of the different types of fractures
There are many kinds of fractures, and various forms, and the causes are distinct;
for there are fractures caused by the blow of a sword, and the neck of the bone cuts the entire bone down to the syfac which is underneath the bone, as an axe does with wood;
and this type of fracture is called a "hatchet fracture".
Or the sword cuts the bone from above without piercing, and this type of fracture is called "complete";
and the wound of these two fractures is large or small.
And if there is a blunt percussion, or a split or a cut from a stone, or from falling on a stone, or other similar things.
And if there is a piercing fracture, which reaches down to the membrane that is under the bone, or it is on the bone, and this wound is either large or small.
And also a wound which is placed in the bone as thin as a hair, and the crack is small, and therefore this fracture is called "hairline";
and if the wound, which is made either by striking with a stone, or by falling, or by a similar thing, causes the piece of bone to go down, and the place is sunken in as do the cauldron makers when they strike the cauldrons;
then the stone enters inside.
And this happens more often to those who have moist bones in their head, like a child's head;
and it happens in all these types of fractures that small pieces are separated like splinters;
and I will speak about it in its place.
And we recognize all kinds of fractures by the depression above them, and probing with a tent, and by the corrupted flesh which is on top.
The hairline fracture is recognized because when the bone is uncovered, and one rubs ink on it, the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of a fracture, pay attention to the patient's symptoms, and if you see any bad symptoms, such as vomiting bile, and loss of consciousness, and stretching, and swelling, and high fever, and the eyes bulging and red, and other similar symptoms with many variations, then it certainly cannot heal.
And if you do not see alarming symptoms, and you hope for recovery, then begin treatment.
And when the wounded person first comes to you, and it is in winter, it is necessary to remove the bone before the fourteenth day as quickly as you can.
And if it is in summer, then hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the tissue under the bone becomes corrupted, and the symptoms we have mentioned appear.
And if the fracture of the bone reaches the membrane that covers the brain, then you must cut the fractured part thus:
And you should take the head of the wounded patient, and uncover the bone in all the ways you can, and over the shape of the wound as gently as you can, and if bleeding occurs when uncovering the bone, or a hot abscess, treat it appropriately, and then fill the area with cloths soaked in rose oil;
And let the wound rest until the hot abscess is calmed, and you are sure of the cessation of bleeding;
Then begin to remove the bone around the edges, and this is done according to two methods of operation:
One method is that you cut with a narrow chisel in front, and this is the shape:
And then use another chisel larger than the first.
And the second method is that you have a number of different chisels, some narrow and others wide, and they should be pointed, and made of Indian steel;
and work lightly, so that you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is strong and hard, then you must pierce around it, before you use chisels with drills, not so deep that they pierce through the bone of the skull, and it should have on the tip a flange or a circle, so as not to let the point pass through the bone;
and you must have several of them, so that each one comes in its place according to the thickness of the bone, so that you have drills for every skull;
and this is the form of the three types of drills:
The method for piercing around the fractured bone is that you place a drill on the bone, and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced;
then put the drill somewhere else a little further on, and so do all around, then cut with chisels the piece of bone which is between the holes, and do this as carefully and lightly as you can, as we have said, until you remove the bone with your hand, or with some of the instruments that you have, such as tongs, forceps;
and be careful not to touch the brain or the dura mater.
And when you have pierced and extracted the bone, you must cut the piece that remains of the bone with another instrument similar to a chisel, but it must be thinner and more delicate than the other chisel;
and if any small bones or splinters remain, remove them gently with one of the instruments;
then treat the wound with dressings and ointments that we have mentioned.
And the other method of operation is the one that Galen described, which is safer;
and he praises it highly, and these are his words.
You must first expose a part of the bone, there where the fracture appears most obvious, so that when you have exposed that part, you will place under the head of this lenticular incisor, of which this is the shape:
And do not cut on one side, and the part is sharp on both sides, so that the cutting edge is towards the bone;
then strike with a small mallet, so that you lightly cut the bone all around, and take good care of the membrane that is underneath;
if it is attached to the bone, remove it lightly, for it can be removed well without harm, and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the membrane, and the bone is only cut on the surface, and there are small pieces, then it is necessary to smooth this roughness, and remove the splinters with a fine scraper of which you should have various sizes, to administer in each place the most suitable one, according to the work and the shape of the fracture.
So start again with large scrapers, and then with finer ones, and do not stop doing this until it is good.
In each of the other hair-line cuts and fine fractures, you must administer treatment according to its correction;
and this is something that is not entrusted to one who has not applied himself to the study of this art.
And if the peritoneum is exposed, you must take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and soak it in rose oil, and place it on the wound;
then take another cloth, folded in two or three, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth;
and do this as gently as you can, so as not to aggravate the peritoneum, then apply another bandage over it, and do not tighten it except enough to hold the wound covering in place; 
and leave it like this for a day or two, until the hot inflammation has subsided, then untie it and apply medications such as lily roots, and vetch flour, and incense powder, and birthwort, and similar things;
and make a powder of these things, and put it on the wound, and constantly apply cleansing medications without causticity;
and make sure the wound is always clean, that you do not leave the ointment there, and do not allow pus to collect, because when pus collects on the wound dressing, it will rot and become infected, and this will cause the patient great harm;
because when you put something caustic on the peritoneum, it blackens on the surface.
Therefore, take heed, if any bad accident happens to the patient, as we have said, it is undoubtedly doubtful.
And if blackness appears only because of the medicine that has been applied, which has such a property, then you must take one part honey, and three parts rose oil and a drop of glue, and put it on the peritoneum;
then treat it with the appropriate treatments, until it is healed.
