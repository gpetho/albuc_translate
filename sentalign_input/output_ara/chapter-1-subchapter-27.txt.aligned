If pain arises from the liver due to coldness and moisture or due to thick wind, so that it deviates excessively from its natural temperament, and the patient is treated with what we mentioned in the division, but it is not effective. The patient should lie on his back, and three cauterizations should be marked with ink in this shape and this exact size on the liver, below the cartilage where the human elbow ends.	When there is pain in the liver from cold and humidity or from thick vapour, so there is a severe disturbance of its natural constitution, and the patient has been treated as prescribed in the appropriate section but with no effect, the patient should lie back, and you should mark with ink the places of three cauterizations, in this form and exactly of this size below the costal cartilages, where the elbow reaches.	0.87095654
And there should be the thickness of a finger between each cautery mark, and the cautery should be lengthwise along the body, straight, and do not press your hand with the cautery iron.	Let there be a finger's breadth between each pair of cauterizations and let the burning be straight along the length of the body. Do not press the cautery hard with your hand.	0.8050477
And the amount you burn of the skin's thickness should be half of it, no more, and the patient should be standing on his feet; if he is not standing, then he should be lying down with his legs extended and his arms raised, and this is the image of the cautery iron.	Let the thickness of the skin you burn be half its thickness, not more; and let the patient be standing on his feet during the cauterization. Alternatively he may be recumbent with legs outstretched and arms raised. Figure of the cautery.	0.7991233
You can cauterize these marks with the scalpel cautery if you have gentleness and skill in the craft, and be careful not to go too deep in the cauterization, burning the entire skin and burning the abdomen and reaching the intestines, for the skin there is thin, so be aware of it.	You will also be able to do these cauterizations with the edged cautery when you have craft and facility in the art. Be careful lest you go too deep with the cautery and burn the whole thickness of the skin and the abdomen and penetrate to the intestine, for the skin there is thin; bear this in mind.	0.83108044
