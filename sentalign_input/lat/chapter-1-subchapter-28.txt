On the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.
Chapter 30.
When an abscess occurs and you wish to know if it is in the liver's flesh or its covering: if it is in the liver's flesh, the patient suffers dull pain and heaviness; if in the liver's covering, there is sharp, intense pain; and you see that its treatment has wearied the physicians.
Thus, the patient should lie on his back.
Then mark the site of the abscess with ink, and heat a cautery shaped like a ray.
And this is its shape.
Cauterize with it once, until the entire skin is burned and reaches the membrane, until all discharge is released; then treat it with the abscess remedy until healed.
And this type of cautery should not be used except by one experienced in the art of medicine and who has often encountered such illnesses; only then should he dare this procedure.
But truly, leaving it alone is, in my view, better.
