Chapter thirty-three on cauterizing diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is from cold and humors, so that it weakens the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and it has been treated with various treatments, but has not healed, and you see the patient tolerating cautery and having sufficient strength, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, as mentioned previously in cauterizing the stomach with the circular cautery iron, and four gentle cauterizations around the navel with the gentle nail-shaped cautery iron, and a large cautery on the coccyx above the buttocks, or two cauteries.
If you see that the humors are abundant and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize him with a cautery on the pubis and a cautery on each flank, and perhaps you may add two small cauterizations on the stomach near the large one, for it is a successful treatment whose benefit will not fail, God willing.
