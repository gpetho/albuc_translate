Chapter fifty-two on the treatment of umbilical hernia.
The protrusion of the navel happens for many reasons: either from a tear in the peritoneum over the abdomen, from which the omentum or the intestine emerges, as happens in all hernias, or from blood that flows from a vein or artery, as mentioned before, or from wind that accumulates in it.
If it is from a tear in the peritoneum and the exit of the omentum, then the color of the swelling is similar to the color of the body, and it is soft, without pain, and appears in different positions. If it is because of the exit of the intestine, then its state is, along with what we have described, more variable, and if you press it with your fingers, it disappears and then comes back, and perhaps it is accompanied by a gurgling, and it increases greatly when entering the bath and with intense fatigue.
If it is from moisture, then it is soft, does not disappear if you press it with your hand, and does not increase or decrease.
If it is from blood, then, along with these signs, the swelling appears dark.
If it is from growing flesh, then the swelling is hard, and remains at one size.
If it is from wind, then its touch is soft.
And the action in this is that you observe. If the protrusion of the navel is from the blood of the artery or the vein or wind, then you should refrain from treating it, as there is fear and danger in that, as I informed you in the chapter in which I mentioned the swellings that occur because of the artery and the vein.
If the protrusion of the navel is because of the intestine or the omentum, then you should order the patient to hold himself and stand upright and stretched out, then mark with ink around the entire navel, then order him to lie down between your hands on his back, then make an incision with a wide scalpel around the navel in the place that you marked with ink, then pull the center of the swelling upwards with a large hook, then tie the place of the incision with a strong thread or silk tendon with a firm tie, and the knot of the tie should be a loop, then open the center of the swelling that is pulled over the tie, and insert your index finger into it and search for the intestine. If you find that the tie has caught it, loosen the loop and push the intestine into the abdomen. If you find omentum, pull it with a hook and cut its excess.
If an artery or vein obstructs you, tie it off quickly and return to your work. Take two needles, insert two strong threads into them, and insert the two needles, hardened, into the incision you made around the swelling, having passed them through.
Then tighten the swelling in four places on the needles. If you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the pulled flesh rots and falls off by itself, or cut it when it becomes thin and rots.
Then treat it with what is necessary of ointments until it heals.
If the protrusion of the navel is from flesh growing in it or from moisture, then it is necessary to scrape out the swelling as we said, and remove the blood or moisture that you find in it, then treat it with what will heal the place.
