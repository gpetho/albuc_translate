And the sign of its onset in children is that they suffer tightness in breathing upon lifting and movement: and you find at the end of the spine and its joints, that one part has already started to protrude above the other vertebrae.	0.80388427
So when you see this and you wish to stop it, cauterize him with a cautery that should be circular so that the cauterization takes in equally all sides of the vertebra.	When you see that, and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery shaped like a circle, in this manner.	0.6708237
If you wish, you can cauterize two or three lines around the vertebra with the punctate cautery; let the punctures be close to one another.	And let the cautery take hold evenly on every part of the vertebra: and if you wish, cauterize around the vertebra with a pointed cautery in two lines, or three, with the points close together.	0.7499924
