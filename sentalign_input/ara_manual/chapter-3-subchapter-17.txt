On fractures of the bones of the foot and toes.
As for the heel, it is not subject to fracture at all. As for the bones of the foot, they may be fractured, and the toes also are rarely fractured, but rather are subject to contusion in most cases.
If a fracture of the bones of the foot occurs and you see that those bones are overlapping, let the patient place his foot on the ground upright as if walking, then you stand and place your foot on the raised part of those bones, then tread on it and straighten it.
Until they return to their places, then apply the dressing and the splint from above, and place a small board under the sole of the foot that has two flat ends, then tighten the foot tightly after wrapping it with bandages and everything else you need.
When three or four days have passed, loosen the bandage, and you will find the bones straightened whether they were fractured or dislocated, so the procedure is as you see.  As for if some of the toes are fractured, set them and straighten them according to what I described to you regarding setting the fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the broken toe the length of the toe and slightly wider than it, then place this board I described to you under the foot and tighten it firmly. If two, three, or more bones are broken,
then put a splint on each toe according to its size, wrapped in a soft cloth, and tighten the board on the bottom of the foot, and let each end of the board rest outside the sole of the foot to secure it well.
And you should not forget to attend to all that we have mentioned to you regarding all the other fractures, of the symptoms that we have mentioned, and address each symptom as appropriate.
