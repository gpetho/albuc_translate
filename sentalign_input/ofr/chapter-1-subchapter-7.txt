When apoplexy is chronic and you treat it as we have said, and it is not effective, and the patient does not have a fever, then make four cauteries: two on the two corners/temples of the head, and one in the middle of the head, and one in the place that is called "vessels" as we have said before, and the last cautery on the pit of the stomach; and it should be treated as we have said before.
