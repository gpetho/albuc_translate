On Cauterizing Gout and Pains of the Joints.	On cauterization of gout and pain in the joints.	0.89068234
If the pains of the joints are from cold humors that flow to any part of the body, and if the pains occur in the legs, then it is the physicians' custom to call that specifically gout.	When there are pains in the joints from cold humidities flowing into whatever part of the body it may be, and specially when there are pains in the feet, doctors are in the habit of calling that 'gout'.	0.86075705
If cold gout is treated with the types of treatment we mentioned in the division and the pains do not go away, then cautery will remove them, and that is that you cauterize after emptying around the joint of the legs with many cauterizations, and the cautery iron should be olive-shaped and medium-sized, in this manner.	When gout due to chill has been treated with the various treatments mentioned in its section, and the pains remain, the cautery will remove them. That is, you cauterize the patient with multiple burns around the joint of the foot, after he has been purged. The cautery should be a middle-sized olivary one, thus.	0.8084744
And if you need to cauterize the surface of the leg, do it with the point cautery. If the pains ascend to the knees or to the other joints, and this happens often, cauterize each knee three or four times on each side with this same olive-shaped cautery iron.	If you need to make punctate cauterizations round the front of the foot, use the punctate cautery; and if the pains go up to the knee or other joints, which often happens, burn each knee with three or four cauterizations on every side with the same olivary cautery.	0.8942734
If you need more than this cauterization, cauterize, but do not deepen your hand with the cautery, rather it should be about the thickness of the skin only. If the pains ascend to the hips or to the back, use what we mentioned about cautery in its chapter.	And if you require to cauterize him more than this, do it, but do not go deeply but only about the thickness of the skin. If the pains go up to the hip joints or the back, employ those cauterizations that we have mentioned in their own chapter.	0.858926
If the pains are only in the hands, cauterize around the two forearms as you rotate in two rows. If the pains remain in the fingers, cauterize them at each knuckle and on the back of the hand.  If the pains ascend after some days to the elbows or to the shoulders,	And if the pains are in the hands only, pierce a double line all around the wrists. If the pains remain in the fingers, pierce them once over each joint and once on the metacarpus. And if after some days the pains go up to the elbows or shoulders then cauterize both on each side.	0.88278264
cauterize them on each side. The patient should not neglect good regimen and taking medications, for if he improves his diet and expels the phlegm, he will recover with this cauterization, God willing.	And keep the patient to good habits and taking of medicine; for if his regimen be good and the phlegm got rid of, he will be cured with this cautery.	0.7412208
