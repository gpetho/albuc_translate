This condition often affects the lower parts of the feet and consists of thick, hardened growths that harm the foot.	This disease, which is something hard paining the foot, very often occurs in the soles of the feet.	0.6332027
There are two methods for treating them: cauterization with fire or with hot water.	The cauterization in this case is twofold, actual or caustic.	0.4895646
For fire cauterization, use a hollow cautery resembling a vulture's feather, made of iron, and sized to fit around the corn on all sides, with fine edges.	The actual cautery is to heat a hollow cautery like a vulture's quill, made of iron, narrow of edge, of such a size as to surround the corn all round.	0.70038533
Then place the heated cautery over the corn. Rotate the cautery around the corn, allowing it to penetrate deeply; leave it for three days until it begins to discharge pus. Then apply a poultice of wild mallow crushed with salt and leave it on overnight. This will cause it to be uprooted from its roots.	Then put it, hot, on the corn and rotate it till the cautery reaches the root of the corn; and let be for three days to draw the pus; then apply a plaster of wild mallows ground up with salt, and leave the plaster on one night; then it may be drawn out with its root.	0.8921491
Afterward, treat the area with an ointment that encourages flesh growth until it heals.	Then treat the site of the wound with stimulating salve till it heals.	0.8049335
If the corns or warts are not recessed and occur on the body’s surface, particularly on the hands and feet, then apply cauterization with hot water. Use a metal tube made of bronze, iron, or a vulture’s feather, and place it over the corn or wart. Pour a small amount of hot water into the tube, press it down and turn it slightly so that the tube’s edge presses into the root of the corn, allowing the hot water to reach the corn’s depth. Let the patient bear the hot water’s sensation for about an hour.	If the corns are not inverted, which usually happens on the surface of the body and particularly on the hands and feet, you should take a cannula made of bronze or iron or made of a vulture's quill, and place it on the corn or wart; then pour into the cannula a small quantity of caustic solution; keep your hand on it and rotate it, keeping up a slight pressure so that the edge of the cannula impresses a mark at the root of the corn and the caustic makes its way to the root of the corn.	0.85065854
Afterward, release it, as the corn will be uprooted from its roots.	Let the patient endure the action of the caustic for a while, then remove it; for the corn may be drawn out with its root.	0.47462747
Proceed in this way, one by one, until you treat all the corns on the body.	Treat them in this manner one after another till you have accounted for all of them.	0.70100176
Then, once removed, treat the areas with an ointment that promotes flesh growth.	Then treat the site of them, after eradication, with stimulating ointments.	0.7287779
