of abscesses of the throat
Sometimes lumps come inside the throat, which are called "godath," and they are properly called the two tonsils, and when you treat them, as we have said in the section, and they are not healed, then take note: if it is a hard abscess with little feeling and dark color, do not touch it with iron (a surgical instrument).
And if it is red and the root is large, do not touch it with iron, also because of the bleeding; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will open it, or it will rupture by itself; and if it is a round white color, and the root is thin, have the instrument prepared for cutting, but first see if the hot abscess rests and is calmed.
Then have the patient sit facing the sun, with his head in your lap, and open his mouth and have the assistant hold it between his hands, and press the tongue down with the instrument, of which here is the form; and let it be of silver or fine brass like a knife:
When you press down the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, take the hook and insert it into the tonsil, and pull it out as much as you can; and pull some of the tissues with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which here is the form, which resembles scissors; however, the tips are curved, and one towards the other, and are very sharp, and it is made of Indian steel or fine steel:
And if you do not have this instrument at hand, then cut it with pliers, of which here is the form:
And let it be sharp on one side, and not on the other; and when you have cut one of the tonsils, cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision, the patient should gargle with warm water, and water and vinegar, and if bleeding occurs, have the patient gargle with water in which pomegranate peels have been boiled, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the bleeding is stopped; then treat it until it is healed; and sometimes other abscesses grow in the throat besides the two tonsils, so cut them in the same way as the two tonsils.
And I treated a woman with an abscess that had grown inside her throat, that is to say, an abscess with little feeling; and it had almost completely closed off her throat, so that the woman could not breathe because the passage was blocked, and she could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she had remained like that for a day or two.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had pushed out two lines through the two nostrils.
I hurried then at once, and inserted a hook into one, then pulled it out, and drew out a large amount of pus; then I did the same in the other nostril, and opened her mouth and pressed down her tongue; afterwards I inserted the hook into the abscess, and cut a part of it, and only a little blood came out; and thus the woman's throat passage was opened, and she immediately began to drink water and then wine, and I did not stop cutting at this abscess for a long time; and the abscess kept growing back, and filling the place that I had emptied, until it was very large again; then I devised a plan and cauterized it inside the throat: thus it stopped growing; and I left those parts, and I do not know what God did with her after me.
