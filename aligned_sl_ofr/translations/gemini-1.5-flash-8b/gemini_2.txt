O you, very dear son, I have completed this book, which is the last of the science of medicine, along with its completion, and have made the end through its expositions and its declarations. And it came to me in a vision that I would complete it with this treatise, which is part of the work of hands, that is to say "surgery".
And because the work of hands is very strong in our region and is entirely and utterly strange, the science is lost and cut off, and nothing remains of it except the small descriptions in books of the ancients that the hands have changed. And from this has come the error and the vanity, and the intentions are closed and the science is distant.
Or it seems to me that I want to revive it along with the ordering of this treatise according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and will bring together the forms of cautery irons, and the other instruments of the work with the addition of the declaration and preparation of them, as is necessary.
And because no good masters of hands are found in our time, the art of medicine is distant. And he who undertakes this must excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so that he knows the arrangement of the members, and their forms and connections and separations, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and veins and their number, and the movement and of the moving and resting veins, and the location of their exit.
And because of this, Hippocrates said that the name with the name is much, and with the work is little; and especially in the art of hands.
We tell you in the introduction of this book that whoever is not knowledgeable about the things previously mentioned, should be careful not to fall into error and kill men;
so that I have seen many of those who undertake this science and abandon themselves without science and without experience.
For I saw a foolish man who opened an abscess of scrofulous swellings in a woman's neck, and cut the arteries of the neck; so that so much blood flowed out that the woman fell dead in his hands.
And saw another man who pulled a stone from an elderly man, and the stone was large; so he carried away with it a piece of the bladder, and the man died within three days.
And I had already been called to remove it, and saw the condition of the patient and the size of the stone, and knew well that if it was cut, he would die.
And I saw another man who took on the case of a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the break there was a wound;
and the ignorant physician bound the break over the wound with tight bandages, and did not leave the wound any slack, and left it like that for a while;
and he commanded him not to loosen it at all;
and it remained like that until the leg, the foot, and the whole area swelled up and came to ruin.
I was called to go to him, and I hurried to come and untie the leg; and when I had loosened it, he was at peace and felt no pain.
But nonetheless, the corruption had already taken hold in the limb, and I could not heal it;
and the corruption continued to spread through the limb until the entire limb was lost.
And I saw another sore that burst an infected abscess, and then inflamed through the malice of its lord.
For a sore, when it is cleansed of melancholic humor, it is not right to touch it with iron unless it is in such a place that one can remove all that is corrupted.
And therefore, my dear son, you must know that the work of hands is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work where there is danger in many dispositions;
and I will show in each place of this book where there is fear and danger.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to be careful, so that foolish people cannot speak ill of you.
So take your weapons in counsel, and undertake your patients gently and firmly, and use the best way so that by the grace of God you come to salvation and be praised;
and leave the terrible illnesses of grievous sickness;
and remove your weapons from that which makes you doubt, and have faith in yourselves so that you may come from this world to the other with glory.
Galen said in some of his admonitions: Do not undertake a serious illness unless you are called a foolish physician.
I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
The first chapter is on cauteries with fire and cauteries with sharp medicine, and the chapter is ordered from the head down to the feet;
and of the forms of instruments, and of the iron tools for cautery, and of everything that is necessary for the work.
The second chapter is about cutting and piercing, and cupping and wounds, and the extraction of arrows, and similar things;
and the chapter is ordered and the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter is on restoring dislocations and sprains, and similar things;
and it is ordered from the head down to the feet, and the forms of the instruments.
Before we remember the work, I must explain the nature of the help and harm of each constitution.
I say that the nature of the help, and of the harm, is the longest discourse and the most subtle science and the secret answer;
and many wise men spoke of this, and agreed upon this;
and their words are enough for me, for I fear length.
I say that cautery helps universally in all constitutions where there is matter, except for two constitutions: that is to say, a hot constitution without matter, and a dry constitution without matter.
In a hot and dry constitution together with matter, some disagreed and said that cautery is a great help; and the others said the opposite: that cautery is not useful for an illness that comes from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is hot, and it should not be used to treat a hot illness with heat, nor with dryness;
and the one who said the opposite said that cautery is of great help in hot and dry illnesses that occur in the bodies of men. For when you compare the body of man and its moisture to the complexion of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it true on several occasions through experience.
And nevertheless, do not intervene unless the one who has experienced it, and who knows through long use the chapter of cauteries, and the diversity of human complexions, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the space of time;
Of other complexions we have no fear, especially in cold and moist illnesses. And all the doctors assembled and agreed on cautery.
And know, son, that cautery with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater goodness than cautery with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and does not affect anything other than the limb that is inflamed, and does little harm to another limb.
Burning medicines spread from one limb to another, and cause serious illnesses in the limb. and perhaps kill the patient.
Fire, because of its intensity and the goodness of its substance, does not cause harm, unless there is excess.
And this I have found through experiment and through the length of service and study I have put into the art, and it was based on the truth of things;
and for this I excuse the length of speech, for I do not wish to deprive you of the secret contained in fire, and the nature of its action, how it expels illnesses from the body, as the philosopher demonstrates; or receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on the time cauteries should be performed, and chose spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the ensuing harm is subdued by the help of cautery; and especially if cauteries are necessary for pains, quick and urgent, that cannot wait for the time when greater harm might come to the limb.
And do not think about it at all, dear son, as fools do; for the illness healed by cautery has no return; and they say it thus;
and they say it thus; but it is not so as they believe, because cauteries are only a medicine that changes the complexion, and dries the humors that cause the pain, and are more valuable than medicine due to the haste of its value, and for the virtue of its work and its mastery.
And it is possible that the illness comes sometimes according to the complexion of the sick person and the location of the illness and its virtue;
and if superfluities assemble within him through the acquisition of foods and similar things, unless cauteries are administered in a place where there is little superfluity and moisture, like cauteries for toothache, and similar things, such pain does not return; But this happens little.
And many people do not understand why cauteries are called the last resort of medicine, and that is true;
but they do not believe that cauteries are worthwhile after other medicine, but their understanding is false, and cauteries are the last resort of medicine because when we administer other kinds of treatments for any illness, and they are not effective, then we administer the cautery, and it is effective.
Then it is clear that cauteries are the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of foolish people.
The ancients said that cauteries with a gold instrument are better than those of iron, and they said this only because of the quality of gold and the high nature of its substance;
and they said that the place where cauteries are applied does not cause rot, but this is not true, for I have experienced it, and have found that it is true in some men;
And cauteries of gold are better than those of iron, as they said. And yet, when you heat a gold instrument, you do not know when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it cools quickly;
and if one heats it too much; so do they to the fire; and thus there is sufficient impediment.
Or I have arranged this chapter from the head down to the feet, so that the way may be easier to find.
These cauteries are effective against moisture and cold on the brain, and there are two that are done because of a disease called "soda", and because of many humors that descend from the head to the eyes, and to the ears, and for the multitude of dreams and toothache and sore throat, and especially for all diseases that come from cold such as paralysis, soda, apoplexy, and similar diseases.
The form of this cautery is that the patient should be purged by a solvent medicine, purifying the head for three or four nights, according to what the strength and age and custom of the patient can endure; and then raise the head of the sick person.
And then have him sit cross-legged between your hands, and place his hands on his lap;
Afterwards, place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his two eyes; and leave where your middle fingers will come, then heat the cautery which is called "olivare", of which here is the form: And place it on the marked spot, and by moving your hand down and squeezing it little by little, turn it; then lift your hand quickly, and look at the spot if you see the bone slightly sticking out; and if you do not see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you;
after take a little salt, and put in water and soften cotton inside, and place it on the spot, and leave it for 3 days;
after put wet cotton in butter; and leave it on until the inflammation is gone; after treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrafarmaçon", until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer a wound remains open, the more it purges itself; and therefore, it helps.
And some of these said that one should leave the cautery on until part of the bone is burned, then remove what is burned from the bone, and then be cured.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on for so long, and push so hard, that one removes from the bone as much as a weaver's shuttle, that women use in their spindles, so that the humors might flow out.
And the wound should be left open for a long time; After that, one should heal and close it.
And these two methods of cauteries do not seem to me to be good at all, except in some people where there is a fear of pain.
And to me it seems that I should leave it.
For the shoulder is weakened by the continuous dissipation of its natural strength, as we testify in other limbs;
And even when the patient's shoulder is weak by nature, the first appearance of cautery is safer and milder for me, and with this I use work in combination for a better outcome.
When chronic pain afflicts the entire head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use herbs and pills called "cochie," and remedies for cleansing the head, oils, and plasters; and if one applies the cautery that we have previously described, and it does not work. Be warned if the patient's shoulder is of strong nature, and if it is not too cold; then cauterize below that cautery a little, as we have said above. Afterwards, apply cautery on each horn of the head down to the bone, as we said before, and apply cautery to the area called "vessels"; and that is the place where cupping is applied; and place your hand so that you do not see down to the bone: the patient feels much greater pain in this cautery than in others, and I will speak of that elsewhere;
and the cauteries of the horns should be finer than those used to cauterize the middle of the head, and this is the form:
of cauterization of the head When sudden pain occurs in a part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head is purged by cleansing medicines, and the other cures I have described in the division of illnesses have been performed, and none of this helps: then perform cauteries in two ways, that is to say, with sharp medicine and with fire.
The cautery with sharp medicine is that you take a slice of garlic, remove the skin and cut it into two pieces, and then pierce the temple where the pain is in such a way that you can place the garlic slice under the skin;
and when it is placed, bind and compress it well and leave it like this for twelve hours; and then unbind it and remove the garlic slice, and leave the wound like this for two or three days; then place a piece of linen dipped in butter on it until the pus comes out.
After that, treat with ointment until it is healed;
and if you want, use some of the burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth chapter on burning medicines.
The cautery of iron is like this. Heat the cautery, of which this is the form:
And it is called "closed" because the head is shaped like a closed container, or a small curve, and in the middle, a small appearance;
and place it on the painful area, and hold your hand, and turn the iron slightly, until half the thickness of the core is burned;
and lift your hand so the artery, which is outside, does not burn, and copious blood flows out.
Afterwards, put cotton in salted water, and place it on the area for three days; then put damp cotton in butter, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish to cauterize this migraine with the cautery called "cultellare," to the very tip, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine which is not ancient.
of migraine
When you treat a migraine, as we have previously said in the divisions of diseases, and it does not help, and you see that the cauteries previously mentioned, of medicine and iron, do not suffice, then you must heat the cautery called "cultellare" until it is white;
and thusly apply it to the aching spot in a line half a finger long, and remove your hand once, and make sure you do not cut the artery and do not reach the bone;
and be wary of the jaw which moves when one chews, and that the nerve only has to do with that movement and that spasms do not come to the patient, and be wary of an overflow of blood from the artery when it is cut, or a cut causes great fear, especially to one who does not know it, and who is not a student or experienced; and leave the work halfway;
but I will tell you how one stops blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it belongs in this book.
And if you see that these cauteries are not enough for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize it in the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed;
and if you wish, administer the cautery that we have discussed in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two blades; and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
of the pain in the ears from cold.
When pain in the ear comes from cold, and dissolving medicines and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division have been applied, and the pain does not change, then heat this cautery which is called "poins," of which this is the shape:
Then prick all around the diseased ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and move a little above the root of the ear after you have marked the spot to prick. and make ten pricks around each ear;
then treat the spot until it is healed.
of the torture of the mouth
Torture which must be treated by cautery is no worse than those caused by phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases;
and do not apply cautery to those that come from dryness and spasm of the nerves.
When you treat this type of torture caused by phlegm, from the eyes and purges of the head and gargles, and this is not enough, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and another a little outside the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips;
and place the cautery on the healthy-appearing part, and apply it to the head of the ear a little below the corner of the head, and another to the temple as long as a finger; and leave the cautery there until half the heart is burned;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And it resembles the scalpel we have described before, but it is a little more subtle, and the knife should be a little thicker;
after treating the area as I have said before, until it is healthy.
When apoplexy is old and you treat it as we have said, and it does not help, and the patient does not have a fever, then apply four cauteries: two on the two horns of the head, and one in the middle of the head, and one in the place called "vessel" as we have said before, and the last cautery on the mouth of the stomach;
and be treated as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness, give the patient large herbs and pills that purify the brain;
Afterwards, raise the patient's head entirely, and place the mustard plaster, as described in the treatise on plasters, on the patient's occiput;
and this is the manner of cautery: if you do it as I have said.
If he is thus healed, it is good; and if he is not, apply three cauteries from within the head, descending down to the neck, and have a space of one finger's breadth between each cautery;
and treat it as the others, and if you wish to add more, and the patient can bear it, then apply one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two others upon the two horns, and treat it until he is healed;
and let the cauteries be what are called "olivare," as I have said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of scabs and of what we have said before;
Afterward, clean the patient's head, then cauterize in the middle of the head and on each horn, and one behind and three upon the spine of the neck;
and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is suffering, and the illness is severe, then cauterize four times on the spine of the back; and leave it until the greater part of the heart is burned, and remove your hand; afterward treat it until it is healed, and the cauteries which are called "olivare" which we have previously mentioned.
of the epilepsy
Epileptics should not use fire cauteries unless they are phlegmatic, and it is necessary first to purify the brain with years and other treatments that we have mentioned in the section when the patient is large and suffering from taking medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot endure it, then have them gargle and chew, purifying the brain often with good foods;
Afterward, apply a cautery to the head in the middle, and apply cauteries to the vessel, and to each horn; And if the patient is strong and enduring, apply cauteries as I have said to those with paralysis and body softening, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped, according to the manner I have described.
If the patient is a child, apply subtle cauteries according to this manner:
When, due to melancholy, superfluities or corrupted moisture and thick phlegm are present, then cauterize it with such cauteries as we have described for those with paralysis.
And if, due to melancholy, the superfluities are inclined towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him to drink something by which the brain is cleansed, according to what has been described before in the division.
After, cleanse the patient's head; after make a well-made linen bandage, like a circle, and place it on the head;
and the patient sits cross-legged, and be held firmly on all sides;
then apply the liniment, and use the old beeswax butter; and heat it gently over a fire, so that the patient can tolerate the heat; then empty the circle inside the head, and let it cool;
and do this to the patient each week once with other good treatment, until they are healthy.
Or if you wish to cauterize it, make several small punctures with the cautery.
This type of cautery softens the brain equally;
and then place moistened cotton in butter and goose fat.
of the eye's water When water comes first to the eyes, according to the signs I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something that purifies the head, and keep it from all moisture, and make him sweat several times in a bath, fasting.
Afterwards, he commands him to raise his head, and cauterizes him in the middle of the head, and gives him two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of water is in both eyes, or in one if the descent is in one.
and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the heart, and let the cautery be long according to the width of the temple;
and be wary of the flow of blood, and if you see too much blood coming out, then staunch it with such power as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision the precaution of how you will staunch it;
And sometimes one cauterizes or uses a cautery under the two bones behind.
and if one sees that it is from cold phlegmatic superfluities, then do the cautery that I have said at the beginning of the water descending to the eyes: One cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries or cauterizations under the two bones; and if there is further need, then cauterize wisely above the eyebrow with a single small cautery.
When you treat it according to what we have said in the division, and it does not help at all, then give the patient three nights' worth of cochies to drink; after having cleansed the head, and having cauterized in the middle of the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries with the cautery called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair;
and beware of the artery, that you do not cut it.
And this is the form of the cautery which is called "clavilis":
When the membrane of the eye is softened by disease and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery which is called "olivare". of which this is the form:
And if you wish, make two cauteries above the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not leave the hand there except until the third part of the membrane is burned, according to the manner that I have said.
from hair that pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyes are turned inward, and prick the eye, and there are cauteries made according to two manners: that is to say, of fire, or of burning medicine.
For cautery with fire, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they grow and are even, then place the patient in your care. Afterwards, draw a figure on the skin of the eyes, shaped like a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the sign be next to the hairs;
then place moistened cotton in egg white and persillage juice over the eye, then heat the cautery, of which this is the shape:
Afterwards, cauterize on the figure you have marked little by little many times, so that the heart is burned in that place;
and the signs of the success of the work are that you see the skin retracted, and the hairs raised at the puncture of the eye;
Then remove your hand, and leave it like this for three days, then put cotton moistened in butter until the burning is gone; afterward, treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if after this the hairs grow back and the skin is softened, then recommence the cautery on that same spot, as you did first;
and if the hairs are gone, cauterize it until the skin is raised to its natural position, and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
The burning cautery of medicine is that you instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even, then make a shape of myrtle leaf from parchment;
then take French soap and live charcoal, of each one a third, and grind well together; and do it quickly, so that it does not cool, then spread it over the shape you have made, like the myrtle leaf, and put it over the skin of the eyes; and if the patient holds it in one eye only, one should work on one, and if in both, also. and put under the eye cotton soaked in egg white;
and the patient's head be in your good health and place your index finger on the medicine, and press it slightly and move it every time the patient feels the medicine's biting, for it bites like fire.
When you have done this a long time, remove the medicine from your finger. And when the biting has passed, lift the area with water, and observe if you see the paper raised as if it had been raised by the constraint of fire or by an incision; and if it is so, then it is well.
If not, then apply more medicine to the area where the medicine has not worked, until your work is equal, and your eyes are focused;
then place moistened cotton in butter until the burning heart is gone, then treat the area with the ointment called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healthy.
And if you need to be careful in your work, be very careful that no medicine gets in your eyes.
And if the paper becomes soft afterward, and the hairs prick the eye, then reapply the medicine to the area where the paper softened properly, just as you did before; after treating it until it is healthy;
and this is the shape of the myrtle leaf:
And know that human eyes vary in size, and according to this, adjust your constraints;
and the correct path should not be hidden from the one studying this art.
of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula as we have described in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatments do not work, then you must apply cautery to it in this manner.
Instruct the patient to place their head in your lap. and let the assistants hold the patient's head between their hands in such a way that it does not move or shift.
after that, place moistened cotton in an egg's white or in persill juice over the eye;
then heat the cautery, which is such:
and is shaped at the head like the shape of a vault's feather, together with which the cautery should be;
if you wish, it should be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, it should also be like a tent;
but nevertheless, this one that is shaped is better suited for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the corruption, and dry it; and if it is closed, then open it, and draw out the pus;
Then apply the hot cautery strongly, and hold your hand on the cautery part near the nose above the eye, so your hand does not make a mistake; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If you go from the beginning of the cautery down to the bone, that would be good. If not, then repeat the cautery once more, and again if you need it, and leave it for three days;
After that, place moistened cotton in butter on it, and treat it with desiccation ointment until it is healed, and if 40 days pass and it is not healed, then apply an acute corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed; and the rest according to what he would put in his chapter.
And there is a manner of cautery of fistula that none of the ancients said. Understand a fistula, and make the place; After that, put into the fissure a subtle camahan of which this is the form: and there are made in the quantity of a .3. of lead; and hold your hand on the camahan firmly, and let the patient not move at all, lest the melted lead run into his eye;
and it is necessary that one put over the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white or in water:
The lead will cauterize the fistula spot, and heal it with marvelous health.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery we have described, it is good. If not, it is necessary to administer a poultice to the nose, and return the fistula to the body of the nose according to what is appropriate in its proper place.
openings/cracks in the lips Often cracks appear in the lips, called "poil", especially in the lips of children.
When you treat these cracks with what we have said in the divisions, and the treatment does not work, then heat a small, knife-like cautery according to this form:
And place it quickly in those cracks until it reaches the bottom;
afterwards, treat the area with a plaster until it is healed.
When an abscess comes to the root of the throat or the uvula, or the palate, or the roots of the teeth, afterwards it causes decay and rot and becomes aged and turns into a fistula; and you treat it as we have said in the divisions, and it does not help at all: then it is necessary for you to have a cautery according to the size of the fistula; after the opening or hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and the innermost place;
and do this once or twice, after the treatment that we have mentioned in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is healed like this, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to uncover the place and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicine, and that is not effective, then place the patient's head on your lap; afterward, heat the cautery, whose form will come after in this manner: place a rod on the tooth;
and quickly place the hot cautery on it, and hold your hand there until the patient feels the heat reaching the root of the tooth;
afterward, remove your hand and reapply the cautery according to your will;
afterward, let the patient fill their mouth with salty water, and let it stay for an hour and rinse it out.
And in this manner, the tooth that was moving is now fixed, and the soft gums are restrained, and the corrupted moisture is dried.
of the pain of the teeth
When toothache comes from cold, or where there is cold or true cold, and the cures of medicine are of no use, then there is need for cautery in two ways: and cautery with butter and cautery with fire.
Cautery with butter is such that you take cow's butter, and its tip in an iron or bronze spoon; afterwards take cotton and wrap it around the point of a tent, and moisten it in boiling butter, and put it on the aching tooth quickly and hold it until it is cooled;
and thus do often until its virtue reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, moisten wool and cotton in cold butter, and put it on the aching tooth, and put hot iron so that the fire reaches the end of the tooth.
The cauteries together with fire are such that you take an iron or bronze rod, and it is thick so that the fire does not reach the patient's mouth;
afterwards heat the cautery, with which the shape will come afterwards, and put it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery is cooled;
Do this often, for the pain will be removed either that same day or the next.
And it is necessary that the patient fill his mouth with good butter in the application of this cautery, and then remove it quickly.
and this is the form of the cautery:
And make cautery from whatever head you want, and according to what you are able;
and this is the form of the cautery:
of the scrofulas When the scrofulas are of phlegm and cold moisture, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, then heat the cautery, the head of which follows, and have two openings for the fumes to escape from the other side of the cautery;
and place the hot cautery upon the abscess once, or if it is necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, place the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it thus for three days; and place moistened cotton in butter until the burning is gone;
afterwards treat the area with ointments and dressings until it is healed.
When moisture overcomes the channels of the lung, and especially when it comes from a cold temperament, then it is necessary that the patient be first purged by dissolving medicines;
afterward apply cautery to the root of the throat, and be careful not to go all the way to the throat, and not to burn the heart by more than a little.
After that, apply another cautery to the joint of the neck to the top of the spine, and let the cautery, which is called "clavile," be of the form we have before;
and treat the place as we have previously said until it is healed.
When coughs and lung illnesses are from cold moisture, and the patient has neither fever nor dryness, and the illness is longstanding, apply two cauteries on the ribs in empty spaces; and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts;
and let the cauteries, which are called "clavile," be according to the form that has been previously described.
And if you wish, apply a cautery by pricking at the entire cautery that is called "poins," of which the form is previously described in the illness of the ears;
and let the pricks be up to 30, or thereabouts.
After curing the area according to what has been previously stated, and let the cauteries be three lines according to this form:
And for this, the cauteries are lighter, for you make three at a stroke.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset, but it cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement that occurs, as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterwards, let the patient be supported on their back and on their side; Afterwards, lift the heart that is inside the tittle (or small pouch) to the fingers of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated inside, then heat the cautery that has two nerves, of which this is the shape:
and cauterize the heart until it pierces the side, and the shape of the cautery would be combined with four cauteries;
and for that, a cautery with three nerves is made, so that the shape of the cauterization is six cauteries;
and the nerves are according to the fineness of a tent, and this is the shape of the cautery with three nerves:
And sometimes one nerve is added to this, so that there are eight cauteries.
After, place the cautery on the crushed material with a cloth; after make the patient rest, and let the limb not be moved for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated above, which thing happens little, then make cautery on the thick part of the cautery clavicle, or many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed, and the patient is healthy.
When cold and much moisture come into the stomach, such that it is contrary to its constitution, and the catarrh is multiplied within it, and in the accustomed methods of treatment, and it does not benefit at all, then the patient must be placed on their back, and extend their legs and arms. From this, afterwards, apply three cauteries; one beneath the breastbone, by the amount of a finger; one on the entire clavicle cautery; and two cauteries outside the two sides, so that the figure of the cauteries is in three angles, and have such space between one and the other that they are not joined together when they release pus.
And let the cauteries be so deep that they touch the two parts of the heart, and let the figure of the cauteries be according to this shape without joining:
And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape;
And whoever is afraid of this cautery, cauterize by pricking and making a mark on the stomach at a point according to the quantity you wish. Then cauterize with the entire cautery that is called "points".
After the treatment of the treatment that we have had before, until it is healed.
When the liver suffers pain from cold and moisture and great windiness, so that it is wrongly disposed from its natural complexion due to superfluities; And if the patient is treated according to what we have said about divisions, and it does not benefit him, then the patient should be examined regarding his condition; and apply three cauteries according to this form and this figure and this quantity upon the liver, to ward off the hypochondria, where the pain of the man comes.
and have a space of the thickness of a finger between each cautery. and let the cauteries be long, and do not press your hand too hard on the entire cautery;
and let only half the heart be burned, and let the patient stand upright.
and if he cannot, let him lie down, and stretch his legs out, and raise his arms.
And if you wish, cauterize these cauteries with a knife, if you are skilled and wise in the art, and beware that you do not burn the entire heart, for you would dry up the entire body; and that it does not reach the boil, for the heart is very delicate in that place, and you know it for certain.
When there is an abscess in the liver, and you wish to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient feels pain not too strongly;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels violent pain.
And when this treatment ceases to work, then it is necessary that the patient be supported on his head;
and then drain the area where the abscess is, and then heat the cauterizing iron, which is similar to a ray, of which this is the form: And cauterize with the cauterizing iron until the flesh is burned, and it reaches the surface, until the wound is completely healed;
after the treatment according to the treatment of dressings until it is healed;
and it is not appropriate for anyone to use this cautery except those who have studied medicine for a long time, and whose hands these illnesses have run through on several occasions.
Then he can work boldly, and nevertheless it seems to me that it is better to leave it alone.
from cautery of burning.
The ancients said that one should make burning cauteries with roots of aristolochia, and in this manner: Take a long aristolochia root, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and also as thick and as long as your fingers; and soak it in oil, and hold it over the fire, and cauterize with the cautery between the jawbone and the throat, and two small cauteries a little further down on the area below the chin;
and two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping slightly backward; and one cautery in the middle of the breast, and one more above the stomach, and one between the two shoulders, and two on the two sides of the breast outside the cautery that is between the two shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but do it openly, as if smelling.
And some ancient ones said that some men used a cautery resembling a razor, and heated it and put it between the ribs until it reached the abscess; and the pain went away, just as we have said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this work there is fear, where the patient now dies, or a fistula comes that cannot be healed.
of the mouse
When you treat the disease of the mouse, following what we have said about the divisions of treatments, and it does not help at all, then there are three types of cautery, all of which are good.
Of which one manner is that you make three or four cauteries, along the length of the mouse, according to the figure of the liver cautery that we have said before;
and do not press your hand too hard on all of the cautery, and let the patient often lie on his back;
and another manner of cautery is that you heat the cautery that has two nerves, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and lift the heart which is in the area of the mouse, or if the patient's pain comes from the left, and let the elevations that you lift the heart according to the heart, according to the length of the body, and the cauteries be according to the width of the body.
After that, apply the two inflamed nerves until the heart is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and so there will be four of them.
And if you wish, cauterize with the entire cautery with three nerves.
After the cure, when it has cast off corruption for a long time, and this is worth more than the other cures mentioned before.
Cautery is of no use for dropsy, except in the manner called "asclytes".
When you cure it according to the methods we have described in divisions, and your treatment is of no benefit, then you must make four cauteries around the belly, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, two behind the back on the spine, and one on the breast. And let the cauteries be close to the thick part of the heart.
Afterwards, leave the cautery open for a long time to allow pus to drain, and do not abandon the patient's treatment after the cautery. And healing would be hastened, and both intentions would be combined with God's help.
The form of the cautery for the belly should be the shape that we have shown before. And the one for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what is set forth above.
When the feet are swollen in one who is hydrops and are full of yellow water, you must cauterize on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger. And raise your hand with the cautery without turning.
And do not enter too deeply, for the yellow water would burst out, and let the cautery be according to this form.
After that, make two cauteries on each leg at the tip of the kneecap; and let the cauteries be long, one below the knee in front and the other outside, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open for a long time without curing, so that the water may come out;
after the cure of the other cures that we have mentioned.
When abdominal distress comes from cold and moisture, so that the retentive and digestive virtues in the stomach and intestines are weakened, and cannot be cured by various treatments; and you see the patient suffering greatly and with a strong constitution, then apply a large cautery to the stomach according to what has been discussed previously, or a circular cautery to the stomach; and four subtle cauteries around the abdomen, one subtle cautery on each hip.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient suffering, then apply a cautery to the groin, and one cautery to each side, and two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach, for the cure is beneficial when there is good assistance.
Of the cure of hemorrhoids
When hemorrhoids are in the fundament, one or more, and are old and are of thick, cold, moist, corrupted humors, and have been treated as we have said in the divisions, and it does not help, then apply cauteries: Three on the spine of the back, which is entirely outside the navel, little by little in a triangular shape, and one cautery below the abdomen, two inches.
And if you think his stomach is chilled, and the food does not cook, and you see the face swelling, then place one large cautery on the stomach, as previously mentioned, and another on the liver, and another on the spleen, all cauteries placed in a row. And leave the cautery open for a long time. After treatment, leave the area until it is healed.
When you cut the thelul, heat the cautery that resembles a razor, and then put it, all ablaze, on the cut thelul. and let it stay there until the cautery reaches the beginning of the vein, from which the blood flows.
Do this once or twice, and if there is a lot of thelul, cauterize each one as we have said. after applying healing ointments until they are healed.
and if you cauterize with a large cautery on the alchatim, it will provide greater aid.
When the patient cannot tolerate cutting or opening, which we will describe in its place, such an illness comes that cannot be healed except by cautery.
When a fistula forms, and is old and discharges rottenness and corrupt moisture, you must probe it entirely with a thin probe, and make sure you know how deep the probe goes.
Afterwards, heat the cautery, which resembles a scraper, and place it in the fistula according to the depth the probe has entered. Continue to apply the cautery until that rotten and corrupted flesh is burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the amount needed.
And beware of burning the nerves that are nearby, and the large veins.
If the fistula goes to the body of the bladder and the intestines, beware of those places, and only use such strong treatment in the fleshy areas, and make sure it's not penetrating.
Afterward, treat the area until it is healed, and if the area is sealed and the matter has been removed for a long time, then know that the area is completely healed.
And if the matter has not been removed, know that the area is perforated, and the bone at the bottom is corrupted. And thus, like one of those that we will discuss in its place.
When pain from cold comes to the kidneys, and from great windiness, and does not take the form of a woman, then it is necessary for you to make cautery on the kidneys on one side and the other with the cautery of the clavicle that we have previously mentioned;
And if we cauterize it in the middle, then there will be three cauteries in a line, and they will give greater help.
Of the bladder When the bladder is weak and soft from cold and moisture, so that the patient retains urine, then make cautery on the outer part above the bladder, where the hairs of the knife begin, and one to the right and one to the left, and each cautery should be as long as the tip of a finger (one inch long);
and make one cautery outside the back, or two if you need it.
and let the cauteries be spaced according to the previously described shape.
When the spleen is cold and moist, and does not allow conception, and the flowers are corrupted and their ends delayed; and when they come, then great pain is felt: Then it is necessary to make three cauteries around the pit, as we have said about the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries outside the back;
and let the cauteries be sharp, as we have said.
When viscous moisture descends to the socket of the hip, and for this reason it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together;
And if the place of the separation is found empty, then you must cauterize the patient on the hip socket with one cautery shaped like a circle, and mark in front of the place around the socket as it turns, so that the socket is inside the circle;
and let the cautery be like the one used to cauterize the stomach.
And if this cautery is not present, make three large olive-shaped cauteries, and let the cauteries be as deep as all the heart;
and treat it until it is healed.
of the pain in the hip. When pain comes in the hip joint, and it is from cold and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we have said in the division and the treatment is not effective, and the illness is long-standing: then it is necessary that you purge the patient of the thick humors with foul-smelling pills, or other good pills of similar sort. After that, apply cautery.
and the method of cautery is according to two methods: that is to say, burning medicines together, and cautery by fire.
Cautery by fire is according to many methods, of which one is such:
that you cauterize on the hip joint three triangular cauteries according to this shape, and make them deep and large, and have between each cautery a space the thickness of a finger, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped;
Sometimes cautery is done in the middle on the head of the hip, so there are four according to this shape:
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circular cautery that we have previously mentioned in the dislocation of the hip;
but do it in such a way that the circle encompasses the entire hip, and all the thick parts of the core are burned.
And this is the method used for sciatica, when the pain is in the hip and does not reach the thigh or the leg.
And if it reaches the thigh and leg, then make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle, four fingers, a little to the left side;
and let the cauteries be sharp, and let the thick parts of the core be burned;
and if the patient feels that the pain extends to the toe or near the heel, cauterize where he feels the pain three or four times with the cautery called "points". And if necessary, make more.
And if the pain is beneath the knee toward the thigh, make a cautery with a sharp or circular cautery, and be very careful in all your cauteries that you do not leave the cautery on for so long that you burn the nerves and major arteries, and that you do not cause the patient more harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen several who have made cauteries on the ankle of the foot, and they left them on for so long that the leg swelled up completely, and the foot as well, and the entire foot was pierced and corrupted. After a belly-ache from which he died.
And if the pain is in two parts together, make a cautery in one and the other, according to this manner.
And the wise ones said in the cautery of the hip, concerning this method, make one such iron and let it be as thick as a fingernail or a little less, and let it be in sections and from one section to the next, the distance of a finger width.
and let the sections be facing two sides, and be like knots, and let there be a handle of iron well made;
and this is the shape:
And it should be heated until it is all red and throws sparks, and then it is placed upon the sore hip, and turned towards the healthy side;
and cauterize once, cauterize again, and leave it for three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open for a long time; after the treatment with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasim says that we use this cautery little because of the fear of its effect, and we see few who use it;
and nevertheless, this is a good cautery for those who can endure it, and in the places where it applies.
The cauterizing instrument is made with crosspieces into which the bar of the door descends, and it should be of bronze or iron, with a long side, and it should have two notches, and between each should be the thickness of a finger; and be open in front and above, and join together according to this shape:
Then place the patient's hip on the healthy side, lying on their healthy side, and press your hand firmly onto the hip; then pour between the two circles of hot water, which has been heated briefly in the fire, and leave it for an hour, and let the patient endure the heat and burning.
For it produces a burning sensation like fire;
and when the burning has subsided, remove your hand with the instrument and wash the hip with warm water, and leave it like that for three days, and apply butter until that which is black from the burn is removed; and leave it three days, that putrefaction may come out;
and that would be the final help after the treatment with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain has spread to the thigh or to the leg, make an instrument that soaks with water according to what you have done to the hip likewise;
and that is the manner of the hot water, and I have written it in the treatment of the rectification of medicine. Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot. where it should have a small hole to allow the point of a razor to enter;
where it should have a small hole to allow the point of a razor to enter; and place another pot tightly over that pot, and put alkali and lime and sweet water on top, so much that there is a fingerbreadth of it above the powders, as you hold it in your hand tightly.
and leave it thus until it descends water and drops into the sealed pot, then take all that water, and pour it back over the lime and alkali as before.
And then it will be very strong and is used in various medical practices and for cauterization of other limbs.
For it has the same effect as fire, and there are other medicines used for cauterizing the hip, such as mustard and honey and mastic and lime with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a cure where a man was cured of hip and sciatic pain, and he praises it greatly, saying that no other treatment was done, and that he was healed in one instance after this cure, and he had bathed as he will teach hereafter.
And he says in this manner that you take fresh and dry green litharge, and grind it very finely with a little grease, and put it on the hip and thigh and leg where the pain is, and bandage it.
and leave it for three hours, and by the amount that the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then have him enter the bath until his body is slightly moistened, and have him enter bed, and the pain will leave entirely and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with such remedies, unless it is after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat's dung, it greatly helps.
and the cauteries should be done in such a manner. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the hollow that is between the big toe and the other one called the foscile.
After that, take dry goat dung, and put it in the fire until it is embers, and put it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished;
and do this again, and do not cease to do this until you think by feeling that it reaches the hip, and that the pain is stopped;
and this manner of cautery is called "cautery of goat".
of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, whether from falling or impact or excessive evacuation, or from seeming cold spreading matter, in none of these cases is cautery of use, except for that which comes from the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary, after the patient has been rid of foul pills or similar things, to apply to the back, wherever the pain is, three lines marked with a cautery, and on each line five cauteries or more, according to the strength and quantity that the patient can tolerate;
and let the cauteries be made according to the cautery that is called "pointed".
and if you wish, make three or four cauteries at the middle claviform cautery according to this shape:
Many times this illness comes to young children, and the signs of its beginning are that they have a tight chest when they stand up, and fear; and you find in the last spine of the back and in those appearances that come upon the other spines.
When you see this and wish to cure it, cauterize it with a circular cautery according to this shape. So that the cautery encompasses each part of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with a cautery that punctures two or three lines, and the punctures should be close together.
After treating the area until it is healed according to what we have said, and be careful not to administer cautery to a swelling that is in a nerve sheath.
of the pain of the joints
When joint pain is caused by moisture spread throughout the limbs, and when the pain is in the feet, which the doctors properly call "podagra," and when it is from a cold cause and remedies cannot cure it, it is treated with cauteries in this way:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if it is necessary to cauterize on the sole of the foot, then make a cautery to the whole cautery that is called "point". And if the pains extend to the knees and other joints, and this often happens, make three or four cauteries on each knee, of each part, according to the olive-shaped cautery;
and if you need more, then make more, but do not hold your hand over it any longer than until the thickness of the heart is burned.
And if the pains descend to the knee and back, administer the cautery that we have discussed in its chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make punctures around the wrist in two lines;
and if there remains any pain in the fingers, make punctures on each joint and on the hair of the hand;
and if the pains come down to the elbows or to the shoulders, cauterize each part, and give good care to the patient and take medicines.
For if you give him good care and purge phlegm, he will be healthy with God's help.
When a rupture occurs in the armpits, and the boils descend to the breasts, and it is recent, then when you wish to treat it, do not let him eat anything that day. and that he uses things that loosen the stomach, so that the stool descends from his stomach;
after that, make him sit on his back between your hands, and instruct him to hold his breath until the boils are repaired, and bring them back to your fingers, and make a sign under the rupture on the bone of the dagger, and make a sign that resembles half a circle above the body;
then heat the cautery, of which this is the shape:
until it is white and it emits sparks. Then return the bowels to their place; and let the minister hold his hand upon them so that they do not return back;
and properly support the patient's thighs, and place a cushion beneath him and a servant upon his thighs, and another upon his chest who holds his hands;
then place the cautery on the mark with your whole hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, then begin again another time until you come to the bone; and carefully watch that the bowel does not jump when you do the cautery; that you do not burn it; and that by this the patient does not die, or another harm.
And know that when you do not come to the bone with the cautery, your work is worth nothing.
And it is necessary that the cauteries for children be subtle according to their size, and for large people as large according to their size;
after three days, treat the area of the cautery with butter until the burn is removed;
after the treatment with other ointments until it is healed, and let the patient lie on their back for forty days until the wound is well-sealed;
and it is necessary that his nourishment be light for a long time, so that his bowels do not swell when he attempts to walk in rooms.
And after forty days, when he wishes to rise, provide him with a well-made sling, and keep it for forty more days;
and let him have good rest, that he labor little and guard against too much drink and eating, and too much loud shouting;
and when he follows this instruction, he is completely healed.
And I will describe here after the treatment of cutting in its chapter.
When ruptures occur in other bellies and are known, and you want them to grow no more, you shall apply a cautery to the cautery according to its quantity, and let a third of the kernel be burned; after the treatment according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients have said that it should be cauterized with a three-angled cautery according to this form:
But first mark the place of incision and make a line across the width above the rupture, and another outside, and then position your hand in the middle of the whole cauterization clamp.
But the first cauteries are lighter and milder.
of ancient pain in any limb When pain comes to any limb, whether from falling or striking, and that pain lasts a long time, and the cure of medicine is not effective, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with the cautery that is called "point," and let the cautery be according to the length of the limb and its smallness, weakness, virtue, and location of twisting and pain.
If it is healed from the first cautery, that is good.
If not, start another cautery on that one, for such is the custom that it should affect the limb that is nearby, so you must perform cauteries until the patient is healed.
The sick are sometimes helped by cautery, greatly aided, and especially those sicknesses that come from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it to be cauterized, be aware if the sickness is in the beginning, and if it is cured according to what we have said in the division, and does not descend nor remain, and you doubt that the corruption will not take hold of the entire patient, then do five cauteries on the head: One in the middle of the head, and the other towards the forehead at the end of the hair; and two on the two temples, and one behind on the nape of the neck;
and let your hand remain so that the cauteries reach the bone, and so much that the scabs come forth so that the vapors of the thick humors may escape;
and cauterize the sore according to what is in front of it.
And if the disease is spread everywhere; and if it clearly diminishes, you must cauterize it with these cauteries that we have mentioned at the head, and one cautery at the top of the nose, and two cauteries on the spine of the neck, and six cauteries on the spine of the back, and one large one on the rump and another beside it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the elbows, and two on the tendons of the chest, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and beware of the nerves that are on the back of the buttocks, that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one cauterizes on the bone of the knuckle, and one on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more help you give it, and the more benefit it has;
And know that the sick person feels no pain at the cautery as healthy people do, because the body is already entirely corrupted.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you will find in the forms of the irons.
After treatment, cover the area with flour of chickpeas with honey and other remedies until it is healthy.
When swelling comes to any limb and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it is not healed, then make cauteries on the limb according to the size and smallness of the limb;
and let the cauteries be a little penetrating into the depth of the flesh; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes cauteries are made on the hand and foot and back, at the source of the nerve that numbs the limb, and thus the swelling is removed;
and nevertheless, no one should intervene unless they are knowledgeable about the limbs and the sources of the nerves moving the body.
When the disease called "albaras" is advanced, and the tools of medicine are of no use, then cauterize it with a cautery a little deeply, according to the thickness of the core, until the whiteness is removed and its color is changed;
then treat it with flour of vetch and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and blood of a colon and blood of an almond, of each a portion; and let it all be mixed together, and be bound with a cloth, and be placed on the spot until it is healed.
The treatment of a chancre by cautery
When a chancre appears at the beginning, and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the chancre.
And nevertheless, the wise ones said that one should also cauterize in the middle of the chancre;
and nevertheless, this does not seem good to me, for I fear that it may become ulcerated and corrupt, and I have already seen it happen several times;
and a more direct thing is that it be cauterized around, with the cautery that is called "circle," as we have said in many cauteries.
When someone has a disease called "adubelati," and it delays in healing, either due to the superfluity it creates, or because of the patient's age when they are decrepit (that is, too old) and have little blood, or due to time; and you want to hasten its healing: then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by pricking; afterward, leave it thus. For it will hasten to heal.
And if you want to pierce it with the entire cautery, heat the cautery of which this is the form:
And place your hand in the middle of that illness called "adubelati" until the cauteries have pierced the core, and let the cauteries be such that the patient feels them externally in such a way that the course of the decay is alleviated.
Afterward, treat it until it is perfectly healed.
There is another type of illness called "corrodens," which is nothing other than a consumption of a limb, for it consumes the limbs just as fire consumes dry wood.
If you see this illness in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, then heat the cauteries small and large, according to what is necessary for the place where the illness is.
After cauterizing from all sides until you remove all corruption, and nothing remains of it, so that everything corrupted is removed.
And then leave it three days, and apply a soothing poultice with oil to the cauterized areas until the heat from the fire is gone, and all the corruption.
After the treatment with ointments that generate flesh.
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh does not grow, it is good.
and if not, then repeat the cautery on any remaining corrupted areas.
And this corruption has sometimes been treated with acute medicine instead of fire cautery;
However, fire cautery is of greater help, and I have already mentioned the treatment with acute medicine in the division: Take it when you need it.
of the sores that come to the feet Often, sores arise on the feet, called "clos" in our understanding, and it is a large, enclosed thing that hurts the foot.
And the cauteries for this illness are in two ways. That is to say, cautery by fire, and cautery by hot water.
Cauterization by fire is done by heating a cautery iron, something like a vaulting beam, made of good iron, sized so it can hold a nail on all sides, with thin edges.
Then, put it hot onto the nail, and turn your hand around the nail until it reaches the bottom of the nail. And leave it thus for three days until it begins to fester. Then make a poultice of crushed wild mallows with salt, and leave the poultice on all night, and the nail will fall out and be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the area with a healing ointment until it is healed.
And if they are burned on the body, and it happens often on hands and feet, then you must apply a cautery of hot water. and it is in this manner: Take a copper or iron rod, or a piece of vine, and place it on the nail and the small outgrowth, that is to say for warts; and place the rod so that it encompasses it entirely, then put a bit of hot water, and hold your hand firmly, and press your hand while turning so that the edge of the rod reaches the root of the nail, and the hot water can find its way deep to the root;
and let the patient endure a little the burning of the hot water for an hour; then leave it like this, and it will detach itself from all its roots.
Do this one after another, until you remove all those that are on the body, then cure them with ointments that generate flesh.
When someone trembles from cold nerves, or from quartan fever or other, you must make four cauteries or four on the spine of the back, one cautery between each spine; and one cautery on the feet, and one on the stomach with an olive cautery;
This will stop the trembling, and the health will be hastened from the cold illness.
Sometimes appear on the body, boils or foul pustules, that come from gross corrupted matter.
If, when they appear, a cautery should be applied to each head of the pustule: a subtle cautery of myrtle wood, whose point is heated in the fire, or of long aristolochia root, or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, according to this manner, and they cannot grow any further, but the excess from which they came is broken, and they are healed;
but it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of blood.
Many times there are great bleedings from the artery that is cut in the wound that comes from outside, or in the incision of the abscess, or in the cautery of the limb, and in similar things; and it is a very grievous thing to stop.
And yet, when this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press it firmly until the blood is still under your finger, and no more drops emerge;
then put the olive-shaped cauteries, several small and large ones, into the fire until they are all red;
then take one, large or small depending on the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and place the cautery on that vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stopped.
And if it spurts out forcefully when you remove your finger from above the vein, and the cautery has gone out, quickly take another cautery from the fire.
And do not cease to do this, one after the other, until the blood is stopped;
and be careful that you do not burn the nerve that is beside it, and that no other harm comes to the patient;
and know that when blood flows from the artery, it cannot be well stopped, especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four ways that we have said: or by cautery, or by extraction when it is not treated, or by a strong ligature of thread, or by medicines applied that have the power to stop blood; and be bound and tightly constrained at the beginning.
Whoever applies a constricting bandage of cloths or puts burning things on, or other similar things, will not profit much.
And if this happens to someone and they have no bandage or medicine available, they should put their index finger on the wound of the vein as we have said, and extend it firmly until the blood is stopped above the wound and above the vein; and do not move the finger, but moisten it with cold water often, so that it is very cold until the blood is congealed and thickened and stopped;
and do the necessary inquiries regarding cauteries and medicines.
We have told you in the first chapter all the illnesses in which fire cautery or burning medicine is appropriate, and the indications and causes and instruments and forms of cauteries;
and I have arranged that chapter from head to foot, and I will proceed through this chapter in the same way so that one can more easily find what one desires.
And before I begin this, my dear son, you should know that this chapter involves more danger and fear than the first concerning cauteries, and therefore greater caution is needed.
For in the work of this chapter, there is often the evacuation of blood when opening a vein, and incising an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in cutting into stones, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and many die.
And I warn you not to undertake foolishness. For many kinds of people come for cures. some come who are so angered by their illness that they die easily from the frenzy they find in their illness, and from the greatness of their malice; and from these one must have fear.
And from these there are some who give you their sense, and say: wait, I am healed"; and the illness is spiteful.
It is not fitting that you consent to those who come to you with this manner, but put greater consideration in your honor than in your greed, and do not act foolishly but wisely with those of whom you are certain, and of whom you can take and gain praise;
and use prognostication and indication in the treatment of your patients, so that health may be converted;
and this will help you acquire good renown, and glory, and a memory of praise.
Most dear son, Our Lord grant you good understanding and uprightness, and if you wish to inspire yourself from the holy inspiration of his hand, amen.
Now I have ordered this chapter, dividing it into chapters, in accordance with what precedes in the chapter on cauteries, which I have described from head to foot, so that you may more easily find what you will need.
Know that this illness often comes to children during childbirth, and when the mother squeezes the child's head too tightly;
and sometimes it comes from a reason that is unknown.
And I never saw this illness in anyone but children, and in all those I have seen, death was hastened. And therefore, it seems to me that it is better to leave this kind of treatment.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head grew larger each day until he could no longer support it;
and the moisture increased so much that he died, and this moisture is assembled under the bone on the surface, between the heart and the bone;
and the treatment is such if the moisture is between the heart and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you should make a wide incision in the head;
and it should be as long as two fingers, until the moisture runs;
and see here the form of the spatula:
If the moisture is deeper, and the abscess is larger, make two incisions in the shape of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and the signs show the joints of the head open on each side, and the pus leaps out when you press it with your hand inside, and this is not yet resolved: then you must cut into the head with three incisions according to this method:
And after the incision, draw the moisture completely out. Afterwards, bind the incisions with cloths and powders, and put wine and oil on them, and leave it thus until the fifth day;
then unbind it, and treat the wound with poultices and ointments, and let the head heal evenly, and give the patient dry food with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another way of incision is that you look at the size of the abscess and the collection of pus;
for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left.
Then cut where the abscess is open, and the collection of water, and slice it according to your ability;
and be careful not to cut the artery; and let blood flow, so that the patient dies from the flow of blood and the evacuation of moisture.
When someone has a disease called "catarrh" in the eyes or chest, and the illness is long-standing, and medical treatment is ineffective, then the final treatment is cauterization, where the two arteries are cut.
It is necessary, therefore, when you are about to cut them, that the patient hold their head back; Afterwards, he rubs the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient tightens their neck with the whole cloth; then look where the vein swells, and the places of each are near the ears, and are scarcely healed;
then mark the places with a sharp instrument, then cut one and the other with a sharp instrument from two sides, until the cut reaches the bone, and that is to be done along the width of the head.
And if you wish, place the instrument under the artery and cut above it, cutting as you should through the middle.
And when the vein is cut, the blood leaps out continuously upward.
And if the artery is not visible when felt, then you should measure the space of three fingers, then mark it and cut down to the bone;
and the amount of blood to be released is six ounces, and perhaps a little more or less, according to what the patient can endure, and the fullness of the artery;
then examine the wound: if there remains any piece of the underlying bone, cut it so that no festering sores appear, then bind the wound and apply ointment, and treat it until it is healed.
of migraine When chronic migraine comes, and acute catarrh, due to moisture in the tears and heat in the temples and old-fashioned madness and similar things, and he has been treated by various medical cures and none of it helps, we will open the arteries in the temples and cauterize them, as we have described.
And the method of extracting them is that the patient pulls back the hair on their temples and finds the artery that appears in the temple, for it appears clearly by its pulsation, and is rarely visible except in some very cold individuals.
and if it is visible, the patient tightens the area around the neck with some cloth strips, then rubs the area with a rough cloth, and washes the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly; then take the spatumile of which the form is this: then scrape the skin slightly until you reach the artery, then pull it upwards with forceps, and separate it well from the tissues underneath on each side;
and if the artery is thin, turn it with the point of the uncine, then cut it from that part according to the quantity of two heads. For if it is not cut, the blood will not stop completely.
And draw out the blood from VI ounces to III;
and if the artery is large, you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that decay does not come before the wound is closed, and a flow of blood occurs.
then cut the excess that is between the two ties at that same time, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with a knife cautery to the bone until the heads are cut;
and that is the best operation, if the patient does not have a fever and is of a hot complexion. For cauteries are a help to finish the moistures: For this reason, it is of greater help to moistures.
Where it is necessary for the extraction of arteries that one fill the place with old cotton and put on well-made tents;
and when one removes them, let them be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until they are healed;
and if, while working on the artery, the blood flows freely, hurry to stop it with cautery, or fill the area with vitriol and hold it with your hand until the blood is stopped; and if you do not have this available, put your finger on the area until the blood is congealed, and wash the area with cold water until the blood stops, and hold it as necessary;
And there should be one finger's width of space between the two blades, and then when you have marked the two areas, you place the burning iron on it until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and be spaced apart between the two points, for it is not completely fused by this cautery entirely.
and this is the shape of the cautery:
And the gentler and easier way to extract the artery is to cauterize the vein with this sharp cautery from two sides, but the sharp points should be thick to retain their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it holds its heat less.
of tears When the tears from the eyes are flowing down the veins that are above the head of the sufferer, and no medical treatment is beneficial, and you see the patient's face turn red, and feel trembling in their forehead, and if the skin is thin and moist such that the hair on the skin has fallen out, and the skin is heated, and scorched by the heat of the tears, then this treatment is necessary. And the ancients called it "contused cure," and it is that you should make the patient's hair on their forehead recede, then make three cuts on their forehead evenly along the length of the forehead;
And the ancients called it "contused cure," and it is that you should make the patient's hair on their forehead recede, then make three cuts on their forehead evenly along the length of the forehead; and one of the cuts should be as though two are made right in the middle of the forehead, going down to the nose, and the other two along the temples above the skin, and be careful of the incision of the arteries which are along the temples above the skin;
and keep your hand away from the continuation of the two jawbones, and each wound should be the size of three fingers across the joints.
and have prepared a piece of sponge and many cloths for wiping the blood, then take a spatula, sharp on both sides, whose shape is like this:
from the incision that is next to the temple to the second incision; and scrape all the flesh that is between the two cuts over the entire surface that is on the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second one, and then remove this spatula. then place in the first cut the instrument called "cultellaire", which is very sharp on one side, and on the other side is blunt, not sharp, and this is the shape:
And place the sharp side toward the flesh next to the heart, and the blunt side toward the bone, and put it in place until it reaches the middle cut.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous down to what appears of the heart, and then do the same in the middle cut to the other cut;
and then draw out the blood equally, and press the area for the taken blood;
then place in each cut a tent of old cotton, and place over it cloths soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and watch that no hot abscesses come there;
and on the third day, loosen the bandage, and apply a large poultice of warm water, then cure it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and other cures that cure wounds, until it is healthy.
When an acute cold comes to some, and you see the eyes strained and small, and the sight weakened, and the eyelids burned; and the hair falls out, and in the head there is a sharp pain, and the patient sneezes; Then know by these accidents that those matters and that cold come from many veins, and the best cure for it is this.
And it is that you order the patient to lie on their back, then make a large cut across the forehead, and another one the size of a large I. And begin from the cut on the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision go down to the bone; and move your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move the jaw;
and when the bone is exposed, wipe all the blood away with a sponge, and then separate the two edges of the cut and put old cotton and linen cloth in it; then put soaked cloths in wine and oil on top, and be careful of a hot abscess;
when it is removed, you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with things that dry out, causing flesh to grow.
In such a way: Take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and make a plaster; and apply it to these wounds to cause flesh to grow everywhere.
of the stoppage of the ears
Everything that falls into the ears is one of the four things: or grains, or beasts, or a stone from a mine, or similar things like iron; or seed, such as peas, beans, lentils; or something flowing, such as water and oil and similar things.
When a stone or other object falls into the ear that does not join with the ear nor grow within the ear, place the ear in the sun.
If you see the stone, then distill a little violet oil or oil of sesame, then administer extraction; and make him sneeze with concoctions, and plug his nostrils when the sneezing comes, and place pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and extend the ear upward.
Often, it comes out through this treatment;
and if it does not come out, administer extraction with fine tweezers, of which this is the form:
If it leaps out with the tweezers, that is good;
if not, administer extraction with a fine, small double-bladed hook;
and if it does not jump out with that, make a copper wire and push the head of the wire into the hole of the ear firmly, and seal whatever is around the wire with soft wax so that air cannot enter with the wire; then pull it out firmly, for often it comes out as we have said;
and if it does not come out in such a manner, take glue with which birds are caught, and put on it some instrument suitable for this purpose, and put a bit of cotton around it; then press the glue onto the stone or whatever, and pull it out.
And if it does not jump out with all these things that we have said, hurry to cut the ear before a hot abscess comes and it causes spasms;
And the manner of the cut is that you first make the patient bleed from the cephalic vein, and draw blood according to the measure of its power, then make the patient sit between your hands and turn their ear upward, and make a small cut in the root of the ear at the fat or dependent place; and let the cut be like a crescent, until you reach the stone, then remove it according to your ability, and suck it quickly into your mouth;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is grains that are within and it swells, administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, administer a thin, subtle spatumile according to this form: and administer an incision of that grain.
But do not do this when you think the grain is moist because of the moisture of the ear, until you have made many pieces;
then extract with delicate tweezers and with suction, as we have said, so that the extraction is eased.
In the water that falls into the ear, the patient should first use sneezing remedies, and stuff the ear with old cotton. And let him lie on that same ear where the water is. If it jumps out with this, it is good.
If not, then take many small, light stones the length of your finger and warm them slightly in the fire; and place one in the opening of his ear, and let him jump up on his feet from the other side, and strike with another stone on the stone in his ear; and do not cease striking stone on stone until the water comes out completely, and thus it jumps out completely;
And if you wish, take a twig, and put one end in the ear, and the other end hold over the fire until the thinnest part of the twig is burned;
then do the same with other twigs until the water comes out completely, just as we have said with the stone.
In the extraction of a creature, if it is small, like a flea and similar things, treat it as we have said in the division;
but if it is large enough to be felt, administer extraction with pincers; and this is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In the extraction of worms nestled in the ears, when you treat them as we have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and the treatment does not benefit, you must look at the ear in the sun: if any worms are apparent, extract them with fine pincers, and if none are apparent, take the implement of which this is the form:
And it should be narrow underneath and wide above. And insert the most delicate end into the ear according to the amount of suffering of the sick person, then suck firmly on the entire implement; do this often until all the worms exit.
And if they do not obey to come out, plug around the implement with cotton, as I have said for the stone;
and if they do not leap out as we have said, administer the distillations that the ancients have tested for the killing of worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations;
and distil your oils and your medicines into the ear through this implement, of which here is the form as you see: And it is of silver or bronze, narrow beneath to the small holes, and open above for distilling;
and for pressing in the distillation through an implement of well-made bronze for this, and if you wish, take a scraper and wrap around the pointed end with cotton; then pour your oil or your juice, and whatever medicine you wish into the channel, and the channel be in the ear;
then put the scraper with all the cotton inside, and press your hand gently until the oil is distilled to the end of the ear; and the patient smells it inside, and let the distillation be a little heated with fire also so it is distilled into the ear; and watch that it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be very good.
of the stopping of the ears
No children are born who do not have any holes in their ears;
and this same thing happens to men through the stopping of a wound, or of flesh born inside the ear, and these stoppages sometimes extend deep into the ear, so that one cannot see it;
and sometimes there is a little bit of a blockage in front of the hole, and one sees it clearly.
That which goes deep, so that one cannot see it, is of difficult healing in many conditions, and in that which one sees, you must place the patient's ear in the sun; and look inside: if you see the obstruction appearing, then open all of this stuff with the form which is here:
And be sharp and cutting in front and behind, all smooth, so that it does not injure the ear;
If the obstruction is of flesh born of or within the ear, then hold it with fine forceps and cut it lightly, until all the flesh is removed.
And if the obstruction is deep within the ear, then take a fine, light scraper and warm it a little in the fire, then place it in the ear's interior.
If you feel an obstruction from which the patient suffers difficulty hearing, pierce lightly, and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear;
Then place a tent in the ear according to the width of the opening, and moisten it with Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until the wound is closed, or take a tent and moisten it in rose water, and powder it with powdered vitriol;
And if you see the ear swollen, then you must remove the tent and replace it with another tent moistened in cerote, made from rose oil and wax, until the swelling is gone; Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a discharge of blood comes, then dip a sponge and cloths in cold water, and place it on the ear, and use other treatments that stop the discharge of blood which are in the treatment of distillations.
This althelul, which comes in papillæ on the eyes when they are moist and dry, you must pull them out with forceps and tweezers, and cut it with a spatula from its roots; then put powdered vitriol on the area.
And if blood flows, cauterize it with a thin lens cautery, and the cauterization after the incision is worth more.
and many times it returns, because something remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
of hail Many times there come in the eyes' papery parts things that seem like hail in their shape and hardness, and for this reason this disease is called "grandine", and it is a collection of thick moisture in the papery part above and below; the work is such:
the work is such: beware if the grandine moves from one side to the other, and it is an easy thing to know;
Then, if it moves, widen it, then lightly scrape it from each part, then take it with forceps and cut it.
If you cannot cut it without slightly piercing the paper, do not harm the patient;
and if the fissure is large, assemble it with stitches and treat it until it is healed;
and if it is small, do not use force, for the ointments will soon restore it and create flesh.
And if the granulation is descending into the inside of the ear towards the upper part, reverse the paper, and extend the granulation with forceps, and cut it and press it from one side and the other;
and if the paper is separated by the incision, that does not cause harm;
and when the granulation is cut, lift the eye of salt water, and treat the place with that which creates flesh until the patient is healed.
of the fat of the eyes Exinach is a fat that is generated in webs of the membranes above, and this happens more to children than to adults, and causes great pain to their eyes, and they get catarrh in the mornings, and cannot look at the light of the sun because tears well up in their eyes;
and because of this they often lie on their faces and sleep, and their membranes beneath their eyebrows are moist, so that swelling and appearance have covered with exinach which is visible in the eye. And when you press the place with your fingers and feel the exinach within.
And the method of treatment is that the patient places his head on your chest;
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a covering in the shape of a circle according to the amount of exinach in each part, then place it over the patient; and press with your fingers on one side and the other, so that the exinach is brought together within the circle;
then cut into the middle of the moisture with a sharp spatula a slit of the width, and not any greater than the wound that is made in bloodletting;
and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach; and in several ways exinach comes out of the slit, in the shape of a piece of white fat.
Then draw it out completely with a piece of cloth placed between your fingers to prevent it, and turn your hand to the right and to the left until it is spread out;
and be careful not to add more to the slit, that you don't get the entire spatula up to the eye, so that you don't injure it.
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the slit, then slightly enlarge the slit a little until it appears;
Then draw it out as we have said, then soak cloths in oil and water, and put over the area, and bind with bandages.
And if there are such men who grind salt and put it on to corrupt the moisture that remains.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if there is a hot abscess at the place, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
of the hairs of the papers When hairs grow on the eyelids in addition to the natural ones, and become old, they harm the eyes and cause various illnesses such as chronic tearing and softening of the eyelids and albuginea, to the point where it causes the destruction of the eyes.
and the cure is according to four methods: or by cautery with fire, or by a sharp medicine according to what is before in the chapter on cautery, and is done either by incision and suture or by cauterization, according to what I will say.
You must place the patient's head against your own chest, then turn the eyelid toward your left hand;
if it has turned over, that is good; if not, then put a needle on the entire thread over it; and let it be next to the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow next to these hairs, and pull the thread over the entire eyelid, and turn it to the razor;
then cut in the part under the eyelid, under the attached hairs, along the entire space, from the large tear duct to the small one;
then pull out the thread, and place a small tent of cotton and cloth under the eyelid, then draw a figure of a flap over the eyelid, like a myrtle leaf, and however, the figure must be according to the amount you want to raise the eyelid which is divided for all.
And if someone needs to cut a large amount of the eyelid according to how the eyelid is softened;
then cut across the entire space along the two lines you have drawn, and begin from the large tear duct to the small one; and let one of the cuts be near the natural hairs, the thickness of a hair; then put the hook into one of the two angles of the core, then scrape all of it;
then stitch the two edges together with a needle and fine wool thread, and wipe away the blood, and dry the excess thread on the two eyebrows with some sticky substance, if you want to do that;
and if not, then do not treat it, and leave the stitch and threads for three or four days;
then treat the wound without stitching with dry and constricting things, for paper aids the healing and joining of the wound, but stitching is weaker (as the ancients say), and this is a safe practice. and if there is another method:
and if there is another method: and there is another way: to shape the paper like a myrtle leaf, as we have described, with three separated incisions according to the form that is here:
then cut what is above with small equal forces according to the form that is here:
And if you lack the power to hold the pliers, and the parts are not equal, take a needle with one thread and put it in the middle of the figure; and put another thread beside the large tear, and the second thread beside the small one, and hold the threads evenly between your fingers;
then lift your hand equally, and lift all the skin on which you have marked, as we have described, then bring the two lips of the wound together with stitches, and cure it until it is healed;
and if an abscess comes to your incision, soothe it with cerote and similar soothing ointments;
and sometimes the hairs of the paper are changed:
if so, you must use what we have said about the incision;
but the stitching in one and the other is more artificial.
The treatment of canes is thus according to this form: and that you convert the paper and the slit inside according to what I have said, and then make two canes by art, and two thin bands as long as the paper and as wide as the spatula is; and cut as two heads from two sides where you hold the threads;
then assemble one and the other subtly above what rises from the paper of the eye, and tighten the two canes of the two parts together; and leave it thus for some days, and the skin which will be tightened will die and will dry and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it delays, then cut it with some force, then treat it until it is healthy;
and when the wound is healed, and the paper will be lifted, and the hairs will no longer prick;
and this is the shape of the two canes that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity of length and width:
The work is such that you take a fine needle, and put a fine and soft silk thread in it; then assemble the ends and tie them together subtly, and let the length of the threads be one palm long;
then arrange in the chase another fine silk thread briefly, and tie the ends of the thread;
then place the patient's head in your hand;
and let it be near the sun so that the work is clear, for it is a subtle and delicate work, then place the needle with the whole chase in the root of the hair close by, and make it pierce through the paper quickly until you pull it over the natural hair;
then pull the hair up to the chase, and place that hair in the chase, if there is one or two or three or more;
then withdraw your hand so that the hairs come out of the entire chase in the paper with the natural hair.
And if the chase is pulled and the hairs do not come out with it, then you shall pull the chase underneath all the thread you have ordered, until the chase comes out of the hole above and you see it through the vision of the eye;
Then you shall pull out the chase and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair heals in its place and the flesh grows;
And if the hair is small, then attach one long hair of the natural ones, and let it grow along with it until it is elongated, then lift it.
Of the corruption of the eye When this disease, which is called "aleacrati" or the corruption comes to the eye, there are two types of it:
One natural, and the other unnatural.
And it happens by the inflammation of a wound, or by incision or cautery, and by similar things.
And the way to treat it is to split that inflammation, and separate its edges, and put linen tents inside, and bind it until it is healed;
and you should not use anything that dries and constricts in treating it. For if you do that, the illness will return worse than before;
but use softening things, such as fenugreek; and apply water or cooked flaxseed and melted diaquil ointment in some oil, and wrap it in a tent, and treat it with that.
And the key to your treatment is to be careful that it does not heal according to its former form;
and these treatments that we have described are only ways to address this illness, so that it does not return in its former form.
This illness, which is truly called "axacrati," is both natural and accidental.
The accident comes from wounds and cuts and cautery and similar things;
and the method of treatment is that you take a needle, on which there is a double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and pierce it from the left tear duct to the right, so that the thread comes out at two points in the flesh;
then stretch the flesh over the entire needle and cut it with a spatula wide. And if the appearance of the paper returns according to what is necessary, that is good;
if not, take a scraper and put it in the gap, and turn the paper, and make two cuts on the inside edge of the paper;
and let the ends of the two cuts be at the two corners of the incision you have cut, and make them into angles so that when they are joined together, the shape is like the shape of a letter called "I greek";
then remove that flesh, according to the amount that its edges are sharp underneath, from what is under the paper, then join the two separated parts and stitch them with a wool thread;
then treat it with what we have said about softening medicines and dressings, until it is healed.
And if the ailment comes from a cut, or a suture, or cautery, then you must make a deep incision beneath the hairs of the papers, and according to what is before. then separate between the two edges of a dressing, as I have said;
then separate between the two edges of a dressing, as I have said; and one must perform the work according to the form of the illness, for it is very diverse in form, and skilled masters prepare remedies with all their power so that they can restore the figure to its natural form;
and the sick person themselves, according to what work and instruments are necessary in various situations.
When this joining occurs in such a way that the paper on top is joined with the white of the eye, and cannot move or perform its natural actions, then you must place the point of a razor underneath the paper, and lift it up;
and spread it with tweezers, until you cut what is adhering to the fine spatula, so that it is neither too sharp nor too sharp, so that the patient cannot endure the spatula being too sharp and injuring the eye;
and let your incision, with which you scrape that assembly, be gentle, so that the paper returns to its natural shape;
and the entire assembly is healed, and sometimes they apply salt water to the eye, and remove it with fresh water and with a poultice;
then place a linen tent between the paper and the eye, and place wool soaked in abundance of egg white on the eye; and after the third day use poultices and healing things until it is healed.
Know that the nail is according to two types: It is nervous and similar to hard skin, and another that is not nervous, but is similar to frozen white moisture, that when touched with iron and one attempts to remove it with pliers, one cannot.
And both types begin near the large tear duct, and grow little by little until they cover the entire sight and all light and movement of the eye.
And the manner of the incision is that the patient should put their head on your chest, then you open their eyes; and lift the paper in your hand, then grab the nail with small pliers, and extend it above; then take a needle, and put a hair of a horse, or a cow, or an ox, and a strong thread; and double the point of the needle a little and place it in the middle of the nail, and pierce it with the whole needle, and tie the nail with a thread and extend it above, and singe the side of the nail that touches the pupil and the silk with the hair all the way to the root, then cut the remaining part at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula and with small forces, and leave the natural flesh at the tear duct, so that the flow of tears does not come about by the incision.
and sometimes the nail extends only to the hook and the thread, as we have said; then singe it with a soft spatula, of which this is the form:
And be careful that the spatula does not touch the fleshy tissue and break it, and that the pupil is not pierced;
and after the incision, put a little bit of bruised salt and litharge into the eye, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with whatever is needed until it is healed.
And if the nail is not nervous, and you cannot push in the needle, and the tweezers cannot get in, this type of nail is often treated with medicines;
and it grows as I have described in the division, and if you want to cut it, open the patient's eye, and take a slightly pointed spatula according to this shape: And carefully trim the nail, and if you see that it is thinning and the inflammation is pressing, distill from your mouth into the eye litharge-based ointment, red ointment, and bruised salt, and bandage the eye until the next day;
If anything is contrary to this in the eye, such as a boil, then leave it, and first treat the hot boil until it is healed, then resume the treatment as before, until it is healed.
then begin the other treatment according to this same method, until it is completely removed.
And if the appearance of the tear duct's flesh harms the eye through great damage, suspend it with tweezers and cut a part of it, not all of it, so that the tear duct does not appear.
Then distill into the eye red ointment made of litharge.
Sometimes red flesh grows on the eyes of some men, covering the pupil and sticking to the eyelids, and it resembles a rose-like swelling.
and the procedure is that the patient places his head in your hand, then opens his eyes, and you use tweezers suitable for this, holding all that flesh firmly.
then cut the first flesh, and continue cutting with the scalpel until the end, and be careful not to injure the eye in the process.
and the incision should be like the incision we mentioned for cutting the toenail, with small amounts of force to remove the scab, as the form after this chapter shows.
and when the incision is complete and all the flesh is removed, apply a preparation of ground herbs or a red-colored liquid and similar corrosive medicines to the eye, and put a bandage of egg white over the eye, making sure it is covered against a hot abscess.
and if anything remains, and the blood flow overwhelms you, and you suspect a hot abscess, leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that calm a hot abscess.
then return to your work until it is healed, and thus do whenever flesh has grown in the eye in this manner.
However, it is necessary that you ease the treatment of each eye weak from its natural path. and from the accidental path, through work with iron.
and do not put your hand into any of these works until you see that the limb is enduring that work.
Those are red veins that are covered over the eye, and they hinder the eye's work and weaken the eye every day.
It is therefore necessary at first that you examine whether the eye, in which the speck is, is strong, and that there is no other illness apart from the speck. then treat it in this way:
instruct the patient to place his head on your breast, then draw those veins with a lancet according to your knowledge, and let the lancets be thin, double, according to this form:
And let there be two lancets by degrees in one body according to this form:
then treat forcefully those veins subtly, and wipe the blood one hour after the other, until you see those veins withdrawn from the eye;
and beware that you do not pierce the eye with the points of the spatulas, and do this work at midday in front of the sun, and be very diligent in your work so that you only cut the veins;
and when you have done this, distill green and red bile into the eye to corrupt what remains of the scab.
And if you are unable to collect all of it at that time, make a plaster on the eye of things that soothe the pain of the eyes, and leave it for a few days until the pain is calmed and you are certain of a hot abscess, then recommence according to this manner that is before until it is healed;
and this is the form of the treatment:
The mirror is called "arissati" fistula:
when you treat it with cautery and with a sharp burning medicine, according to what I have said before, and it is not healed, there is a trick, so that you cut open the abscess, where it should remain, and drain all the moisture that is there, until the bone is exposed.
And when the bone is exposed, and you see the corruption and blackness, then scrape it with all the instruments of which this is the form;
and it is called "aspre chief", and it should be made of iron and have a sharp point, and be pointed like a file, as it is in the present form:
And place it on the place of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that the corruption is removed;
and do this several times, then restore the place with desiccant medicines.
if the place is healed, and flesh grows, and the body of the swelling is healed, and remains like this for forty days, and it does not regenerate and is not suppurating, and no bad accident comes to it, know that it is healthy;
if not, then there is no other remedy than to bring the fistula to the opening of the nostril according to this form: and that you uncover the bone a second time with iron and sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered, then you take a drill according to this form, and let the iron drill have three angles, and let the shaft be thinned to the head as you see here:
then place it on the bone next to the tear duct, and move your hand away from the eye a little, then turn the entire drill until it pierces the bone, and the patient will feel it because wind will come out if they hold their hand over their nose;
and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and hardens the place, then the matter goes to the nose; then it is a lighter thing for the patient.
When the eyes are fully open, and there is no disturbance to the nose, nor any narrowing, then you must bind the patient;
then cleanse it, then apply leeches or cupping glasses without causing a wound to draw out the humour, then place over the eye a poultice made of acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla, and then compress the eye, and place the poultice over bandages and cloths;
and the way to arrange the cloths is that you take sufficiently soft cloths, and fold each one into four, and then place one on top of the other according to the amount the eye needs;
then compress it over a hard bandage firmly, and again apply cupping glasses to draw out the humour without causing a wound;
then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye compressed day and night, and if the poultice softens, you should compress it more tightly;
then remove the poultice after day and night, and if you see the eye recovering, that is good;
if not; then repeat the plaster, bandages, poultice, and cupping glasses until it is healed.
a tearing of cloth or skin When tearing occurs in the skin, it then opens, and pus comes out like resin grains, and is frightening to see;
Then, if you see it split, the procedure is to put a needle into the root of the affected part down to the top, then put another needle where there is a double thread from the tear; and pierce it, and leave the first needle according to the positioning;
then cut the double thread and tie a part of the skin around it, and tighten it well, then remove the needle and put on oiled wool soaked in abundant egg;
and leave it until the thread comes loose with the skin, then treat the eye with comforting things until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is constricted by the skin on all sides of a cloth circle, until it is healed.
And if the eye shows great disturbance, pierce it with a thin instrument that penetrates deep into the eye, and drain the white moisture and lower the eye, and immediately enter within;
then extract it until it is healed.
This disease, called "alcunnati," is nothing more than swelling that gathers in the eye, resembling a descending pus, but it is not pus;
and the method of treatment is to have the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take the head in both your hands, and move it until you see the swelling come upwards to your eyes; then it should be fixed, and not descend and the light should be clear, and the patient should see things as he used to;
and if it does not descend below, know that it is pus, and if the descent of the swelling is not prepared as we have said.
then make the patient sit between your hands, then take a fine spatula and pierce the cornea a little bit along the continuation of the conjunctiva with the cornea and the crown, until the swelling comes out;
and when it has come out, then instill into the eye hot pus mixed with honey, or pus or fenugreek boiled and honey, then be treated with other remedies until it is healed.
of the eye's pus We have already discussed the types of pus in the division, and what is necessary to pierce; then work according to the health.
You must have the sick person sit between your crossed hands, away from the sunlight, and hold the healthy eye tightly.
then place the paper of the eye in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right;
then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument called "almagda," or in your left hand, if the eye is right;
then place the tip of the instrument beside the crown, by the thickness of a nail, in that white part of the eye near the tear duct, then push the instrument called "almagda" forcefully, and turn your hand so that it pierces the white part of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the hollow;
and it is necessary that the measure of the almagda's path be at the depth of the space between the pupil and the end of the blackness; and that is the crown of the eye;
if you see the bone in that membrane through the clarity of the cornea, and you can place the instrument to the place where the point is, then press it along one track after another.
if the point descends now, the patient sees before him and the instrument in his eye.
Then rest a little, and if the point goes back up the second track, apply force with the instrument, and when it is firmly fixed and it does not rise, gently remove the almagda by turning your hand little by little;
and then put a little gem-like salt on the point, and lift the eye from that. Then place over the eye a bandage of wool or soft cloth soaked in rose oil and plenty of egg, and bind with the healthy eye.
We, and those of our time, place over it a bandage with plenty of egg.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye due to its hardness, because there are some people whose eyes are too hard, you must take the instrument called "alberit", of which this is the form:
And then pierce only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a subtle opening, and then put in the almagda, as we have said;
and for the completion of the work, prepare a suitable bed for the patient, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark place;
and be kept free from all movement, and let him eat light foods, and do not move his head either to the right or to the left, and be bound according to his disposition until the third day;
then release him in the same dark room, and test his vision, and make him see some things, and then reapply the bandage until the seventh day;
and you should not do this during the treatment hour or immediately after the incision, but you should do this later, because the blood rises quickly.
if a hot abscess comes, you should unbind the eye before the seventh day, and use what soothes the abscess;
and when it has calmed down, unbind the eye and place a cloth over his face for a few days, and let him remain in that dark room.
And then gradually leave the room, and return to his normal activities;
and know that no disciple should interfere in this case. And a man from the land of Iraq came to us, who told us that in their country people made an almagda, a thing through which water is sucked, but I have never seen one in our land, nor have I ever read about it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the appearances of the forms of the almagda, so that those who do not know them may see them;
and are properly of bronze: And let their heads be of this same subtlety, and their backs in three sharp angles.
Sometimes various additional fleshy growths appear on the nose, some of which look like scorpions with many legs;
and some have flesh deeply embedded, of a dark color, and some have soft flesh of a good color. In that one of these fleshy growths which is soft, and not embedded, you should have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun;
In that one of these fleshy growths which is soft, and not embedded, you should have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun; and open his nostrils, and apply a lancet to those growths, and draw them out; then cut what you can remove with a finely pointed, sharp lancet, until you know that the flesh is completely removed.
And if anything remains that cannot be cut, then work at it with all delicate instruments gently, so that nothing is left behind; and if, without overwhelming you, or a boil is present, then treat it as necessary;
and if it is a malignant boil, then hurry and cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all flesh is removed, then apply oil and vinegar to it. If the boil opens and moisture flows down to the palate, know that it is healed;
and if moisture does not penetrate as it should, know that there is new flesh grown on the bone above, which the instruments cannot reach to cut;
Then you must put a rather thick linen thread, and tie it in places a thumb's width or less apart; and have the patient pull the thread's end into their nostril to the best of their ability, and pull and sniff until the thread comes out of the nostril into the mouth;
and many children do this in school, and it is an easy thing for anyone who wishes to do it;
Then hold the end that came out of the nostril in one hand, and the other end that came out of the mouth in the other, and pull one after the other, holding the places where the threads are tied.
Do this until you know that the knots have corrupted the flesh, then pull the thread, wipe the blood, and soak the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back in the nostril as before;
Do this for three days or more, until the ointment has corroded all remaining flesh;
and then place a lead strip in the nostril for several days until it is healed, and if it requires drying medicines, use them;
and this is the form of the instrument for purging the head, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nostril:
And it should be of silver or bronze, resembling an open lamp, like a tube, and the conduit likewise;
and if you wish, make a closed tube, and let the instrument be full to purge the head;
and have a handle on the head to hold it when one heats the oil or any liquid.
from the skin over the nostril
Many times a disease called "telul" arises on the head of the nostril, and grows and becomes large often, until it is a visible thing to look at;
and for this, you must cut it at the beginning, and remove it completely, then place the cautery or burning medicine on the spot;
and if one delays cutting it until it is large, watch out if it is hard, of a foul color, of poor sense:
if it is not touched with iron, for it is a festering abscess, for when one cuts it sometimes, great harm comes to the patient;
and if the abscess is soft to the touch, not foul-colored, and you see that it can be completely cut, empty the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the place with dry and astringent things.
Know that when a solution of continuity comes on one of these cartilaginous works, it profits little, except in some men.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, one must see if the wound is fresh, with all its blood. and then bring the two lips together with a suture, and treat it until it is healed.
and if the lips are already separated on one side and the other, you must cauterize all the parts of their core until they bleed, then bring the two lips together with a suture, and tighten it, and dust over it powder of dragon's blood and crushed incense; and place on the powders a piece of strong or other joining plaster, and leave it until it dries, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of the suture is that you assemble the solution: or with needles, as we have said in the suture of the belly; or with thread, as I have made you aware.
of abscesses of the lips
In the mouths of men, hard abscesses occur within the lips, resembling grains of millet, both smaller and larger;
Then you must turn back the lips, and cut open each one, and take it with forceps and cut it into each part;
then fill the place after the incision with powdered vitriol, until the blood is stanched;
and then bandage it, and treat the place with dry things until it is healed.
Many times flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients call "albulus";
if so, you must grasp it with tongs, and cut it at its root, and allow the pus or blood to drain;
then place powdered vitriol, or other astringent and drying powders, on the place;
and if that flesh returns after the incision, and it often happens, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it: if it does not return after the cautery;
Sometimes there are gathered at the base of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, scabs that are ugly and rough; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellowish and rotten, so that the decay reaches the gums, and the teeth are foul-smelling;
so you must make the patient sit between your hands, and his head be in your lap, and scrape the teeth or the scabs where they appear, until nothing remains there; and thus do with the blackness and greenness, and the yellowness and other blemishes, until they are cleansed;
and if one removes what is there at the first attempt, it is good; if not, then repeat it again on the second day and the third, until you have scraped everything clean;
and know that teeth require various types of tools for scraping, according to what the craftsman demonstrates, because the scrapers used for scraping the surfaces of teeth have different shapes than those used for scraping between the teeth; and these shapes and others should be prepared with you.
It is necessary, when you treat a toothache, that you delay extracting it as long as possible, for one should not do this at all; for it is a very important substance until one has no excuse for scraping.
Therefore, when the patient insists on extracting, you must be certain of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and they think it is in a healthy tooth, and causes the good tooth to be extracted; and yet the pain does not depart because of this, until the bad extraction, for we have already wanted to do this to those nobles;
And when you are quite certain of the aching tooth, you must cauterize around the tooth with a very strong cautery to protect the gums on all sides;
Then, use your fingers or fine pliers to carefully extract it bit by bit, until it is properly loosened, then firmly hold the pliers; And let the patient's head be in your sacred space between your knees, and hold it firmly so that it does not move.
After extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it does not easily come out, then take any of these instruments and gently put them in on each side, and move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is pierced and decayed, you must fill it with bandages where the holes are; and if you extract it gently with pliers, so that it does not break when pulling;
and it is necessary to work very skillfully around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And be very careful not to break it, and leave a piece, and return to the patient greater pain from the root than the first.
And beware that you do not do as the ignorant masters do, who through their haste and boldness sometimes break the jaw, and do not accomplish what we have recounted;
but sometimes cause great illness by the remaining roots, or by the jaw they break, as we have often seen;
And when the tooth is drawn, wash the place with wine or vinegar and salt;
and if bleeding occurs, which often happens, fill the place with ground vitriol;
and if that is not enough, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments, with which one first moves the teeth, should have long points and thick handles, so that they do not bend when you pull the tooth;
and these are the shapes: And they should have thick members so that they do not bend when pulling, and they should be made of good, strong iron, and be toothed to hold the teeth.
of the root of the teeth When the root stays in when pulling, you must place moistened cotton in butter for one or two days, until the area is softened, then put the pliers called "algefri" on it, which have a beak-like shape;
and be made like a file, and this is the shape:
And if the roots will not come out with these pliers, you must expose the flesh all around the root, and put the instrument called "althali", that is to say, a small pick, of which this is the shape:
And it should be strong and thick so as not to break, and if the root comes out with this, it is good;
If not, use all the instruments, whose shapes follow here:
And if one uses this instrument with two blades, of which this is the shape: and other tools that are shown in the reasoning of the teeth, and of this instrument which resembles large pliers, of which this is the shape:
And these instruments should be strong so they cannot break, and know that there are many instruments for teeth. and also other instruments, which are not counted;
and the skillful and subtle master finds his own instrument, according to his work and the illness reveals to him, for there are such illnesses where the ancients did not teach any instrument because of the diversity of others; and if one breaks the chariot or other bones, or where it might be, then he seeks the instruments that are necessary, that I have told you, and helps with the gestures, of which this is the shape:
And let them be thick and well-holding to hold the bone, so it does not escape, but can be held and removed;
and then restore the place with suitable medicines for that, and if there is decay in the bone, and it is small, then remove it with all this instrument:
When the tooth appears not according to the natural body, and the shape is ugly, and especially in young women, then you must know if the tooth is born after the tooth, and is not in the right place, and it cannot be filed or ground:
Then remove it. And if it is connected with the tooth, then take this instrument, whose shape is like a small beak, and is made of sharp, pointed iron:
And cut it little by little over several days due to the hardness of the tooth, and so that you do not move the others, and if it is apparent that it can be filed, then file it with a file of this shape:
and it is also like the file with which needles are made;
and file the tooth little by little over several days gently, so that it does not move too much as it breaks;
then the surface finally with a rasp, and if the tooth is too sharp and it hurts the tongue, it is necessary to file away the roughness until it is even, so that it does not hurt the tongue nor corrupt the speech.
When the front teeth become loose, whether from a blow or falling, and the patient cannot bite down on food without them falling out, and you have treated them with binding medicines, and this is of no avail;
then they must be held together with a gold thread, for silver thread turns green and rots, but gold never changes.
and let the thread be neither too thick nor too thin, according to the amount of space between the teeth;
and if you wish to straighten the teeth, take the thread and double it between the two sound teeth, then place the ends between the loose teeth, if there is one or more, until you wisely reach the next sound tooth on the other side; then repeat the covering until the part where you started, and gently and wisely tighten your hand, until it does not move at all;
and let your ligature be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the thread with pliers, and join them, and place them between the sound tooth, and place it so that it does not injure the tongue;
and then leave it as tight as it can stay, and if it loosens, or the thread breaks, tighten it with another thread;
if it stays, and will serve thus for its whole time, and this is the form of the teeth and the manner of straightening the two healthy teeth, and the two jaws, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, it is replaced in its place, fresh by fresh, as we have said;
and no one should meddle with it unless they are skilled and patient, and sometimes a tooth shape is made from cow bone, and it is placed in the place where the defect is, and it is tightened as we have said, and it remains and serves thus for a long time.
Sometimes this ligament grows beneath the tongue naturally, so that it is born thus; or by accident of a stitched wound;
and the work is such that you open the patient's mouth, and hold their head steady, and lift the tongue;
then cut the nervous ligament along, so that the tongue is freed from its attachment; and if there is hardness or knotting, and it is from a wound's healing, then use the hook and cut along that ligament;
and be careful that the cut is not too deep, because of the artery that is below;
and when you have done this, lift the place with rose water and vinegar, or cold water, then place a linen tent under the tongue;
and apply a poultice to the patient every night, so that the place cannot heal.
And if a discharge of blood comes, then place powdered vitriol on the place; and if the blood is abundant, cauterize it with a lentiginout cautery, which is good for that; then treat it with other remedies until it is healed,
and if you see a spot of a different color, or black or hard, so that the patient does not feel it, do not touch it, for it is a cancer;
and if it is declining to a whiteness, and there is moisture, one should insert the lancet, and split it with a subtle spatula, and free it from one side and the other; and if the blood is abundant during your work, place powdered vitriol on it until it is stopped, then return to your work until you have removed all of the fluid;
then lift the place with ease and with care, and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
of abscesses of the throat Sometimes there appear in the throat boils which are called "godath," and these are properly called the two almonds.  And when you treat them, as we have said in the division, if they are not healed, be careful:
if it is a hard abscess of small size and dark color, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is large, do not touch it with iron, also for the draining of blood; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will lance it, or it will burst by itself;
and if it is of a whitish color, and the root is subtle, prepare the instrument for cutting, but first observe if the abscess is warm and calm.
Then make the patient sit in front of the sun, and his head be in your hand, and open the mouth and take the tongue between the hands, and press the tongue underneath the whole instrument, of which this is the shape;
and it should be of silver or thin bronze, just like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument and you see the abscess, take the forceps and insert it into the lump, and pull strongly upwards as much as you can;
and pull out any threads with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which this is the form, resembling a pair of shears; and nevertheless, the ends are bent, and one against the other, and are very sharp, and are made of hardened iron or steel:
And if you do not have this instrument available, cut it with pliers, of which this is the form: and be sharp on one side and blunt on the other;
and when you have cut one of the almonds, cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision, have the patient gargle with hot, sharp, and easy-flowing water, and if bleeding occurs, have the patient gargle with water, or with the rind of cooked pomegranates, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the bleeding is stopped; then treat it until it is healed;
and sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat besides the two almonds, so cut them in the same way as the two almonds likewise.
And I treated a woman with an abscess that had formed in her throat, namely a small abscess;
and it had almost completely closed off her throat, so that the woman could not breathe because the passage was blocked, and could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she had remained like that for a day or two.
And the abscess had swollen so much that it had pushed the two nostrils outward through the two openings of the nose.
I immediately hastened, and inserted a lancet into one, then pulled it out forcefully, and extracted a large portion of pus;
then I did the same in the other nostril opening, and opened her mouth and pressed on her tongue;
then I inserted the lancet into the abscesses, and cut away a portion of it, and only a little blood came out; and thus the woman's throat passage was cleared, and she now began to drink water and then wine, and I did not cease to cut into the abscess for a long time;
and the abscess kept growing again, and filled the space I had emptied, until it became very large;
Then I cauterized it inside the throat; Thus it remained without growing;
and I left those parts, and do not know what God did to her after me.
of the eye
When phlegm descends to the eye, and it is swollen and lengthened, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is beneath large and round, it is called "eye".
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the inflamed abscess is calmed, and it is subtle, then you must cut it.
and the one that is round, assembled, and not long; and if it is bloody or of a dusky color or black, then you should avoid the incision of it. For there is great danger to the patient.
Therefore, when you see it, according to the manner that I have described, its whiteness and length, you must have the patient sit in front of the sun, and press the tongue with the instrument of which we have previously made mention; then insert the hook into the uvula, and pull it down, and cut it with one of the two instruments I spoke of in the incision of the two almonds.
And you should not cut more than the excess that is beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, it hurts the voice and the speech;
and after the incision, use what we said about the incision of the two almonds, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient is afraid of the cutting, then you should use a method for cauterizing the fear sensation.
And the manner of the cautery is sharp, sharp. And have the patient place their head in your hand, and then press the tongue against the instrument that we discussed in the cautery chapter, and cauterize with a hot, sharp iron, so that it is neither too thick nor too thin; and fill the end of this instrument, whose shape is:
And have at its head a hollow where medicine is placed, like the bowl of a spoon, and place the instrument with all the medicine on the wound;
and let the patient lie on their side, so that the saliva and mucus run from their mouth into the medicine inside, so that it does not go down into the throat, and wound it;
then hold your hand over all the medicine and press it on the wound, for the amount of half an hour, until you see it heal and the burning of the medicine is calmed;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around some instrument, and moisten the cotton in the medicine, and put the instrument with all the cotton on the wound, until the cotton dries on the wound;
and do this often, until the cautery is perfect, then leave it to dry, and it will fall off after four or five days.
And if you need to reapply the cautery of the medicine, reapply it, and after the cautery wipe around the wound with cotton dipped in butter, and clean what is around the medicine;
and be washed with cold water, and be treated with gargles until it is healed.
This treatment is safer than the incision, rather than the cautery;
if it is treated by fumigation in this manner, take calamint and hyssop and oregano and rue and chamomile and yarrow and similar herbs, and put them all or some of them in a pot, and put water in it, and boil;
and the pot should be well sealed with strong clay, and inside the pot there should be a device shaped in this manner: And it should be of silver or brass, and let one of the ends be put into the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the eye through the channel, until the eye is deadened;
after that, repeat often, until the eye dries, and be careful not to do this at the beginning of the arrival of a hot abscess, for many things happen; and do not do this treatment except at the decline of a hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not present, then take a tube and put a piece of eggshell inside, so that the mouth of the patient is not too hot; for the eggshell does not allow the vapor to burn the mouth, and this is a good cure and salvation together.
Many times a bone or fish spine, or any thing, gets stuck in the throat;
If so, you must pull out what you can see, and press the tongue towards the sun with the whole instrument, so that you may see the thing move;
and what you do not see, and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is cooked in the stomach; perhaps the lodged thing will come out with the vomiting;
or if the patient swallows a piece of sponge, or a piece of navel, or a lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; and ties a thread to the sponge, and then swallows it; and when it reaches its place, it will stick, and then pull it out;
and if it does not come out by what we have said, then take an instrument of lead according to this form:
And let the instrument be curved at the head so that it can more easily enter the throat, and have the head lifted high; and be careful that you do not touch the epiglottis, so that the whole thing does not come, nor push the bone inside;
and it is better that the patient push the instrument, so that it may be known where the thing is stuck; if it pushes down, or he pulls it out with the entire instrument equally, until it is out.
of the leech from the throat
Sometimes the leech is medicated, as I have said in the division, by the cure of medicines; and when this does not help, then look into the throat of the patient in the sun, and then press the tongue with the instrument I have told you.
And if you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook, or with small pliers that are suitable for this.
And if that does not work, take a heated iron chain, and place it in the throat of the patient, then place the heated end of the chain on the chain's link, and do this often. And if the patient is feverish every day.
Then take a full glass of cold water, open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it around with his hand often; and as soon as the leech senses the water, it falls off.
And if it does not fall off as we have said, then fumigate the patient with asafoetida, using the instrument I mentioned in the fumigation of the eye;
Do this many times, for it will fall off without delay.
And the manner of fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are burning coals, and the bottom is covered with a lid pierced in the middle, and through that hole is the head of the instrument;
then put your fumigation into it, and the patient puts the head of the reed into their mouth, and closes their mouth so that the smoke does not escape, but goes down to the leech;
and the leech will now fall off, and if it does not fall off, then recommence the fumigation many times;
and let the patient endure thirst, and eat salty and dry things, and drink no water;
and then it will be necessary for it to come out forcefully through this treatment.
And the shape of the instrument with which the leech is drawn out, is, when it can be seen, like curved tongs, to make entry into the throat; and it should resemble the beak of a bird, and have a rough, rasping quality, so that what it takes, it cannot leave;
Many types of abscesses exist, according to what is remembered here from one and another in this book, and they differ in puncturing and cutting;
and it is in two ways, one of which is in its own appearance, and from what it holds of moisture.
And the second way is due to the places where they are in the body.
For abscesses of the head are different from those of the foundation, and abscesses of fleshy areas differ from those that develop in joints, and each has its own treatment.
And there are abscesses that should not be pierced until the boil is ripe according to its completion;
And there are some that must be pierced when they are swollen, and do not ripen according to their completion, such as abscesses near joints.
For when an abscess comes near the joints, and one lets it fester until it rots around, the ligaments and nerves of the joint may be corrupted, which causes contraction in that limb.
Or if the abscess is near the main limb, and you delay the perforation until it is ripe, it will harm the main limb;
or if it is near the foundation, one pierces it sooner than it is ripe;
and you should not pierce a swollen abscess without complete digestion, except for those near the foundation, lest it rot deeply, become elongated within, and cause a fistula. and may not heal in a long time.
And you must know the time to pierce a ripe abscess according to its completion, and that is when the pain subsides, and the fever departs, and the lessening of the pain and redness, and the diminishing and sharpening of the abscess head, and the other signs;
and you should make the perforation sit in the most dependent place of the abscess, and where it appears to move;
and let the perforation be along the body's length, and if the abscess is in the hands or feet, or in joints and nerves and arteries, and in all places equal where there is no fold. In those that fold, according to that limb.
And when the abscess is in a fleshy place, it is better that you leave the perforation until it is confirmed in complete digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the body of the venom from it will be lengthened, and it is full of much filth. and perhaps the lips and the depth of it harden.
And if there is any abscess that is pierced according to the width of the body, according to what the limb needs.
And you should make small abscesses, small openings; and in large abscesses, large openings, and many fissures according to the likeness of the abscess's size;
and if there are such abscesses where it is necessary to pierce the core and cut; when it has become as if a small flag, and is withered, then you should do as one does with boils:
and some are split into three angles, and some are cut like myrtle leaves, like abscesses of the groin;
and some where a round incision is made, and other incisions and similar cuts.
Those that do not have a head, like a superficial, soft abscess, it is necessary that you pierce them thoroughly;
and it is necessary when the abscess is large, and it has gathered much pus, and you pierce it, do not draw all the pus at once, but draw a part of it; then plug the abscess until the next day, then draw out some more pus again; do this many times, little by little, until all the pus comes out;
especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a woman carrying, or small children, or old decrepit men. For the spirit sometimes leaps with the discharge of pus, so that perhaps the patient dies, and you do not realize it.
Therefore, avoid this chapter with great caution, and when you have pierced your abscess, dry the wound, and see if the wound of the abscess is small; and if it is a full-sized wound, then apply linen or old cotton dressings; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings, then you must put a dressing into each one so that they meet each other;
and if you have cut a piece of skin in the abscess, and have trimmed it around, then you must fill it with old cotton or linen rags without moisture, and bind it until the third day;
then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if a flow of blood occurs in your work, then apply cold water and ease it, and soak a cloth, and repeatedly place it over the bleeding area.
And if the bleeding persists, apply management and treatment, and the powders that I have mentioned in their proper places in this book.  And if it is wintertime, and the area where the abscess is is very sensitive, then you must place dressings and cloths soaked in warm wine and oil over it.
And if it is summertime, and the area is fleshy, then you must put over it cloths soaked in water and oil, or in cold wine and oil, until the third day, as we have said.
and then drain the abscess, and dry it and treat it, as is appropriate, until it is healed.
And this should be universally known in treatments for abscesses:
or I have told you how one should proceed in treating abscesses, and here is the chapter.
Where the top of the head has small abscesses, and there are many kinds of them, that are like the egg of a hen, and there are many similar ones.
There are some that are fatty, and others where there is moisture like pus;
and there are some which are hard and stony to cut, and there is no doubt if the artery does not oppose it.
And the work of the cutting is that you try with every instrument which is called an "entromissoire," of which the form comes afterwards, what thing it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then cut it along its length.
And when the moisture is emptied, then remove the skin without leaving anything which contained that moisture, for it returns often when one leaves something behind;
then dip cotton into Egyptian ointment, if it is present; if not, in water and salt, and apply it to the wound, and leave it until the next day; and that which has remained overnight will run.
And then repeat the cotton, as before, on the second day, and the third, until you know well that it does not remain overnight;
then treat the wound with ointment suitable for it, until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fat, cut it along this form, lengthwise; and apply your lancets, and scrape it from all sides, and apply all your treatment to draw the pus from the area where it lies;
and if the artery resists you, do what I have told you after.
And also do the same with the abscess if it is hard, and with cutting and healing, as I told you.
And cut on the hard and moist abscess, it is easier, for they are of little blood. And if some of these abscesses are on the head where there is no moisture, and of those abscesses that I cut on the head of an old woman;
and I found the abscess as hard as a rough, harsh, white stone, and it could not be broken; and if one had struck any of them, one would have done as much harm as with a stone.
In other abscesses coming to the head, except those which come to the heads of children and to the roots of the ears, the opening should always be in the most dependent place, to cause the pus to come out.
and treat them as is appropriate.
Often these abscesses appear on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes come elsewhere on the body, and are numerous, and are joined together.
And each scrofulous swelling is properly within its own area, just as a boil and an abscess of the head, as we have said; and the appearances of these scrofulas are many.
and the appearances of these scrofulas are many. There are some that contain moisture, and some that are malignant and refuse to obey health.
in those, then, that you see of good disposition when touched, and are the color of the body, and soft on all sides, and are not close to the nerves of the neck, nor the artery, nor the channel, and are not deep;
if it is necessary, you must cut it from above, and scrape each part, and spread the two flaps of the core with forceps, if you need them, as we have said of abscesses of the head;
and draw it out little by little, and be sure that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and that the spatula is not sharp or cutting, lest the hand slip, and go too far, so that you do not cut something that you should not.
And if you cut the vein or artery, and this prevents you from working, then put powdered vitriol, or other powders that stop blood, into the wound, and tighten the wound. and leave it until the abscess is calmed, and the wound is softened, and begins to rot.
And when the blood is stopped, then return to your work, until you complete it;
Then examine your index finger to see if any small scabs remain, and cut and clean them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scab, then you should not cut the scab at its root, but tie a strong double thread to it and let it fall away from it without harming it.
Then fill the wound with old cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
And if you cut the entire scab, you must bring together the two edges of the wound and stitch them now, since there is no excess remaining due to the size of the scab. Then you must aim to cut the root of it, and pull it out, and stitch it as we have said.
Then you must aim to cut the root of it, and pull it out, and stitch it as we have said. Those scabs that hold excess, pierce it where it appears ripe.
and pierce it thus, like the one previously mentioned, depending on it, then apply poultices with ointment and similar things, so that it corrupts what remains of the corruption. And when the wound is well cleansed, treat it with ointment that encourages flesh growth, until it is healed.
The ancients said and spoke of the incision of the throat; But I never saw anyone in our land who performed it, and this is the record of their words.
For those with quincy, it is necessary that the incision in the throat, called "epiglottis," be drained; and one should not provide aid through them, because all the veins and the body of the ill person are affected by the abscess being hot in the mouth, or in the throat, or in the two tonsils.
When the illness is in the channel of the lung, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the destruction that comes from strangulation.
Therefore, when we wish to cut the epiglottis, we should cut it below three or four small, transverse slits, between the two circles or with the amount of a slit on the surface, not in the cartilage;
and those places are suitable for the cutting of the epiglottis because there is no flesh there, and the vessels are far apart.
And if the master is afraid, he should stretch the skin of the throat throughout the entire area, then cut through the skin until he reaches the channel; and clear the blood vessels, if you see anything, and then cut the surface, as we have said;
and it is demonstrated by the cutting of the phlegm from the channel which jumps out through the broken place, and by the loss of voice;
and leave the wound open for a while.
And when the time has passed for which strangulation is feared, bring together the two edges of the wound in the skin, and stitch it entirely without the cartilage;
then administer medicines which cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Albucasim says that one should not do this until the throat is completely obstructed, and the patient is judged to be dying, and breathing fails. Then one cuts the epiglottis so that the patient cannot breathe, and breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death;
and for this the ancients commanded leaving the wound open until the malice of the illness has passed, and it passes in three or four days. And then they commanded to stitch up the wound and cure it, until it was healed;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw that a lady took a knife and stuck it into her throat, and cut part of the channels of the windpipe;
and I was called to treat her, and found her as if dead.
I uncovered the wound and found the blood that had flowed from it, and I saw clearly that she had not cut any vein or conduit except the throat, and the breath was escaping through the wound.
I hastened and stitched the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and nothing happened to the lady except that her voice became hoarse, and afterward she returned to her condition;
Therefore, I say that in the cutting of the epiglottis there is no need for fear.
This abscess is called "throat hernia," and is a large abscess the color of a yellow gemstone, and is very common in women;
and is in two ways: natural, and accidental;
where the natural has no device.
And the accidental is in two ways, of which one is like fat in us, and the other way is like an abscess that comes from a vein in us; and if there is fear, and one must not operate with strong force except in the small one, and try and examine the entire inside: if you find it like a lump of fat, and it is not connected to any vein, then cut it, like one cuts lumps, and remove all its covering, if there is any. and carefully examine everything, and treat it as necessary, until it is perfectly healed.
There are many kinds of lumps, of which I will describe all the appearances;
and here it is necessary that I state the whole difference that exists between a lump and a wound.
I say that a wound is hot and feverish, as long as the boiling has passed, and the putrefaction is complete; Then the fever and heat cease.
With a lump, there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains a cyst, which is its own sac and is according to the color of the body, and it begins like a blister, and grows larger;
and they are according to two appearances, either greasy or moist, and many of their colors are as I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to the treatment of the lump, that you first examine and inquire into all the instruments called "entromissoirs," according to what their form will be in the chapter that follows.
And the manner of inquiring into abscesses of lumps is that you take the moistest spot you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, then according to the size of the abscess;
then remove the instrument, and be careful of what jumps out.
If moisture runs, whatever color it may have, let it flow out as I have said of the other abscesses;
and if, after the instrument, no moisture comes, know that it is greasy, then let it flow out in a cross, and take it with forceps, and lightly scrape it from each side, and guard the skin where it lies so that you pull it out healthy along with the lump;
and if you cannot pull it out whole, then pull it out in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the lump returns many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood bothers you, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, and bind the wound, and place soothing things on the hot abscess, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed;
and if the lump is large, then sew the two edges of the wound, and treat it with what generates flesh.
and if the throbbing vein is contrary or otherwise, then hurry and fill the place with crushed vitriol, and leave it there for two or three days, until the wound is rotten, and the boiling of blood rests; then return to cauterize what has remained of the wound.
See here the shapes of the intruding instruments, and they are of three kinds: large and medium and small;
and of them there are three squares that are called "albaret", and one that is called "breb", and of them there are three kinds: large, medium, and small, for searching out abscesses of fistula;
and they are also like the needles with which one sews the sores, and they are of yellow brass, or of iron, or of silver, and those that are yellow are more effective, and are more tested with black lead for searching out the corruptions of fistula;
and are of three kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the amount of the width of the openings.
The shapes of the probes are of many similarities, as you see here:
and there are probes that have two curves of three kinds also;
and there are probes that have three curves, and are also of three kinds;
and there are probes that have two curves, and probes of one curve only, and are of three kinds;
and all of these are necessary in their place.
The head of these, which one cuts, is sharp, and of such there are some which cut not much on one side only, so one scrapes the skin, in order that one does not cut the vein nor the nerve;
and among these instruments are lancets fitted into handles, so that the patient does not feel them during the opening of abscesses;
and are of three kinds: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and one uses them only on fleshy areas, such as legs, and arms, and breasts, and hooves, and similar places;
and sometimes one makes another small instrument, resembling a nut-shell, according to this shape, with which one stops blood: and one puts it sometimes to the place which bleeds from cutting of veins, and arteries, and sometimes according to this large shape:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to be corrupted, so that they resemble women's breasts;
and they remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wants to cure them, it is necessary to do so according to this shape from this line .b. up to .g.: then scrape off the fat, and fill the wound with a healing medicine, then stitch together the two edges of the wound, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast inclines downwards, and is softened due to its size, as happens with women, then split it into two sides above, by two similar clefts; so that one is held to the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller one according to this shape, from this line .b. up to the line .g.; then scrape off the skin between the two edges, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about stitching and powders, and whatever is necessary in the treatment, until they are healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not fully made, because the patient does not want to rest, or due to the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remaining tissue and fat, then treat it until it is healed.
These abscesses that come from under the armpits are types of hard scrofulas, where there are lumps, and some contain moisture.
Those which contain moisture should be cut according to this shape, from line .b. to line .g.: And when all the pus in the abscess is drained, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with suitable ointment until healed.
And if the abscess is like scrofulas, cut it as we have said for cutting scrofulas, and if the wound returns pus, apply cautery as we have said before.
When the artery is ruptured, and the skin is sealed over it, there often follows an abscess, and the same happens to the swollen vein and abscess;
and if one recognizes it as being due to the artery, the abscess is long and deep; and when you feel it with your fingers, you feel it is constricted;
and when it is due to the vein, there are obvious swelling spots;
and it is foolish to cut this abscess, especially when it is beneath the armpits and the ankles and in the neck and many other places, and it is very large. Therefore, one should avoid iron treatment, and the one who is at the head should avoid it too, and in the one who has a swollen artery, pierce above the skin lengthwise;
then open the incision with lancets, and nicely separate the artery from the tissues, until it is uncovered;
then place a needle underneath it, and make it pierce to the other side, and tighten the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples;
then prick the place between the two ties with a probe until the blood that is there comes out, and let the abscess be drained;
then administer the treatment that causes swelling, until the tie falls; then treat it with a suitable ointment, until it is healed;
and if the abscess is caused by a vein incision, you must hold the part of the abscess that is on the skin, then put the needle under the part you are holding, and pierce it, and have a double thread there, so you pull it from the other side; then tie the abscess, as I have told you, or tie the thread to the two ends of the thread;
and if you doubt that the thread will not hold, you put another needle through the whole thread under the whole abscess, at the incision of the first needle, and tighten the threads in four places;
then cut the abscess until the excess comes out, then cut the excess from the heart and leave what is tied;
then put a damp cloth in wine and oil, then administer cures of poultices and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses come to the artery and vein, abscesses come to the nerves when they are struck, or by excessive labor, and similar things.
And this happens more often to the shoulders and fingers and in all places where there are joints, and it is a grievous abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and is in various conditions without pain;
and when it is squeezed tightly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep in the body, but beneath the skin;
and it moves well in all directions, and does not go forward or backward, nor under or over, and that which is in the joints should not be cut with an iron; perhaps contraction would follow; and that which is on the head or forehead, pierce the skin with a spatula.
and that which is on the head or forehead, pierce the skin with a spatula. If the abscess is small, hold it with tongs and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, suspend it with a hook, and scrape it, then remove it and stitch the wound together and treat it until it is healed.
Sometimes it occurs in the belly and nowhere else, a disease called "fungus" because of its appearance, and its roots are subtle, and its head large;
and there are small and very large ones;
and I saw a man who had two in his belly that were more like fungi than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white and had fine roots and were cracked, and moisture often flowed from them.
I cut them and found eighteen ounces in one, and six in the other, and the work in the incision is such that you look to see if the patient is moist, and the color of the lump is white and moist and with subtle roots; if you cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery in your presence.
if you cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery in your presence. For in cutting, there often comes too great a discharge of blood, and if the blood overcomes you, then hasten to cauterize;
and if you see the patient frightened and afraid of the incision with the iron, then take a well-made lead thread and bind the lump as we have said, and leave it for two days;
and then restrain it, and do not cease to tighten the lead thread until it cuts the lump and it comes away without effort;
and if the roots are large, there is fear of cutting even into the belly, but you may well cut the half, then cauterize it so that it does not return;
then treat the wound, and be careful not to cut the tubercle that is of fixed color and poor sense and milky appearance.
For it is an encrusted abscess, and I will come to the treatment of chancre later.
when the abscess is ripe If the appearance of the abscess comes from a wound cautery or a surface fissure, and is on the belly, and some of the pus comes out, as happens in other ruptures, or from blood flowing from veins or arteries, according to what is stated before, or from flatulence;
and if it is through the rupture of the surface and the release of pus, the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body, and is a slight thing without pain, and appears with diverse discharge. And if it is due to the discharge from the intestines, then it is more diverse, and when one presses it with their fingers, it will bulge and then return, and perhaps it is hard, and grows considerably at the entrance of the bath and through hard work.
And if it is due to moisture, it is a slight thing, and appears clearly when you press it with your hand, and it does not constrict at all;
and if it is due to blood, the abscess appears large and hard, with these signs, and is fixed according to a certain quantity; and if it is due to wind, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you look to see if the appearance is due to blood from an artery, or a vein, or wind.
and if it is due to wind, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you look to see if the appearance is due to blood from an artery, or a vein, or wind. Then you should leave the treatment. For there is doubt and fear, as I told you in the chapter on abscesses, because of the artery and because of the vein.
And if the appearance is due to the intestine or the belly, then you must instruct the patient to hold their breath, and be stretched out straight, then draw a sign all around the belly; then tell him to lie often between your hands, then go around the area you have marked with the entire spatula, then extend half of the abscess above the entire large incision; then tie it around with a strong thread, or a strong silk cord tightly, and let the wound be free from the ligature;
then open the extended half of the abscess over the ligature, and put your index finger in it, and look for the intestine; if you find it caught by the ligature, then untie it, and put the intestine outside the belly;
and if you find the bowel, then grasp it with the incision, and cut off the excess;
and if the artery or vein opposes you, then go gently around, then return to your work and take two needles, and put two strong threads in them, and put the two needles around what you have done in a cross so that you pierce;
then constrict the abscess in four places over the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until it rots, and the dead flesh will fall away on its own; or cut it when it is softened and rotten, then treat it with what is necessary, and finish the abscess as we have said;
or cut it when it is softened and rotten, then treat it with what is necessary, and finish the abscess as we have said; and draw out the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the place with what is necessary, and close the place.
of a chancre We have discussed in the division the types of chancre, and how one should work on them with medicines, and how one should avoid using iron treatment;
and we say that chancre arises in the flesh, and there is great care in its treatment, and the ancients said that when chancres are in a place where it can be scraped away, like chancres in the breasts, and in the thigh, and in similar places, and it should be completely removed when it is in its beginning;
no one has ever healed one before me.
And the treatment, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you purge the patient of black bile sometimes;
then make him bleed if he has a noticeable fullness, then prepare the patient in a good place to perform the treatment;
then discard your lancets or cauteries, and the dressings from all sides, and remove it from all sides without leaving anything;
and let the blood flow freely, and wipe the area well with your hand or something else, and if the bleeding makes the incision on the artery or vein worse, cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped; then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
of dropsy We have already discussed the different types of dropsy, how the accumulation of water occurs, the signs of each type, and the treatments using both medicines and iron:
and one should not use iron in these two types: that is to say, tympanites and yposarche, for it is a deadly thing;
Therefore, when you treat this type of dropsy called "eclytes" with medicine, and the treatment is ineffective, then examine if the patient is weak, or if they have another illness besides dropsy, such as diarrhea and similar conditions; If not, do not use iron, for there is doubt.
And if you see a patient with strong constitution, and they have only dropsy as an illness, and they are neither too young nor too old, then you should proceed thus: Raise the patient upright in your hands, and press the abdomen by pushing the water to the lowest part of the chest, then take the spatumile espinous according to this form: And let it be sharp on two sides. Pointed, yet not so sharp that it can reach the intestines when inserted, and cannot injure them;
Then observe whether the dropsy is located towards the intestines: If so, you must cut open above the pouch three straight cuts below the point of the knife; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, your cut should be on the left side of the pouch, three cuts;
and if it's due to the spleen, it should be on the right, and it's not right for the patient to lie on the incision, so that the superfluities don't flow to that weak spot;
Then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and remove it, and lift your hand through all the space between the skin and the surface, as if skinning, to the amount of a fingernail or the like;
Then pierce the surface until the space reaches the empty place, and that is the place of the water, then pull it out forcefully, and insert this instrument of which this is the shape: And it is similar to a thin silver chain, and is of bronze or light bronze, and has a small hole in the lower part; and on one side, three holes; and two on the other side, and one on the other;
and the head is shaped like a feather, and this is the shape of the incision with which the scribe cuts the feather:
at the top of the head is the handle, so that when the instrument comes to the water, it immediately sinks onto the instrument;
empty then half or a third of it, for if you empty more than is necessary at that time, perhaps the patient will die because of the resolution of his spirit from the weapon, or he will fall unconscious, or he will approach death;
but empty according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the disposition of the patient's virtue and his pulse signify;
then withdraw the instrument and retain the water, and it is now retained because of the heart that seals the hole that is on the surface, which I spoke of, that you pierce in this manner;
then restart the instrument another day, if you see the patient suffering this, and draw a small quantity of water;
do this for some days, and be careful not to overdo it until there remains only a little water.
And if you doubt about the patient, and leave too much water, then treat him with a hot burial or sand, and by profuse sweating or baths and sun, and let him drink. and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed, and cauterize on the stomach and on the liver and on the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I said before.
Sometimes children are born who have no opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its proper place.
If it is necessary, pierce it immediately with a very fine needle according to this shape:
then place a thin lead plug in the opening, and bind it and keep it in place for three or four days.  When he wishes to urinate, remove the plug, let him urinate, and then replace it;
and perhaps it is not necessary, for the urine that comes out will not allow the opening to remain closed.
Those whose opening is small are treated with a lead plug, as we have said, and it will widen.
Those who do not have the opening in their proper place are injured, because some are born with the opening at the head of the penis, so they cannot urinate until they raise their penis; and they cannot ejaculate because the matter cannot reach the outlet, and that is a serious illness.
And the method of treatment is that the patient lies often on their back, then stretches the head of the penis and cuts it like the shaft of a feather, so that the opening falls into the middle, as is necessary;
and beware of bleeding that often occurs, and if it happens, staunch it with what stanches blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the blisters on the penis Many times these ulcers appear on the penis, and it is an unsightly appearance of flesh;
and some are malignant and some are not;
so you must take them with a fine lancet, and cut and scrape them all, then put moistened cotton on Egyptian ointment; then treat it with Diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the ulcer is malignant, with foul color and odor, you must apply cautery.
When you have cut it, and if the ulcer is on the shaft, and part of it is inside the skin and part outside, then you must remove the ulcer that is inside first; and when it is healed, treat the outside.
For when you treat it together, the shaft of the member is not secure from being pierced, and blackness and corruption occur in its shaft and in the testicles;
You must remove all that is black and corrupt, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from pomegranate bark and poppy seeds, and then treat it with further remedies until it is healed.
And if a discharge of blood occurs, administer the lunar cautery according to this method:
The cauteries help with two conditions together: that is to say, to the discharge of blood, and to the corruption;
And if the head of the penis is corrupt and retracted, you must place a lead pipe in the channel of the penis, and the patient must urinate through it;
And when the skin on the head of the penis, which occurs in those who have not been circumcised, or it occurs due to a wound or abscess, then you must burn it with a pointed instrument, until the ligament is broken, and the head of the penis is freed from all sides;
And if it is a serious matter to discuss this, you must burn it with a cautery iron, a bit of the head of the penis and skin;
Then separate gently between the two, and put a thin soaked linen cloth on it, so that it does not burn again.
Circumcision is not simply the breaking of a connection like other wounds; However, when we perform this work of our own volition, and properly on children, it is necessary that we do the best work, and the least harmful to health.
I say that the ancients did not practice circumcision of their children, for they did not use it in their law, and we have only what we have acquired through experience.
For I have seen the majority of masters and surgeons who performed circumcision using a knife, or by force, or a very sharp blade;
If the blade slipped, because there are two layers, and perhaps one is cut through and the other remains. Or it must be cut again, and the pain is doubled, and the cleansing of the foreskin is not certain to have healed the end of the member;
and in the cleansing of the nail perhaps the iron slips, and the work is damaged, and many times they are born in such a way that they do not need cleansing, and I have seen it.
Of the cleansing done by force, throughout the entire thread, I have found the goodness of the experiment, because force cuts equally well from above and below.
For when you press your hand, it cuts equally in one single moment; but let the thread be tightly wound around the skin;
and let the manner of the first work be such that you make the child, if he understands, think that you are only tying the thread around the stick, and you can then make him happy in all the ways you can;
then hold it straight between your hands, and place the forces between your hands or under your feet so that the child does not see them, nor any of the instruments;
then place your hand on the stick and blow into the heart, and pull it upwards until the head of the stick is inside; then clean it well of the dirt that has collected there, then tie the marked spot with a double thread, then tie it under one knot to the other knot;
then clean it well of the dirt that has collected there, then tie the marked spot with a double thread, then tie it under one knot to the other knot; and hold it with your two fingers by the second knot, with the thumb and forefinger, and cut between the two knots, then quickly lift the heart and pull the head of the stick; then let the blood run drop by drop, for that is the remedy; and put powder over it, and over the powder a layer of glue made of a boiled egg mixed with rosewater, cooked with good and fresh rose oil, and leave it there until the next day, and treat it with further remedies until it is healed.
The form of the forces for the cleansing is this:
the two heads should be taut and sharp, and the heads should be as large as the handle, equally.
The error of the cleansing occurs when the heart is inside at the incision.
Then you must extend it to your fingernail, lest the place become an abscess.
and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it to your fingernail, then hold it with pliers and then cut it.
And if it passes three days, and that which is under the rod is swollen, let it be until the hot abscess has calmed, and lightly scrape it.
Cut it as much as you can, and be careful of the part of the rod, it will not harm it at all.
Then treat the area with things like powders for wounds, as we have said in treating powders, and if you cut too deeply into the heart, and it rises above, it will not hurt.
Then cure it, as we have said, until it is healed.
Regarding the retention of urine
The retention of urine is due to a blockage by stones, or congealed blood, or by mucus, or by dead flesh, or similar things, as we have said in the division.
And if the urine is not released, and you see the retention is due to a stone lodged in the bladder's neck or opening, then the patient should be bent over their knees. and their feet should be placed on their back, and they should extend their belly from the area above the back, and the patient should tighten their abdomen as much as possible. And then the bladder neck is forced to express the stone above, so that the urine is released.
And if it does not come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you should administer extraction using the instrument called "syringe," of which this is the form:
and it should be made of fine, light silver, like the feather of a bird. and its length should be one and a half palms, and it should be slender at the head.
And the method of releasing the urine is that you take a double thread, and tie a small piece of wool or cotton to the end, and put the end of the thread inside the syringe;
and cut the excess wool and push it to the tip of the syringe, then lubricate the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and have the patient sit on a seat, and lubricate the bladder and penis with moist oil and olive oil and warm water;
then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the root of the penis, then pull the penis upwards towards the groin;
then push the syringe forward until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it reaching the empty space, and this is not done according to this order frequently, because the channel it goes through is twisted;
then pull the thread with all the wool little by little, and the urine follows the wool, then pull it out quickly, and make the urine flow;
and repeat the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
When sores or blood come to the bladder, or corruption is gathered there, and you wish to distill acids and medicines, do it with the whole instrument called "clepsydre", and this is the form:
It is closed, and has three holes: Two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the lead-lined channels through which the medicine flows should be such that they tightly seal the penis without addition, so that one can draw out the moisture, and inject when necessary;
and when you wish to inject your medicines into the bladder, put the tip of the applicator into the moisture, and pull that which is inside;
so you will draw the moisture into the applicator, and then forcefully push the medicine inside; Then the medicine will enter inside, and go to the bladder at once, so that the patient will feel it;
and that is the form of the subtle clyster with which one clysters the bladder:
And it is of silver or of bone, and the tip is higher;
and underneath is a bag or pouch where the liquid falls;
Then take a sheep's bladder and put the liquid with which you wish to clyster the bladder into it, then tie it between the two breasts with a well-made double thread, and heat the liquid slightly over the fire;
then insert the tip of the clyster into the tube, then press your hand on the bladder until all the liquid has entered, so long as the patient feels that the liquid has fully entered the bladder;
and if you do not have a bladder, take a piece of parchment and make a circle, and pierce it roundly in the middle; then put a strong thread into these holes, then assemble the circle just as one assembles a shield, and put inside it what you want of oil and liquid and water, and tie it to the instrument;
and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the liquid goes into the bladder.
of the stone
We have already discussed in the division the types of stone, and the extraction together with medicines;
and have described the difference between the stone lodged in the kidneys, and all the signs, and in what stone one should operate with a knife; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you openly and briefly.
I say that the stone lodged in the bladder occurs more often in children, and this is a sign that the urine leaks from the bladder, similar to water in its subtlety;
and there appears sand, and the patient scratches his penis, and it hangs down many times, and then hardens; and much of this leakage weakens the foundation;
and the cure is easy in children until they are four years old, and is very difficult in the elderly, and is moderate in those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those who have large stones than for those who have small ones.
And when we come to the treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient with an enema, to remove all the filth that is in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders the search for the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and push and move him downward, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes rises from its higher position;
then make him sit between your prepared hands, and his hands should be under his thighs, so that the bladder is entirely inclined downward;
then search for and touch it inside;
if you feel the stone in the space, then hurry now to cut into the stone.
And if it does not fall out upon touching entirely, then moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger if the patient is a grown young man; and put it in its base, and search for the stone, and when you feel it on your finger, bring it up to the neck of the bladder;
then press on your finger, and put it outside in the place where you wish to cut.
And instruct the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and instruct him to stretch his right hand upwards on the nipples, and with his left hand remove the skin underneath the nipples in the area where the incision is to be made;
then put the spatulum, the shape of which is this: And cut between what is between the nipples and the fundament, not in the middle, but on the side of the left groin;
and be straight above the stone, and your fingers be often on the fundament, and let the cut be in a way such that it is wide outside and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
perhaps the pressure on the finger that is on the fundament will cause it to jump out without difficulty;
and know that there are stones where there are angles and edges: so it is difficult to remove;
and there are some that are smooth, resembling a ball, and round, from which the removal is easy.
For those with angles and edges, make the incision larger;
and if it does not budge, you must use pliers that are like a file at the head, to tightly grasp the stone so it does not slip away; or you insert beneath it a slender, curved instrument at the head;
and if you cannot grasp it thus, widen the hole a little, and if the blood is profuse, constrict it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, first place the largest one in the neck of the bladder, then cut above, then pull it out, and the smaller ones afterwards if there are more.
And if it is very large, it must be made smaller, and a larger wound made. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or urine comes out continually because the wound cannot close;
but nevertheless, try to pull it out, or break it with pincers, until you pull it out in pieces;
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with frankincense, aloe, and dragon's blood, and bind it, and put over it a cloth moistened in oil and wine, or oil and rose water and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess; then bind the patient's neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
And when you loosen it, thoroughly wash the area with oil and water, then treat it with diachylon ointment and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses appear in the wound, and corrosion, and blood clots in the bladder, and the urine is retained, which is recognized in such a manner that it comes out without force with the urine: Then put your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains, it will rot the bladder and cause it to corrupt;
then cleanse the wound with water, vinegar, and salt, and help him in every way that you know, until he is healed;
and it is necessary that every time you treat him, you bind his two thighs together, and gather the medicines around the area.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the passage of the penis, and it is stuck inside, and the urine cannot come out; if you treat it as I have just said, that you cut it many times, you are excused for the cutting by this treatment. I have already proven it thus.
Take an iron rod in this shape, and let it have three angles formed into a fire-tongs shape.
Then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot return to the bladder;
Then insert the rod into the penis gently, until it reaches the stone; and turn the rod in your hand on the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone from the other side;
Then the urine will come out immediately, then press your hand on that which remains of the stone inside the penis. If it is immediately broken, and jumps out with the urine, and the patient is healed;
And if you cannot do this for any reason that prevents it, tie a thread below the stone and another above, then cut the penis at the stone between the two threads, then pull it out, and untie the thread, and cleanse the congealed blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
of the stone of women
Sometimes a stone is embedded in women, and if it happens, the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for three things:
One is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a woman knowledgeable enough to uncover herself to the examiners, especially when she is chaste.
And the third way is that perhaps one cannot find a woman knowledgeable enough in this art of hands;
And the fourth way is that the stone of the woman is deeper than the stone of the man, so that a deeper incision is needed, and great fear arises. And if necessity summons to this, you must take a skilled woman-physician, and one is hardly found, and if you do not find one, a discreet female examiner will do;
and present a wise woman experienced in the lives of women, or a woman who knows part of the art, and instruct her to do what you command her concerning the examination of the stone; and carefully observe if the woman is a virgin:
and carefully observe if the woman is a virgin: then she must insert her finger into the foundation and seek the stone;
and if she finds it, she must constrain it beneath her finger, and instruct her to insert her finger into the afflicted area, and seek and press her left hand firmly upon the bladder.
If she finds it, she must move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder downwards, until it reaches the root of the thigh;
then cut upon the stone at the root of the thigh opposite the middle of the groin, where the stone is most apparent, and feel the stone in that part; and do not move her finger over or under the stone, and let the cut be initially small;
and do not move her finger over or under the stone, and let the cut be initially small; then insert the instrument into the cut; if you feel the stone, enlarge the wound until the stone can easily emerge, and know that many types of stones exist:
that is to say, small and large, rough and smooth, long and round, and those with veins.
so know the appearances in order to know the outcome.
And if the blood overwhelms you, put powdered vitriol in the place, and hold it for an hour until the blood is stopped;
then return to your work, until the stone is out, and have the instruments that I have told you about in the extraction of stones, to have men help you in your work;
and if the blood overwhelms you, and it is from a cut artery, put the powder on the place and bind it with bandages, and do not begin this again, and leave the stone and do not pull it out, lest the patient die; then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood has subsided, and the place is healed, then return to your work, until the stone is out.
A watery hernia is nothing other than a collection of moisture or white pus, which is under the root of the testicles, containing the egg;
and is called "syfac", and sometimes is properly in the covering of the egg, so that one might think it to be another egg; and it is the skin of the testicle between the white syfac that we have mentioned;
and this does not happen often. And the generation of this hernia is from weakness that comes to the testicles, and that matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow on the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: or it is a color leaning towards yellowness, or it is blood-red, or black, or watery white, and this happens more.
and these are the signs to recognize this assembly, because if it is the white pus as we have said, the abscess is round, a little long like the shape of an egg, and the testicles are not visible, because it has moisture all around.
And if it has moisture in the proper tissue, the abscess is round with a portion of the egg, and therefore one thinks it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white pus, one feels it well.
Therefore, when you wish to know the color of the moisture, you test all the surrounding area, of which the shape is before you. According to that which comes after the surrounding area, judge of that which is within.
And when we treat it with iron, the patient must be bled according to his ability and the fullness of his body.
Then lay him on his back, on something a little high, and put many cloths under him;
Then sit on his left, and command the minister to sit on the right, and extend the rod to one of the two ribs of the heart of the testicles;
Then take the heated spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles along their length, right up to the base, and make your incision straight, separating the skin of the testicles until the white surface is reached, and carefully peel it back according to your ability;
Then pierce the plain surface with water through a large hole, and draw out all the water, and then apply your hooks, and stretch the surface upward;
and do not touch the heart of the testicles, but only the surface; Cut it all, or by pieces, even the subtle side of it, for if you do not cut it wisely, the water will return;
And if the testicles swell during your work, then return them to their place when you have finished working on the surface;
Then bring together the two leathers of the heart of the testicles with a stitch, then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the testicles corrupted by another illness, you must tie the vessels that are supporting, fearing the flow of blood;
Then cut the testicle at the entire support, and remove the testicle, and treat it as we have said.
And if a sharp object is lodged in two parts together, know that these are two splinters; Then cut the other part as you did the first, likewise, then wipe away the blood, and place wool soaked in rose oil in the wound;
Then cut the other part as you did the first, likewise, then wipe away the blood, and place wool soaked in rose oil in the wound; and place other wool soaked in wine and oil over the two testicles, and place doubled cloths over it, and tie it over the entire bandage, according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with wool bandages in this manner, and let them be joined together by stitching at the crotch of the breeches, and one should extend from the buttocks to the back, and the other to the area of the stab;
and the other two ends over the two shoulders, and let the entire bandage be gathered together in the buckle of the breeches;
And sometimes this wound is treated with a cautery instead of an iron cut, and you should take a sharp cautery knife, and cut the skin of the testicles, and heat it as we have said, so that the white surface containing the water is exposed;
Then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce that surface with the prongs, and scrape it with this hot, fine cautery:
And cut it in every way that you can, until you remove all of it;
and be careful that the fire does not touch the testicle;
and know that this work is more healing; and beware of bleeding, and be careful that the work of cutting is gentle;
And if anything makes you disagree, whether it is an abscess, bleeding, or something else, cure whatever disagrees, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is afraid and does not want to endure this procedure because of its horror, administer a perforation, as I tell you, and if you are certain through the signs we have mentioned that the watery swelling is distant, then have the patient sit upright on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess on the lower part, throughout the entire thickness, and make the perforation along the length of the body;
and make the opening wide so that all the fluid runs out;
then place cotton on the area and bind it, and allow the remaining fluid to drain, then treat it until the wound is healed;
and if the linen bandage does not allow the fluid to exit through the wound, you should insert a reed or the instrument used to draw water from the hydrops, whose form is shown earlier;
and enlarge the wound's opening, and know that the fluid returns and collects after six months or a year, and when it collects as before, the patient will pass their days.
Know that in the treatment of this condition, there are many dangers in various situations, therefore I believe it's better to leave it alone;
and I will tell you the treatment and the characteristics of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses come upon the body, and especially upon the testicles; and it is by many means.
That is to say, by a superfluity of sharp and acute matter, spread to the testicles, or by percussion;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and finds no pain, and is a grievous abscess;
and perhaps an abscess is grievous, fearful, and painful, and of fixed color, and sometimes comes from the wound of an artery, or from swelling of a vein.
When it is from a wound of an artery, it is known by the disposition of a hot abscess when you press it with your fingers; and you should not touch it at all.
That which is made from swelling of a vein is known by its disposition to the pressure of the touch of the fingers, and one can well make the incision on this appearance, and on the other flesh; and it is that you cut the core of the testicles, then raise the scrotum, and pull the white membrane away from the testicles, and free the suspender from all parts of the testicles.
If the scrotum is already swollen with these inflamed areas, then you must pull on the scrotum and cut it.
And if there is air on the surface, or in that which is inside the vessels, then you must free all that membrane and cut it cleanly.
And if the origin of the flesh is in the back, then you must cut it all, and remove the testicles, as we have said.
And when your work is complete, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with further remedies until it is healed.
This is an abscess wrapped in a swelling similar to a boil, accompanied by softening of the testicles, and the patient suffers greatly when he walks.
And the treatment for this illness is as difficult and dangerous as the previous one, and nevertheless we will tell you the method, according to what the ancients did.
You should have the patient sit on a raised seat, then put the suspensory for the testicles down to your fingers, around all the vessels that are close to the penis, and the master should grasp and stretch them firmly.
Then cut with a sharp, wide spatula through the area across the vessels, until they are exposed, and then cauterize from each side, as we have said in the extraction of arteries located in the temples;
Then insert a needle with double thread, and tie it to the first place where the vein emerged, and tie it again to the other end; Then cut them in the middle straight, according to the length of the body, and draw out the corrupted moisture;
Then treat the wound like the others, where pus is formed, so that no vessels fall off to nourish one of the testicles;
For by this, no harm will come, and if blood comes from all the vessels, then the testicles must be removed from all the vessels; So that the testicle does not lose its nourishment due to the incision of the vessels, and they dry up and cannot be helped.
The occurrence of this injury is due to the cut that occurs in the skin, or the stretching on the abdomen in the groin area, because the intestines descend from that rupture towards one testicle;
And this rupture is either of the skin, or of its stretching, and these two types come from many causes:
or from a blow, or a jump, or a fall, or the lifting of a heavy load, and by similar things;
And the signs, when it's from the stretching of the skin, are that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; And the abscesses are equal all the way down, because the skin presses against the intestines.
And the signs, when it's from a cut in the skin, are that it causes sudden pain at the start, and the abscesses appear different, near the skin, and this is due to the exit of the intestines and the body pushing against the skin.
And sometimes the intestines descend with the viscera, and are trapped, causing the patient great suffering, especially when pressed.
And in these iron treatments, there is fear, for which they should be avoided.
And the method of treatment is that you instruct the patient to return the intestine to its place within the wound, if it can be put back in; then support it on its back, between your hands, and raise the hips;
then stretch the body upward, and cut all the skin from the groins lengthwise; then insert the levers of the groin, in accordance with what you need to open the wound, and they should be such that the pus may exit;
then scrape the surface beneath the skin of the groins, until the white, hard surface is exposed on all sides;
then place your index finger into that which surrounds the groin, into that which lies between the white surface beneath the skin of the scrotum and the second surface, and separate that which is behind the scrotum and between the second surface;
and then move your right hand inside the groin, and stretch the white surface upward with your left hand, and lift the scrotum with all its surface towards the groin; and instruct the assistant to extend the scrotum upwards, and loosen that which is behind the ligament;
and search with your fingers if there is any intestine wrapped around the hard white surface, and if you find anything, place it in the abdomen beneath;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of multiple threads, and insert it into the back part of the surface, which is behind the skin of the testicles; after the groin, then cut the ends that appear of the threads, until there are four threads; then assemble them one over the other in the shape of a cross, and tie the surface, which we have mentioned is beneath the skin of the testicles, with a strong bandage of two parts; then wrap the ends of the threads, and tie them tightly with two parts, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter the wound, so that a bad abscess does not arise; and place the bandage again according to the first bandage, one inch long from it, and after these two bandages leave the surface of the groin, which is beneath the skin of the testicles, the length of one finger; and after all the other according to the roundness that the testicle bears;
then cut in the part that is beneath the skin of the testicles, so long as the blood runs, and the wound, as we have said before;
then administer wool soaked in oil, and place it in the wounds, and apply the bandage that we have mentioned. And sometimes the white surface that we have mentioned is cauterized after the incision, due to the fear of bleeding. For this happens many times, and leave the bandage until it comes off by itself;
and if it is slow to fall off, it should be soaked with hot water, and apply what we have said, until it falls off;
then treat the wound with another treatment, until it is perfectly healed.
of fleshy hernia
In this method I have never seen anyone who dared to perform the cure with iron.
And the ancients said that it is done just like the method which is interwoven with the viscera, in such a way that you tie the vessels, after the incision above or slightly below;
then cut in half, and treat the abscess of that which opens, until the vessel drains;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes a rupture occurs within the ribs, as we have said, and the place opens;
and none of the intestines descend into the groin, and if any do descend, it is little, and repairs itself at all times;
and yet if it remains too long in this position, the wound or sore grows, until the intestine descends;
and this happens through the extension of the sore on the ribs, as we have said, for it extends, then softens and swells the place and opens;
and the cure is by cautery, as we have said before;
and sometimes it is cured by iron in this manner: and it is that the patient lies often on his back between your hands, then cut the area of the ruptured swelling with a width according to the quantity of three fingers;
and then remove the sore that is under the skin that covers it, then take the rod and place it over the exposed area of the sore;
and press it deep into the belly, then cut the two exposed areas of the sore over the head of the rod, and cut both;
then remove the head of the rod, and do not cut into the sore or stretch it or anything else, as I have shown you in the treatment of the rupture of the intestines; then treat it with the treatment for wounds.
then treat it with the treatment for wounds. And when you cut the threads, clean it and treat the wound until it is healed.
The sore is constricted, and has no appearance in the rupture, and the cautery is milder in this place, and closer to healing.
of the softening of the skin of the nipples
Many times the skin of the nipples is softened in some men, because the flesh within is softened, and it is easy to see;
and it is necessary, when one wishes to cure it, that the patient be laid on his back, and that one cut the softened skin over the natural skin;
then bring together the two edges with stitches, and if you wish, first stitch the excess of softened skin with three or four firm stitches;
then cut between the stitches, and cure it like other wounds until it is healed, and the thread falls out.
of the chastening
Know that chastening is forbidden by our law, and for this reason I would prefer not to speak of it in this book;
and it is only necessary for two reasons:
one of which is that the patient should be able to answer when asked, and know the cure;
and the other, because we often need to chastise some animals to help us, such as goats and sheep and cats and other animals.
I say therefore that chastising is done in two ways: either by pulling, or by cutting.
In the one that we do by pulling, we make the beast sit in hot water, until the testicles are softened and hanging; then grasp them in your hand, until they are reset and you no longer feel them.
Of the castration of the tail: you must restrain the beast, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspender, and cut on each testicle in one cut, when you have well scorched them;
and leave no spot of the surface and the subtle surface which is over the vessels;
and this manner of castration is milder than that which is done by traction, because with traction perhaps some part of the testicles remains, which causes the beast to desire lust;
then cure the wound until it is healed.
of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism is according to two manners in men: one is that between the two testicles appears also like the figure of a woman's nature, where there is hair, and sometimes urine flows there.
And the other manner is in women, and has on the vulva also like a penis and two testicles.
And the treatment of the man and the woman is that you cut away all the joined flesh, and treat it like other wounds;
in the second manner, of men whose urine leaks through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
Tenaculum is a joined flesh on the natural part, as long as it is too unsightly to look at; and some women have it as large as a hand, and that is the cure.
You must pinch the excess of the tenaculum with your hand or tweezers, and cut it slightly;
and do not go too deeply, lest a flow of blood occur, then treat the other wound until it is healed;
and another flesh that arises at the mouth of the wound, and fills it, and perhaps bursts forth, and is like a boil, and because of this the ancients called it "boil disease". If necessary, you must cut it, like we said of the tenaculum, and treat it until it is healed.
Erratic it is when the nature of the woman is not perceived, or the opening is small; and is either natural at birth, or accidental through illness that has come to it;
and is either natural at birth, or accidental through illness that has come to it; or it is by added flesh, or from a thin or thick surface, and is made deep within the womb, or in the ribs, or beneath, or wherever;
and hinders conception, and childbirth, and perhaps the ability to bear flowers;
and the knowledge of this is by the examination of the parts.
If the numbness is close and apparent, then look at your fingers or the hand.
If it is from a thin surface, and it is close to the two lips, then hurry, and treat it thus:
place your two index fingers together, and let the woman lie on her back, her legs spread apart;
then spread the two lips gently, so that the thin surface is healed, and the numbness is relieved;
then take wool and soak it in oil, and place it on the area, and let the woman lie on her side each day so that it cannot adhere.
And if the surface is hard and thick, then you must cut it with a spatula, similar to a myrtle leaf.
If the numbness is of recent flesh, then suspend it from a hook and cut it.
and have medicines that stop blood, such as dragon's blood, incense, and a mixture of egg white.
then apply a wide lead strip so the wound cannot adhere.
and let it be for a long time, and apply a dry linen tent.
then treat it with further cures until it is healed.
And when in the wound there comes dead flesh, it must be cut away according to this method, if it is not an inflamed abscess. For an inflamed abscess in the wound, one should not touch with fire.
of hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood flows habitually, and when the hemorrhoids are old, they become ulcerated.
And we have already discussed their types, and the signs, and I will now describe those which receive treatment.
I say that hemorrhoids and ulcers, when deep within the wound and not visible to touch, are not treated with iron.
Those that are at the opening of the wound, which can be felt, are those that can be treated.
Therefore, you must put the woman in a cold room, then grasp the ulcer with tongs, and cut it at its roots, then sprinkle medicinal powders that constrict blood, such as oak gall and dragon's blood and frankincense, and similar things;
then place her feet against the wall for an hour, then put her in cold water;
and if a discharge of blood comes, make her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate bark and galls and similar things, and then take barley flour and mix it with honey and oil, and make a poultice for her back.
And if it stops, that is good. If not, apply leeches to the back and breasts without injuring them;
then take wool, and soak it in plantain juice or elderberry juice with old wine, and apply it to the area.
And when the abscess has settled, treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and that called "albathir" is red, and resembles a rough lump; it should be cut, as I said, like a boil. and then treat it until it is healed.
Many kinds of abscesses appear in the body, such as sores and stony abscesses and herpes and boils and fistulas and hemorrhoids and hot abscesses, and many other illnesses that I have mentioned in the division.
It is therefore necessary for me to describe in this treatise the hot abscess that comes in the body, which is not among the abscesses that collect pus;
and if you wish to know the treatment for it, look to see if the abscess is sharp at the beginning of its appearance, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red, if you can see it. Then do not rush to pierce it, but allow it to mature until the pain is calmed;
and then have the sick person sit on a seat, and have two small seats where they can lean, and rest on their back and bring their feet to the parts outside the leg;
and let their thighs be spread out, and place their arms under their knees, and tie them well with a good bandage;
then suck the wound towards the right side, and apply the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the ulcer, from which the form will come afterward;
and it is necessary that when you wish to apply this instrument, that you first place the rod into it to know the depth of the ulcer, so that what enters the instrument does not go any deeper than it should, and that it does not injure the patient; and if the instrument is larger, then it is necessary to cover the depth of the ulcer with cloths, so that the instrument does not hurt it;
and it is necessary that he place the horn of the instrument on top, and that he hold the instrument.
And when the abscess is open, and one cuts it gently with the hand, then it should be cut at the top, with the knife's edge.
And when the boil is emptied, then it is necessary that you put moistened cloths in rose oil, or in dry green oil, into the wound;
And place the cloth deep inside the ulcer, and put a clean, moist linen cloth over the ulcer and over the incision soaked in water or boiled mallows.
Then treat it after two days of the appropriate ointment, until it is healed;
And sometimes one washes the ulcer and wound with a clyster of water and honey, and then with water or the cooked roots of lilies and aristolochia; Then return to the ointment.
And if the wound has reopened in the ulcer, you must avoid cautery with iron, but treat it as we have described in the section.
of childbirth It is necessary first for the midwife to understand the signs of natural childbirth, and these are when you see the woman pressing downwards and desiring to smell the air:
then the child hastens to emerge. Then know that this childbirth is according to the natural process, and the birth is under its head, and the afterbirth with it;
And when you see these signs, then it is necessary to gently press her belly, so that the child emerges quickly;
For when it descends under its head, the afterbirth exits with it, and the mother is freed from her superfluities through good cleansing;
And that which comes otherwise does not come naturally.
For it sometimes comes upon its feet, and the body or head, and hands, or it comes upon its stomach, or often, and is turned by chance on its neck, and in other bad ways;
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and subtle in these things, and to guard against error and deception, and I will show you all the forms of how one should help her.
If the child comes upon its head through natural delivery, and the woman labors greatly, and her strength is weak, then have her sit upon a stool, or have women hold her up.
And apply her nature of oil or fenugreek that is cooked, and then let the midwife place between her fingers the small spatula of which here is the form: and cut the afterbirth, and cut with her fingernail until the moisture that is within flows out;
and grasp the woman's abdomen until the child descends, and if it does not descend, then it is necessary to administer an enema to the woman of a mixture of fenugreek and sesame oil;
then have her drink and sneeze from this concoction, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: then the child will now come out.
And if the two hands come out forcefully, it is necessary that you gently return them little by little; and if they cannot go in, then place the woman on a stool, and raise her feet up; then lower the stool to the ground, and hold the woman so she does not fall when it lowers;
and if the hands cannot enter, and the child dies, then cut the hands with the knife that is placed beforehand, and extract the child, and return it likewise.
of the child's exit from its feet When the child comes onto its feet, it must be pushed upward; and then turn it slowly, bit by bit, until it is straight;
then take it by the feet and stretch it slowly.
If it jumps up to its thighs, command it to grasp, and make it sneeze with incantations; if it jumps away, if God wills.
And if it does not jump away as we have said, then turn it slowly, bit by bit, until it is according to its natural form. For then it is light.
And if it does not jump away as we have said, take a mixture of aloe, and oil of sesame, and melted gum, and grind everything in a mortar; and put this ointment on the affected area of the woman, then have her sit in warm water up to her ribs;
and when she is softened from below, make her a poultice of myrrh, and put it underneath, and leave it on for an hour; then have her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and pinch her mouth and nose, and gently press on her abdomen, for the child will jump out now.
of the birth of the child upon her knees When the child comes into this form, the midwife should place her hands gently, little by little; then be held gently on her neck, and let her legs hang down, and let her lie down on the bed; and gently fold her hands, and then take her hands above her belly, and remove the cushions underneath, until she is ready to give birth; and if the child does not emerge, then take her feet and move them vigorously, then move her belly upwards, then put your hands there; and gently bring forth the child; and tell the woman to strain as hard as she can until the child emerges.
of the child's birth that comes out with one hand hanging down it is necessary to devise a way to bring the hand back. if one cannot bring it back, have the woman get up and go.
if she cannot walk, have her lie on the bed, and straighten her legs firmly.
then administer the poultice that I have described;
and if she does not give birth, have her sit on the chair, then try to bring the hand back; and deliver the child according to its natural form, and make her sneeze, and instruct her to strain until the child comes out.
of the child's exit from the mother's neck, and let her hands be spread out, and her face turned toward her mother's back It is necessary that the attendant hold the child's hand, then turn it slowly, and gently draw it out;
and when it is even, put on the natural mucus of the head and oil, as we have said, then instruct her to move slowly;
and when you have done this, make her sit on a chair, and instruct her to strain; and make her sneeze. in this same way for the entire secondine.
in this same way for the entire secondine. When it begins to swell in this way throughout the secondine, cut the secondine with your fingernail, until the moisture is emptied;
and if the infant hangs on its face and on its neck, cut it from the side, so it is not held back, and the infant dies;
then put the child inside, until you have placed it as it should be, and instruct the woman to take herself:
of the birth of twins Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four are born; and this is not a strange thing, and it rarely happens. Two are a strange thing, and do not live, if few are named;
Two are a strange thing, and do not live, if few are named; I know that they are multiplied, and are separated by the surface that divides them, which is attached to the belly;
and sometimes they emerge just as naturally as one single child, as we have said.
And if they emerge painfully, treat it as we have said, and let the handling be subtle, and quickly and lightly do what it does; and do it as it needs to be moved to safety. of several children
Sometimes they are formed in the womb as I, II, III, IV, V, VI, VII, or many more up to XV, and they are all formed in the form of a child by the measuring of the wise and glorious, and it is necessary for the attendant to know all this, for perhaps similar things happen; so do as is necessary.
of the dead child
When you treat a woman of the dead child in the womb, as I have said in the division, and it does not come forth, and you are constrained to manual work; if it is necessary for you to know if the woman is of sound virtue, and has no accident or fear of death;
if it is necessary that the woman be placed on her back, and her head inclined downward, and her legs raised;
and the minister should hold her from two sides, or she should be bound to the bed so that she is not drawn down by the child;
then rub the mouth of the child with moist oils mixed with the mucilage of mallow and fenugreek and flaxseed, then anoint the child's hands with these oils and mucilages;
then put them lightly into the child, then find the place where she puts the instruments that are suitable for this, and be on guard if the child is positioned so that it descends onto its head;
if you place the instruments in its eyes or neck or mouth or palate or under the chin or in the throat or near the sides, and if the descent is on the feet, then insert it into the heel or ribs in the middle;
and it is necessary that he hold the instrument in his right hand, and place the curve between the fingers of his left hand, and gently put it into his hand, and insert the instrument into any of these places that we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty space;
then insert another instrument, or a third if you need it, so that the extractions are equal;
and then extend it equally by moving it from one side to the other, to remove the obstruction, and let the instruments be toothed to hold the obstruction, as is the form here:
And if a part remains, then anoint some of his fingers with oil, and place them on that part, and pull the other part;
and if any still remains, then place this instrument in a higher position, and do so until it comes entirely out.
And if one hand comes in front of the other, and it cannot be brought back due to constriction, then you must wrap it in a cloth until it is completely out; then cut at the joint of the sole or the heel, and thus you must do in the other hand, and the two feet.
And if the child's head is large and the passage narrow, or if it has a sharp point gathered, then you must place the pointed spatula between your fingers, and split the point and extract the sharp point; or you round it with the instrument called "almidach", from which the shape comes with the instruments in the chapter which is after this one;
and likewise do this if the child has a large head naturally;
and then pull the bones with the pincers, and if the head leaps out and it is held by force, let it be split open, so that the moisture which is in the wound is gone;
and if it cannot come out, then cut it into pieces as much as you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, then you must pierce it until the moisture flows out.
And if the child is on its feet, the pulling is light, and the straightening to the mouth of the wound is light.
And if it is tight in the belly or in the breast, then you must pull it out with a cloth wrapped around the hand; and cut the belly or breast, until the moisture within flows out;
and if the other members are removed, and the head remains, then the attendant places their hand deep into the wound, and pulls it towards the opening of the wound; then puts one or two hooks in it and pulls forcefully;
and if the opening of the wound is constricted by a hot abscess that has developed, then it is not necessary to work on it, but rather moist and fatty things must be administered; and administer plasters, and soak in soft and moist water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can put it upright, then administer what we have said for a living child;
and if one does not have the strength, then pull it forcefully in pieces, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, then administer what we have said for hot abscesses that develop in the wound;
and if a discharge of blood occurs, then it should be placed in constricting water, and administer other treatments.
And I saw a woman whose belly had contained a dead child, then another one was sewn on top of that, and the other one died. After a long time, an abscess developed in the flank, and swelled until it opened, and began to discharge profusely.
I was called to treat it, and I pondered it for a long time, and could not close the wound.
I applied a strong-pulling plaster, and one bone came out, and after a few days another one. I was very surprised, because the belly has no bones.
I thought it was bones from a stillborn child.
I probed the wound, and pulled out many bones, until the woman was better. and the woman lived a long time like this, and sometimes a little pus would come from the spot;
and I have recorded this chapter only because, when the master encounters a strange thing, that he may know how to provide help.
Here after comes the form of the press, with which books were made;
and with two turns on the two ends of the two hinges. However, the horns should be more subtle than the restrictor, and should be made of ebony or boxwood;
and let the mouth of the tube be one finger's width wide, and the margin of the trees one finger's width, and in length one and a half palms; and between the two hinges should be two attachments of this same tube, which should be fastened on one and the other, of half a palm in length or a little more;
and these two attachments are placed into the mouth of the jar to open when one turns the two horns.
Another form, similar in appearance but more subtle and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, resembling pliers; and have two attachments at the two ends, as you see, one palm long, and two fingers wide;
and when you wish to open the jar with the whole instrument, place the woman on a bed, feet hanging down and legs open, then put the two joined attachments into the jar, and hold the head of the instrument beneath between her thighs; then operate your hand on the entire instrument, as you did with the pliers likewise, according to the amount you wish to open the mouth of the jar, until the woman does what she wants.
These instruments are all superior, and their appearances are multiplied; and when the ones in charge have prepared them, so much the quicker the work, and so much higher the men for their quantity.
Do not neglect the instrument until you have prepared it, for their necessities are not excusable.
When the afterbirth is retained during childbirth, you should instruct the woman to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with a condiment, and hold her hands firmly over her mouth and nose. and if she jumps because of that, so much the better.
If not, she takes a pot, and makes a hole in the lid, and puts herbs in that can open the passage of the womb, such as calament, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia, and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, should be boiled in water over the fire;
then put one end of the cane into the hole of the pot, and the other end into the mouth of the womb, and hold it until the vapors come into the womb;
then make her sneeze, as we have said. Then the afterbirth will come out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out easily, instruct the woman to moisten her left hand in oil of sesame or in the mucilaginous juice of mallow, and then put it on the part, and draw out the afterbirth; and when she has found it, then she should take it and extend it gently and straightly, so that the womb does not rupture during the extraction;
but it must be moved gently to the right and to the left, and then pulled; then it will come out and separate.
And if the opening of the womb is very narrow, we have mentioned the treatment of sneezing and the fumigation of herbs;
and if it is not helped by all that we have said, be careful not to force it during the extraction;
but it is necessary that what is at the opening of the womb, you tie it to the woman's thigh, then administer a clyster of four-part ointment; if it will rot and return, and it will become better;
However, when it rots, a bad odor comes to the stomach and head, and harms the patient. Therefore, suitable fumigations are necessary for this:
None of the ancients have tested fumigation with cress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates a woman after the delivery of the flowers and the afterbirth is this:
And it is of glass, resembling a chain, and one places the thin end in the nature, and the wide ends over the fire;
and let the fumigations be over the coals, and the sore until it is wasted, and begin another.
Many children are born who do not have the foundation pierced, but have a thin layer of a subtle substance over it: Then it is necessary for the midwife to pierce that layer with her finger, and not pierce it with a very sharp instrument, and to maintain the bandage so as not to touch it;
then put on wool soaked in wine and oil, then apply a healing ointment until it is healed.
And if you doubt that it will close again, put a lead chain in the opening, and leave it there for a few days, and remove it when the child wants to go to the rooms.
And sometimes these blockages come from the closure of a wound or an abscess; if it is necessary to cut that closure: it should be treated, like we have said about the lead chain.
Fistulas that come from under the fundament are swellings, and those that come from beside the fundament, or in the space between the two parts, have a fistula or several;
and when that swelling is old, it opens, and sometimes leaks white or subtle pus, and sometimes these fistulas are discharging.
and are known by that which comes out—either an expulsion or wind—when the sick person expels, and perhaps a worm jumps out.
And there are fistulas that pierce all the way to the bladder, and even to the middle of the penis; and reach down to the hip joint, and to the root of the thigh.
And thus one recognizes a fistula that pierces to the foundation, and one that does not pierce: and it is that you put your index finger in the foundation, and put a thin needle of bronze or iron into the fistula when there is no winding.
And if there is winding, you put a thin lead tent, or a horsehair, until you feel the tent or hair with your finger;
and if you do not feel it, and it does not come from the opening any discharge of wind or pus, as we have said: know that it does not pierce at all; so hurry with the cure.
And when the fistula pierces to the bladder or to the passage of urine, urine will leak out and cannot be sealed by medicines.
If it has pierced to the joint of the thigh, the tent will go all the way to the place; if there is no twisting and the source of the pain is around it, it often comes out as a boil, and no medicine or ointment will be of any use.
and in these piercing fistulas, there is no cure other than hard work, and the foolishness of the meddling charlatans.
In one that is not pierced and is not old, there is hope for health through iron, as I have experienced, and this is how the patient lies on their back between your hands;
and the person raises their legs up to their thighs, and keeps their thighs inclined towards their stomach; then place a tent of bronze, or lead if there is twisting, until you know where the tent comes.
If the patient feels it around the foundation, you should put your index finger there, and then feel if the tent has pierced it.
and if you feel between your finger the surface or flesh, then you know that it is pierced; if not, work on it until it can be healed.
It is said, however, that some can be healed well, but this happens rarely.
and the help that is given is to heat the subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula, as it has been said before; and place it, all hot, into the fistula, until it comes near the bottom; and do this two or three times, until you know that these stray flesh, like a bird's feather, are burned;
and then treat it with tents soaked in butter, until that flesh is healed, then treat it with ointments that encourage flesh growth and healing.
If it is thus healed, it is good.
If this, otherwise, cannot be healed;
and if the tent goes in, and does not pierce the finger that is at the base, and between your finger and the tent there is a thick covering of flesh or pus, and you see the fistula at this, which followed the covering of the heart; if you cut at the beginning of the fistula, and push the tent forward, and then cauterize afterward, until it reaches the top of the tent; and the tent will be delivered, and fall;
then cleanse those twisted flesh that look like a bird's feather, and nothing remains.
And if the blood overcomes you, and flows between you and the work, cauterize it with fire or sharp medicine.
For cauterization by fire brings together two good things: that is to say, the burning of these added flesh, and the stopping of blood and the drying of moisture;
then treat the soaked bandages with butter or crushed herbs, until the place discharges pus, and the burned flesh comes out in the pus;
then treat the wound with ointments that penetrate deeply into tough flesh, and the medicines are dry.
For when it is restored, it is healed and does not return.
And if a fistula comes down to the very bottom and is separated from the body, then you should put your finger in the bottom and investigate it.
If you feel the membrane, and between it is the cloth or the surface or flesh, where it is close to piercing, then there is no other way but the hope and expectation, through the administration of one of the three methods:
or you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it to the bottom, or if you can, put in tents and treat it as before;
and do not go too deep, lest you cut the holding that holds the bottom, and the discharge come forth without your will; then treat it as we have said;
then treat it as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you remove that covering and clean it since it is cut away from the bottom, or by a tent or other appropriate instrument; then cleanse that dead flesh that is in the wound, as much as you can; then study how to restore the wound, and to contain the fistula on the exterior of the bottom:
then study how to restore the wound, and to contain the fistula on the exterior of the bottom: it will be a lighter thing for the patient.
And sometimes fistulas are according to this manner: and it is when you put the tent in the fistula, and it is on the side of the bottom next to the skin above, then take a tent pierced at the head according to this form: And he puts a twisted thread in two, and puts the tent with all the thread into the fistula until it is at the head.
If it is piercing into the margin of the bottom within, then pull out the thread from that hole, so that you put your finger into the bottom;
and pull the head of the thread, and assemble the two heads together, and hold one to the other, and leave it one or two days;
and restrain it sometimes, until the thread cuts through the flesh that is between the two, and it falls away;
then cure the wound until it is healed and sound.
If the fistula does not pierce, then make it pierce in all the ways you can, if it is not too deep. For it is not necessary to make the incision so deep, and then cure it, as we have said, until it is healthy.
The shape of the spatumile spine, with which one makes the fistula, is very sharp on one side and sharp-edged. and on the other side not, so that one does not cut what one should not cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are according to two manners: or they are inside the fundament, like grains of resin, and there are small and large ones, and often blood flows from them, and there is one or more of them, and they are in front of the fundament and at the top of the fundament;
but those that are in front have little moisture, and often a little yellow water or a little blood, and have the color of the body;
and the treatment for those that have them inside the fundament is that you instruct the patient to strain himself to go to the privy, so that the fundament comes out and the strings appear; if you hurry, and pull it with tongs, or you hold it with your fingernail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the forceps cannot hold them due to their moisture, then they are taken with a cloth, or cotton, or a piece of chamois; and pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and sprinkle some warm powders on top, which should be in place of cautery; or you cauterize them as it is said in the chapter on cautery, then treat them with other treatments until they are healed;
and if the foundation cannot come out, then irrigate the patient with a biting and harsh enema to wash what is in the foundation, so that it may come out openly; if the patient cannot bear it, and if the threads are pulled from the foundation, then the treatment is light;
if the patient cannot bear it, and if the threads are pulled from the foundation, then the treatment is light; and it is that you take them with your fingernail or pliers, and cut them, then treat them as we have said, until they are healed, and that they fear the incision by iron. Thus it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner:
Thus it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner: Take a twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then pull the thread over and pierce the needle on the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and that be of sufficient width;
and tighten the thread firmly, then tie the thread, and pull out the needle, and do so with all the others, and leave one to run the excess blood;
then put over the foundation a damp cloth in rose oil or in cerote, and put it over the foundation, and instruct the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they fall out, and when they have fallen out, treat them with ointment and other cures, until they are healed.
of the dryness of the foundation Many times there is dryness of the bowels, and by constraint of nature, and when the illness is old and medicine is of no use. If it is necessary, you should scrape with a spatula or your fingernail the scab over it, which does not let it moisten; then treat it until it is healed as is appropriate;
and if it cannot heal, then repeat the scraping more forcefully than before, until it bleeds profusely and is raw; then treat it until it is healed.
there is trembling. A small, deceptive appearance is formed around the body, and goes very deeply.
and sometimes one finds cold, and one feels it also as if trembling, and it comes over the whole body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the treatment is that you take a stick of a goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and put that stick over the trembling, so that the circle encompasses the trembling completely around. Then turn your hand over the entire stick until you cut all around the trembling, and place it deep within, and eradicate the trembling from its roots.
And if you wish, make one of brass or iron according to this form, and let it be thin underneath and sharp above. not piercing, in order to hold and press on the finger.
And if you wish, cauterize the trembling, as is described earlier in the chapter on cautery.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver or bronze, or of molten or hammered brass;
and sometimes these instruments are made small or large, according to those to whom they are administered. Those administered for the treatment of children and those who are weak and in pain, are small.
Those administered for the treatment of children and those who are weak and in pain, are small. The form of the small and large clyster is, from above, wide, or the belly is bound in this manner:
and there be a separation where the belly is bound, as you see, and the bladder be pierced within;
and have two holes on one side, and one on the other;
and let the belly where one places the medicines be made of an animal's bladder or parchment, and be pierced all around with small holes, and have between each hole a space of one inch, then put into these holes a strong thread of thick thread twisted in an X or in a spiral shape around, and assemble the belly as is a goat's; and when the medicine is inside, tie it with a strong thread in front of the instrument, then clysterize;
and this is the shape of the circle:
And let the medicine neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or similar thing, then insert it gently; then the minister squeezes it with his two hands together, until it is all empty, then withdraw the clyster, and let the patient raise his legs against the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, let him hold it as much as he can; and if he sleeps a whole night soundly, it is even greater help.
And if you clyster him in a disease of diarrhea, and the medicine hastens to exit, then repeat it until he is healed.
And if the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, or an abscess, let the clyster be as subtle as for a child;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster on which the leather is tightened:
We have already said in the division the treatment of wounds;
or we will tell you the cures of hands and medicine, according to their completion.
I say that wounds are diverse according to what they are made of, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and of what they are made.
The things by which wounds are made are by throwing stones, and cutting with swords and knives, or lances or wood or arrows, or similar things;
or that are made according to the places on the body, such as a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the chest, or the belly, or the liver, and similar limbs;
and I will tell you the cure for each wound, and will begin with simple wounds of the head, for the remembrance will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, take care if it is from throwing a stone or similar things, and the skin is nonetheless broken and the wound is large, and you fear a hot abscess: if you make it bleed immediately from the cephalic, especially if little blood comes from the wound, and let the blood flow to the opposite of the injured part;
and keep the patient from repletion of wine and heavy foods.
And if he does not want to bleed, let his food be diminished, and let him drink no wine, nor eat meat;
and put on the wound, if a hot abscess comes there, cotton soaked in rose oil only, or in astringent wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, put on the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it is not altered by the air, powder, which I will say a little later;
and if the burn has altered it, put on some ointments until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, like from a sword cut or similar, and the edges cannot come together with bandages, bring them together by stitching, as I will explain for wounds of the belly and the ribs.
If the wound is exposed to the bone, and hanging, and only holds on by a little, cut it off. then treat the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to eat hearty foods, such as heads of livestock and cooked wheat, also birds, and similar things.
And if you find rot in the skin, and it is not attached to the bone, cut off all the rot and throw it away, then treat it.
and if there is an artery or vein in the wound from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped with medicines, tie off the artery, and if you find it loose, tie it with a thread; and if this does not help at all, cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the cure is easy: and it is that you place this powder which welds before the burn has changed.
And the manner of the powder is: take frankincense one part; dragon's blood two parts; living coals three parts, and powder subtly, and fill the wound, and bind it firmly, until it heals well and joins with all its blood;
and then bind it well, and leave it without unbinding, if it does not swell; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes one uses only hot coals, when one does not have incense or dragon's blood, but that the heat has not changed the wound.
And if the heat has changed the wound, especially in its state, then one does not put this powder in it.
but puts on some digestive ointments, or poultices of barley flour made with water and honey, until it casts off pus; then cures it with other treatments until it is healed.
And if a bone fracture comes with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with delicate pincers;
and I will tell you about the fractures of the head afterwards.
of the wound of the neck
If a wound occurs on the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and one on the head; but if a nerve or artery of the neck is cut.
If it is a nerve, there is no other remedy than to let it heal, and to not put anything constricting on it, because it harms the nerves and makes them contract; and do not put anything cold on the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is also with the brain, which is the highest part of the body;
but let the medicine be soft, like warm water mixed with rose oil, and warmed water also, and other mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, sew it up and bandage it, then treat it until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and it is filled with pus, then pierce it in the lowest part;
and if the artery is cut, and bleeding comes from it, tie it off, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the spine in the throat is cut, or the heart, and the passage is guarded, through which food goes, then sew the heart to the throat's cartilage, and do not touch the throat, but put it back in its natural shape; and then restrain the swelling, and leave it for a few days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, then extract it; and if there are pieces of bone, then pull out all you can, and those you cannot get, leave them until the wound has festered, and the opening has discharged and lightened;
and if the wound is fresh, then put powder on it, as I have said. And if there is bone in the wound and a fistula, then treat it as I have said in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or a knife, and the wound is deep, then look if gas escapes from the wound as the patient breathes: Then know that the wound is fatal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, then do not put powder on it at the first hour, nor bind it tightly due to the blood so that it does not linger deep, and return to the heart, and kill the patient; but apply a drawing ointment, and bind it twice a day;
and if you do not have ointment, then put old cotton in the wound to absorb the moisture, and make the patient sleep on the wound for three, or four, or more days; then there will be no spasm, nor tremor of the heart, nor constriction of the windpipe; and when you see good conditions, then know that the wound is healed. Then treat it with poultices and other remedies until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and opens again, then know that there is a fistula;
if it is treated as it should be. And if the wound is from a sword or knife cut, and it is simple, or on the chest or back, treat it as the one that is on the front; if it is large, by stitching;
and if it is small, with powder, and if it has penetrated the bone, and broken pieces off, then search the wound, and pull out the splinters if they are separated; and if they are not separated, leave the wound to fester, so the extraction will be easier;
and for other wounds on other limbs, the judgment is as we have said.
of the rupture of the belly
The rupture of the belly is great, medium, and small;
from the large wound sometimes the intestines, or the nerves of the intestines, jump out, which causes their intrusion;
and the cure is more difficult, and sometimes a small wound is worse than a large one, because it is more difficult to put the intestines back in if one does not put them back in hot and quick;
because the intestines swell as soon as they feel the cold, so they are more difficult to return to their place, and therefore a medium wound is more difficult to treat; for this reason, it is better to return the intestines to their place than other wounds,
And know that the rupture of the belly is according to four manners:
the two common cures occur in the cure of the belly, and the cure of other wounds of the body and two other specific cures are common to other wounds;
and nevertheless they are more specific to the cure of the belly, and I will explain each one and clarify.
I say that when the wound is small, and some part of the intestine protrudes, and it is difficult to return it, this is by one of the two methods: or because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen due to cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this manner: moistening a sponge or linen cloth in merely lukewarm water, or you may boil it in water with squills, cyperus, and spikenard, and warm the intestine until the swelling is removed;
and sometimes using astringent wines, which are more potent than water alone for reducing swelling.
And when you see the swelling diminish, moisten the intestine with water or boiled mallows and rue, for by this the opening is relieved of small things;
and if it cannot enter, then make a small incision in the wound with the instrument used to cut hemorrhoids;
and the first treatment is more potent than cutting, which no one should do without great necessity;
and this is the instrument for splitting it:
so it cuts inwards into the curve and not outwards, and see here the shape: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine jumps out, return it back to its natural form in its proper place, if you have the power, for this is worthwhile.
When the wound is large, and it is in the part under the belly, it is necessary that you make the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the part below the belly, place the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and also if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts, place your attention on ensuring the injured part is higher than the other;
and thus it is necessary to administer what I say in large and medium wounds.
In small wounds, place what you have prepared, then have between your hands a skilled assistant who holds the entire rupture in his hand, and brings together the edges;
and this is the common method of stitching, and is that you take a needle or several, according to the amount of the wound's width, then leave a space of one inch from the head of the wound, and there place a needle with a strong thread; and pierce the two sides of the skin with the two sides of the subjacent skin, which is beneath the skin itself, until you have pierced through that part, and bring together the two ends of the subjacent skin, the four together;
then draw a double thread around the needle from both sides, then bring together the two edges of the wound, and then leave one inch of space, and place another needle there;
then tie the thread as you did with the first needle, and do not cease doing this according to what you need of needles, until the entire wound is sewn together;
and let the needles be of medium size, between subtle and thick, for subtle needles cut through all the flesh, and those too thick cannot enter properly: therefore they must be medium;
and it is not appropriate to push the needles too far into the flesh and skin, lest they cut and open the wound before it is sewn together;
and then cut the points of the needles, so that they do not injure the patient while they sleep, and put bandages or strips at the points of the needles to hold them in place, and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this method of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds, for one or two needles will suffice.
The second method of stitching is common, and it is that you bring together the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the flesh together with a needle with one strong, medium thread;
and when you have pierced all four edges together, then draw the needle back to the starting point, in the manner in which cloths are sewn;
and put space between each stitch the thickness of a little finger;
This method of stitching is known to men, and I sewed a wound a man had in his belly, which was wounded by a knife, and the wound was more than a palm in size, and the intestines were protruding well over two palms in size, and the wound was in the middle of the belly.
I returned the intestine after it had been out for twenty-four hours, and the wound was closed within fifteen days, and I treated him, and he was healed.
And the doctors had judged that he would die, and that was a miracle.
And I did not treat it with ointments, for I was in a place where none were found, nor any medicines; And I placed old cotton on the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until he was healed.
Or I shall tell you the two proper ways of stitching:
Take the needle, and thread it from the outside to the inside;
When it has pierced the heart straight on, then leave the tip of the thread, or stitch, where you put the needle, and make it pierce the other side, from inside to outside;
And the understanding of this stitch is that you stitch like a tanner sews hides, and that you leave the thread on one side, and take it up again on the other, until the stitch is completely finished.
The second way of stitching, which Galen properly calls, is as some do, who bring the two parts together naturally, and place one end of the thread to the other end, in this manner:
Insert a needle into the nearest part of the wound, and pierce only that spot, and leave the two ends of the thread; Then turn the needle, and make it pierce from the outside to the inside, at the two ends of the thread;
Then pierce each of them from the outside to the inside, at two other parts of the wound that are on the other side;
And this is the best way of stitching and the most common.
Galen said this, and some testify, that the belly should be sewn with two needles, each with a thread;
And one needle should be pushed in from one side, and the other from the other, in the manner of those who sew leather straps;
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the stitching is more serious than in other parts of the belly.
The judgment of the wound is such as the judgment of other wounds:
and it is that when you find the wound fresh with all its blood, before the flesh has changed it, you put the intestine back in place, and stitch it;
then put on the powder of healing herbs, and if the flesh has changed it, put on any ointment that is available, until the wound heals; and stitch the threads, and let the edges of the wound and the skin be joined together; then treat the wound as the others, until it is healed;
and if you have no medicine, put on, as soon as it begins to heal, old cotton, and change it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need any other medicine in addition in many cases when the wounds are simple;
and if you fear that the wound might spread to the major limbs, then you should soak a light fleece in tempered oil, or rose oil, and put it around the joints and under the armpits;
and if it feels pain or putrefaction in the boils, and this often happens, then irrigate them with warm dark wine, especially if the putrefaction reaches the intestines;
and pierce it within, and know that when it's the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small one.
The intestine called "jejunum" cannot heal when wounded, and this is because of the density of the veins within it, and because of the subtlety of the whole body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
And if the hernia protrudes from the wound, then put it back in place just like the intestine, while it is fresh;
and if it is old and turned to a dark colour, then you must tie the dark area so that blood does not come out, because there are veins and arteries there;
then cut what is between the tie, and hang the two ends from the part beneath the wound, even lower, to ease the extraction when the hernia falls, and the wound heals.
of the rupture of the bladder
When the intestine is torn, and the wound is small, it can be restored in some people, for I saw a man who was wounded in the abdomen with a lance;
and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and became festered and turned into a fistula, and from it came discharges and flatulence;
I applied treatment according to what I could, and did not cease to refine it until he was healed, and the tissues were joined together.
And when I saw it healed, I feared the patient might have pain in his belly; and he had no pain, but remained in better condition, and eating and drinking;
and some experimenters said that when he has a small wound in the intestine, it should be bound in this manner: take linen strips with large heads, then bring together the edges of the wound, and when the strip has opened its mouth, place it over the two edges so that it clamps its mouth down on them;
and then cut off the head, and it stays in place so that it cannot come loose, then put another strip after it in the same manner as before, until the wound is entirely closed; and stitch the wound.
This head will burn in the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and the intestine can be tied with a thin thread that is cut from the intestine of an animal, in this manner:
take the head of this intestinal thread, which should be very lean, and then tie to the head of this thread a thin linen thread that is twisted, then thread the thread into the needle and stitch the intestine, and bring it together in the rupture;
and this manner of stitching with strips is no stronger than according to the way of trust and hope;
and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the large intestines, there is no ingenuity or skill, but only subtlety.
of a fistula or where it may be Know that any wound or abscess, when it becomes chronic, is universally called a "fistula," especially when it is crooked and discharges pus.
And a fistula, according to the truth, is a knotted, hard, and white tumor, where there is no pain, and it is also crooked like the feather of a bird;
and sometimes it discharges clear pus, and other times thick pus; sometimes little, and other times quite a bit;
and I have spoken of this in the division of wounds, that any wound that is not healed, and there is no flesh, it is only because of one of the eight causes: that is to say, by the smallness of the blood or body; or because of its malice; or because there is hard flesh inside and on the edges, that does not allow flesh to grow; or there is too much pus; or the place is rotten, and the material is of bad quality; or the medicine is not good in the treatment; or because the corruption is a type of pestilence; or because the property of the region is slow in digestion, and delays recovery, and swells by nature; or there are veins or bones:
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the cures of medicine in the division.
Or it is necessary for me to make you know the cure for fistula which is done by the work of hands.
Know that fistula occurs in all members of the body; for there are fistulas that come from large veins, and arteries, and nerves, or to the surface, or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs, or to the spine of the back, or to any joint of the hands or feet; and some come to the property of the principal member, and similar places.
And all the fistulas that are of this kind are of grievous healing, and there is nothing but labor, and ignorance;
and if there is any fistula that does not come to the place I have mentioned, and you have confidence in its cure, and you wish to know it, take a tent of brass or iron, if the fistula is straight, then seek it;
and if the fistula is crooked, then seek it with a subtle tent of lead, for lead bends easily around the crookedness;
and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot properly search it with tents, then irrigate it through one of the openings, because the moisture flows from one opening to another, and clean it;
then search it carefully to your ability, so that you know if there is bone or nerve, and is buried deep, and ask the patient carefully about the pain he feels when you press your hand, and the place where he feels it;
and when you truly know the place where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery or vein, or in any of the places that I have told you, then cut it according to what I have told you, and remove the filth and the corrupted flesh that is within;
and then treat it until it is healed, and if the fistula is deep and in the right place, you must cut deep, as much as you can, then put softened medicated cloths into liquid medicine, and place them to the head of the fistula, so that the medicine corrodes the excess that has remained at the bottom;
and then apply ointments to grow healthy flesh, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed by this, cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, cut it.
If a vein or nerve hinders you or the main limb, as we have said;
and if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, scrape it until all corruption is removed, then treat it with things that grow flesh until it is healed;
And if it is not healed, and returns to a boil as before, know that you have not yet reached the root:
if you uncover and seek until you are at the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
and if it is thus healed, that is good. If not, know that the corruption is too deep for you to reach; if there is no other remedy than to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it out with pliers, pull it out with a suitable instrument, and if there are many bones, pull them all out, leaving none.
and if the moisture resists, and there is no error or fear, then cut through moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, put something on the wound to cause rot, and leave it until the area around the bones is rotten, and then the bones will be easier to get out.
And if it is a large bone, such as from the leg or thigh, resist the corruption only until the blackness is completely removed, then restore the wound;
and if a large part of it is corrupted, and it reaches the bone marrow; then it must be cut and scraped all the way to the corruption, and then it should be treated until it is healed.
and I will tell you about a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take example and help in your work.
There was a young man, around 30 years old, who had pain in his leg, from a cause that came from within the body, so that the matters came to the leg, and it became swollen with a large abscess, and there was no reason to avoid opening it;
but the physicians, through their folly, worked so much on it that the abscess opened, and a lot of matter flowed out, and it became a fistula, and many openings came into it that all discharged pus and moisture from the body;
and many physicians applied treatment for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of medicine, until I was called in, and I saw his leg and the remedies with which they treated it, and what flowed out through the openings in great quantity; and the young man's body became red, and had a yellowish color.
I inserted a tent into one of these openings, and then searched all the openings, and found that one was connected to the other from all parts of the leg.
I hurried then, and cut into one of the openings until I uncovered part of the bone, and I found it corrupted and broken, and the corruption had reached the bone within;
I removed what appeared to me of the corrupted bone, and thought there was no other corruption, other than what I removed;
and began to restore the wound with healing medicines for a long time, and could not heal it;
and then I began again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continuing into the bone, and I removed it, and then I attempted to heal the place; but I could not do so until I cut around a palm's width of bone, and the bone was completely hollow, then I restored it with medicines; and it was healed and mended quickly, and no further work was needed except for the patient's weakness, which could not endure, and for the fear of death I had for him. For because of the blood evacuation, he often coughed, but he was completely healed, and a hard flesh grew in place of the bone, and it was of good disposition and caused no harm or opposition at all, neither in the present nor in the future.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, it should be treated in this manner: Take a bandage, and tie it to the exposed end of the bone, and instruct someone to hold it up high; and place another thicker wool bandage over the first bandage, and bind it over the flesh that is above the bone, and pull the head [of the bandage], so that you pull the damaged flesh underneath, and expose the skin above the spot where you want it to be, so that the bandage does not wound the flesh;
and place a firebrand or a board under the bone to help cut away the damaged flesh;
and continue until you can see and feel the damage, and do so again.
And if the bone is damaged, and does not show, and the damage is inside or in a part, then expose the entire flesh;
then place a firebrand underneath, and then bandage from one part to the other of the damage, and let the bandage be the length of the damage plus a little, as we have said;
and if the damage is in the joint, then cut the damaged joint, and bandage the bone on the other side;
and if the damage is in the continuation of the two joints, there is no other remedy than to cut;
and if the damage is at the point of the hand, or at the point of the foot, this is a very serious matter, but nonetheless you must investigate this corrosion, how it appears to you; and cleanse it in every way that you can, but that the veins or nerves do not oppose you;
and know that the knives and saws for cutting these bones are many, according to the arrangement of the bones and their appearance, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness; and for this, it is necessary to prepare a tool for each kind of work;
and know that the work will show you the instrument you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the testimony of the kinds of illnesses; so consider the tool you need according to what is appropriate.
The shoulder might be dislocated either through internal or external causes;
and when you have treated that corruption with medicinal cures, and they do not help at all, then it is necessary to cut off that limb down to the place where the corruption lies, so that the patient escapes death, or the greater evil, which is the limb's malfunction;
and the sign is that the limb becomes black, so that it seems to be burned by fire, and after the blackness, the corruption can spread from limb to limb, and take over the entire body;
if you hasten to cut it off, and if it is due to the sting of some venomous animals, such as sea scorpions and vipers and similar ones, if the corruption is at the tip of the finger, cut it off and do not give it any time to spread to the hand.
And if it reaches the hand, then cut it at the joint, so that the corruption does not reach the arm;
and if it reaches the arm, then cut it at the elbow;
and if it passes the elbow, that is death, and no strong remedies are of any use beyond the amount of their virtue;
and do exactly the same when the corruption comes to the foot: if it comes to the first joint, then cut it after the other joint;
and if it comes to the foot, then cut off the entire foot; and if it ascends the leg, then cut at the knee joint;
and if it comes above the knee, there is no other remedy than to leave the sick person to die;
and the way to cut or to sever the limb is that you bind it above and below, and have one attendant stretch one of the ligatures downward, and another attendant the other ligature upward, and you separate the flesh that is between the two ligatures to a space of one span, so that the bone is exposed;
then cut or sever it, and put a linen cloth on each side, so that the cut does not touch healthy tissue, and other injury and festering abscesses do not come to the sick person.
And if bleeding occurs when you work, cauterize the area quickly, or apply some astringent powders;
then return to your treatment until it is complete, then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you that it happened to a man in his foot:
he had a burn that appeared like a fire burn, and that corrosion first came to his toe of the foot, until it affected the entire foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he hastened to cut off the foot, and was healed;
and a long time later, the corrosion returned to the toe of his hand, and he came to me, and I put on him things that rebound after cleansing the body, and the corrosion could not cease;
and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I did not want to, because I had hope of repelling the matter; and also feared that if I cut off his hand, he might die, because the man's strength was weak;
and he despaired entirely, and returned to his land, and hastened to cut off his hand, and was healed;
and I have taken this account only so that one may do likewise, if one has need.
Sometimes an abscess occurs in a fleshy area and lingers so long that it collects a large amount of pus; and then it bursts and the pus escapes, and the area remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin on top is as thin as fine cloth, and it does not reach the bone, nor the nerve, and such an ailment is called "sinus" and is not called "fistula";
but if it extends so far that it reaches the bone deep within, it is called "fistula";
and the skin is such that you should cut that skin all around, especially when it is thin, like a cloth; and it does not heal due to its corruption.
And if you are certain that the skin will heal, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, treat it with a clyster thus:
Examine if the swelling is large, and the pus that comes out has a foul odor, then clyster it with Egyptian medicine which is made thus: Take lead, oil, and litharge, equally, and put them in a vessel over the fire, until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey;
and then take of this according to your need, and mix it in water and honey, and clyster it into the swelling, and bind the opening; and leave the medicine in for two hours, then remove it by squeezing;
do this often, until the swelling is cured, and the foul smell is removed;
and sometimes it is clystered with water from ashes, when this medicine is not available, and that you take ashes from vine wood, and pour water over them, then strain it, and clyster it, until you know that the swelling is thoroughly cleansed;
and if the patient cannot tolerate it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the water of ashes, then clyster it with water and honey, or if there is a little bit of litharge crushed in it; or you clyster it with honey and mixed wine, that the honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and the wine makes the swelling dry;
and when you have done this, and you have ensured that the swelling is thoroughly cleansed, then clyster it with that which causes flesh to grow there, and that you take a diafinit plaster, and make it with rose oil and wine;
or you clyster it with some medicines and ointments, of which I have discussed the properties in the treatment of ointments;
and if the opening of the swelling is small, and the nozzle of the clyster cannot enter, then enlarge it slightly with an iron, and place a tent of Egyptian ointment, or basil ointment, until it is enlarged;
and if the wound is too wide, then sew it up, leaving only the space where the clyster can enter, and if the opening that releases pus is on top, then cut it at a lower point.
and if you cannot cut the swelling from below as you wish, prepare it in such a manner that the pus flows to the lowest point, for when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to grow there, and if you cannot cut the swelling from below as you wish, prepare it in such a way: that the pus runs easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus;
that the pus runs easily downwards, and leave nothing of the pus; and take consolidating medicines to place on the swelling, and spread over it a linen cloth that covers the entire swelling; then cut as forcefully on the spot where the swelling is, a little larger than the first, then spread a soft ointment over another cloth according to the size of the opening, and place it over the swelling to ease the pus, and do not remove the large cloth except after many days once;
and that which is over the swelling's opening, remove often to remove the pus, and know whatever comes from the pus, whether it is venom or little or enough, or digested or indigested;
and watch if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine has been extended in such a way and you see the nature that jumps over the swelling's opening, then know that the swelling is already healing, and health is approaching;
and then unbind it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you unbind the wound, change another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if subtle venom flows after a long time, do not despair of health, for health approaches.
For there are men whose flesh heals slowly in their wounds, and others who do the opposite;
And if undigested pus bursts from the swelling after many days, know that the swelling will not heal;
and if the swelling is slow to heal, and is inflamed, add drying medicines that are moist in substance but dry in virtue, such as a diaffinit ointment, because it contains a large amount of vitriol, and that is the final medicine;
Take diaffinit ointment, and make it with rose oil, and mix it with equal parts of old wine by substance;
then mix it and use it;
and this same method works better for swollen tumors, when diaffinit ointment is not available, or you can take myrrh, aloes, and frankincense, grind them, and powder them over the honey when it is on the fire;
and then apply it in strips, and spread it over the swelling, and sometimes an aristolochia root, and the roots of the lily of the valley, which is also like the flour of vetch and centaury; and use it as simple or compound remedies: grind them, and make a powder, and put it on the honey I mentioned, and use it;
and if the cure is prolonged and is not cured by this treatment, then know that the corruption is deep, and produces pressure on the bone, or the tough tissues, or the ligaments; if the treatment for the fistula, as we have said before.
Panaricium is an abscess that arises under the nail of the finger or toe, or perhaps arises in other fingers;
and when it is aged, and one does not pay attention, a pus-filled abscess will form, and it spreads and expels pus until it reaches the root of the nail, and perhaps it will spread over the entire nail;
and the corruption reaches the bone, until a foul pain arises, and the fingertip is swollen, and the color is livid.
When you treat it as we have said in the division, and the treatment is of no benefit, then you must cut away all the excess remaining of the nail with a sharp knife, then cauterize the wound afterward. Cauterization is very helpful if the bone and nail are healthy;
and if the nail presses against the flesh, and begins to prick and wound it, you must place a wedge under the nail that pricks the flesh, and lift it up, and carefully and gently cut the flesh, and apply burning and corrosive medicines to the remaining flesh to remove all of it. then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corruption is in the bone, cut it out and remove it forcibly, for as long as the corrupted bone is there, it cannot heal.
And if you see the finger being corrupted, cut it into the middle, as previously mentioned, and then treat it until it is healed.
And if it is struck and bruised, and it feels great pain, you must first treat it.
Then cut the nail of the spasmodic finger, cutting across the top, and be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh under the nail, for the patient would feel too much pain.
And if it happens, place something on it that soothes.
The swelling that arises in the hands of some men by chance is entirely fleshy, and sometimes there are bones in it, and sometimes there is a nail, and some of them originate at the joint's root, or the origin is in some of the fingers' bones.
Those that arise on any finger bone do not move, and those that arise at the finger joint, sometimes do move.
The size of the one that is fleshy is light, in such a way: Cut it at its root with a wide spatula.
Those that arise at the joint's root are difficult to cure: So hold it by the cut.
In that which arises or should be at the rear, you should first cut the round flesh down to the bone, then cut the bone with a suitable knife, and then treat it until it is healed.
The joining that comes to the toes together comes from birth, or from a wound's joining, or from fire's burning, or from similar things.
You should cut that joining, so that the toes return to their natural shapes. then put between them tents or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not rejoin. or you put between them thin pieces of lead, until the place is healed, as is fitting.
If a joining occurs between any of the toes and the palm, cut that joining as is fitting.
Large veins are enveloped, full of melancholic superfluities, which arise in many parts of the body;
and more so in the legs of those who walk and work and carry, than in others.
Therefore, you should administer a purge of the bile, and then cleanse it with basilica.
The treatment with iron is according to two methods: one is that they are cut, and black blood is drawn out; and the other method is that you tie off the vein, and draw it out fully.
The cutting is according to this method: First, make the leg very hot with hot water, until the thick blood is thinned, then restrain the patient's leg from above the thigh down to the part below the knee;
then cut the vein in one place, or two, or three, with a wide cut, then lift and draw out the black blood into your hand, from one end to the other, as much as the patient's strength can endure;
and then tie it, and instruct him to eat foods that produce black bile;
and recommence the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are full, and harms the patient.
The raising of it is according to this manner: raise the patient's leg, if there is much hair, then place it in a bath, and raise the leg in hot water until it becomes red, and the veins swell;
and if you do not have a bath, then warm it by the fire, and then cut it along the vein from the top of the knee, or in the part below the ankle;
then open the skin with the lancet, and scrape the vein from each side, until it appears when it is felt;
and it is seen red and black, and when it enters the skin it seems like a white string;
then put the knife underneath, until it is raised from the skin, and then gently cut with the lancet, then cut it in another place above three fingers;
then scrape the skin over the vein until it appears, then lift it with the knife, as you did, and cut it with another lancet, as you did first;
then make another incision, or several if you need them, then lift it, and cut it at the finger of the foot, then pull and lift it down to the second incision;
then pull it from incision to incision, until it all comes out, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull and lift it, then insert a strong double-threaded needle, and tie it and pull it, and put a knife underneath, and turn your hand back and forth until it comes out; and be careful that it does not cut, for if it cuts, it cannot be pulled or lifted, and this causes harm to the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, put wool soaked in wine and rose oil over the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vision is constricted, twisted, and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must split it crookedly, but do not cut it; and pull it out as we have said before.
The shape of the iron with which one cuts the vision is curved, and does not cut straight, lest it cut the vein;
and is of great curvature, for if it were subtle, it would cut the vein, but be thick as we have said, and here is the shape:
This vein is intertwined in the legs, in warm parts where no herbs or trees grow, and in land where there is no moisture;
and perhaps it arises elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens from the rot that comes from under the skin, just as it comes into the body of serpents and worms, intertwined between skin and flesh.
And if the signs of the beginning of this vein are that a very great inflammation comes to the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to emerge, like the root of a plant.
When the head is open, you must wrap around it a piece of lead of one and a half to two ounces, and the knot, and leave the lead hanging down the leg, and every time it protrudes, wrap it around the lead and the knot;
and if it is too long, cut off a part, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root until it is entirely out. for if you cut it, it will return into the flesh and cause abscess and rot in the place, and a bad illness.
for which reason it is necessary that it be treated little by little until the end, and nothing remains in the body;
and sometimes this vein, when it is treated, is five or ten palms long, and a man came to me, from whom it emerged ten palms long, and when you cut it, it forces a ray or a pore, and pierces it to the bottom, so that everything comes out;
and let the matter within be emptied, and apply healing medicines to the place to prevent any rot for a time, then treat it like abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has many branches, and especially when it opens in the joint of the foot, or the foot, and many pores arise from it, and from which many branches sprout.
Then cure it as we have said before.
of worms that grow between skin and flesh This illness is called "cattle disease" in our land, because it often affects cattle, and is a small worm that grows between skin and flesh, and travels throughout the body ascending and descending, and one feels it clearly moving from limb to limb, until it breaks through the skin where it travels, and causes sores.
and is generated by the corruption of certain humors, as worms and snakes and leeches and ascarides come in the belly.
and one doubts its malice, for when it travels through the body, and ascends to the head, and it reaches the eye, perhaps it returns and destroys the eye. and this happens many times.
When you want to cure and draw it out, you can only do so when it is moving.
if you wish to do so, then you must tie the area above and below with a strong bandage tightly, then cut and pull it out forcibly, and if the worm is deep in the flesh, and you cannot find it, then cauterize the area with fire until it is dead.
and the greatest harm it does is that it will damage the eye, as we have said.
and if you see it coming to the head near the eye, hold the eyebrow tightly below it, then cut above it and pull it out forcibly.
and the patient should use cleansing remedies and dissolving medicines for the corrupt harmful humors, and abstain from foods that induce corruption.
of the pain that comes from windiness This illness is called "vakirir" in our land, and is a pain that comes in certain limbs, and can move from limb to limb;
and I saw that which I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of her arm;
and I saw it rise afterward, just like a worm to the shoulder, more quickly than anything, like live silver when it rushes from one place to another;
the pain departed from that place, and settled in the shoulder, and then a little later ran throughout the body, until it reached the other arm;
then she told me that it would often turn around the body, just as I saw it.
I was very surprised how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this illness in this manner. However, I had seen many that had suffered pain moving from one place to another, but I had never seen it like I saw it in the woman;
and I thought it was because the woman had a thin body, and exposed veins, and because of this the windiness appeared constrained;
and it does not appear according to this reason in those who are plump, and who have moist bodies and full veins.
And when you wish to cure this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears to you as we have said, then quickly remove it from above and below, and then cut until that constrained windiness in the place issues forth; and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your eyes, then cure it with things that expel windiness, such as foul-smelling pills, and pills of serpent, and similar others.
Arrows are diverse, according to their appearances and according to the places on the body where they strike.
The diversity of them is that there are some that have large points, and small, and barbed, and soldered; and some that have two angles, and some that have tongues, and some that have pieces;
and the one that strikes any limb strikes in two ways: or in a principal member, like the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members. When it strikes then in any of these members, and the signs of death, which I will tell you afterwards, appear: if you should avoid extracting this arrow, for death comes afterwards in many ways; and when these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not deep, then pull it out and treat the wound.
And the sign of the brain when the arrow strikes and pierces the bone, and the thin membrane covering the brain is torn, is when there are blurry vision, sudden pain, paleness, redness in the eyes, inflammation and redness of the tongue, spasms and loss of understanding, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps there is a leak of fluid from the nostrils or ears; and perhaps he loses his speech and voice; and a white fluid like pus oozes from the wound, and it also boils like burning flesh;
and if these signs appear, then you must treat it, and remove the arrow if it is not lodged within.
The sign of an arrow lodged in the heart is that it is near the left breast, and feels as if it were stuck in something hard, not empty; and perhaps the arrow moves like the pulse, and black blood flows out, and coldness and cold sweat come, and fainting occurs: then know without doubt that death will follow.
And the sign of an arrow wound in the lungs is that frothy blood spurts from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and sighs loudly and seeks cold air.
And if the arrow pierces the chest, it is near the small ribs; and causes great pain and sighing; and all the muscles of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, perhaps something of undigested food spurts from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly, and a bit of hay spurts through the intestines, there is no hope for a cure, nor for extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and the urine spurts out and comes pouring forth, and the patient feels great pain: know that the wound is fatal.
The other limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, shoulder, arm, spine of the back, thigh, leg, and similar limbs, are safe according to various conditions. When the arrow is in the nerve or artery, and it is not venomous, as I will tell you what happened to me, so that you may do likewise.
It happened to a man that an arrow struck him in the tear duct at the root of his nose: I tried it, and pulled it out on the other side under the fat of the ear, and he was healthy without any harm.
And he pulled out an arrow that had lodged in the fat of the eye under the eyelid below, and the arrow was bent, and he could only reach the tip towards the shaft, and the arrow was large, like a Turkish bow, with all light iron without ears;
The man was healthy, and no bad accident came to him.
And he pulled an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabic with ears:
I cut away the beards, and I worked so carefully that I pulled it out, and the Christian was healthy.
And he pulled an arrow from a man, that had lodged in his belly, and thought he would die;
and after he had passed thirty days, he did not change his condition; I cut around the arrow, and I carefully extracted it, and pulled it out, and there was no bad outcome.
And I saw a man whose arrow had lodged in his back, and the wound was closed over;
and the arrow remained inside him, and did not change his natural disposition, nor did he find any harm in any of his natural activities.
And I saw another man, whose arrow had lodged in his face, and the wound was closed over; and remained like that without suffering great pain;
and many others similar.
And an arrow was extracted from a nobleman of the king, that had lodged in the middle of his nose, and was slightly inclined to the right side; and the arrow was completely embedded.
I was called to treat it after it had been lodged for three days. I found the wound very narrow.
I probed it with a very fine probe, and did not feel anything. and he felt a prickling and pain under his right ear.
I thought it was from the arrowhead. I put an attractive and digestive plaster over the spot, so that the area wouldn't swell. And the arrowhead appeared to me.
And the arrowhead appeared to me. I put the plaster on, and stitched the wound again, and the patient remained like that for a long time, until he felt the arrowhead in his nose one day.
and he told me so. I put an acrid, corrosive medicine on the wound for several days, until it opened, and I probed it, and felt the head of the arrowhead working its way out.
Then I added more of that acrid medicine to the opening of the wound, until the head of the arrowhead became clearly visible.
And the deadline passed well, about four months later, and then the wound widened so much that I could put pincers in it, and moved it from one side to the other, and it still couldn't come out.
Then I didn't stop trying and devising different instruments, until I found a pair of well-made pincers, according to what their design will be at the end of this chapter, with which I extracted it, and healed the wound.
And the experts judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I then restored it, and the wound was healed, and the patient was completely healthy.
Or I have told you the nature of extracting some arrows, so that you apply your treatment to what I have not said, because a book cannot encompass everything;
But wise masters, comparing even small things, and focusing on what is present and lacking, discover new techniques and new instruments, in response to the unusual things that arise in this art.
I say that arrows do not emerge from the limbs where they are lodged except in two ways: either through the place where they enter, or through another part;
and the one that emerges through the place where it enters, is an arrow lodged in fleshy areas, and sometimes emerges immediately.
And if it does not emerge immediately, then let it remain until the flesh around it is softened, and the path of exit is eased;
and if it is lodged in the bone, and cannot emerge, then leave it thus for a few days, and move it every day;
and then it emerges, and if it does not, then pierce around it with a fine instrument, until the surrounding area is enlarged, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is lodged within the body's area, so that it cannot be seen, then search for it throughout the entire wound; and if you sense it, then pull it out with a suitable instrument;
and if you cannot because of the tightness of the wound, and the depth of the arrow, and there are no bones, nerves, or veins, then enlarge the wound as much as necessary;
and pull out the arrow if you can, and if the arrow has ears by which it is held, then remove the flesh that is caught on either side of the ears as much as you can, and then break or bend the arrow's ears so that you can pull it out;
and be careful not to break the arrow, for you would pull it out more painfully.
And if you cannot at once, leave it until the surrounding area is rotten, then pull it out, for the extraction will be easier. And if the flow of blood makes it difficult, administer what we have said about treatment in its chapter;
and be careful of cutting the nerve and vein, and devise how you can, as much as possible, remove the arrow safely, whether quickly or slowly, or firmly or gently;
and place the patient in the position he was in when the arrow struck him, for this is the greatest help there is, and if you cannot, place him according to the signs they show you.
The arrow that comes from another part, or where something is apparent of it, or the skin is swollen in that place so it can be seen or felt distinctly:
then cut there, as far as the pliers can grasp it, and then pull it out: if it jumps out now.
And if it is held within the bone, then rotate your hand round and round until it enters the bone, and widens the bone, then pull it out.
And if it cannot come out, then leave it for a while, and then recommence the extraction until it comes out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is in it, then push it to the whole shaft;
and if the shaft has fallen, and you wish to administer a push, then administer a pointed instrument, so that the point of the arrow enters the pointed part of the instrument;
and then push forcefully, and if the arrow is pointed, then push an instrument with a pointed end into it, to ease the extraction.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary for you to cut away all the flesh around where the poison is, if you can, then treat the wound as is appropriate.
And if the arrow has lodged in the foot or the belly or the bladder or the side, and it is close to the surface, and you can cut over it, then cut it out.
And be careful not to cut the vein and the nerve, and then pull it out, and then stitch the wound, if necessary. and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the pliers used to remove arrows is similar to a bird's beak, and see here the shape:
And there are many kinds of them: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the arrowhead is also like the feather of a bird, for pushing at the point of the arrow, like this is the shape:
Of the veins from which one bleeds are thirty-one, of which there are sixteen in the head, that is to say: Two beats that are behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; and the two arteries that are in the two visible temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspires"; and the vein that is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the top of the nose; and the two veins that are in the neck; and the two veins that are in the lips above the mouth, and these are the veins that are called "augeherich"; and two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins commonly lanced are five in each arm:
One is the cephalic, and is on the left side, and the common people call it "vein of the head"; and the middle one is called "faste," and is composed of the cephalic and basilic, and the common people call it "vein of the heart"; and the basilic is on the right side, and the common people call it "vein of the belly," and it is above the fossa, and is the one that is lanced, which is clearly visible above the wrist.
And the small vein is the vein that is between the auricular and annular, and has two branches;
and in the leg and foot there are three veins: one is below the bend of the wrist on the left side, and the second is behind the ankle on the right side; and the vein called "nerves," that is in the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg there are three veins under those.
The bleeding of veins behind the ears helps with chronic colds and migraines;
and the quality of the bleeding, as I told you, is that you raise the patient's head and rub the area where the veins are with a rough cloth; then the patient tightens their neck with a vise, until the two veins appear behind the ears in two places hanging from the head: then take them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, lance it;
then take the lancet and insert it under the vein to the bone, then raise your hand over the entire vein, and cut both the skin and the vein in two, and make the blood come out as much as you want;
then restrain and tie it, until it is healed;
and I have already mentioned the incision and cautery in the first book.
The bleeding of the two arteries that are in the two temples is good for a chronic headache, and a constant eye inflammation, and for sharp tears in the eyes;
and the qualities of the bleeding are as I say: and the patient should tighten their neck, until the two veins appear clearly; and feel the pulse under your finger, and then bleed from the inside;
then lift the heart above the vein up to your index finger, and place the lancet underneath, and lift the vein upwards, and cut it, as you have done to the other two veins, and let the blood flow according to your need;
then release the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, then place some cotton on it; and then bind it tightly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have already spoken of their cutting and their extraction, at the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the vein in the forehead is as valuable as bleeding from the cephalic vein in maladies of the face, and in migraine, and in inflammation;
and the method is that the patient tightens his neck by twisting, until the vein appears; then take the instrument called "digging tool," of which this is the shape:
And place the point on the vein, and strike with your hand, or something else, and allow blood to issue according to the quantity you desire; then loosen the patient's neck, and tie the vein until it is healed and sometimes the work is done with a wide flame.
However, it is not appropriate for the flame to be overly sharp; and hold it sideways, for the bone is close by, and perhaps the flame will break if it is too thin.
The cauterization of the two veins that are in the two tear ducts helps with eyes, and the brow, and redness, and the inflammation in the eye, and the diseases of the face;
and the qualities of their cauterization are that the patient tightens his neck by twisting with a ligature, as before;
then cauterize, and let the cauterization be across, a little long and a little wide, for there is no flesh there. And if the flame is thin, perhaps it will break.
Then let the blood flow, as much as you need, and then put a bandage over it and bind it well.
Cauterization of the vein in the nose is good for headaches, acute madness, and facial maladies, like migraines and redness that appears on the face, especially when it is chronic;
and the method of the cauterization is that the patient should pull their neck, then press their nose with your left hand, and take a thin long flame and place it between the two nostrils, in the space between them, for the vein is not easily seen there, and the blood will now begin to flow;
and do not go too deep, and let the blood flow according to your needs, then bandage it for a night, for it is quickly restored;
Cauterization of the two temples helps with constriction of the throat, and the beginning of swelling, and many maladies, and to impetigo, and to ulcers, and herpes, and tumors;
and the method of the cauterization is that the patient should pull their neck from both sides, as we have said;
and let the master be standing above the patient's head, and the patient sit on a seat, then cauterize the vein along a little widely, then draw the blood moderately, or as much as is needed;
then do the same to the other vein, then loosen the bandage, and bind both veins moderately, so the patient does not choke; and leave it until morning, so the wound is healed.
of the cauterization of the lips The cauterization of the veins of the upper lips helps with phlegm in the mouth, and with the corruption of the gums, and fissures of the lips, and of the nose and throat.
And the procedure of the cauterization is to make the patient sit before you, and bind their neck as I said; then turn the lip, and look for the two veins, one on the right lip and the other on the left, and they are recognized by being black, and because around them are small black veins:
Then cauterize one and the other, and if you don't recognize them, and you are in doubt, cauterize the largest one on each side, and do the same for the two veins that are above and below, for it is the same method.
Of the cauterization under the tongue The cauterization of the veins under the tongue helps after the cauterization of the cephalic vein, and it is for the constriction of the throat, and for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth;
And the quality of the cauterization is that the patient sits between your hands in front of the sun, and the patient lifts the tongue, and looks underneath on each side for a black vein:
Then cauterize one and the other, and do not go too deep, for the arteries are below.
The veins of the arm, which are commonly cauterized, are cauterized in two ways:
either by a large, flaring flame of burning, or a subtle olive-like cut, like sharp knives, and is called "anesil"; and are large or subtle according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The form of the burning flame is very renowned, and is large, as you see:
And it is necessary to open veins filled with thick, visible blood, and containing thick, troubled blood; and this is the form of the olive-like flame:
and is finer and pointed, and is for lancing thin veins, where there is thin, yellowish blood.
The lancing of the basilic vein, which is one of these veins, helps illnesses that are under the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the belly;
and it is necessary for the healer that he lance skillfully, and that he avoid the artery that is beneath. And if he cuts the artery, and a flow of blood comes, then it must be stanched, as I have said; and the lancet should not be piercing, but cutting like a knife.
And if the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary for you to press it, and choose another; or you want any branch of it, or you heal in its place the vein in the middle of the arm: it appears clearly; and cut with the lancet knife, as we have said.
And if you want to know the place of the incision, it is first necessary for you to press the arm, so that you touch the place until you feel the pulse; then mark the place precisely, and then bind the arm, and cut the vein with the lancet knife; and watch that you do not strike the artery when you see the place punctured, for it is of the artery: Wipe it then.
And if you see it gush out upward like a child's urine, and the blood is red and subtle, know that it is blood from the artery: Hasten then, and place your finger over it for a while, then remove your finger if the blood stops, for this often happens; Tie the arm, and leave it thus, and let the patient not move it;
and keep watch over it, and do not move it until he is healed.
And if the blood does not stop, and it overcomes you, and the medicine is not present, then cut the artery if it appears, for it will withdraw the chief; and stop the blood.
And take a fig tree bark, and split it, and take one half and bind well over it until the next day;
if the blood stops, that is good; if not, treat it, as we have said, with the powders that stop blood;
and the stopping of the blood is not difficult in many conditions due to the small area of the wound, and the strength of the limb's binding.
The vein's bleeding in the middle helps it draw blood from the head above and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilic and cephalic veins, as we have said;
and it is necessary for the surgeon to be careful of the nerve beneath, and if he cuts too deeply and strikes the nerve, it swells and the wound is difficult to heal, and perhaps cannot heal;
and this nerve is often exposed, and if it is not exposed in some men due to its subtlety, you must cauterize it with an iron instrument. and cauterize the nerve to your ability.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, cut it lengthwise.
The surgeon using the cephalic vein helps, as it draws blood from the head, and helps the eyes;
and it is necessary to bleed by pricking at the olive-like vein or the myrtle-like vein, because it is the safest of all veins, for it has neither nerve nor artery beneath it. However, one should seek the easiest place, and do not cause any harm if one errs the first time, and one can start again. and perhaps the place swells in some people, when one errs the first time, but it causes no harm.
The quality of the bleeding is according to your judgment.
The first thing you should know about bleeding is that it is only administered to preserve health and to avoid future illnesses;
and let the bleeding be done in one of the three veins that are on the elbow: that is to say, cephalic, radial, and basilic; and one should bleed at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of fullness appear;
and one should bleed on the first or third day, after two or three hours of the day.
The bleeding given to illnesses has no determined time, but whenever necessary, by day or by night, at all hours and times;
and it is not appropriate to bleed children until fourteen years of age, nor women carrying a child except from the fourth to the seventh month. And the old who have passed sixty years should not be bled.
And when someone wants to be bled, in whatever way, it is necessary that they cleanse the intestines with a light clyster, if they have held much waste, so that the veins do not draw from the intestines the spoiled superfluities harmful to the principal limbs;
and do not bleed those who are too full of food, nor those who are drunk, as long as they are unwell, nor the hydrops.
and one should refrain from bleeding after colic, vomiting, and bowel movements, and multiple abitations in women, and labor, from wakefulness and fasting, and whatever weakens either the spirit or the body.
then gently reduce the humors, if the blood is thick, by food and drink and by medicines, if you have the means.
then enter a bath, if nothing prevents it, to thin the blood, and bleed from the vein of the breast around the third, as we have said.
and guard yourself that day from work, and from pain, and from lust, and similar things;
and be relaxed and joyful, and let the blood-letter be higher than the one being bled, and rub the arm two or three times, then tie the bandage moderately, for when it is too tight or too loose, the blood cannot flow.
and then rub the area with your hands until the veins swell and are felt;
Then the blood-letter should moisten the flame with a little old oil, then place the finger of his left hand on the vein below the spot where he intends to bleed, so that the vein does not burst and fail when struck.
For there are veins that flee like ropes when bled, and some are full of wind, so that when the flame is applied, it recoils from the flame and the vein cannot be opened, and so it is with those. And if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the blood-letter must be careful in these matters.
And if the vein opens the first time, that is good; If not, he should start again a little lower than the place where he has previously stabbed, unless the place is swollen.
And if the place is swollen, and the patient is frightened, he should leave it for one or two days, and do not bind the arm. Perhaps there will be a hot abscess.
Do not enter the bath, then restart the bleeding if it pleases him.
And if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly, and you fear that it will not release as much blood as you want, then hold the flame directly on that opening itself.
And work a little hastily, before the place becomes swollen. For this happens many times, when the wound is small.
If you see the place swollen, then do not restart the bleeding, but put a little oil-soaked cloth, for it thins the blood's course, and the oil is milder in this area than the cloth.
And thus apply the oil-soaked cloth to each bleeding point you open the veins, to stop the flow of blood.
And this same action creates friction and throbbing of the blood, when applied to the area. Thus the blood is subtle and divides when it is too thick.
And if a large abscess occurs, which happens many times, especially when the bleeding is not sufficiently thorough, the opening of the vein is small,  hurry and apply a sponge soaked in warm water and salt to the area and hold it for an hour.
And you must do this after the blood has been drawn from the vein, and if any discoloration or greenness remains in the area after a few days, it will not cause harm. And if you wish, apply something made of aloes or myrrh mixed with juice of calamint, mint, or similar substances.
And many times, abscesses and appearances occur in the bleeding of the basilica.
Therefore, place your hand upon it, and if you find the area soft upon compression of the hand, that appearance is bad. Then stop, so that you do not apply anything of what we have said, because perhaps it comes from a rupture of the artery.
But make a dry poultice to harden the area, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And draw out each drop of blood according to the quantity of its virtue and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it issue until it is red. And if you see it thick, let it run until it becomes thin; And if it is too hot, let it cool down.
And it is necessary for the one who is strong and full, and needs bloodletting, that a wider wound be made, and the flame be wide.
and for the one who is weak, do the opposite, and it should be bled little and often, and it should be bled by cutting across, not by pricking;
and this way of bloodletting is safe from blood loss and nerve damage, and it is better than bleeding from the long or the wide.
And to those whose bodies weaken during bloodletting, give soaked bread in pomegranate juice; If they are heated, draw blood three or four times. And if they are of cold complexion, before the bloodletting, let them eat bread soaked in syrup of mulberries, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, like pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a well-scented syrup.
And if they faint during bloodletting, after the loss of much blood, they should drink broth of meat, and a subtle fragrant syrup, and use the other things that we have said in the division or chapter on fainting, for the evacuation of blood vessels.
And if he wishes to open his arm and bleed again, it is necessary, when he is weakened by much bleeding, that he bleed little by little, according to the amount of his continued strength.
And whoever wishes to open their arm after the first bloodletting, and they have a strong body, should bleed seven hours after the first bloodletting, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wants to bleed from another part, they should bleed on the second or third day.
For there is much blood within the body that is already heated, and causes fever; so it is necessary to draw a large quantity, and enlarge the opening so that it drips in a stream; since you observe all the conditions of bloodletting, and place your hand on their pulse while they bleed, so that death does not come instead of the stream, and this happens many times when the bloodletter is negligent;
and it is not appropriate, when you want to untie the arm, and make blood issue a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press strongly upon it; nor if it is bent, that he extend the arm hastily, for this would be bad;
but leave it until it bleeds a second time; or you prick it with the tip of the flame, so that the blood which is congealed in the opening of the vein issues forth, and place a little bit of salt mixed in water, and press lightly upon it.
And if the vein is swollen, leave it and do not constrict it, until the abscess is calmed.
And if it is necessary to draw blood a second time, then draw it in that same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the middle of the arm is lanced instead of the vein of the head because it is composed.
And the manner of the lancing is that the patient puts his hand in warm water, until the flesh is red;
then it is bound moderately, so that the vein appears well, then it is lanced straight through, not from the side nor from end to end;
and the opening should be wide, and it should be lanced close to the joint of the hand, and if blood will not flow, then put the hand in warm water, and let the blood run into the water, until you have enough;
and if it is summer, do not put the hand in warm water, for one puts it more in winter than in summer;
and the lancing of this vein is safer than all other veins, for there is neither artery nor nerve.
The lancing of the vein in the right hand's palm is effective against all liver ailments, and this is the method:
Hold the hand tight, and put it in warm water until the vein is swollen, so one can see it; and if the lancing is sideways, and you cut it completely through, it will cause no harm;
and do not go too deep, for the nerves are bare under all the flesh, and then return the hand to warm water if the blood is congealed in the wound, and cannot exit.
And when you have drawn as much blood as you need, put oil and wool on the vein to quickly close it, and do the same for each vein.
The lancing in the left hand is good for mouse disease, and do exactly as I have told you for the right.
The lancing of the sophene is good for all diseases beneath the body, such as the diseases of the marris, and retention of flowers, and diseases of the kidneys, thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the quality of its lancing is that the patient puts their foot in hot water, and rubs the vein until it bursts, and ties above the joint of the foot; and the vein is at the ankle, and above the foot there are many veins;
So lance it then on the larger vein, or at the ankle, whichever is better.
And if you lance it above the foot, be careful of the nerves underneath, and lance it transversely as if cutting;
and let the flame be subtle.
And if the blood cannot come out, then put the foot in water, and let the vein drain well.
And if the lancing fails the first time, then try again a little higher up, for the place is unhealthy;
And do not be afraid of the nerves, as we have said, and likewise do this to the sole of the other foot.
The place of the sciatic vein is at the heel of the foot, and its lancing is worth the pain of the hip, when it is for hot blood.
And the qualities of its lancing are that the patient enters a bath, and tightens above the ankle with four fingers twisting, for otherwise the vein does not appear;
And if it appears, then lance it in all the ways that you can, and across it; And it is better that you cut it, for the place is safe, and it is very susceptible to hands.
And it is better that you cut it, for the place is safe, and it is very susceptible to hands. And if you do not find it, lance any vein that appears on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and beware of the nerves;
And make as much blood flow as you wish, and then loosen the ligature, and place cotton on it and tighten it; It is now lanced.
Cupping vessels are made of horn, or bronze, or glass;
And cupping is done in two ways: either by striking and drawing blood, or without striking.
And this cupping that is without striking is in two ways: either with fire, or without fire;
And cupping done by striking and drawing blood is done in fourteen places on the body, of which one is entirely on the head; and another is in the middle of the neck; and two others on the two sides of the neck; and the cup under the chin; and the cup on the two shoulders; and the cup on the hips; and the cups between the two arms; and the cups on the two legs; and the cups on the two ankles;
and cupping draws no blood, except for the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore does not weaken one, as one does with venesection; and it should not be administered, neither with fire nor without fire, in any illness arising from repletion, until the whole body is emptied.
And if, by necessity of illness, or by custom, cupping is required, administer it each hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in between and at every time;
for there are some who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are some who find fullness and redness in their face, and in their head, and in their neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and some who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have their tongue swollen, and bleed; and there are some who dream, and see by night blood and wounds and death and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is in the middle of the month, we order them to be cupped after three hours of the day.
The leeches from the mug help the heaviness of the head… that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary for this to be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of the leeching of the cephalic vein, and it is not appropriate for those of cold complexion to use it, or those who have a cold, for this does them much harm;
and for this reason, it is not appropriate for the elderly to use it, nor those who have cold illnesses in their head.
And those who often leech themselves become forgetful, and for this reason, the cupping should be placed a little lower, due to the fear of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the neck is in place of leeching the head and basilique vein, and for this reason it is good for constriction of the chest, and fissure of the bronchial passage, and for all these, and for repletion.
And it should only be applied lightly, for if it holds too firmly, it causes forgetfulness in the stomach and the heart.
Cupping on the second ribs of the neck is good for head pain, ophthalmia and migraine, and for strangulation, and pain in the roots of the teeth, and is in place of leeching the basilique vein.
And you should instruct the healer to press their hand down when applying it so that they do not cut the artery and cause a flow of blood.
Cupping under the chin is good for mouth ailments and gum problems, and similar diseases of the mouth. And it is a substitute for leeching the two lips.
Cupping on the shoulders is good for illnesses caused by heat and fullness.
Cupping on the elbows is as effective as leeching the three veins of the arm, for it draws blood from those large veins.
And instruct the master not to strike too deep, for the area is thin in flesh and contains nerves and arteries.
A cupping on the buttock is good for hemorrhoids of the fundament and illnesses beneath, and the cupping should be large and made of bronze, as it needs to draw well. And perhaps, if it were thin, it would break. And it would make large wounds.
Cupping on the legs draws blood openly, as they draw blood from the entire body, and are effective for old pains in the kidneys, bladder, and urethra, and relieve the symptoms.
And they are placed at the two knees and the two ankles, but they weaken the body after prolonged use, and cause swelling in several conditions.
The manner of applying the cupping is to first place it empty, and suck gently, and apply it quickly, and move it evenly, and do not cease from this until you see the area reddened and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears.
Then remove it and replace the cupping glasses, and watch the condition of the body, because some people have tender flesh, and delicate pores. So it is necessary to strike only once, and it is necessary to make wide wounds, and a little deep. And suck gently.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to strike twice. The first time to thin the thick blood's path.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to strike a third time.
And when we want to draw blood little by little, we need only one strike. And if we want a lot of blood, we should start again often.
And if the blood is thick, strike deep, so that the heart is pierced suddenly, and it is necessary for those with thick, hard skin, and narrow pores, that you anoint the places of the cupping glasses with an appetizing and dissolving oil: if it is in a state, of violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil;
and if it is in winter, of cress oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or something similar.
And if the superfluities are thick and cold, take bitter oil, or balsam oil, or anise oil, and the like.
And if the one being treated has tender skin and wide pores, one should not put any oil on it, but it should be washed after the cupping with rose water, or cold water, or mulberry water, or pumpkin water, or porcelain water, or something similar.
And he who has much moisture, should rise from juice, or myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick superfluities should rise from old wine, or buckthorn water, or an anise or chamomile decoction, or other similar things;
and one should not be cupped with a cupping glass before a bath or in a bath, but after the bath an hour or two;
and do not sleep after the cupping, and it is necessary that he washes himself, when he is to be cupped and when he is cupped.
And beware if the one who is bled is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; if it is necessary that he take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces in the shade, and similar things; and eat young fruits, and the meat of the hare, and moist meats.
and eat young fruits, and the meat of the hare, and moist meats. And he who has a cold complexion, let him take syrup of honey, and fragrant wine of medium age, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat young fruits and small birds and pigeons;
and on the day that he will be purged, he should drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give some men sometimes treacle or nutmeg before the purging, or afterwards, to strengthen the main limbs; and the blood should be thinned, but it is not at all fitting that those who are hot should drink it.
Cupping that is placed without striking is that which is placed on the liver, and on the spleen, and gout, and on the belly and the bowels and kidneys and the hip, for those limbs do not tolerate being struck upon them, and one does not do this otherwise than to draw blood from limb to limb, just as we place it on the breasts when the nipple bleeds;
to remove the viscosity that is in the limb, just as we place cupping on the belly and on the bowels to reduce the limb;
and it removes the pain, when there is obstruction or stone, so it removes by its attractive virtue perhaps the obstruction, or dislodges the stone from its place;
and thus does it when it is placed on the liver and on the spleen when there is retained wind, and these cuppings are administered empty to suck only; and sometimes are administered with fire, and sometimes full of warm water, just as in diseases of the pleurisy, and in such a manner that one fills the cupping with warm water alone, or with water in which one has boiled suitable herbs to this.
The form of the cupping administered with fire is this:
And have two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and have on the side near the middle one small hole, as if to put a needle, and be of bronze, smooth beforehand so that it does not hurt the patient when placed on the limb;
and have in the middle a crossbar of bronze or iron, to place a lit candle, and there be both large and small according to the illnesses and the age of those who take them;
for the cuppings of children are different from those of the old, and of the thin from the fat.
And one must thus place this cupping on the limb:
Take the candle of wax or liniment, and place it inside the cupping through the bar that is inside the cupping, so that the light is at the bottom of the cupping, so that it does not burn the patient;
and then put it on the limb, and your fingers be on the opening that we have mentioned, so that when one wishes, the vapor goes out, and one removes the cupping;
and one takes the liniment as before, and recommences it often, if you need to.
In the cupping therefore, which is administered in a disease of pleurisy, with acute pain, there is no bar nor opening, and is administered only when it is full of water, and is placed on the limb simply;
and this is the form:
Leech are only administered in limbs where one cannot put cupping because of their smallness, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places bare of flesh, such as the toe or the nose, and other similar places;
and the quality of their use is that when you find leeches that are in clear, sweet, clean water without injury, then take them;
and put them in fresh water for a while, until they are full and have nothing in their bellies; and then be bled from a vein and cupped, then rub the limb until it is red, and put the leeches on;
and when they are full and fall off, if it's a place where a cupping glass can be applied, then apply it, for this is very useful.
If not, then remove the area, and then with water, very well, and then squeeze it;
and if the area bleeds too much after the leeches, then soak a linen cloth in cold water and put it on, until the blood is stopped;
and if the blood is excessive, then put ground vitriol, or galena, and similar things on it, until it is stopped;
or you put half of peeled beans on the area, and leave them until they are scorched to the area, then it will stop now;
and if you need more, then take other leeches.
And if the leeches don't want to take hold, rub the area with fresh blood, or you stick a needle in it until blood comes out, and then put them on, and as soon as they feel the blood, they will stick;
And when you want them to fall off, sprinkle a little powdered aloes and salt, or ashes, on top, and they will fall off now.
Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and is for the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that fools mock this chapter, as if they never saw any of the ancient books, nor read any letters in them.
And for this reason, the science is estranged in our land, for I never found any good one.
and I know nothing about it, except through the knowledge of ancient books, where I have studied so much that I have mastered the science, and through experiment, and through the habit of my life.
And I have here described in this chapter what is contained in it, and have summarized it at the end, and have clearly shown the shapes of the instruments that are used, as I have done in these two chapters before.
It is therefore necessary that we state in the prologue of this book the essence of the discourse and the chapters where the wise man focuses his understanding, and remains on the truth, so that those who are tested can know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a break or dislocation or twist or fracture occurs to anyone, you should quickly bleed the patient on one side and the other, if nothing prevents you from doing so, such as weakness of the body, or children, or the elderly. or if the weather is not very hot, or too cold;
and avoid cold foods, that is to say cold meats, and the flesh of birds and young deer, and drink no wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and do not overeat foods that fill the veins with blood, lest you fear a hot abscess, or the spreading of matter in the limb.
If the patient returns to his former condition.
And when the broken bone begins to heal, the patient should be nourished with foods that promote fattening, or that have viscosity, such as boiled wheat in water, and rice, and porridge, and veal, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment, the break repairs more quickly.
And know that broken bones of the old and decrepit do not easily heal according to their nature because of the dryness of their limbs, nor those that are too tender, such as the bones of young children;
but there is a cure; reset the broken bone, using strong bandages that hold and join the limb together, until it is as strong as it was before; and do not disturb its work, and for this, it needs to be nourished with rich foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For a fracture of the head is different from a fracture of the arm or leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures. For there is a fracture that goes outwards and another inwards, like the tip of a feather for writing.
For there is a fracture that goes outwards and another inwards, like the tip of a feather for writing. And there is a fracture with a wound, and a fracture with just a small crack.
And each manner has its own device and its own proper instrument in restoration, according to what the memory brings to its place;
And a fracture of the bone is known by the fact that the place is twisted, and it is clearly visible through the skin, and it sounds when pressed with the hand;
And when there is no twisting or sound on touching, and the patient does not feel much pain, there is no fracture;
But there may well be twisting, or a crack, or a small fracture. Therefore, you should not move it with your hand, but apply the medicines that come next, and then gently hold it still.
And know that a fracture that is in the joint, and the two parts are separated, they must now be placed in equal alignment, lest a hot abscess come about;
and if a hot abscess comes, leave it for a day or so, until the abscess is calmed;
then put it back into alignment as easily and wisely as you can, and know that the restoration of this is easier than the restoration of one where there are pieces;
then hold it still, as is necessary afterwards.
And if in the bone there are broken pieces, if it is a hand or foot, or with your hand if it is a small limb, or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand;
and put the limb back into its natural shape, so that when the broken parts of the limb are separated, you bring all the additions back into their places as best you can, and take care that through your work, no injury or pain comes to the patient;
and well join the two ends of the bones according to the best shapes.
And feel it well with your hand if it seems to you that it is not quite right:
if you straighten it well, and do not bind it too tightly, nor press it as those do whose work causes a hot abscess and contraction in the limb, as we have often seen.
And when the limb is in place, you must carefully restrain the patient so that he does not move it, neither while waking nor while sleeping, nor while turning, nor in any other manner; and carefully watch that the limb is so secure that he feels no pain. For when he feels no pain, it is not yet properly set, and it must be put in such a position that he feels no pain;
and carefully watch that the limb is so secure that he feels no pain. For when he feels no pain, it is not yet properly set, and it must be put in such a position that he feels no pain; and watch that it is placed correctly, so that no crookedness arises when it is restored;
and the quality of the fractured limb is according to what I have told you.
Know that fractured limbs are diverse in smallness and in largeness and in shape.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and similar things: so it is necessary to wrap them in soft and subtle linen cloths; and those which are large, such as thighs and legs:
so it is necessary to wrap them in a wide and hard bandage, because the wide bandage embraces the whole large limb, and binds it tightly on all sides equally, so that there is no bruise;
then tie around light cloths, three or four turns according to the limb, and tighten your hand a little on the whole bandage, then go above the fracture and tighten less, so the fracture moves away a little;
and soften the bandage little by little, until you take a large part of the healthy place, then take another bandage and turn around again over the fractured place;
then go again to the part below the fracture, and tighten it moderately, neither too tight nor too loose, as we said in the first bandage above;
then put linen cloths or cloths between the bandages, until it is all even, then tie everything over the bandage, and then place your well-made plasters on top, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or an abscess, place something to soothe the abscess, hot, and that removes the swelling, and leave it thus for a few days;
then place plasters over the dressings, and let them be half the width of a well-cut cane, or of the wood from which cleaves are made, or of palm fronds, and they should be according to this figure:
but it is necessary that the plaster placed over the fracture be a little larger and wider than the others;
and be also as long as is suitable for the limb's size, whether small or large; then apply plasters over the dressings as you did in the first dressing, then tie a bandage over them, just as in the first dressing over the fracture; tighter at the top, gradually looser;
and the bandages should be of medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin, and made of soft linen;
for if the bandages are thick, like the works of fools who make their dressings from twisted linen ropes, and that is a great error, for the dressing cannot be even if it is too thin, and it is not suitable for there to be less than a finger's width of space between each dressing.
And if the patient is wounded by the edges of the dressings after tightening in healthy places, place linen or wool padding under them so that he is not hurt.
When the wound is with a fracture, and the bone is broken, I will discuss the treatment later.
And know that it is not suitable to bandage all the broken limbs on the first day. For when the limb is large, you should not put bandages on it tightly until after five or seven days, or more, according to your certainty about a hot abscess occurring.
And see here the method of ancient plasters for restoring fractures, dislocations, and twisting injuries:
and it is that you take flour that is kept on the walls of the mill, and mix it with abundant eggs, and apply this mixture, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it, and this is the common method of the plaster that restores the fracture in many ways, and especially for women and small children, for it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another method of plaster restoring the fracture and dislocation and twisting: take three abareis and ladani and enule and asefetide and gum arabic and mugat, each of ten ounces; myrrh and aloes, each five ounces; alechil eight ounces; and make it into powder, and mix it with the white of an egg; if the man's complexion is hot, then use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and quickly restores broken bones, and is valuable to many men.
Another type of plaster that is good for sprains: take mugwort and marshmallow, each ten ounces; myrrh and aloes, each nine ounces; frankincense six ounces; Armenian bole ten ounces, and grind well, and mix with water or egg white, and administer.
Another way of a plaster for joints and bones separated from their place, and soothes the pain that arises, and the bone cuts and the fracture: Take new wool, and soak it in warm oil and cooked oil, and put it on the affected area.
These plasters do not restore, but they are good for easing a hot abscess, and properly remove the pains.
Another way of plaster that restores broken bones: Take dried fig leaves and leaves of earth-wort, and grind them together, and make a plaster.
Another way of plaster for the restoration of a broken bone and to reduce the remaining abscess. Take root of mallow, chamomile, violet flowers, and vetch flour, of each one part;
and grind, and mix with wine, and if the limb is inflamed, then mix with moist coriander water, or water, and use it.
Another way of a stronger plaster than the first, when a hard abscess comes to the restoration of the limb. Take roots of mallow, and flaxseed, balaustine, melilot, and sanicle, and violet flowers and chamomile, of all in equal parts; and grind, and mix with salt water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb, and its rest.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not put on a broken limb to restore strength anything but a cerote made of wax and oil, and nothing else, and he says that it should be neither too soft nor too hard.
And Galen seems to say that one should put on a broken limb, for restoration, somewhat dry and warm things, such as myrrh and aloes and frankincense and similar things, as we have said.
Another type of poultice that is good for injury and pain: Take mugwort and men's shaved heads, or bird feathers, and mallow, and rue equally, and grind them, and make a poultice and apply it.
And then remove it a little later, and be careful that the patient feels no pain, and that the bone has not shifted from its place; If not, do not remove it for several days. And if pain, itching, restlessness, or swelling come to the place, hasten and remove the poultice immediately.
and take a light cloth and a damp sea sponge, and dip it in water, and apply it to the place, until the itching ceases, and the pain is calmed; then let the limb rest for an hour, then apply dry wool, soaked in water or rose oil, and bind it for a night, until you are sure of a hot abscess.
and the inflammation of the limb subsides, and the pain is removed, then reapply the subtle bandage and a little poultice, and do not bind it so tightly as before; and continue until it is healed.
And if you see that the hot abscess, redness, pain, and swelling have all been removed, and you need a poultice and a bandage, then reapply them as you first did.
And if nothing from what we have said happens to the limb, do not unbind it until after 3 or 4 or 5 or 7 days. and sometimes leave it for 20 days, depending on what is seen, until the fracture is healed, and the flesh's alignment approaches the normal.
Then restrain it more than before, and the limb increases its flesh, as I have said before.
And if you see the place drying more than is necessary, know that nourishment cannot come there. Apply warm water to it every time you unbind it, and this should be every third day, and loosen the bandage slightly.
By this work, therefore, nourishment comes to the limb, and quickly amends what foolish doctors do, who restore the limb incorrectly.
That is bad, and it is a fearful practice, and I see no other course than to leave it alone and work correctly.
Many types of fractures exist, and diverse shapes, and their causes are distinct;
For there are fractures caused by sword blows, and the collarbone breaks all the bone down to the surface beneath the bone, just as a hatchet or a shaft does; and for this reason this type of fracture is called "hatchet-shaped".
Where the sword cuts the bone through from above, and this type of fracture is called "complete";
and the wound of these two fractures is large or small.
And if there is a penetrating blow, or a fracture, or a blow from a stone, or from falling on stone, or other similar things.
And if there is a penetrating fracture, which approaches the tissue beneath the bone, or is on the bone, and this wound is either large or small.
And if there is a wound that penetrates the bone as thin as a hair, and the fracture is small, and for this reason, this fracture is called "hairline";
and if the wound is made either by hitting with a stone, or by falling, or by a similar thing, and pushes a piece of bone inward, and the place bulges as when potters strike their pots; if between the stones inside.
And this happens more to those who have soft or moist bones, such as the head of a child;
and happens to all these kinds of fractures that small pieces are detached like splinters; and I will speak in its place.
And we recognize all kinds of fractures by the pull on them, and the examination of the coverings, and by the corrupt flesh that is on top.
The fracture is recognized by this, that when one has uncovered the bone, and rubs over it, the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of the fracture, watch for the patient's complications, and if you see any bad complications, such as vomiting of bile, and loss of consciousness, and extension, and paleness, and fever, and the eyes becoming inflamed and red, and other similar complications in various conditions, it cannot heal without a doubt.
And if you do not see a frightening complication, and you hope for recovery, then begin the treatment.
And when the wounded person comes to you first, and it is in winter, you should remove the bone before the fourteenth day if you can.
And if it is in summer, hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the tissue under the bone becomes corrupted, and the complications we have mentioned come about.
And if the fracture of the bone reaches the tissue that covers the brain, you must cut the fractured part like this:
and that you take the head of the wounded patient, and uncover the bone in every way you can, and gently over the wound's shape, and if a discharge of blood comes when uncovering the bone, or a hot abscess, assist them with what is necessary, and that you fill the place with cloths soaked in rose oil; and keep the wound at rest until the hot abscess is calmed, and be sure of a discharge of blood; then begin to remove the bone, and it is done according to two methods of work:
One method is that you cut to a narrow incision beforehand, and this is the form:
And then make a second incision larger than the first.
And the second method is that you have a number of different incisions, some narrow and others wide, and they are pointed, and made of hardened iron;
and work lightly, so that you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is hard and tough, you must pierce around it, before you administer incisions with drills, not deep enough to pierce beyond the bone of the skull, and there should be a margin or circle above the point that prevents the point from passing beyond the bone;
and you must have several, so that each comes to its place in the thickness of the bone, so that you have drills for all skulls;
and this is the form of the three types of drills:
The quality for piercing around the broken bone is that you place a drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced;
then reposition the drill slightly afterwards, and do this all around, then cut with the incisions the space of the bone that is between the holes, and do this more subtly than you can, and lightly, as we have said, until you draw the bone out with your hand, or with any of the tools you have such as tongs, pincers;
and be careful that you do not touch the brain nor the surface.
And when you have pierced and drawn out the bone, it is necessary that you remove the residue that remains of the bone with any other tool similar to a knife, but it must be finer and more subtle than the other knife;
and if anything of the small bones or any scales remain, remove them gently with one of the tools; then treat the wound with poultices and ointments that we have described.
And the other method of work is that which Galen says, which is safer; and the wound heals very quickly, and that is his word. It is necessary first that you expose a part of the bone, where the fracture is apparent, so that when you have exposed that part, you place under the head of this incisor, lenticular, of which this is the form:
And do not cut only on one side, and the part is sharp on two sides, so that the blade is towards the bone;
then strike with a small mallet from above, so that you gently cut the bone all around, and take good care of the cloth that is beneath;
if it is adhered to the bone, then remove it gently, for it is removed well without harm and without fear.
And if the bone fracture does not pierce the cloth, and the bone is cut only from above, and there are small pieces, then you must remove the roughness, and remove the scales with a fine rasp, of which you should have various sizes, to administer the most appropriate one to each place, according to the work and the shape of the fracture.
So use first larger rasps, and then finer ones, and do not cease from this until it is well.
In each of the other cuts and subtle fractures, you must administer the cause according to its direction;
and this is something that is not easy for the one who has devoted their study to this art.
And if the surface is exposed, you must take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and moisten it in rose oil, and place it over the wound; then take another cloth doubled in two or three, and moisten it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do this as gently as possible, so as not to burden the surface, then apply another bandage, and do not bind it too tightly except just enough to hold the wound;
and leave it thus for one or two days, until the hot abscess is calmed, then remove it, and apply medicines such as lily roots, and vetch flour, and frankincense powder, and aristolochia, and similar things;
and from these things make powder, and apply to the wound, and apply medicines frequently without causing pain;
and watch that the wound is kept clean, that you do not leave ointment on it, or allow pus to collect, for when pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it will rot and fester, and great harm will come to the patient;
for when one applies a corrosive substance to the surface, it burns from above. Therefore, beware, if any bad accident comes to the patient, as we have said, it is undoubtedly dangerous.
And if blackening does not appear other than from the medicine applied, if such a virtue it has, you must take one part of honey, and three parts of rose oil, and put them in a cloth, and place it on the surface; then treat it with the methods of treatment that are appropriate, until it is healed.
Know that sometimes the two parts of the nose are broken, or one part only, for these are two bones;
and the one underneath is cartilaginous, and does not break, unless bent or twisted, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, you must put your little finger into the nostril, and place the broken part against your index finger, and with your thumb opposing it, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and watch that the patient feels no pain from your work.
And if the break is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach the place, you must place it even with the head of a slightly thick reed.
And if the break is in two parts, do the same again, and hurry to restore it on the first day, if you can;
otherwise, after the seventh or tenth day, when the inflamed abscess has calmed down, then tie linen strips to the head of the nose, if the break is in one part.
Or you put one on the other side, if the break is there; and let the strips be so large that they fill the holes of the nose.
And some healers say that the strips should be soaked in butter, and changed every day. It does not seem to me that this is right, but they should be soaked in a concoction of egg white and ground powder; then leave the strip in place until the bone is firm and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes goose feathers are placed in the nose in place of strips, and a soft bandage is wrapped around it, and the fracture is held, and the patient breathes through it; or do whatever you want.
And if boils come up in the nose while you are working on it, put a plaster or moistened cotton in rose oil, or a bit of diachylon.
And if boils do not come up, put a plaster on the outside, of ground cumin, and incense powder, mixed with a bit of egg white, then put light bandages on it, and do not bind the nose tightly.
and if the nose fracture is small, and it is broken into small pieces, remove it with suitable instruments, then suture the fracture, and cure it with substances for healing flesh, and stitching, as with plasters and ointments suitable for it;
and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with compresses and put lead strips on it until it is healed.
When the jaw is fractured from the inside, and there is no outside wound, and the fracture is only on the outside, and it is not broken in two, except for bumps inside, it is easily recognized.
It is necessary, if the fracture is on the right side, that you put your index finger into the patient's mouth; and if the fracture is on the left jaw, place your right index finger inside, and gently push the fracture inward, and hold it from the outside with the other hand, and make it even.
And if the jaw fracture is separated into two, you must apply extension from two sides, until they are even.
And if there is movement or fracture of the teeth, bind them with a gold, silver, or silk thread, then apply a plaster to the broken jaw and place a double cloth over it; and place a large, well-made splint, or a piece of leather, equal in length and width to the jaw, and bind it as firmly as you can, and instruct the patient to rest and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape changes, untie it on the third day, and then restore what has changed. and apply a plaster, of mill powder with plenty of egg or chickpea flour, after you have removed the plaster;
and place a light wool over the plaster, and if the plaster dries and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until he is healed; Many times he is healed in three weeks.
And if a hot abscess comes, administer what we have said many times.
And if there is a fracture and wound together, check if any piece of bone has been removed; so subtle as to remove with suitable instruments for this.
And if the wound is narrow, widen it with fire according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remains, stitch the wound, if it is large, and apply suitable dressings to it, to induce flesh, until it is healed.
The forceps break several times before, towards the shoulder, and the fracture is in three ways:
where it is broken and separated into two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore;
where there is a fracture with a wound.
And the work is like this when the fracture is without a wound, that you have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder that feels the broken forceps; and the other extends the neck towards the part;
then place the fracture with your fingers, so that the shape is as it should be, and there is neither appearance nor deviation.
And if you need to extend it further, place a round sphere of cloth, or wool, under the patient's shoulder, and it should be thick according to your need; and extend and lift the forceps, and hold the sphere in your hand, so that you place the fracture straight, as it should be.
And if you cannot pull the head of the forceps out, because it has gone deep, then the patient must lie often on their back, and place a medium pillow under the shoulder, and let the assistant push the shoulder down, until the bone of the forceps is lifted.
And then straighten the fracture with your fingers, and if you find it fractured, you must split it.
and gently pull the pieces apart, and if the bone cannot join together by any effort, cut it with one of the scalpels you have; but that you place this instrument under the forceps, to protect the surface:
and it resembles a spoon, and is not sharp, and should be as wide as necessary, according to the size of the bone and the power of the work;
and have two heads, as you see, and one is wide, and the other narrow, as is the break in the wound you made when you pulled the bones;
and when you are certain of a hot abscess, then cauterize the wound, and if the break is small, or you doubt a hot abscess, then fill the wound with bandages and tents, according to its quantity.
And if a hot abscess comes, soak the bandages in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and put it on.
The tightening of the bone, when it is without wounds and without cuts, is that you place on the bone a plaster of mill powder and egg white, and put light bandages on, and put a sphere under the splint, if you need it; Then take a very large bandage, one palm wide, then place a double bandage over the bandages, and the plaster; Then take a thin stick three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around that bandage, so that the end of the bandage hangs down; and place the stick over the fracture, and turn the bandage over the shoulder, and under the healthy armpit, and under the diseased armpit; and reset it from each part, and when you see that the binding holds the fracture properly, and you see clearly that the stick does not move from the broken bone, then watch it every day, and when the binding loosens, then tighten it;
and have the patient lie on their back, and place a small pillow under the armpit when he sleeps, to raise the shoulder; This will lessen the fracture's force through the elevation of the shoulder, or you bind the arm to the shoulder, and do not untie it unless bad events occur, for up to twenty days;
then recommence the poultice, if you see that it needs it, and tighten and loosen it thus, until it is restored;
and it is restored in the most cases in twenty-eight days, and in fewer in some men.
of the fracture of the shoulder
Sometimes the shoulder breaks in a wide place or in the middle, and one does not know it is broken except by touching it;
if you align it according to the shape of the fracture, and reposition it according to its natural form, in all the ways you can;
then place on the area flour from the mill with plenty of egg, and light bandages, and put over it a double cloth; then place over it a large and subtle splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if under the splint there is a gap in any part of the shoulder, fill that gap with flax bandages, so that the splint lies evenly;
and then bind it all with a strong bandage firmly, so that the splint does not move from its place, and observe the bandage every day;
and every time it softens, bind it, and make the splint even if it is out of place, and let the patient lie on his side;
and the shoulder is restored in 20 days or 25.
And when this number is completed, then unbind it, and be sure, for it is not bone that easily goes out of place.
And if a piece of bone sticks out, and is under the skin, then cut it open, and remove it, and do what we have said about treating a hot abscess in a broken forceps.
of the broken breast.
The breast is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely. But it often breaks on the outside.
And when it is broken in the middle, it sinks downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and shortness of breath, and sickness, and perhaps vomits blood, and the broken bone's edges show, and one can feel it well.
And the restoration is that the patient often lies on their back, and one places a cushion between their shoulders, then presses the shoulders together, and brings the ribs of the two sides together with your hands, and carefully adjusts it in all the ways you can, until the bone's shape is as it should be;
Then put plasters and bandages over the subtle splint of salt, or other light wood, and wrap it in a cloth, and bind it over the broken bone, so that it does not move. and turn the bandage round the back, and bind it properly, and check the bandage every hour, and if it loosens, tighten it;
and if it needs loosening, because of corruption or itching that comes to the place, or pain or abscess, then hurry, and loosen it, and remove the plaster, and apply whatever remedies are appropriate;
then replace the plaster, and tighten it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the ribs
Know that the fracture of the ribs happens mostly in the thick parts behind the back, and in the upper part, and they only bend because they are brittle; and one feels it well by examining the sides.
And the restoration is that you align the fracture, as is proper. And then apply a plaster, and bind it tightly with a bandage, if you need to.
And if the fracture of the ribs is leaning inwards, the patient feels extreme pain and sharp stabbing, just like a stab wound, because the bone pierces the tissue; and gasps for breath, and coughs and vomits up a large amount of blood, and it is a serious illness, and the ancients devised great remedies for it.
And some say that one should administer foods that inflate the belly, to push the fracture outward.
We do not do that, lest a hot abscess form, if one has not already formed. And if one has formed, then treat it.
And some of you say that one places leeches on the area, to draw out the blood strongly, and that seems reasonable. However, there is doubt that the leech will draw out the superfluities to the area because of the weakness of the disposition.
And some of you say that one should cover the area with wool soaked in hot oil, and one places bandages between the ribs to evenly bind it around, then it should be treated with pleurisy treatment, with food, and medicine.
And if the patient feels great pain that he cannot bear because the bone is piercing the flesh, and doubt is on the patient, then it is necessary to cut above the area of the broken rib, and it is necessary to place instruments underneath to protect the surface.
And then one must cut the bone, and draw it slightly, and then stitch the two edges of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters, until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess comes, then put cloths moistened in rose oil on the area.
and treat the area as is appropriate for an abscess, and let him lie often on his side where it should be, until he is healed.
and also to the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you wish to know if they will be healed or not, be watchful if you see their hands soft and swollen and dead, and cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, they do not feel it.
Know that it is mortal in many dispositions, and if they move and feel well when squeezed and pricked, know that the joint of the bone is safe, and that the patient will be cured if a cure is applied.
And if a similar thing happens to the spine of the back, and you wish to know if they will be healed or not, be watchful if the feet are softened, and if the accidents are there that are in the hands, and on the back there is wind and expulsion without will;
and when it is laid upon their stomach, there is expulsion without will. And when it is laid upon their back and they wish to sit up, they cannot. Know that it is mortal: so do not labor in its cure.
And if these accidents do not come upon them, then the thing is less serious.
And the treatment is that if there is a hot abscess, you should apply rose oil or egg oil to it until it is soothed;
then place a comforting and drying plaster on it, and bandage it, and instruct the patient to rest; and do not sleep on the part where he feels pain, until he is healed.
And if any bone is separated, then it is necessary to cut on the side of the heart; and remove the bone, then bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with stitches, and then treat it with a healing ointment until it is healed;
and if the bone's head is broken, which is called the "head of the thigh," then put your left thumb on it, and align it with your right hand as best you can, then apply the plaster and bandage as needed;
then bind it, and if there is a separated bone, then cut it open, and remove it, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the fracture of the hip bone
Sometimes it happens that the hip bone is broken, and if it happens, there is little reduction at the head; and cuts lengthwise, and bends inwards, and causes the patient pain at the site, and a prickling, and swelling of the broken part.
And the restoration is that you stretch your hand above, so that you are above the fracture; and know what the fracture is and its form;
and if the fracture is only at the head, then set that fracture even, so that it is in its natural form.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it bends inward, then lay the patient on his stomach, until the restoration of that fracture is apparent to you. And when you have made it even, then place the plaster over it, then put a splint of wood or of leather over it, and bind the fracture so that it does not move;
and fill the space beneath the ribs, so that the limb is even. And instruct the patient to sleep on his healthy side, or on his back.
And if a hot abscess comes there, do not touch it, until the hot abscess is calmed, and place on it what we have previously said; and then return to the restoration, and bind it as is necessary, if there is no bad accident;
of the fracture of the shoulder
The shoulder is that which is between the ribs and the head of the shoulder, and if it is broken, it should be restored according to one of the two methods:
one of which is that you take a stick of medium thickness, according to this form:
And tie two strings to the two ends, and hang them up, and let the patient sit on a seat;
then place the broken arm on the stick, so that it reaches the armpit, and have a curved piece of wood in the middle, then hang it on something heavy or the attendant stretches it downwards;
then let the attendant align the break with their hands together, until the break returns as it should.
And another way is that one supports the patient on a support, and ties the hand to their neck, then instructs two attendants that one should hold that which is above the break with their hands, and the other should hold below on the entire length, and each stretches to their part.
And if you want the extraction to be stronger, tighten one string below the break, and one above the break, and each of the attendants stretches to their side.
And if the break is close to the shoulder joint, you must place one string under the armpit, and another towards the side, beneath the break;
and also if the break is towards the side, a light string must be placed gently, without effort, until the break is aligned above the place, and above the side;
then align the break as it should be, and tighten it, if no abscesses occur.
And if a hot abscess comes, do not tighten it for seven days, and place moistened wool in oil and rose oil until the hot abscess is calmed;
then tighten it, and the manner of tightening it is that you place the plaster over the break, then assemble the arm over the shoulder, and place your hand on the shoulder or on the chest;
and apply the bandage, and tighten over the shoulder and over the arm, so that the arm is in the place of the shoulder blade, if nothing prevents it, or if the bone is not displaced.
And if you doubt that the bone will move, then use splints, and place a splint wider and stronger than the others over the break, and let there be one finger's width of space between each splint, and let each splint be so large that it extends three fingers' width beyond the break on each side;
then tighten over the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter about the break, more strongly and less as it extends.
And if you see the positioning of the splints, and the tightening, as we have said, during the time you are restoring the broken limb, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave it to be bound until the seventh day, as we have said;
then check the bandage every three days, to see if there is any itching or swelling, or that the nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight. If it straightens, as we have said.
And if no such accidents occur, do not loosen it until after three days or more, and let the patient sleep on their back, and have their hands on their stomach;
and place a cushion full of wool beneath the shoulder, and watch every hour of the day or night that the shape of the broken limb does not move, or that the bandages do not loosen;
if it straightens by the virtue of medicine, and give him the food that we have previously mentioned, in such a way that the food is initially subtle; and when he begins to recover, let it be thick.
And it is customary that the shoulder and leg should be recovered in forty days altogether; and then one should release it and administer baths and medicinal ointments to straighten the place.
And if the constriction is severe and swollen, it remains unreleased for ten days or two months.
of the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "forearm bones", of which one is smaller, and is the one that supports the wrist;
and the other is large, and is the one that is underneath, next to the little finger;
Perhaps only the large forearm bone is broken, or the small one, and perhaps both together.
When the small forearm bone is broken, the restoration is slight, and the healing;
and when the large one is broken, the healing is bad, and worse than when they are both broken together.
If it is the small forearm bone that is broken alone, then it needs to be gently straightened slightly, and placed straight.
And if it is the large forearm bone, then it needs to be held tighter;
and stretch it over a cushion, and hold the thumb of the hand higher than the others, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and let the patient lie across himself, and the cushion in front of him higher, so that the patient does not suffer any labor;
then the minister should extend their arm to the part under his hand, or to a bandage, and another minister to the other above.
And then the physician should put it straight, according to its best form.
And if in the fracture there are pieces, then put each in its place, and if there is any separated one that pricks the heart, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut it open and remove it, as we have said before.
And if with the fracture there is a wound, I have spoken of it in the separate chapter; so take the treatment.
And if in the beginning of the restoration there are hot abscesses, then apply a plaster of cerote made of rose oil and white wax, neither too hard nor too soft; and bind the plaster carefully, until the hot abscesses are calmed.
And then remove the plaster, and put the poultice of mill powder with abundant egg, then put the splints, and let the splint of the fracture be stronger, and a little wider than the others;
and know that there should be six splints or arms in several positions: whether the fracture is in one of the bones, or in two;
and hold it more tightly over the fracture than elsewhere, and gradually less as it moves away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and let the bandages over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough;
and let the bandages over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and let the thread, with which it is tied, be linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And observe the limb and the bandage after several days. And if any bad accident happens to the limb, such as itching that comes to the limb, then you must wash the limb with hot water until the itching is calmed;
and let the limb rest neither too tightly nor too loosely.
And then reapply the binding, and if the bandage is softened and the bone separated, or something similar, then adjust it.
And be careful that nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight, then you must loosen it a little, and leave it like that for several days, until the nourishment flows, and then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have said happens to the patient, then do not loosen it until twenty days.
or, in the meantime, the patient hangs their arms around their neck, and their neck should be level, and they must avoid movement and fidgeting, and sleep on their back;
and know that this fracture is restored in thirty or thirty-five days, and perhaps in twenty days, according to the combinations and the complexions of the virtues.
of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and on the fingers there are few fractures, and there is often only bending.
And when the palm of the hand is fractured or bent, the patient must sit cross-legged, and sit straight in front of him evenly;
then place his hand upon a flat surface, and the minister should extend the broken bones, and the minister should align them until they are well joined;
and apply the plaster and bandages, if no abscess forms, then place a splint according to the size of the area; and be wrapped in a linen cloth.
And if the fracture is inside around the sole of the foot, make a circle of cloths and instruct the patient to apply it to his fractured foot; and then bind it with a long cloth, and let the splint be soft leather as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it as is appropriate.
And if the fracture is on the outside, you must place a splint above, and another below, on the sole, so that the hand is open and straight, then bind it entirely around the hand, and bandage the area between the fingers.
And if the fracture is in any of the bones of the fingers, if it is the knuckle, then set it straight, as is appropriate; and bind it with a bandage, and if you wish, place a small straight splint to lift the fracture, and do not move it;
and if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as the index finger or one of the others, set it straight and bind it with the healthy finger next to it; or bind them all together in a position that holds them still, or you put a splint on them, as on the knuckle;
and take care in the restoration and arrangement of hot abscesses, and treat what comes of it, as I have said.
The bone of the thigh is often broken, and it is clearly seen when it turns forward and backward;
and the restoration is done by binding a bandage over the fracture, and another under it. And the patient lies on his face, then each attendant extends their bandage equally on their side;
and this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
And if the fracture is near the root of the thigh, one bandage should be towards the groin, and the other bandage under the fracture.
And also if it is near the knee, then the bandage should be beside the knee, and the extension should be below;
then the surgeon should align the bone with both hands, so that it is according to its natural form, and then apply the plaster, and bandage it, if an abscess does not appear there.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it calm down, then return to your work and your treatment; The bandage is done in such a way.
You must wrap over the fracture with one hard bandage doubled in two or three, and let the excess remain, then turn the leg so that the heel comes to the root of the thigh, and insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg, below the knee, and let the thread's ends come above;
then wrap the bandage around the leg and thigh, then place splints over the fracture, and place a splint over the leg bone;
then fill the empty space between the leg and thigh with soft cloth to evenly distribute the pressure, then begin to tightly bind three or four turns over the fracture; and the higher you go over the fracture, the less you tighten it;
then tie the two ends of the thread that you put between the leg and the thigh, and tie three splints that are above, then go back to below the thread's end, until you get next to the foot;
and tighten it so that it does not move from its place, then leave it like that, so that neither an abscess nor swelling nor other such thing comes. And if it happens, untie it, and treat what comes, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of bone that prick, it needs to be treated, if one can; and if one cannot, then one must split the place and pull out the foreign object; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken in this way, so that splints are placed on it, as in the shoulder and the arm;
However, in the restoration so made, the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in ten days, or a little less or a little more, according to the diversities of the constitutions.
Know that in the joint of the knee there is little breaking, but it bends many times.
And if it breaks, it is never more than a crack, or a hole, and it happens in any wound, and without a wound, and this is well sensed.
And the restoration is done by putting together the broken pieces as best as possible, until they are joined.
then apply a plaster, and place a round bandage if needed, and bind it as appropriate, then review all the preparations we have mentioned for other fractures, like a hot abscess and similar conditions. apply whatever is necessary for each accident, until it is healed.
of the broken leg
Know that there are two bones in the leg, one called the "shinbone", and the other called the "fibula".
and every type of fracture occurs as it does in the arm, and therefore the restoration is similar to that of the arm, and the work is the same. And if both bones are broken together, the leg turns in all directions.
And if the smaller bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the large bone is broken, great pain is felt, and it is clearly seen. and it turns downwards.
Then administer extension, and align it, and bind the splints equally;
However, if the fracture is severe, and there are several pieces, the extension should be less and lighter; and treat it according to your skill.
And when you have completed all your work, take two bundles of wooden splints that hold the leg on each side, and are the length of the leg from the knee down;
then wrap it in two places with one bandage above and below, and tie it in the middle as well. With this tying the leg will not be able to move to the right or the left, and thus it is well done;
and some administer one splint the length of the leg, made of wood, and place the leg on it to prevent movement.  This is done properly in a fracture where there is a wound;
and move the leg each day to see if there is a hot abscess or other accident; if treat it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the bones of the foot
At the ankle there is no fracture, but to the bones of the foot sometimes comes a fracture and to the toes a slight break, and there is no force except a crack in several positions.
And if a fracture occurs to the bones of the foot, and you see these bones rising above each other, then place the patient's foot on the ground, as if they were going to walk, and then place your foot on theirs, over where the bones are raised, then press until they return to their places;
then place the plaster and bandages on, and put under the sole of the foot a small board two spans long, then bind it to the foot securely, after you have wrapped cloths around, and other things you need.
And when three or four days have passed, then untie the bandage, for you will find the bones aligned, whether fractured or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are fractured, then set them, as we have said for the toes of the hand; then place a splint along the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider, then place under the foot the board I mentioned, and bind it securely;
and if there are two or three, or more, fractured, then place a splint on each toe according to its size, wrapped in one linen cloth, and bind the board under the foot; and let it be positioned over the head of the board, so that it holds the sole of the foot well.
And you should not forget the other things that I have said for other fractures, as we have stated; and treat each accident as appropriate.
of the fracture of the bone of the knuckle
When the bone of a woman's nature is broken, seat her wide, then incline her to the back, and hold her from behind;
then fill the woman's nature with cotton, and put in as much as it will hold;
then lift the woman up, and raise her back slowly, and then the cotton jumps out until it comes to the entrance of her nature, and the bone returns with the cotton;
and when she wishes to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, replace it, and thus do for seven days or so: so the break will be restored, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, and tie a cord to the opening, and put the entire bladder into her nature; then blow into the cord forcefully, until the bladder is inflated inside: the nature will return the break;
then fill it with cotton, and leave it thus for some days, until it is healed.
And when the bone of a man's finger, or a woman's, is broken, restore it thus as we have said for the hip bone;
and these nearby breaks are not hidden from the one who applies study and use to them, and understands my book.
For the break signifies in many ways the right path of restoration: Understand it then.
In the penis, when it is broken, take a goose's throat and apply it to the penis; then wrap cloths around it, and leave it for three days or so, and it will be healed quickly.
of a break with a wound
It is necessary for one who has a break with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the bone of the thigh or of the shoulder or similar, to be bled now, so that the bleedings we have mentioned bear witness to it.
And if the wound bleeds, stop the bleeding with vitriol, if you have nothing else, then resume restoring the fracture at that same hour, or that day, if no hot abscesses come.
And if hot abscesses come, leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess is calmed, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, for you would bring bad accidents.
And if the broken bone is apparent upon the uncovered flesh, it is necessary that you put it in place gently with your hands, with a small extension.
And if the extension is not suitable for putting it equal with your hands, then reset it with this instrument that is of iron, which has seven or eight fingers in length, and its width is according to the size of the wound; and for this, the surgeon needs three or four, according to what he needs in each fracture treatment;
and it should be round and somewhat thick, so that it does not bend under the compression on the limb in your work, and it should be pointed in front, and thick from the middle forward, like this:
And it is called "palainche", so that the curved part must be placed on the head of the apparent bone; and put it in place once, until it returns, and let the parts be equal against each other. And if the fracture is subtle, and the instrument cannot properly grasp the bone, then you must cut the head of the bone, so that the instrument has purchase.
And if you cannot return the bone, as we have said, then cut it with a suitable instrument for this, whether a knife or saw, to the best of your ability;
then remove what remains in the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is returned, and the patient feels great pain afterward, know that it is not in its natural place.
Do so until it is in its place, then soak a cloth in dark astringent wine, and properly if it is in that condition; and do not put plasters or anything else oily on the wound, lest it cause rot and corruption;
then apply dressings once you have restored the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and trim the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and be very careful that the wound is not constricted by the fracture;
and many times foolish doctors have done this, and have caused death or sores on the patient sometimes; and the constriction should be softer and gentler than with other fractures.
And if the wound is large or bad, and you fear that evil accidents may occur, as we have said, and you find pain in the area, then you should not put dressings on it; but wrap around, instead of dressings, hard cloths, and tie them.
And when you see pus forming on the wound after one or two days, remove what you have put on it completely, and apply a healing ointment for wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones.
And you must loosen the limb twice a day, morning and evening, until it is healed and sound.
And the limb must be positioned so that the pus runs down easily.
And if many days pass, and it does not heal but keeps producing pus, know that there are small pieces of bone, therefore you must probe the wound with a probe, and remove all those separated pieces that cause the pain.
And if a fistula appears in the area, or another form of corruption, you must treat it, according to what he says in his chapter before this one.
And when the bone is broken and exposed on the limb, like the bone of the thigh or shoulder, and other similar large bones, do not remove it, for often death results, but leave it until it rots;
Perhaps it will fall away after twenty or thirty days, then treat the wound, if you can;
and if you cannot, then leave it.
Many times they come after the healing of the break, especially when it is near the joint, and a terrible sight is the appearance of the limb; and perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Beware therefore if it is fresh: If the administrator gives astringent medicines, such as aloes, frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, acacia, and similar others, then you may take any of these things, or all together, and mix them with astringent wine or with the white of an egg or with oil; and place them on the wound in bandages, and bind it tightly, and do not loosen it for many days;
and place them on the wound in bandages, and bind it tightly, and do not loosen it for many days; and then remove it, and begin another, until the swelling is gone;
or you bind over a piece of well-made lead; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings from the limbs;
and if the swelling has already hardened like stone, and it is necessary to remove it, then cut over it and remove the superfluous part; or you scrape it with a razor until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
of the limb that is weak after healing
When the broken bone is restored, and afterward the limb remains weak and frail, this happens for many reasons: one of which is that it was bound too tightly, and not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or due to an excess of swelling; or because of too much movement, and not at the right time; or because he has little blood in his body, and is weak.
And the cure is to make the patient eat, and to make the body soft, so that the blood is multiplied within him; and give him a bath, and give him joy and ease;
then put pitch on the limb, so that the pitch attracts great nourishment, and often water it with warm water, so that the nourishment flows to the limb; and returns to its natural form.
a limb twisted after the healing When the limb is twisted after restoration, and the broken bone is evident, and the limb's shape is unsightly, nonetheless, it does not entirely lose its natural function:
so do not believe the fools who say that one should break the limb anew, and many foolish men have done this in our land;
and this practice is condemned, and great harm results, and perhaps death;
However, if the knots and the twisting are fresh, they should be softened with hot water, or with softened herbs, such as mallow leaves, roots, and melilot, and similar things;
and make a softening poultice, such as a well-made diachylon, and take the mucilage of mallow, and mix it with goose fat or sesame oil, and make a poultice on top;
or take ripe figs, and crush them with flaxseed, and similar medicines that soften the adhesions.
And sometimes the knot is loosened by rubbing continuously and for a long time with moist hands. And movement should be administered to the limb every hour.
And if the distortion is old and hardened, like stone, and it needs to be removed with an iron, it should be cut down to the bone, with a sharp, light incision. and apply dressings and care in the treatment.
Dislocation occurs when a joint moves out of its place, so it cannot move, and the limb is misshapen, and the patient feels great pain and injury.
When dislocation happens to someone, it should be brought back immediately without delay.
For if one delays, the area swells, and perhaps it is difficult to return it to its place.
Therefore, it is not appropriate to move it when it is swollen: Many times it causes swelling and other pains;
However, when this happens, have the patient bled, then leave it until the abscess is calmed;
Then anoint the limb with warm water and oil, then gently reposition it, and treat each limb as its cure will bring it back into place.
And I have ordered the chapters on dislocations from the head to the feet.
Sometimes the jawbones are dislocated, and the dislocation of both is according to two manners: where they are slightly dislodged from their place, and slightly softened; or they are completely dislocated, and hang towards the chest, and saliva flows from the mouth so that it cannot hold it, nor can it close its mouth, and it wraps its tongue with its speech.
When the dislocation is slight, it returns through several arrangements.
And if it is complete and accomplished, you must reposition it quickly, and not delay.
and in such a manner that the attendant holds the patient's head, and puts the thumb of one of his hands into the root of the dislocation of the jawbone inside the mouth, if the dislocation is of two parts; and the other finger of the hand should be on the outside, to hold in place;
and instruct the patient to relax their jaw, and move it in all directions. And the attendant places it straight, until it returns to its place.
And if the resetting is difficult, especially if it is the two jawbones together, then lubricate them with hot water and oil, until they are reset gently;
and do not delay in resetting them, as we have said.
And when they are reset properly, and the patient's mouth closes well without stiffness, then place damp cloths on a plaster made of rose oil and wax, then tie it lightly with soft bandages;
and let the patient sleep on their back, with their head resting between two cushions, so that they do not move it to the right or left, nor exert any force with their mouth, but take light food until the pain is gone and the jawbones are healed;
and then let him eat whatever he wants lightly, and do not strain to open the mouth for eating and drinking, until the jawbone is well healed and sound.
And if the two jawbones cannot be put in place at one time and are not returned to their position, then fevers and persistent aches follow, and perhaps looseness of the bowels, and perhaps a vomiting of clear phlegm.
And when you see this, then know that it is fatal. and many times the person to whom this happens dies within nine days.
The shoulder cannot dislocate from the inside of the chest and the breast, and is sometimes dislocated outwards, and one feels it well.
And the restoration is that the patient lies often on his back, and extends his arms; and then press the place firmly with your palm, and it will return;
then put on the plaster and the bandage, and bind it tight;
and the shoulder towards the ribs cannot dislocate; if not, and if it dislocates at any time, then reset it to its place, as we have said;
then put on the plaster and the bandage, and bind it tight, and instruct the patient to rest until he is healed;
and likewise the shoulder is reset, when it is separated from its place.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is not dislocated except in three ways:
one of which is that it dislocates to the side of the socket below; and the second is to the side of the breast; and perhaps dislocates to the upper part, and this happens rarely;
and does not dislocate behind due to the shoulder, and does not dislocate inside due to the nerves;
and many times dislocates below towards the socket, especially in those with little flesh, for in those it leaps quickly;
in those who have enough flesh, it jumps with difficulty, and returns with difficulty.
And perhaps there happens to some men a blow or a fracture, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and they think that it is dislocated by this.
Therefore, you must test it, until you are certain; and then begin the cure.
And dislocation is known when it is down towards the armpit, and it makes a difference between the diseased and healthy shoulder, and you will find a clear difference between them; and you will find a hollow at the head of the shoulder, and under the armpit when touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were a bone; and the patient cannot bring his hand to his nose, nor move it in any way;
and also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you find it clearly when touching it;
and this type of dislocation is only to be reset, when it is new, or if a child is sick.
And the method is that the minister lifts the patient's hand upwards, then places their hands under the armpit, and lifts the joint upwards forcefully to its place; And the minister lifts the hand, and extends it upwards, then places it underneath; Then it will return quickly.
And if it does not return as we have said within a few days, then the patient should be bathed in hot water; and the minister administer softening and soothing lotions, such as a decoction of marsh-mallow and fenugreek and melilot in water, and be administered;
Then the patient should be placed on their back, and a thick pad of wool, neither too soft nor too hard, should be placed beneath the armpit, then the patient's heel should be placed on the pad, and the shoulder head should be lifted skillfully, and the patient's hand should be pulled;
and another attendant should hold the patient's head so that it does not move downward; that shoulder returns right away, and if you wish to see how to reset it in this manner:
and you must have a man present who is larger than the patient; and stand upright beside the patient's side, and place their shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lift the armpit upward, so that the patient hangs in the air; and another attendant pulls the patient's arm downward towards the belly. And if the patient is too light, then hang something heavy with him, and the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is reset also in another manner:
and a long firebrand is placed in the ground, whose head is as round as a pestle, and is neither too thick nor too thin; then it is placed beneath the patient, but let it have soft cloths on top, and the patient be lying on the length of the rod;
then his hand is stretched downwards strongly on the other side, and the joint will return to its place quickly;
and if it does not wish to return despite all these things we have said, then perform this treatment: take a firebrand of two arms of great and four fingers wide, which has a rounded head so as to enter deeply beneath the armpit, according to this form:
then place soft cloths over the head of the rod, so that the rod does not injure the patient, then place it under the patient's armpit;
and extend his arm along the rod, and bind the shoulder to the rod, and the arm to the top of the hand, then place the arm on a rung of a wide ladder, and let the hand be stretched downwards, and let the body hang from the other side: the joint returns into place now.
And when it is in place, whatever the manner, you must place an equal wool pad under the armpit, then place the prepared plaster of ground powder, with incense and egg white, over the entire shoulder and around it, then bind tightly under the armpit, and turn the bandage over the plaster, and bring the hand to the neck, and let the hand remain thus.
And it is necessary that he eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal more quickly;
and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and it is not softened, then it is healed.
And if the joint is out of place due to moisture that has come to it, or for another reason, you must apply cauteries to three spots, as it is shown previously in the chapter on cauteries.
And if you do all this, and it loosens after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and cannot raise his arm, then know that the nerve at the head of the shoulder is cut or stretched or weakened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocations towards the breast, or the back, are caused by impact, and the stretching of the arms, and another method is applied there;
and treat until it is healed.
And if, after healing, there is stiffness in the limb, and delay in movement, the patient should use baths many times, until the stiffness is relieved, and returns to its former nature.
of the dislocation of the ribs
Know that the joint of the ribs is dislocated in spurts, and returns in spurts;
and it has been dislocated from all sides, and especially in front and behind, and the dislocation is not repaired, for one can see and feel it clearly; and dislocates according to each shape. And when you join the diseased rib with the healthy one, you can see it clearly. For the joint is twisted, and cannot bend the arm, nor touch the shoulder at all.
And it is necessary to reset it before a hot abscess comes, for if a hot abscess were to come, it would be difficult to reset it;
and perhaps it cannot be completely reset, especially when it is at the back; so it is worse than other dislocations, and is of greater pain, and perhaps death comes from it.
And the restoration, when it is such that it can be reset, is that you extend its hand with your two hands; and its arms be spread out, and the hands of the mirror according to the knife around, above and below, and push the joint to its shoulders together, or to the root of its palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in front, it returns when he doubles his hand to his hand, and pushing on the root of the palm with the knife that is dislocated.
And if it does not wish to return to its place, then administer strong extension;
and it is that two ministers extend the arm, and hold it, two ministers, so that it does not move with the extension;
then turn the arm each way, after you have wrapped a double cloth long and wide;
and when the physician has joined the joint to his hand, then anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint forcefully until it returns;
and when it is in place, then put on a dry plaster with a bit of egg, and bind it tightly, and hang the arm on the patient's neck, and leave it for a few days, then unbind it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, then untie the bandage, and leave it;
and if you see that the joint is not properly set, then recommence the plaster and the bandage, and leave it thus for a few days, until it is firmly set; then unbind it.
And if he feels tightness after the joint is reset, and it moves, then bathe and rub it well, and press until it is relieved; or you place a layer of fatty sheep's wool on the joint, then leave it for one day and one night, then remove it, and put it in the bath; and when it sweats, rub the joint gently, then replace the wool, and then put it in the bath; and do this two or three times, until it is healed;
and if you wish, place warm, moist cow's hay with butter on top, and bind it tightly;
it will return to its proper position.
the dislocation of the hand
The joints of the hand dislocate, and their return is easier than the other joints. However, it should be returned to its place quickly, at the very moment it is dislocated, before the place becomes swollen, or a hot abscess forms there.
And the repositioning is that you place the afflicted hand on a table, and the minister extends the hand, and carefully places the palm over the appearance of the joint, and pushes until it returns.
However, you must check if it is properly in place; then the patient should place the back of their hand on a table during the extension and repositioning. And if the dislocation is in the back of the hand, the patient places the back of their hand on the table, and the physician places their hand over that apparent joint.
If it returns now, it is good. If not, apply soothing poultices to the abscesses, and leave it like that without starting over.
And if he cannot bear it, and you cannot put it back in place after several days, the joint remains twisted.
and does no harm to the patient except that the hand is softened and cannot grasp anything at all: then know that the nerve or artery is cut.
there is no other remedy except to cauterize near the case, and perhaps nothing else works.
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster we have mentioned, then bind it and leave it for five days, then unbind it and leave it like that.
And if he cannot move it well, and there is any stiffness, soak it with hot water and rub it until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the finger of the hand is dislocated on either side, sometimes on the back of the palm or on the belly;
Then stretch the finger, and push the dislocation with your hands until it returns, then support the head of the finger, and bend it towards the part where it is dislocated;
and leave it for two days, and then put it back in place on that day;
and at night tie it, as we have said, and untie it during the day, and make it move, and tie it again at night;
and do this often, until it is tight, and do likewise if it is dislocated on the palm of the hand, and do as you did before, until it is healed;
and do likewise when it is dislocated on the other side.
where dislocation of the shin from the back
When the shin from the back or the neck is dislocated, or if there are several dislocations, there is no cure, for death quickly takes the patient.
And the signs are that the excretions leak without control, and cannot be held, and often some limb is softened, or the two thighs or the two arms or one.
And many times the shin moves to four parts;
That which moves to the back is called "gilbositez":
The cure is that you watch if the gilbositez came from childhood: If it has not come from childhood, there is no cure or healing at all.
And that which comes from falling or impacts or similar things, the ancient ways of curing said great things, where there is not much profit in all of them;
But I have shortened it according to my intention, and have formed instruments in various ways.
I say that in the gilbosite that comes to the front of the breast, there is no device or health;
and also that which comes straight on the two sides, and one cannot cure it except properly that which comes to the back, as I say;
and that the patient be stretched out on his face in one equal place, and have restraint underneath him, so that he is not injured;
then place one firebrand in the ground at the head, and another at the feet, and tie a cord under the armpits of the patient, and another at the hips, and at the knees, and at the ankles;
and two assistants should hold the cords, one at the head and the other at the feet, between the two firebrands;
and be firmly held, the firebrands as we have said, and the master place his palms on the spine firmly, until it returns to its place.
And if it does not return with this treatment, take a board three arms long, and place it under the wall, and let the patient lie on his side, and place the head of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine; and let the master place his feet on the other end of the board, and press firmly, until it returns to its place;
and if you wish, do it with the turner that turns with the hand. And you should place two firebrands at the patient's head, one arm's length away, and two others towards the feet, and have a palm's width of space between each firebrand, above and below.
and have one hole in each firebrand, through which the turner runs, and let the firebrands be firmly in the ground, so that they do not move.
and between each two firebrands place one revolving firebrand, on which the liens revolve, and have two small firebrands, one palm's length long, in the two turners to turn the turner;
and then tie the lien that is among the assels to the turner towards the head, and the other lien towards the feet to the other turner, and each of the ministers turns their turner on the whole lien, and the master puts the spine straight as we have said.
And when it is straight, apply a desiccant plaster with plenty of egg, then bandages, then the plaster of a tablet three fingers long, which should cover the area of the protrusion and the healthy part of the spine, then bind it with a bandage, as we have said, and the patient should use mild nourishment until he is healed.
And if anything comes in the final stages of healing, it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, along with the plaster we have mentioned earlier. And sometimes a piece of lead is administered, and sometimes an appearance arises in the back of the spine, and it is believed to be a dislocation. And it is the bone that appears, so one should not have presumption. Perhaps it would bring death.
Know that at the joints of the hip and the shoulder, only dislocations occur, and not like at other joints.
And the joint of the hip is dislocated according to four parts: inward and outward, and forward and backward;
and more inward elsewhere, and slightly dislocated forward and backward.
And the recognition of its inward dislocation is that when one joins the diseased leg with the healthy one, it is longer, and the patient's knee is more apparent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their knee to the fire; and the place next to it is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh comes there.
And the sign of one in whom it comes outward is that these accidents are contrary to those before.
And the sign of one in whom it happens to the front is that they extend their leg well according to its completion; However, they do not bend their knee without pain, and if one wants to make it go forward, it cannot, and they retain their urine, and their groin swells, and when they walk, they step on the heel.
And the sign of one in whom it happens behind is that they cannot extend or bend their knee, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is in the place under the ribs.
The treatment of this type of dislocation is to observe if the dislocation is old, and it remains according to its condition; there is no cure. And there should be no presumption about it.
And in the case where the dislocation is fresh, and it is one of the four types of dislocations, hurry to turn the joint, extend it inside and outside, and move it to the right and left; Perhaps it will return, and no other treatment is needed.
And if it does not return in this way, you must prepare a strong assistant, and extend the leg strongly with two hands, or with a strap tied above the knee; and another assistant extends their hand above in such a way that they place their hands under their armpits, then bind it gently with a strap on the thigh; and another holds the end of the strap;
and they pull upwards and downwards all at once, so that the patient is lifted from the ground at once, and hangs suspended.
This method of extension is common to four similar cases, and if the dislocation has returned, as we have said, it is good.
If not, then treatment must be applied to its likeness.
When the dislocation is on the inside, you must turn the patient on their healthy side, then place the strap on the root of the thigh, and the place under the armpit, then pull the strap upwards towards the armpit and towards the shoulder;
then have other assistants hold their arms, and grip the thick part of the affected thigh, and pull it outward strongly: it will return to its place immediately;
and this type of dislocation is easier than the others.
And if you cannot set it in this manner that we have said, you must tie the patient's two feet together with a strong soft strap around both ankles and both knees, and the affected leg should be extended two inches further than the other;
then be suspended from the top of a post, and be two arms' length above the ground;
then instruct one attendant to grasp the head of the thigh, and let another attendant hang with the patient, who grasps the thigh firmly, for the joint will return quickly now.
And when the dislocation is at the hip, the patient lies down, as we said for those with hip problems, and a bandage is tied around the affected leg properly, and on the foot as well;
then place two embers, one at the head and another at the feet, then place an ember between the patient's thighs in the middle; and have a bed of damp cloths around it so it does not burn the patient, then each attendant should extend towards him, and the attendant should put the dislocation in line with his hand.
If it returns, it is good.
If not, place it on a table, and press it as we said for hip problems, and the patient should lie on his healthy side.
And when the dislocation is in front, then it is necessary to extend the injured leg upwards, and according to what I said; and let the attendant put his effort on the injured limb, then press with the other hand and extend it downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is behind, it is not necessary to extend the patient downwards nor to lift him from the ground, but he should be as if the hip was dislocated behind, as we said about lying on both hips; and he should lie on his face, and the limb be extended as we said previously, and one must press on the joint to the table; and it will be correct when the patient extends his legs, and they are even; then join the thighs, and place the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, so that the hip does not move; and rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and put the plaster on;
and if you see that they are even, then bind it, as before, and leave it for three days;
then unbind it, and let the limb move gently, until the limb is strengthened.
of the dislocation of the knee
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inward and outward, and backward;
and does not dislocate forward.
And the sign is that you instruct the patient to bend their leg at the hip, and if it does not fit at the hip, know that it is dislocated;
and the restoration of all is that you make the patient sit upright, and extend their leg if they can, and place your back against their face, and put their foot on your feet;
then take their knee in your palms, and pull between your fingers, then bend the two sides of the knee firmly; and another assistant extends their foot, so that the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that their leg fits well at their hip easily;
and place the plaster on it, and make the leg fit at the hip, and bind them together tightly for three or four days, then unbind it;
and the patient does not attempt to walk, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not completely restored, the assistant should apply strong stretching, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the heel.
The heel is sometimes displaced, and sometimes dislocated completely, both inwards and outwards.
And the signs are that the ankle is swollen, and protruding towards the part where it is dislocated.
The reduction is gentle, and one should gently stretch it with one's hands when it is only displaced.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must have the patient sit upright, and two assistants hold firmly the leg, above the ankle.
then pull the foot towards your right hand, and then to your left hand twice, then extend it upwards, and gently push the foot upwards.
and do this twice, as we have said, by pushing and pulling the foot.
If it returns, that's good.
If not, then restart the procedure, for it will return.
and if it cannot return in this way, then have the patient lie on their back on the ground, and firmly place a stake in the ground between their thighs, and tie bandages around it so that it does not harm the patient.
Then let the attendant grasp the thigh, and another attendant extend the foot to their hands or a rope, which they tie to the back of the foot. Then let each attendant pull equally, and the stake be always between the patient's thighs to hold the patient as they are pulled.
Then let the attendant place the dislocation in their hands, and another attendant hold the healthy leg below, and the dislocation will quickly return.
And when it is in place, then apply the plaster and bandages over it, and bind it tightly, and tie the foot to the leg, and watch the nerves above the ankle behind, so that the binding is not too tight;
Then leave it for two or three days, and if the binding loosens, then tighten it.
Then untie it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient to walk for four days. And if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if boils appear there, you must relieve them, as we have said elsewhere, until they are healed.
of the fingers When the fingers are dislocated, they must be gently straightened without force, and it is an easy thing.
And if the dislocation is in any joint of the back of the foot, you must have the patient sit on a flat surface or, i.e., a table, completely straight, and place your foot on the exposed joints, then press firmly with your foot until it returns.
and when it is aligned and nothing is exposed, place a table under the sole of the foot with two supports, then hold it firmly, and leave it for three days, then release it. and keep it at rest until it is healed.
of wounds and dislocations together
When a wound comes with the dislocation, and one wishes to restore it, often the patient dies.
Do not be presumptuous in the treatment, if you are not skilled in the art and have not practiced it for a long time, and if you are not compassionate and merciful and slow, and not rash.
and use soothing things at the beginning for hot abscesses, and leave the patient in God's hands if you see no hope of health. And when you see hope, then restore the limb to its place, before the hot abscess comes there.
And when the limb is in place, administer soothing things to the hot abscess, and treat the wound, as is proper, with drying ointments.
And if with the dislocation there is a fracture, and small bones separated, then set them, and do what we have said in simple ailments.
And guard yourself from entering a path of fear, according to what I have said, for this will be to your detriment according to your Creator, and for the salvation of your soul and body.
