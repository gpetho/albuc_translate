of rupture of the scrotum
When a rupture occurs in the groin and the intestines descend into the scrotum and it is new, it is necessary that when you want to cure it, he should not eat that day; and he should use things that loosen the bowels, so that the feces descend from his stomach; then make him sit on his back between your hands, and command him to hold his breath until the intestines are repositioned, and return them with your fingers, and bleed underneath the rupture on the pubic bone, and make a sign that resembles half a circle above the body; then heat the cautery, the form of which is:
until it is white and sparks. Then reposition the intestines to their place; the assistant holds his hand on them to prevent them from returning; and work well on the patient's thighs, and place a cushion under him and an assistant on the thighs, and another on the chest to hold his hands; then place the cautery on the sign with your whole hand, hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, repeat again until you reach the bone; and be careful that the intestines do not come out when you apply the cautery; do not burn them; and ensure the patient does not die from this, or other harm.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worth nothing. It is necessary that the cautery for children be subtle according to the measure of their bones, and for adults as large according to their measure; after three days, treat the cautery site with butter until the burn is gone; afterward treat with other ointments until healed, and the patient should lie on his back for forty days until the wound is well healed; and it is necessary that his nourishment be light for a long time, so that the intestines do not come out when he gets up to go to the room.
And after forty days, when he wants to get up, provide him with a well-made bandage, and wear it for another forty days; he should have good rest, work little and avoid too much food and drink, and shouting too loudly; and when he follows this advice he will be completely healed. And I will later describe the cure by cutting in its chapter.
of rupture of the abdomen
When ruptures come in other parts of the abdomen and are known, and you want them not to grow more, make one cautery with a round cautery according to its quantity, and burn a third of the core; afterward treat as we have said; and some of the ancients said it should be cauterized with a three-angled cautery in this shape:
but first mark the place with ink and make a line across the rupture, and another above, and place your hand in the middle with the clavile cautery. But the first cautery is easier and better.
