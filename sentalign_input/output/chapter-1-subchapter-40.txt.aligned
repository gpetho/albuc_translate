On the cauterization of hip dislocation.	On cauterization of a dislocated hip.	0.9027161
When mucous-like humidity is deposited in the hip area, causing dislocation, and a sign of this is that one thigh is longer than the other when compared. And the location of the dislocation is found in the hollow area.	Sometimes harmful humidities reach the hip joint and result in its coming out of its place. The symptom of this is that one leg is longer than the other when one is measured against the other; and a hollow is found there [i.e. at the hip].	0.6944845
Then you should cauterize the patient on the hip area with a circular cauterization, after marking with a probe around the affected part so that the area falls in the middle of the circle.	Then you should cauterize the patient over the hip joint itself with a circular burn, after you have marked with ink a circle round the femoral joint, so that the joint falls in the middle of the circle.	0.84840876
The cautery should have the same form as described in the cauterization of the stomach.	The cautery should be the one whose description has already been given in cauterization of the stomach.	0.78823906
If this cautery is not available, then cauterize with three large olive-like cauterizations.	But if you have not this cautery by you, give him three cauterizations with the larger size olivary cautery.	0.76350534
The cauterization should be done to the depth of the entire scab; and then treat the area until it heals.	The burn should be to the depth of the whole thickness of the skin. Then dress till healed.	0.77247
