Of the pustules of the penis Many times these pustules appear on the penis, and it is an ugly appearance of flesh; and there are malignant and non-malignant ones; then you must take them with a fine hook, and cut and clean them all, then put cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment on them; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed. And if the pustule is malignant, of a rotten color and smelling bad, then you must use cautery. When you have cut it, and if the pustule is at the top of the penis, and is partly inside the skin and partly outside, then you must remove the pustule that is inside first; and when it is healed, then treat the outside. Because when you treat them together, the tip of the penis is not safe from being pierced, and blackness and corruption come to the penis and the testicles; then you must remove all that is black and corrupt, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from pomegranate peel and vetch, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.	The nonmalignant you should seize with a fine hook and pare away until they are altogether gone; then apply to the place cotton wool soaked in Egyptian ointment; then afterwards dress with Palm ointment until healed. But when the pustules are malignant, of a dirty colour, for these you should employ the cautery after cutting and scraping them. If the pustules be on the prepuce of an uncircumcized unbeliever and there are some inside the prepuce and some outside, those that are inside should be removed first; and when they are healed over, then treat those outside. For if you deal with both at the same time you are in danger of going through the prepuce.	0.8424478
and if it is a difficult thing to separate it, then you must peel it with a spatula a little bit from the tip of the penis and the skin; then gently separate between the two, and place a fine linen cloth soaked in cold water, so it does not reattach.	But if the complete separation of the two be difficult then you should dissect away a little of the glans and of the prepuce; for the prepuce is thin, and consequently it is often pierced quickly. Separate then between the glans and the prepuce with a piece of fine linen dipped in cold water to prevent further adhesions. Then let it be dressed with some styptic wine till it heals over.	0.7879604
