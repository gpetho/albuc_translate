Chapter twenty-four on the treatment of nasal polyps.
Various excess flesh may grow in the nose, some of which resembles a scorpion with many legs.
And some of it is cancerous flesh, hardened and dark-colored.
And some of it is soft flesh, not dark-colored. So whatever of this flesh is soft, is not malignant or cancerous,
so you should sit the patient before you, facing the sun, and open his nostril, and cast the hook into that flesh, then pull it out, then cut what you reach of it with a fine, sharp scalpel from one side until you know that all the flesh is gone.
If any of it remains that you cannot cut, scrape it with one of the fine instruments gently until nothing of it remains.
If the blood overcomes you or a hot swelling appears, treat it as appropriate. Or if it is one of the malignant swellings, hasten to cauterize it until the blood stops and all the flesh is gone.
Then, after cutting, put vinegar and water or a drink into the nose.
If the nose opens and the moisture flows from it to the throat, know that he is healed.
But if the moisture does not flow as it should, know that inside him is growing flesh at the top of the spongy bones that the instrument did not reach by cutting.
At that time, it is necessary to take a somewhat thick linen thread and tie many knots in it, making the distance between each knot the length of a finger or less.
And the patient should contrive to insert one end of the thread into his nose with a probe or whatever he can, after making it like a button, and pull it until it reaches the uvula and comes out of his throat.
Boys in school often do such a thing, and it is easy for whoever wants to do it.
Then, bring together the two ends of the thread, the one that came out of the mouth and the other that remained in the nose, then use the knots in the thread to saw the flesh, doing so until you know that the flesh has been cut by the knots of the thread.
Then remove the thread and, after wiping the blood, insert a wick into the nose that you have soaked in Egyptian ointment. Do this for three days or more until the ointment consumes all remaining flesh.
Then, lastly, insert a lead tube into the nose for several days until it heals.
If it needs a drying treatment, use that.
And this is a picture of the syringe with which oils and medicines are dripped into the nose:
He places something like a small lamp, open at its reservoir and channel, made of silver or copper.
Similarly, if you wish, you make the tube closed, like a reed, with a flat surface for the perfume oil.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, to hold it when you heat oil in it or what.
You want from the expressed juices or flowing things.
