The seventeenth chapter on cauterizing the fistula that appears in the corner of the eye.	CHAPTER SEVENTEEN. On cauterization of a fistula in the angle of the eye.	0.7946731
If you treated the fistula with what we mentioned in the classifications of diseases and your treatment was not successful, then it should be cauterized in this manner.	When you have treated a fistula in those ways mentioned in the sections on diseases, without success, it should be cauterized after this manner.	0.8499142
You order the patient to place his head in your lap, and an assistant holds his head between your hands, holding it firmly so that he does not move or shake his head.	Bid the patient put his head in your lap; and let an assistant hold his head in front of you without moving or stirring.	0.8325242
Then you place cotton moistened in egg white or in psyllium mucilage on his eyes.	Then place on his eyes cotton wool damped with egg-white or mucilage of psyllium seeds.	0.9287431
Then you heat the cautery iron, which is of this shape:	Then heat a cautery shaped thus.	0.7540455
It should be hollow, like the quill of an eagle's feather, from the one end which will be cauterized.	It should be hollow and in shape like a fine tube, like an eagle's quill, at the one end that is used as a cautery.	0.7820937
And if you wish, it can be perforated at the other end. And if you wish, it can be solid like a bodkin.	And if you wish it may be perforated to the other extremity; or it can be solid like a probe.	0.82481337
But this hollow one is better for your work, God willing.	But this hollow instrument will be better for your operation.	0.7265792
Then squeeze the fistula if it is open and remove the pus and dry it. Or if it is not open, open it and remove its pus.	Then press on the fistula if it be open and get the matter out of it and wipe it away; or if it is not open, then open it.	0.9104395
Then apply the cautery, which is very hot. Hold it with your hand until it reaches the bone.	Then apply to it the cautery, which should be very hot, and press it in with your hand till it reaches the bone.	0.8952168
And move your hand a little during cauterization from the eye towards the nose, lest your hand err or the patient fidget, and the cautery falls into the eyelid and damages it.	While you are burning keep the hand away from the eye slightly toward the nasal side, lest your hand slip or the patient draw away so that you put the cautery into the ball of the eye and destroy it.	0.85322
If it reaches the bone with the first cauterization, otherwise, repeat the cauterization a second time if needed.	And if you reach the bone at the first cauterization, good; if not, repeat the cauterization if necessary.	0.8563414
And leave it for three days. Then apply cotton with butter and treat it with a drying ointment until it heals.	Leave it a few days, then put on cotton wool with butter and treat with hygroscopic ointment till it heals.	0.6948818
If forty days pass and it does not heal, then apply a strong corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed. And treat it according to what will be mentioned in its chapter, God willing.	And should forty days have passed and it does not heal, apply a sharp corrosive ointment so as to expose the bone, and strip it as will be explained in the appropriate chapter.	0.8108069
And another method of cauterizing the fistula, mentioned by some of the ancients, you aim at the location of the fistula, incise it, then place in the incision a thin funnel, its form is this: And you pour into it molten lead, the weight of a dirham. And you hold your hand firmly on the funnel, tightly closed.	Another method of cauterizing a fistula is that which some of the Ancients mentioned: apply yourself to the site of the fistula and incise it; then insert into the incision a fine funnel, this being the figure of it, and pour into it a drachm of molten lead; and keep your hand on the funnel, holding it firm all the time, and do not let the patient move at all, lest the molten lead run into his eyes.	0.81742823
And it is advisable that you place on the patient's eye cotton soaked in egg white or in water.	Then you should put cotton wool soaked in egg-white or water upon the patient's eye.	0.8355115
For the lead cauterizes the fistula's location and heals it wonderfully.	For the lead cauterizes the site of the fistula and acts as a marvellous cure.	0.85122067
If the fistula is healed by what we have mentioned of cauterization and treatment, then good; otherwise, it is necessary to use perforation of the nose and return the fistula to the nasal passage as will come in its specific place.	If the fistula heals by the cauterization and medication we have described, well and good; otherwise perforation of the nose will undoubtedly have to be undertaken to lead the fistula into the meatus of the nose, by the technique that will come in its own place.	0.8830571
