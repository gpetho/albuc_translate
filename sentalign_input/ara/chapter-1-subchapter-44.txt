Chapter Forty-Four.
On Cauterizing Gout and Pains of the Joints.
If the pains of the joints are from cold humors that flow to any part of the body, and if the pains occur in the legs, then it is the physicians' custom to call that specifically gout.
If cold gout is treated with the types of treatment we mentioned in the division and the pains do not go away, then cautery will remove them, and that is that you cauterize after emptying around the joint of the legs with many cauterizations, and the cautery iron should be olive-shaped and medium-sized, in this manner.
And if you need to cauterize the surface of the leg, do it with the point cautery. If the pains ascend to the knees or to the other joints, and this happens often, cauterize each knee three or four times on each side with this same olive-shaped cautery iron.
If you need more than this cauterization, cauterize, but do not deepen your hand with the cautery, rather it should be about the thickness of the skin only. If the pains ascend to the hips or to the back, use what we mentioned about cautery in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, cauterize around the two forearms as you rotate in two rows. If the pains remain in the fingers, cauterize them at each knuckle and on the back of the hand.  If the pains ascend after some days to the elbows or to the shoulders,
cauterize them on each side. The patient should not neglect good regimen and taking medications, for if he improves his diet and expels the phlegm, he will recover with this cauterization, God willing.
