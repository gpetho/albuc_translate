Chapter Thirty.
On the Extraction of Teeth.
You should treat the tooth for its pain by every means and delay its extraction, for there is no replacement for it once it is extracted, because it is a noble substance. Until, when there is no alternative to extracting it.
So when the patient resolves on its extraction, you should be certain, until you are sure about the aching tooth.
For often the pain deceives the patient, and he thinks that it is in the sound tooth, and so extracts it, then the pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is extracted. We have seen this done by cuppers repeatedly.
So when you are certain of the specific aching tooth, then you should incise around the tooth with a somewhat strong scalpel until you loosen the gum on all sides. Then move it with your fingers or with fine forceps, first little by little, until you loosen it.
Then grasp it firmly with the large forceps, and the patient's head should be between your knees, held firmly so that it does not move. Then pull the tooth straight, so that you do not break it. If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it under it from every side gently and softly, moving it as you did before.
And if the tooth is perforated or decayed, then you should fill that hole with a piece of cloth and plug it well with the tip of a thin probe, so that it does not crumble when you pull on it with the forceps. And you should incise completely around the gum on every side, yes indeed.
And take care not to break it, leaving some of it behind, which would cause the patient a worse affliction than his initial pain. And beware of imitating the ignorant cuppers in their boldness and haste in extracting it without using what we have described.
For they often cause people great harm, the least of which is breaking the tooth and leaving all or some of its roots behind.
Or they may extract it with some of the jawbone, as we have witnessed repeatedly. Then after its extraction, the patient should rinse his mouth with wine or vinegar and salt. If bleeding occurs from the site, as often happens, then grind some vitriol and pack the site with it.
Otherwise, cauterize it if the vitriol is not effective.  A picture of the delicate forceps, which are used to loosen the tooth first: they should have long ends, short handles, and be thick so that they do not bend when you grip the tooth with them. And this is a picture of the large forceps:
They are, as you see, thick-handled so that when you grip them they do not give way or bend, and they have short ends. Let them be made of Indian steel or well-tempered steel, with polished ends.  And at their ends are teeth that interlock, gripping firmly and tightly.
The ends may also be made like a file, thus making the grip strong as well.
