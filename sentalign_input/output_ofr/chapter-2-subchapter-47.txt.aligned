Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to be corrupted, so much so that they resemble women's breasts;	The breasts of some males may swell on attaining puberty so as to resemble the female breast, and they remain permanently swollen and ugly.	0.70931154
and they remain unsightly and swollen, and whoever wants to treat them, must cauterize them according to this shape from this line b. down to g.: then scrape away the fat, and fill the wound with medicine generating flesh, then bring together the two lips of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed;	If this is abhorrent, a semicircular incision should be made on the breast, like this figure, from b to g. Then dissect away all the fatty tissue and pack the wound with a cicatrizing compound and sew the lips together and dress until healed.	0.62343717
and if the breast droops down and is softened by its size as happens with women, then split it into two parts from above, with two similar incisions; of which one is connected to the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from this line b. down to line g.; then scrape the skin that is between the two lips, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about stitching and powders, and what is necessary in the treatment, until it is healed;	But if the breast is pendulous and flabby on account of its size, as happens with women, you should make two semicircular incisions on the upper side, the ends joining one another, in such wise that the longer incision encircles the other like this, from b to g. Then dissect away the skin between the two incisions and remove the fat and sew up as we have described; and apply styptic powder and the necessary dressings until healed.	0.8353977
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not fully made, because the patient does not want to rest, or because of the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remainder and the fat, then treat it until it is healed.	But if you cannot make the incision as full and perfect as it ought to have been, because the patient is restless, or because haemorrhage arises, you should pack the wound with cotton wool soaked in corrosive ointment and leave till it eats away the remainder of the fat; then dress until healed.	0.87163097
