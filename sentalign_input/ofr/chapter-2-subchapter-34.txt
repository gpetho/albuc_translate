to cut the frenulum of the tongue
Sometimes this frenulum that comes from under the tongue is natural, that one is born with;
or by accident of a healed wound;
and the procedure is such that you open the patient's mouth, and have his head on your lap, and lift his tongue;
then cut the nervous frenulum widely, so that the tongue is freed from its attachment, and if there is hardness or a knot, and it is from the healing of a wound, then insert the hook and cut that ligament widely;
and be careful that the cut is not too deep, because of the artery that is underneath;
and when you have finished, wash the area with rose water and vinegar, or with cold water, then place a linen tent under the tongue;
and the patient should hold it there each night, so that the area cannot close up.
And if bleeding occurs, apply crushed vitriol to the area;
and if the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize it with a lentiginous cautery, which is good for this;
then treat it with other remedies until it is healed,
