of the cautery of the head When sudden pain comes in one part of the head and the disease extends to the eye, and the head is cleansed by purifying medicines, and the other treatments mentioned in the division of diseases are applied, and none of this helps: then make cauteries in two ways, namely with sharp medicine and with iron.	When there occurs pain with headache in one side of the head and the pain extends to the eye; and the patient has cleared his head with purging drugs and there has been applied the other treatment that I have mentioned in the sections on diseases, but to no avail; in this disorder cauterization is of two sorts, either with caustic or with the actual cautery.	0.81807774
The cautery with sharp medicine is made by taking a clove of garlic, removing the peel, and cutting it a little at both ends, then cutting the temple where the pain is so that you can insert the clove of garlic under the skin; when it is inserted, bind and press it well and leave it for twelve hours; then untie it and remove the clove of garlic, and leave the wound like this for two or three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter until the rot comes out.	This is the manner of cauterization with caustic: take one clove of garlic; peel it and cut both ends off; then cut open the site of the pain in the temple with a broad scalpel till there is room to contain the clove under the skin; then introduce it under the skin till it lies completely hidden. Then bind up the wound tightly over it with pads and leave for fifteen hours; then unbind it, remove the garlic, and leave the wound open for two or three days; then apply cotton wool soaked in butter till it suppurates.	0.8907063
Afterward, treat the wound with ointment until it is healed; and if you wish, use some of the burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.	Then dress with ointment till it heals. If you would rather, you may carry it out with one of the caustic drugs that I have included in the eighteenth treatise, on caustics.	0.823231
The iron cautery is done in this manner. Heat the cautery which has this shape:	The actual cauterization with iron should be done in this way: heat a cautery of this shape.	0.7552776
It is called "clos" because the head is shaped like a nail with a slight curve, and in the middle, it has a small protrusion; place it on the painful spot, hold your hand and turn the iron slightly, until half the thickness of the core is burned; then lift your hand so that the artery above does not burn, and a lot of blood flows.	It is called the claviform; the head is nailshaped in that there is a slight curvature with a small protuberance in the middle. Apply it then to the site of the pain, hold your hand steady and revolve it little by little. Let the thickness of skin burnt be about half; then remove your hand so as not to burn a subjacent artery, for thus a haemorrhage arises.	0.75334096
Afterward, apply cotton soaked in salt water to the spot for three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter, and then treat the spot with ointment until it is healed; and if you want, cauterize this migraine with the cautery called "cultellare", with the point, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine which is not old.	Then soak some cotton wool in saline, apply to the place, and leave three days; then apply cotton wool with butter; then treat with ointment till it heals. Or if you prefer you can cauterize this migraine with the knife-edge that juts out from the cautery; but be careful not to cut an artery, specially in this kind of migraine that is non-chronic.	0.84616786
