Chapter forty-seven on cauterizing leprosy.
As for those afflicted with leprosy, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially a certain type.
Leprosy, which results from the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile,
So if you want to cauterize it, examine it; if the leprosy is in its early stages, and you have treated it with what we mentioned in the section on classification, and it has not worsened or stopped, and you fear that the corruption will take over the patient's entire temperament, then cauterize him on the head with five burns: one in the customary center of the head, the second below it towards the forehead at the hairline, two on the temples, and one from behind on the hollow of the nape of the neck. Press your hand firmly with the cautery a little until it affects the bone slightly, and scales come off it, to facilitate the exhalation of the thick vapors from it. And also cauterize him on the spleen itself, as mentioned before.
But if the leprosy has persisted in the patient and has manifested clearly, then it is advisable to cauterize him with these burns that we mentioned on the head, a burn on the tip of the nose, two burns on the cheeks, two burns on the cervical vertebrae, six on the vertebrae of the back, one large one on the coccyx at the base of the tailbone, another above it on the same area, two on the hips, one on each hip, two on the knees, one on each knee, two on the shoulders, two on the elbows, two on the nipples of the chest. And cauterize him on every joint of the fingers of his hands and feet with a burn, and on each heel of his feet and ulna of his hands, and be careful of the nerve that is on the back of the heels, lest you burn them.
He may also be cauterized with a burn on the pubic bone, another on the cardia of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more you cauterize, the more beneficial and effective it is.
And know that the sick person does not feel pain from cauterization as a healthy person does, because his body is numb.
The cauteries should be of a size appropriate for the organs and joints, according to the descriptions of the irons that have been given.
Then treat the cauterization with powdered chickpea flour mixed with honey and other treatments until he recovers, God willing.
