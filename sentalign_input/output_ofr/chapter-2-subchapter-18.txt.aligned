of the veins of the eyes Specks are red veins that cover the eye, and impede vision and constantly weaken the eye.	Pannus is a network of blood-vessels spreading over the eye so as to interfere with the function of sight and, in the course of time, weakening the eye.	0.6175835
It is therefore necessary first that you see if the eye, in which the speck is, is strong, and there is no other disease besides the speck; then lift it in this way: instruct the patient to put his head in your lap, then lift these veins with the hook according to your skill, and let the hook be a fine double hook according to this form:	You must first examine, and if the eye with the pannus be strong, with no fault other than the pannus, then the pannus should be gathered up. This is done by bidding the patient put his head in your lap; then, as skilfully as you may, pick up those blood-vessels with one or two hooks. The hooks should be of a gentle curve, like this.	0.81286454
And let there be two hooks of different sizes on one handle in this form:	Or there can be two hooks joined together on one handle, thus.	0.5842525
then lift these veins carefully with the hooks, and release the blood little by little, until you see these veins recede from the eye; and be careful not to injure the eye with the points of the hooks, and do this work at midday in the sun, and be very careful in your work so that you only cut these veins; and when you have done this, instill green and red collyrium into the eye to destroy what remains of the speck.	Then take up the blood-vessels gently with the fine scissors, and wipe away the blood constantly, till you see all those blood-vessels removed from the eye, and the blood wells forth. But be careful of the eye lest you damage it with the points of the scissors. Let your work be done in broad sunlight at midday; and be very steady in your action so as to cut nothing beside the bloodvessels. When you have finished, instil the red or green lotion into the eye to destroy by its caustic action the remnants of the pannus.	0.8705835
And if you cannot remove it all at that time, apply a plaster on the eye of things that soothe the pain of the eyes, and leave it for a few days until the pain subsides and be sure of a warm abscess, then start again in the same way as before until it is healed; and this is the form of the hooks:	If you are unable to gather it all up at that one time, apply a plaster to the eye such as will allay the pain, and leave him* for a few days till* the pain be eased and there is no danger of an abscess. Then repeat the operation in the same manner till it is healed.	0.8188598
