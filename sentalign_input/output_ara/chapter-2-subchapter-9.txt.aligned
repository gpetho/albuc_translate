On the treatment of coldness occurring in the eyelids.	On the treatment of stones occurring in the eyelids.	0.79691386
Often something appears on the eyelids resembling coldness in its intensity and hardness.	There often occurs in the eyelids a thing resembling a hailstone in its strength and hardness, and therefore called 'hail'.	0.7156859
And for that reason it is called coldness, and it is a collection of thick moisture in the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid. The procedure for them is that you examine, and if the coldness is prominent on the surface of the eyelid, moving to every side, then its treatment is easy, so make a horizontal incision on it.	It is actually a collection of thick humours in the upper or lower lid. The operative treatment for it is thus: examine; and if the stone is external on the outer aspect of the lid, and mobile in all directions, dealing with it is simple.	0.6030205
Then peel it from every side gently until it is detached, then lift it with a hook and cut it. If it is not possible for you to cut it except after penetrating the eyelid with the cut, that will not harm the patient at all.  If the incision is large, bring it together with stitching and treat it until it heals.	You make above it a transverse incision; then scrape gently around it till it is free; then catch it up with a hook and cut it away. If it is in such a position that you cannot excise it without cutting through the lid, that will not harm the patient at all. If the incision be big, gather it up with a suture and dress it till it heals.	0.83812845
And if it is small, there is no harm for you from it, for the ointment will repair it and heal it. If the coldness is tending towards the inside of the eyelid, towards the inner surface, then turn the eyelid over and lift the coldness with a hook without needing to make an incision, and cut it away from every side.	If it be small, it will be no trouble, for ointment will restore it and heal it. If the stone is rather toward the inner aspect of the eyelid, then invert the lid and catch up the stone with a hook—you will not need to incise the lid—and cut it all round.	0.81930476
If you penetrate the eyelid with the cutting, that will not harm anything. Then wash the eye after cutting the coldness with salt water and treat the area with something that heals, until the patient recovers.	If the lid is pierced in the cutting, it will do no harm at all. Then, after cutting away the stone, wash the eye with salt water; then treat with cicatrizing medicines till healed.	0.82968795
