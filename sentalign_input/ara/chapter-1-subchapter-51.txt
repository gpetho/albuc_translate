Chapter Fifty-One.
On Cauterizing the Boil.
If someone develops a boil and it is slow to mature, either because of the matter causing it, or because of the patient's age if he is old and has little blood, or because of the time, and you want to hasten the boil's maturation, cauterize around it with many small cauterizations, dotting it.
Then leave it, for it will hasten maturation. If you want to open it with cautery, heat the cautery iron which is pictured here.
And apply it to the middle of the boil until it penetrates the skin, and let the cauterization be on the lower side so that the pus can flow easily. Then treat it as appropriate until it heals.
