On the method of cauterizing for hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
Chapter 25.
When the humors overpower the canal of the lungs, especially when it is due to a cold temperament, then it is necessary to purge the patient first with laxative medicines.
Then cauterize him on the throat at the root of the gullet, in a depressed place, and be careful not to reach the throat itself with the cautery, nor penetrate the skin except a little.
Then cauterize him again with another cautery iron at the joint of the neck at its last vertebra, finishing the procedure; let the cautery be shaped like a nail, following the previous method.
Then treat him with what was used before, until he is healed.
