On the blockage of the penis/ urethra Sometimes children are born who have no opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its proper place.	On the treatment of boys born with imperforate urinary meatus; or with the meatus small or not in the proper place. Sometimes a boy is born from his mother's womb with the glans penis not perforate.	0.7465284
It is therefore necessary as soon as he is born to pierce it with a very fine scalpel / lancet according to this form/method:	So at the moment of his birth you should be quick and make a perforation with a fine scalpel figured thus.	0.70998627
Then put in the opening a thin nail of lead, and tie it and keep it thus for three or four days, and when he needs to urinate, the nail should be removed, and he should urinate, and then replace it; and perhaps it is not necessary, for the urine that comes out prevents it from closing.	Then put in the opening a slender leaden sound, tie it and keep it in for three or four days. When he wishes to make water, it will be removed and he will do so; then put it back. If you do not put in the leaden sound it may be that the urine passing through the place will prevent the wound from healing.	0.8506054
He whose opening is small, he is treated with the lead nail, as we have said, and it will widen.	The case having too narrow a meatus should be treated with the leaden sound, as we have said, for many days until it is wide enough.	0.5011269
Those who do not have the opening in its proper place are injured, for some are born who have the opening at the tip of the penis, because of which they cannot urinate forward unless they lift their penis up; and they cannot procreate because the semen cannot come down to the womb, and this is a bad condition.	In those cases having a misplaced meatusâ€”for example, there are some born with the opening at the edge of the glans so that they cannot make water forwards until the opening of the penis is lifted up by hand, nor can they beget, since the semen cannot reach directly to the uterus, a disorder which is very ugly.	0.7266376
And the method of the procedure is that the patient lies on his back, then stretches the head of the penis and cuts it like the cut of a quill, so that the opening falls in the middle, as it should; and be wary of bleeding that often occurs there, and if it happens, stop it with something that stops blood, and treat the wound until he is healed.	The manner of operating in this case is for the patient to lie back; then with your left hand draw out his glans firmly and cut the end of the glans at the place of the meatus with a broad knife or sharp scalpel, as if sharpening a pen, or as if you were whittling something, so that the middle of it protrudes like a glans penis and the opening falls in the middle as it should. And beware, in your operating, of haemorrhage, which often happens; meet it with styptics and dress the wound until it heals.	0.79685366
