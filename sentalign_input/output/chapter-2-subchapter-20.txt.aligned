On the reduction of the prominence of the eye.	On the reduction of exophthalmos.	0.64321303
When the eye protrudes completely and does not cause harm or impairment in vision, you should leave the patient, follow up, and apply cupping on the neck without scarification and suck well; then apply a liniment made of acatra, aloe, resin, and sarcocolla on the eye, and tighten the dressing on the eye with many layers.	When the whole eye is prominent and there is no reduction or impairment of vision, you should get the patient's bowels open. Then venesect him in the cephalic vein; then apply cupping vessels to his neck without scarification and draw off by gentle suction; then put to the eye a poultice made of acacia and aloes and olibanum and sarcocolla; then bandage the eye over the application with many pads.	0.85378873
The way to make the layers is to take cloths of lion hair, each cloth folded in four layers; and make those layers.	The way to make pads is to take a number of soft rags and fold each into four thicknesses.	0.72232926
Then place them one on top of the other according to the amount needed by the eye. Then tighten them with a hard cloth with strong pressure; repeat the cupping without scarification; then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye tight day and night.	Then put them one on top of the other as the eye requires; then bind on stiff bandages over these, tying them firmly. Repeat the cupping with suction and without scarification. Then take away the cupping vessel and leave the eye bandaged a day and a night.	0.92575824
But if the binding becomes soft in the meantime, then it needs to be very tight.	If the bandaging slackens during that time, it must be tied properly.	0.6056193
Then remove the binding day and night as we have said.	Then remove the bandaging after a day and a night, as we have said.	0.9110919
And if the eye is already reduced, that is good; if not, then repeat the plaster with the layers, the pressure, and the cupping until it is healed.	If you see that the eye has receded, good. Otherwise repeat the applications and pads and bandages and the cupping till it does recede.	0.73039496
