Of the fracture of the clavicle	On setting a fracture of the humerus.	0.499497
The clavicle is what is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder, and if it is fractured, it should be restored according to one of two methods: one is that you take a piece of wood of medium thickness, in this shape:	The humerus is what lies between the elbow and the head of the scapula. If it is fractured it may be set in one of two ways. One is to take a smooth bow-shaped piece of wood of medium thickness, like this.	0.75214016
And tie two straps at the two ends, and hang it up, and seat the patient on a chair; then throw the fractured arm over the wood, so that it comes to the armpit, and has in the middle a curvature of wood, then hang some weight on it or the assistant pulls it down; then the physician sets the fracture evenly with his hands together, so that the fracture returns to how it should be.	You tie two bands at the two ends and then it is hung from above. The patient is to sit on a seat; then his broken arm is folded upon the piece of wood in such a way that his axilla fits into the middle of the curve of the piece of wood. Then hang a heavy weight from the arm, or have an assistant pull it downwards; then the doctor should straighten out the fracture with both hands together until it is properly reduced.	0.931587
And the other method is to lay the patient on his back, and tie his hand to his neck, then command two assistants, one holds what is above the fracture with his hands, and the other holds below with a strap, and each one stretches in his part.	The other way is to make the patient lie back and to suspend his hand from his neck by a band, then you instruct two assistants. One is to grasp with both hands the arm above the fracture, and the other the arm below the fracture; and each should make extension toward himself.	0.910641
And if you see that the stretching needs to be stronger, then bind a strap below the fracture, and above the fracture, and each assistant stretches in his part. And if the fracture is near the shoulder, then you need to place a medium strap under the armpit, and another towards the elbow, below the fracture; and if the fracture is towards the elbow, then lightly place a strap, without effort, until the fracture is even on the spot, and on the elbow; then set the fracture evenly, as necessary, and bind it, if no hot abscess occurs.	And if you wish to extend more strongly, tie a band below the fracture and another above, and let each assistant pull toward himself. If the fracture is near the extremity of the shoulder you will have to put one band beneath the axilla and the other below the fracture near the elbow. Similarly, if the fracture be near the elbow you will have to put a band over the place and over the elbow itself. Then gently and without violence straighten out the fracture until it is restored to its proper shape and fits together well, and then tighten it if no abscess occur.	0.91037834
And if a hot abscess occurs, do not bind it for seven days, and apply wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil, until the hot abscess is soothed; then bind it, and the method of binding is to apply the poultice on the fracture, then place the arm on the clavicle, and place your hand on the shoulder or the breast; and place the cloth, and bind the clavicle, and the arm, so that the arm is in place of splints, if nothing prevents it, or if the bone is not moved.	But if an abscess occur, leave the bandaging until the seventh day and apply raw wool soaked in vinegar and oil of roses until the abscess subsides; then bind it up. The method of binding it is to apply a plaster to the fracture; then wind round the plaster a bandage of new material; then bind the forearm to the humerus, placing his hand open on his shoulder. Then apply pads and bandages to the arm and forearm so that the forearm serves instead of splints, if there is no contra-indication and you see no pathological change in the broken bone.	0.8577993
And if you fear that the bone will move, then use splints, and place on the fracture a splint wider and stronger than the others, and have between each splint a finger's width, and each splint should be so large that it extends three fingers beyond the fracture on each side; then bind the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter on fractures, stronger and less as you move away.	But should you fear any such change then use splints. The way to use these is to place over the fracture itself a splint that is broader and stronger than the rest; and leave a space of a finger's breadth between splints; the splint should be of a length to suit the fracture with the addition of three fingers' breadth all round. Then bandage over the splints in the manner mentioned at the beginning of the chapter. That is, you should bandage more tightly over the fracture itself and more lightly as you get away from the fracture.	0.88072616
And if you see the placement of the splints, and the binding, as we said, when you restore the fractured limb, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave it bound for seven days, as we said; then check every three days the bandage, that itching or swelling does not occur at the spot, or nourishment cannot come to the limb because it is too tight. Adjust it, as we said.	If you decide to put on splints and bandage, as we have said, at the time you set the limb, do so. But if you fear an abscess, leave the splinting and bandaging until the seventh day as we have said. Then examine the bandaging every third day lest there be itching or swelling at the place; or nourishment be prevented from reaching the limb on account of excessively tight bandaging; treat all these in the proper manner according to our prescriptions. But if you are confident that nothing of this sort is happening then do not loosen the bandaging until after many days.	0.87727445
