Chapter twenty-seven on cauterizing the cold liver.	CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN. On the cauterization of a cold liver.	0.8623173
If pain arises in the liver from coldness and moisture, or from intense wind, to the point that it departs excessively from its natural temperament, and the patient is treated with what we mentioned in the classification, but it does not succeed, then it is necessary that the patient lies flat on their back, and three cauterizations are marked with ink in this shape and this exact measure:	When there is pain in the liver from cold and humidity or from thick vapour, so there is a severe disturbance of its natural constitution, and the patient has been treated as prescribed in the appropriate section but with no effect, the patient should lie back, and you should mark with ink the places of three cauterizations, in this form and exactly of this size below the costal cartilages, where the elbow reaches.	0.7911627
On the liver, below the ribs, where the human elbow ends, it should be after each cauterization, with the distance between cauterizations being the thickness of a finger. And the cauterization should be along the length of the body, straight.	Let there be a finger's breadth between each pair of cauterizations and let the burning be straight along the length of the body.	0.587021
And do not clench your hand with the cautery iron, gently.	Do not press the cautery hard with your hand.	0.6867466
And let the amount you burn of the skin's thickness be half of it, no more. And the patient should be standing on his feet.	Let the thickness of the skin you burn be half its thickness, not more; and let the patient be standing on his feet during the cauterization.	0.8030065
But if he is not standing, then he should be lying down, having extended his legs and raised his arms.	Alternatively he may be recumbent with legs outstretched and arms raised.	0.6494795
And you can cauterize these cauterizations with the scalpel cautery if you have gentleness and skill in the craft.	You will also be able to do these cauterizations with the edged cautery when you have craft and facility in the art.	0.7708779
And be careful not to go too deep in the cauterization, burning all the skin, so that you burn the abdomen and reach the intestines. For the skin there is thin, so know this.	Be careful lest you go too deep with the cautery and burn the whole thickness of the skin and the abdomen and penetrate to the intestine, for the skin there is thin; bear this in mind.	0.79282284
