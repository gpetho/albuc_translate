Having completed for you, children, this book, which is the final treatise in medicine with its completion, and having reached its conclusion by its explanations and its statements, it has seemed good to me to complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of surgery, that is, of surgery by hand.
Since surgery by hand is fallen into disuse in our region and in our time, entirely private; until perhaps its knowledge perished and its trace was severed; and nothing remained of it but small descriptions in the books of the ancients, which were altered by hands, and error and hesitation befell them, until its intentions were closed and its vision distanced; it has seemed good to me to revive it with the arrangement of this treatise, according to the way of exposition, explanation, and abbreviation, and to come with forms of cautery instruments, and the other surgical instruments; with the addition of explanation, and with the haste of what is necessary.
The reason why a good craftsman is not found with his hand in this time of ours, is: because the art of medicine is long, and its author needs to be practiced beforehand in the knowledge of anatomy, which Galen described, until he knows the aids of the limbs, and their shapes, and their connections, and their separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and tendons, and their number, and their exits, and the pulsating and still veins, and the places of their exits.
And because of that, Hippocrates said that name with name is much, and with work is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
We however have already spoken of that at the beginning of this book.
Since he who is not knowledgeable about what we have said about anatomy is not excused from falling into the error by which men are killed; just as I have seen many of those who are formed in this science, and boast of it without knowledge and without experience.
That is, because I saw a foolish physician cut an abscess on the woman's neck, and he cut some arteries in the neck, so that the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead between his hands.
And I saw another physician, who presumed to extract a stone from a man who was advanced in age, and the stone was large.
Therefore, he reached it and extracted it with a piece of the bladder.
Therefore the man died on the third day.
And I myself had already been called to extract it: and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the sick man, that he would die.
And I saw another physician, who was receiving payment from a certain Duke of our land for medicine: and it happened to a black eunuch, who was with him, a fracture in his leg near the heel: and the physician, in his ignorance, hurried and bound the fracture over the wound with pillows and small stones with strong constriction, and did not allow the wound any breathing space.
Then he discharged him according to his own desires.
Afterwards he dismissed him for a few days, and ordered him not to loosen the bandage: and he stood thus until his leg and foot were ulcerated, and reached destruction.
I was therefore summoned to him: and I hastened to loosen the bandage: and tranquility followed, and he escaped his pains.
However, corruption had already become firmly established in the limb, and I was unable to restrain it.
Therefore, the corruption ceased to spread through the limb, until it perished.
And I saw another physician, who pierced the cancerous ulcer: and it ulcerated after days, until its malice increased with its master.
That is because when cancer is pure from melancholic humor, then it is not necessary to reach it with iron at all, unless it is in a limb that can tolerate having all of it amputated.
And therefore, my children, it is necessary for you to know that surgery, with its hands, is divided into two divisions: namely, surgery to which health is associated; and surgery with which there is danger in many dispositions. And I have now aroused in every place of this book, in which surgery comes, in which there is terror and fear.
Therefore it is necessary for you to beware of that, and to cut it short, so that fools may not find a way to speak ill of it and dishonor it.
Therefore, receive the measure with care and protection, and your sick with ease and firmness, and use the better way leading by God's grace to health and a laudable succession; and leave the terrible sicknesses of difficult cure; and remove your souls from that which makes you fear, so that hesitation may enter upon your faith and your advantage. For it is more remaining to your glory, and more sublime in this world, and finally to your quantities.
For Galen has already said in some of his admonitions. Do not treat a bad illness, lest you be called a bad physician.

Part I.
Concerning the benefit and harm of the cautery: and in which temperaments it is suitable, and at what time: and if with iron, or gold.
Chapter 1.
But before I recall the operation with it, it is necessary to say the quality of its benefits and harms, and in what temperament it should be used.
Therefore I say that the discussion of the quality of the cautery's benefit and harm is a lengthy and subtle discussion, a matter of knowledge and hidden secrets.
Many wise men have spoken on it, and disagreed, and for me a little of their words is enough, fearing prolixity.
Therefore I say that cautery is beneficial to every temperament, whether with matter or without matter, except for two temperaments: a hot temperament without matter, and a dry temperament without matter.
However, they disagreed in the hot and dry temperament with matter.
For some said that cautery is beneficial in it.
And others said the opposite, namely that cautery is not suitable in a sickness arising from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat; and it is unsuitable that one should be cured of a hot and dry illness with something hot and dry.
And he who says the opposite stated that cautery is beneficial in every hot and dry illness that occurs in human bodies, because when you compare the human body and its humours to the temperament of fire, you find the human body to be cold.
And I, indeed, say through his speech, that through experience it has revealed that to me several times.
However, it is not appropriate for anyone to undertake it unless they have already been proven and practiced in the final exercise of cautery, and have knowledge of the diversity of human complexions and the disposition of illnesses within themselves, and their causes, and their accidents, and their time span.
However, there is no fear concerning the remaining complexions, and especially in cold and moist illnesses. For already all physicians have agreed on them, and have not disagreed on the benefit of cautery in them.
And know, children, that the secret of healing through cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with burning medicine, is this: since fire is simple, its action does not reach beyond the limb that is cauterized; and it does not harm another limb joined to it, except with a small harm.
However, the action of burning medicine reaches that which is distant from the limbs; and perhaps it causes illness of difficult healing in the limb, and perhaps kills it.
But fire, because of its subtlety and goodness of its substance, does not do that unless it overflows.
However, this has now become known to us through experiment, because of the length of our service and study of the art, and our standing on the truth of things; and because of this I am excused from the length of speech.
And know, children, that they disagree on the time in which the cautery should be performed, and they put a better time as spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at any time; because the harm that is accidental due to the time is submerged in the benefit that is drawn with the cautery.
And especially if the cautery is for pains from necessary, strong, urgent pains, which do not tolerate delay; because it is feared from them that a greater harm may occur than the small harm that enters due to the time.
And do not let it fall into your minds, O children, that which only the common people and foolish physicians fear, namely that the illness which is cured by cautery does not always have a return; and they posit that as a consequence, and the matter is not as they think: because cautery is not, unless in place of medicine, which alters the complexion and dries the humours which are the causes, why the pains occur.
However, cautery is superior to medicine by the speed of its health, and the power of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion; and it is possible that the illness may return at some time according to the patient's complexion, and the location of their illness, and its power; and that which is prepared in their body from the accumulation of superfluities in it; and that which comes to them in its acquisition from foods, and similar things from such causes, unless an illness occurs, to which cautery is administered. A subtle illness in a limb of few superfluities and humours, like the cautery of a tooth, because of the pain, and similar to it, for it is possible that that pain will not return to it.
But that happens in few cases.
But truly the common people's statement, that cautery is the last of medicine, is a correct statement; not in the sense that they intend in that, because they believe that there is no cure which can compare to medicine, nor to anything after the cautery has passed.
However, the matter is the opposite of that, and the intention that cautery is the last resort of medicine is not unless that when we administer methods of treatment for an illness, and those medicines do not work; then we administer cautery at the end of the matter, and it does work; then from this it follows that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention understood by the common people and many foolish physicians.
However, the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except because of the equal nature of gold and the nobility of its substance; and they said that the site of the cautery does not cause pus. However, that is not absolutely so, because I have already tested it, and found that it does not do that in some bodies without others.
And cautery with it [gold] is good, and better than with iron, as they said.
However, when you make a cautery of gold in fire, it is not clear to you when the fire reaches the desired amount because of the redness of the gold; and when it quickly approaches cold, and if you add further fire to it, it melts in the fire and turns into sheets.
Therefore, the craftsman falls from that into occupation, and because of that, cautery with iron is faster and more suitable for us, by virtue of its suitability to the operation.
And I have indeed already arranged this chapter on cautery, according to chapters, and arranged them from head to foot, so that they will relieve the one seeking what they want from it. Concerning the method of cauterizing the head at the coronal suture.
Chapter II.
This cauterization benefits by controlling moisture and cold upon the brain:  which two are the cause of headaches, and the multitude of flowing humors from the head to the eyes and ears, and of much sleep, and toothache, and throat pain; and universally all illness that arises from cold, such as paralysis, and headaches, and epilepsy, and apoplexies, and similar illnesses.
The method of cauterization is, that you prescribe to the sick person, that he be evacuated first with a cleansing, dissolving medicine, for three or four nights, according to the strength of the sick person, and their age, and their custom.
Then prescribe that he make his head bare with a razor.
Then make him sit between your hands, squared, so that he has already placed his hands upon his chest.
Then place the root of your palm upon the root of his nose between his eyes. Wherever, therefore, your middle finger shall arrive, mark that place with the cautery. Then apply the olive-shaped cautery to the fire. Then place it upon the place marked with the cautery, descending, with which your hand is gradually bound, and you shall revolve it.
Then quickly lift your hand, and observe the place.
If you see now a quantity of head of alkiel, or a quantity of zeuherb, detached from the bone, then raise your hand.
And if not, repeat your hand with the iron itself, or with another of it if it grows cold, until the bones are seen, which I told you.
Then take some salt, and dissolve it in water, and soak the cloth in it, and place it on the place; and leave it for three days.
Then place the cloth soaked in butter on it, and leave it on the place until the scab is destroyed by the fire. Then treat it with the four-drug ointment until it is healed.
They have said that the more a wound remains open, the more pus it emits: therefore it is better and more helpful.
And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized down to the bone, and the cautery should be held until something of the thickness of bone is burned.
Then shave off that which has been burned from the bone, then treat it.
And others say that it is necessary to reach the ultimate point with the cautery, until it imprints a hollow form in the bone, so that the bone falls off, which is done as a kind of kirate shape: or an instrument that women use when applying small alphabetic infusions.  And they believe that vapors of the head are expelled from this place, and the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then treat it until it consolidates.
However, these two types of cautery do not seem to me to be suitable for everyone, except in some cases, according to the way of fear.
And to leave it, in my opinion, is better with the safety of the person.
For the head is weakened by the disruption of its natural continuity, as we have seen in other members; and especially when the head of the weak person is naturally feeble.  And indeed, the first type of cautery is safer and better in my view, and I use it; therefore operate with it for safety.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the head in pain of the entire head.
Chapter III.
When chronic pain occurs in the entire head, and it is prolonged in the sick person, and he uses leeches, and cupping, and head purges, and oils, and plasters.
And especially if it has already been cauterized with the one cautery that we have described, and none of those things help it, then consider.
For if the sick person's head is of strong natural constitution, and is not weak, and encounters violent cold, then cauterize with another cautery beneath the first slightly.
Then cauterize it on every horn of his head with a cautery, but not so that the skin is pierced and a quantity of bone is exposed, as we have described.
And cauterize it with one cautery on the back of his head, in the place called the *vas* (vessel), and it is the place where a cupping glass is placed; and raise your cautery there, and do not expose the bone.
For the sick person experiences a violent and different pain because of that, from the pain of all the other cauteries on the head.
And I will say that this cautery should be in its proper place; and it should be a cautery for cauterizing the horns of the head, and the back of his head with a finer cautery than that used to cauterize the middle of the head.
And this is its form.
Concerning the method of cauterization in a hemicrania, both with a cauterizing medicine and with iron.
Chapter IV.
When pain and throbbing occur in a part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and it is relieved with cleansing medicines for the head, and the remaining treatment, as I have described in the divisions of illnesses, is given, but it all does not help: then cauterization is performed on that part in two ways: either by cauterization with a burning, sharp medicine, or with iron. The cautery with a burning, sharp medicine is to take one garlic clove, peel it, and cut off its ends on both sides.
Then, with a broad lancet, incise the painful area until a space is created beneath the skin in which the clove is placed.
Then insert it into the space beneath the skin until it is hidden; then bind it over with a suitable constriction pad, and leave it for fifteen hours. Then release it, remove the garlic, and allow the wound to heal for two or three days. Afterward, apply a poultice soaked in butter until the area produces pus. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do it with some burning medicines, which I have written about in the twelfth treatise, on Burning Medicines.
The cauterization of it with iron, is according to this method.
A cautery of fire, whose form is this.
And it is called a Clavil, because the shape of its head is like the shape of a nail, in which there is something curved, and in its middle is a small eminence.
Then place it on the area, and hold your hand, and you turn the iron slowly with speed, and the amount burned should be, from the thickness of the skin, as much as half of it.
And raise your hand, so that the artery, which is below, is not burned, and a flow of blood occurs.
Then soak a cloth in salt water, and place it on the area, and leave it for three days; then place the cloth with butter; afterwards treat with ointment until it is healed. And if you wish, cauterize this hemicrania with the second cautery's knife-like end.
And beware of cutting the artery in this hemicrania, not properly ancient.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in ancient hemicrania.
Chapter V.
When treating hemicrania, with what we said from the previous treatment, and what we said in the divisions of diseases, and if the treatment does not help, and you see from the disease that what we said about the first cautery with medicine, or with cautery with fire, is not sufficient, then it is necessary to heat the knife-like cautery until it is whitened after marking the site of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or about that; and place your hand in turn, and press it until you cut the artery and reach the bone. However, it is necessary for you to beware of the continuation of the jaw, which moves during mastication, lest the side or nerve that moves it be burned, from which spasm may occur.
And be on guard, and careful of the flow of blood from the artery that has been cut.
For in its cutting there is fear, and especially for him who is ignorant of what he does, and is not studious nor experienced, and abandons the operation with that in the first place.
And I will come with a reminder of the regimen of the blood flow that occurs from the artery according to its manner, and in the place of this book.
If you see from the illness that this cautery is not sufficient for him, and you see the body of the infirm tolerating the cautery in the middle of the head, as we have narrated, treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery, which we stated in the chapter on the extraction of the artery with a cautery having two knives.
For cauterization is better than this and more beneficial. Concerning the manner of cauterization in earache.
Chapter VI. When earache arises from cold, and is treated with remedies, and with the other treatment which we mentioned in the division, and the pain is not removed, then cauterize with fire: and that is what is called the Point, whose shape is this.
Then apply the points, after its ignition, in a circuit around the entire ear, as it revolves; or in a circuit around each, if the pain is in both at the same time.
And move the cautery slightly away from the root of the ear, after marking the places with ink; and let the quantity of cautery be ten points in each ear, and approximately like that.
Then treat the places until they are healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Torture.
Chapter VII.
The torture which is treated with cauterization is only from the species that arise from phlegm, according to what we said in the divisions of diseases. And avoid cauterization of the species that arises from dryness and nerve spasm.
When you treat this species of torture with emetics, and purges, and gargles, and your treatment is not effective, then you must cauterize the afflicted person with three cauteries: one near the root of the ear, and a second slightly lower from its time, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the afflicted part.
Because softening does not occur, unless in the part that appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with a cautery directly at the extremity of the upper ear below the horn of the head slightly; and another at the temple; whose length should be according to the length of the thumb.
And hold your hand with the cautery until a quantity equal to half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a kind from the surgical knife, whose form is as described; however, it is not much finer than that, as you see; and it should be a knife with a little superfluous thickness. Then treat the places, with what preceded, until they are healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in ancient apoplexy.
Chapter VIII.
When apoplexy has become chronic, and you have treated it with what we have said, and your treatment is not helping, and the sick person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries over each horn of his head, and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said, and with a cautery on the back of the head, according to what went before; and the method of cautery should be according to what preceded.
Also, cauterize with a cautery on the mouth of the stomach; and this is more of a last resort.
Then, let it be treated with what went before.
Concerning the method of cauterization in cases of oblivion.
Chapter IX.
It is necessary that large doses of hyerae and pills that purify the brain be given to the sick person first in the drink.
Then shave the entire head of the sick person, and place on their occiput a plaster of synapis as described in the treatise on plasters: and apply it several times. For this is indeed the method of cautery; and do it according to the same order as I have said there. If therefore it cures by it, it is good.
If not: then make three cauteries on the back part of his head, which descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and place the thickness of a finger between each cautery.
Then treat the cautery with what preceded it.
If however you wish an addition, and the sick person is able to tolerate it, then make a cautery in the middle.
If you wish an addition, then cauterize him above the two horns.
Then treat him until he is healed: and let the cautery be olive-shaped, according to the form that was previously stated.
On the method of cauterizing in paralysis and softening.
Chapter X.
It is necessary that you proceed in the cleansing of the head with hygeirs, and with what we have said.
Then shave the head of the sick person; afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery on each horn of the head, and with a cautery on its back, and with three on the vertebrae of the neck.
If however the sickness requires the softening of the body with more than those [previously mentioned], and the sick person is tolerant, and the illness is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and lastly with a cautery, until most of his skin is burned, and raise your hand.
Then care for him until he is healed: and thus the cautery of Olives.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Epilepsy.
Chapter XI.
An epileptic is not cauterized, unless that one whose epilepsy is from phlegm. Therefore, it is necessary that you first cleanse his brain with leeches, and with the other treatment that we have mentioned in the division, when the sick person is strong, or is tolerant in accepting medicines.
However, if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and brain-cleansing mastications are administered, beforehand for many days, along with the improvement of foods.
Then shave his head, afterwards cauterize him with one cautery in the middle of the head, according to what has been mentioned before in the method, and with another cautery on his occiput, and with a cautery on every horn of his head.
If the patient is strong and tolerant, then cauterize him with the cauteries that I mentioned in cases of paralysis, and for softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back: and let the cautery be olive-shaped, according to the method that preceded. If however the patient is a child, then place a delicate cautery, according to this method.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Melancholy.
Chapter XII.
When the causes of melancholy are corrupted humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with the cauteries that we have stated in cases of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of inclination to melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him a drink that will cleanse his brain, according to what preceded in the division; then shave the patient's head, and afterward make a properly made roll of linen, like a circle.
Then place it in the middle of the head; and the patient, seated upright, is to be held firm on all sides.
Then apply the liniment. And it is better made from old sheep's butter.
And heat it over a fire with a moderate amount of heat, which a finger can tolerate when inserted into it.
Then apply it in a circle in the middle of his head, and leave it until it cools.
Do this to the sick person once a week, with the rest of his good regimen, until he is healed.
Or if you wish, cauterize it by making many small punctures throughout it, holding the cauterizing hand:  indeed, let it be by smelling.
For this type of cautery moistens the brain with quality.
Then place over it a cloth soaked in butter, or chicken fat.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in descending water to the eye.
Chapter XIII.
When you are shown the beginning of water in the eye through the signs I have described in the division, then begin to give the weak one something that will cleanse his head.
And keep him away from all moisture, and make him sit in a bath, fasting for several days.
Then command him to shave his head, and cauterize him in the middle of his head. Then cauterize him above the two temples with two cauteries, if the descent of water has begun in both eyes simultaneously; or on one side, if the beginning of the water is in one eye; and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are beneath the skin; and let the cauteries be long in width to the temples; and beware of the flow of blood.
If you see something from it, then cut it out immediately with whatever medicine is possible; and I will come with the knowledge that is in the extraction of arteries, and the cutting of them, and the caution from the flow of blood.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck, beneath the two bones, with two cauteries finally produced.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the ancient Lachrymis.
Chapter XIV.
When the tears of the eyes are chronic, persistent; and they are above the veins and arteries which are in the visible exterior of the head, it is verified that it is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities; then cauterize with the same cautery that I have described at the beginning of descending water, a cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries above the two temples, and two cauteries in the neck beneath the two bones.
And if it needs further treatment, then cauterize it on every side of the eye carefully, above the extremity of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the foul odor of the Nose.
Chapter XV.
When you treat it, with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then quickly, and give the weak decoctions in a drink for three nights: afterward shave his head, and cauterize it with a medium cautery, with an olive cautery.
Then cauterize it with a nail cautery, using two cauteries, above the two eyebrows beneath the hair a little.
And guard against the artery, lest you strike it.
And this is the form of the nail cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the softening of the eyelid.
Chapter XVI.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with a single cautery, with this lunar cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows slightly with two cauteries on every side; and let them be distant from the two temples; and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the eyebrow; and do not bring your hand with the cautery to the end, but according to the amount that the third eyelid is burnt.
And this is the form of the cautery according to this method of lunar cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the eyelid when the hairs are turned inward, irritating the eye. Chapter XVII.
The cautery in it is according to two methods: either cautery with fire, or cautery with a burning medicine.
In cautery with fire, first advise the patient to remove his hairs, if he is one who cleans them, until they are extended and even. If, however, they irritate him at their origin, then bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move, until they grow out.
When therefore they grow out and are even, then place the patient's head in your bosom; then mark on the eyelid of his eyes with encaustic, a mark that is according to the shape of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Then place a cloth soaked in egg white, or in psyllium mucilage, on the eye.
Then apply the cautery, whose shape is this.
Then cauterize over the figure which you marked, gradually in many stages, until the skin surface, which is like the shape of a myrtle leaf, is entirely burned away.
And the sign of the success of your work is, that if you see the eyelid already contracting, and the hairs rising near the puncture of the eye.
Therefore raise your hand then, and leave it for three days.
Then place on it a cloth with butter, until the eschar is removed.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
If any hair returns after an hour, and the eyelid softens, then again cauterize that place, as you did at first.
If however the hairs are in the lower part, then cauterize it until it rises to its natural place and is even so that the hairs do not prick the eye.
Concerning the method of cauterizing with a burning medicine in the same case.
Chapter XVIII.
It is to instruct the sick person to let the hairs fall until they lengthen and become even.
Make a form of a myrtle leaf from paper and cloth.
Then take from known soap and from unsoaked lime, one ounce of each, or nearly so; then grind them together thoroughly, and make it quickly so that it does not grow cold.
Then spread some of this over the paper that you made in the form of a myrtle leaf, and place it over the eyelid of one or two eyes.
And place under the eye a cloth soaked in egg white; and let the sick person's head be in your bosom.
And place your index finger on the medicine, and press it for a little while.
And you should move it whenever the sick person feels the medicine's biting, because its biting is found to be like fire.
While, therefore, that which he finds biting persists, then remove the medicine, and move it with your finger.
When therefore the biting subsides, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And then consider, if you see the eyelid being raised, as it is raised with cauterization or incision, it is good. And if not, then repeat the medicine on the area where the medicine doesn't take hold, and doesn't blacken, until your operation is equalized, and the eye is contracted.
Then place upon it Cotum with butter, until the skin of the burn is eradicated.
Then treat it with diaphinicon ointment, or another, until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you in the operation, that you guard the last safeguard, so that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye.
If the eyelid softens after days, and something from the hairs fights in the eye, then repeat the medicine on that place which softens from the eyelid itself, as you did at first.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the myrtle leaf.
And know that the eyes of men differ in size and smallness.
Therefore, according to that, let your consideration be: and the path of rectitude is not hidden from him who studies this art.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in a tear duct fistula.
Chapter XIX.
When you treat a fistula, in accordance with what we have said in the divisions of illnesses, and if your treatment is not helping, then it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Command the sick person to place his head in your lap, and let the attendant hold his head between his hands in such a way that it does not move or shake with his head.
Then place a heated poultice of egg white, or in psyllium mucilage, over his eye; then apply the cautery, whose shape is this.
Let it be concave, like the shape of a vulture's wing feather from one end, with which the cautery is made; and if you wish it to penetrate to the other end, and if you wish it to be held upward in that manner.
However, this concave shape is better for your work.
Then place the cautery, which is made very hot, upon it.
And hold your hand with the cautery for a short while near the cautery, from the eye to the part of the nose, so that your hand does not stray or the sick person is not disturbed; and you shall place the cautery on the fat of the eye and corrupt it.
If therefore you arrive at the beginning of your cautery up to the opening, it will be well.
And if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if you need it; and leave it for three days.
Then place a cloth with butter, and treat it with a drying ointment, until it is healed. If forty days pass and it is not healed, then place upon it a sharp corrosive medicine, until the opening is exposed; and scrape it according to what is in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing fistulas, which some of the first ones said.
Direct yourself to the place of the fistula, and split it open; then put into the fissure a fine camahan, that is, a thin cannula, whose form is this.
And pour into it a drachma's worth of molten lead, and hold your hand with a good retaining cannula, and let the infirm person not move at all, so that the molten lead does not run, or reach his eye.
And it is necessary that you place on the eye of the infirm a poultice infused in egg white, or in water.
For lead burns the place of the fistula, and heals it with a wonderful cure.
If the fistula is healed with what we have said about cautery and treatment, it is good.
And if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal opening, and to reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to where it will come to its proper place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in lip fissures.
Chapter XX.
Often fissures occur in the lip, which are called "pili," and especially in the lips of children.
Therefore, when you treat these fissures, as we have said in the division of diseases, and if the treatment does not help, then a small knife cauterium, according to this form, should be used.
And its concavity should be according to the sharpness of the knife.
Then treat it with a cautery, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in an oral fistula.
Chapter XXI.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, then it produces pus and bursts; afterwards, it becomes chronic and pus flows, and a fistula forms; then, if treatment does not help, it is necessary to cauterize the fistula with a cautery according to its size.
Then introduce the heated iron into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and its end; do this once, or twice.
Then treat it afterwards, with what we said about treatment until it is healed.
If therefore the pus is discharged and it heals, it will be good.
And if not, then it is necessary to expose the place and remove the diseased bone according to what appears on its head.
Concerning the method of cauterization in softened gums and teeth.
Chapter XXII.
When the gum softens because of moisture, and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines, and it does not help: then place the patient's head in your lap.
Then, with fire, a cautery, whose form will come after this, so that you place the Cannula over the tooth; and quickly insert the heated Cautery into it; and hold your hand for a short while, until the patient feels the heat of the fire already having reached the root of the tooth.
And lift your hand; then repeat the cautery several times, as you wish.
Then let the patient fill their mouth with salt water, and hold it for one hour; and let them spit it out.
For the moved tooth is strengthened, and the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
Chapter XXIII.
When toothache is due to cold, or there is cold or a worm in it, and treatment with medicines is of no avail, then the cautery is applied in two ways: either cautery with butter, or cautery with fire.
However, the cautery with butter is such that you take cow's butter and boil it in an iron spoon, or in a pot.
Then take a cloth, and wrap it around the end of the probe.
Then immerse it in the boiled butter, and quickly place it on the painful tooth, and hold it until it cools; then repeat this several times, until the heat's effect reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, immerse wool, or a cloth in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth; and place heated iron on top of it, until the fire reaches the deep cavity of the tooth.
Its cauterization with fire is to apply a brass or iron tube. And let there be something of its thickness, so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the sick person's bone.
Then apply a cautery, whose shape will be appropriate, and place it on that tooth, and hold your hand until the cautery cools.
Do it several times, for the pain will be removed, either on that same day, or on another day.
And it is necessary, in the application of that cautery, that the sick person fill his mouth with good butter, and hold it for one hour; then he should spit it out.
And this is the shape of the cautery.
Cauterize with whichever extremity you can, according to what is possible; and this is the shape of the cannula.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the Strophules.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
When Strophules are from phlegm and from cold humours, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, and you wish their digestion swiftly, then use a concave Cautery with this shape.
Having two open extremities, so that smoke may escape from the cautery from one extremity; and place it, ignited, upon the abscess once, and a second time if necessary, until it reaches the depth of the abscess.
If the abscess is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the abscess.
Then leave it for three days, and place upon it a poultice infused in butter, until that which the fire has burned away is removed.
Then treat it with tooth ointment until the shape of the cannula is healed.
On the method of cauterizing for hoarseness of voice and constriction of breathing.
Chapter XXV.
When humidities overcome the lung passage, and especially when it is with a cold constitution, then it is necessary that the sick person be evacuated in the first place with dissolving medicines.
Then cauterize it in the nocrati near the root of the throat in the depressed place: and beware, lest you reach with the cautery to the throat, nor into the skin, except somewhat of it.
Then cauterize it with another cautery at the junction of the neck at the last of its vertebrae, and let the cautery be narrow according to the manner which preceded.
Then treat it with what preceded, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in illnesses of the Lungs and Cough.
Chapter XXVI.
When Cough and illness of the Lungs are from cold humors, and the sick person does not have a fever, nor consumption, and the illness is long-standing, then cauterize him with two cauteries above the fork in the low, smooth, empty places.
And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples: and let the cautery be of the tube shape as preceded.
And if your wish is to cauterize by puncturing with the cautery, called the Point, whose shape preceded in the puncturing of ear pain: and let the punctures be from thirty punctures up to nearly another.
Then treat him with what preceded, until he is healed. And now let the cautery have three branches: according to this shape.
Therefore, cauterization will be alleviated when you use three cauteries at once.
On the method of cauterization in the Titillico, in the dislocation of the Humerus.
Chapter XXVII.
When the head of the humerus is dislocated due to moisture, and does not settle into its proper place upon returning from the dislocation, until it becomes accustomed to returning, then dislocated by a small movement, which occurs as we have already testified, then you must first reduce the dislocation.
Then the patient is placed on his back, or on his healthy side.
Then raise the skin that is on the inside of the Titillico towards the top with the fingers of your left hand: and if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then, having a cautery with two prongs. Whose form is this.
Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates it to the other side, and the shape of the cauterization will come with four cauteries.
And sometimes cauterization is done with a cautery having three prongs, wherefore the shape of the cauterization is then six cauteries: and the prongs are according to the thinness of the tent.
And this is the form of a cautery having three prongs.
And sometimes one is added above this manner, wherefore there are eight cauteries.
Then place on the cautery crushed leeks with salt.
Then cause the weak person to adhere to quietude, so that the limb does not move at any time until it is strengthened.
And if the dislocation is to the upper parts, and rarely does it happen thus, then cauterize it above the shoulder with a clavicle cautery, or with many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is strengthened, and moisture is removed: and the weak person is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the Stomach.
Chapter XXVIII.
When there are cold and much moisture in the stomach, until they draw it out from its temperament, and phlegm increases within it, and continuous methods of treatment are of no avail: then it is necessary for the sick person to lie on their back, and extend their legs and hands.
Then cauterize with three cauteries: one cautery beneath the breastbone, the size of a finger, with a narrow cautery, and two cauteries below it on either side of a single cautery, until a triangular figure of cauteries is produced.
And lengthen them between each so that they do not unite, when they will make pus. And the depth of the cautery should be the amount of two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
And let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form, without addition. And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach, according to this form, let the cautery used for this be one, according to the form of a circle.
And the stomach is cauterized by pricking it for one who is frightened by this cautery. And it is as if you mark a point on the stomach according to the amount you wish with ink. Then cauterize it with a cautery of the point. Then treat it with the treatment that preceded until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a cold liver.
Chapter XXIX.
When pain occurs in the liver due to coldness and moisture, or to thick wind, until it emerges from its natural disposition by an excess expulsion, and the sick person is treated with what we have said, and it does not help him, then it is necessary for the sick person to be placed on their neck, and to mark three cauteries with ink according to this figure and this same amount on the lower liver from the hypochondria, where the man's elbow reaches. And let the space between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger. And let the cautery be straight according to the length of the body, and do not press your hand with the cautery too much.
And let the amount that is burned be, from the thickness of the skin, the amount of half of it not added. And let the sick person be standing on their feet.
If however, he is not standing, then let him lie down, having already extended his legs and raised his arms. This is the form of the cautery.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a knife cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And beware that you do not proceed too far in cauterization, and the thickness of the entire skin is burned, therefore the whole body is burned, and it reaches the intestines. For the skin there is thin, therefore know that.
Concerning the method of cauterizing liver abscesses.
Chapter XXX.
When an exit occurs, and you wish to know if the abscess is in the flesh of the liver, or in its tunic: then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the sick person is afflicted by pain and heaviness without sharpness; and if it is in the tunic of the liver, there is sharp, intense pain; and you see now that the treatment has fatigued his physicians.
Therefore, it is necessary for the sick person to lie on their back.
Then, mark the location of the abscess with ink; then, apply the cautery, which is likened to a ray.
And this is its form.
And cauterize with it one cautery, until the entire skin is burned and reaches the suppurating matter, until all the pus comes out; then treat it with the treatment for discharging wounds, until it is healed.
And it is not appropriate to use this type of cautery, unless one whose study of the medical art is prolonged, and through whose hands these illnesses have frequently passed with experience, then may dare to undertake such an operation.
But truly, to abandon it, is better with me.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Pleuritis.
Chapter XXXI.
The ancients said that a cautery with aristolochia roots should be used for cold pleurisy in this manner.
And it is, that you take from the dry long roots of aristolochia, one root longer than the others found among them, and be like the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil, and ignite it in fire.
Then cauterize with one cautery at the point between the fork's extension and the neck, and with two small cauteries in a slightly sloping position towards the area below the beard.
And with two cauteries also in that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping slightly to the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
And with three cauteries from the back: one in that which is between the two shoulder blades; and with two cauteries from the two sides of the chest, below the cautery that is between the two shoulder blades.
And you should not press your hand with the cautery, rather it should be visible by smelling the skin. And some ancient ones have said that there are men who use a cautery made of iron similar to a rod: and they set it alight, and insert it into that which is between the ribs, until they reach the abscess with it, and pus comes out, just as we said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this perforation with a cautery there is a fear that either the weak man dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, which has no cure.
Of the method of cauterizing the Spleen, Chapter XXXII.
When you treat the illness of the spleen, with that which we said concerning treatment in the division of illnesses, and your treatment does not help, then the cautery on it is in three ways, all of which are correct.
One of which is to make three cauteries, or four, by drawing a line along the length of the spleen, according to the shape of the liver cauteries, whose shape preceded.
And let there be between each cautery a quantity of the thickness of a finger, or more or less.
And let the method of the cautery be, which we said in the cautery of the liver, equally.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; and let the infirm person be lying supine on his back.
And another method of cauterization is: that you heat the cautery having two prongs, which we said in the chapter on the dislocation of the humerus; and lift the skin, which is directly over the spleen, where the left elbow of the infirm person reaches; and let your lifting of the skin be according to the width of the body, so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Then insert the two very hot prongs until you penetrate the skin with them on the other side; then withdraw the cautery; therefore four cauteries are made. And if you wish to cauterize with another cautery having three prongs.
Then treat the cautery after you have allowed it to discharge pus for many days; for it is more beneficial than all the rest which preceded it in the cure.
Concerning the method of cauterization in dropsy.
Chapter XXXIII.
The cautery does not fall upon dropsy, unless properly applied.
When you treat the dropsical patient with the methods of treatment, which we have stated in the division, and the cure does not benefit, then you must cauterize him with four cauteries in a circle around the navel, and with one cautery above the stomach, and with another cautery above the liver, and a cautery above the spleen, and with two cauteries behind the back between the vertebrae, and one directly on the chest, and another directly on the stomach: and let the depth of the cautery be near the thickness of the skin.
Then leave the cautery open, so that it discharges pus for a long time.
And do not remove the sick person from treatment after the cautery, because two intentions must be aggregated to him: and healing will hasten to him with the help of God.
The form of the cautery with which the belly is cauterized should be a nail-shaped, as its form preceded; and that with which the back is cauterized, should be olive-shaped, as its form preceded.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the Feet and Legs. Chapter Thirty-Four.
When abscesses develop in a hydropic patient, and they fill with yellow water, you should cauterize on the back of the foot, in the area between the auricular and annular regions; and lift your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; then lift your hand; and do not repeat it at all.
For the yellow water will drain, and the cautery should be of this form.
Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be made with the blade end of the cautery; and let the cautery be made along the length of the leg, one below the knee, and the other below that, approximately the middle of the leg; and on each thigh, make two cauteries; and leave the cautery open without treatment for a long time, so that some water drains from it; then treat it with the rest of what we have said.
Concerning the method of cauterization in abdominal distension. Chapter XXXV.
When the abdomen is distended due to cold and dampness, weakening the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and treatment is applied but fails to cure it; and you see a weak patient tolerating a cautery of great strength, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, according to what preceded in cauterizing the stomach with a circular cautery, and with four subtle cauteries around the navel, with a subtle claw-shaped cautery, and a large cautery above the intestines, or with two cauteries.
And if you see excessive moisture, and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize him with a cautery on the chest, and a cautery on each hip; and perhaps add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
For it is a beneficial treatment, whose help does not err.
Concerning the method of cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVI.
When in the anus are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are from gross, cold humors, or corrupted moistures, and are treated with what we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower spine of the back, somewhat triangularly under the almeidati, and with a cautery under the navel, as if with two fingers.
And if you think that his stomach is chilled, and his food is not digested, and you see his face becoming abscessed, then cauterize him on his stomach with a large cautery, according to what has preceded: and with a cautery on his liver, and another on his spleen, with a nail cautery: and leave the cautery open for some time: then treat him until he is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing althelul after their excision.
Chapter XXXVII.
When you excise althelul, then apply a cautery resembling a ray.
Then insert the heated cautery into the excised althelul: and with the last of your hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows: do it once, or twice. If, therefore, the althelul are many, then cauterize each one with a cautery according to what we have narrated.
Then treat them with what is beneficial to them from the ointments, until they are healed.
And if you cauterize it with a large cautery over the alcatin, it is more useful in helping.
Concerning the method of cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
When the sick person does not obey the incision and work that we have described in its place, and is terrified by it, perhaps he is cured with a cautery.
When therefore a fistula happens to someone, and it becomes old, pus runs from it, and corrupted humours.
Therefore, it is worth while to probe it with a fine probe.
Then ascertain the depth of it with the probe.
Then heat the cautery, which is like a ray.
Then insert the heated cautery into the fistula itself and the amount in which the cautery entered. And repeatedly apply the cautery to it until all those corrupted bodies are burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to your necessity.
And guard yourself from burning the nerve, if there is one there, or a large vein; or if the fistula extends to the bladder, or to the intestines, then guard yourself from these places in all of them.
And do not do it unless the fistula is in a fleshy place, and you think that it is not penetrating.
Then treat the place until it is healed.
If, however, the place is sealed up, and the matter is cut off from it, and it remains like that for a long time, then know that it is now completely healed.
And if matter is not cut off from it, then know that it is penetrating, or a corrupted bone is within it, or something like that from those things, whose mention will come in its place.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the Kidneys.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
When pain in the kidneys occurs from cold or from a thick wind, and it lessens on account of that of the infirm person, then it is necessary to cauterize it above the almethen, above the kidneys themselves, with a cautery on each kidney, with the clauile cautery, whose mention preceded.
And perhaps we cauterize it a second time on the almeidatu itself.
Therefore three lines will come.
Therefore, the last will be more helpful.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Chapter XL. When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to cold and moisture, to the point that the afflicted person cannot retain urine, then cauterize it on the lower part of the upper region above the bladder, where the hairs of the pubic area begin, and cauterize with one cautery from the right side of the area and another from the left side: and let the length of the cauterization on each side be according to the size of a thumb's knot; and cauterize it with a lower back cautery, or with two cauteries if that is insufficient: and let it be, as before, with a fitting cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the uterus. Chapter XLI.
When cold and moisture occur in the uterus, and it is prevented by it from conception, and her menses are corrupted, and their discharge is delayed, and pain occurs in her at their arrival, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with three cauteries in a circle around the navel, as we said in the cauterization of the bladder, and with a cautery above, below the back, or with two cauteries: and let the cautery be fitting.
Concerning the method of cauterizing the anus in dislocation.
Chapter XLII.
When mucous humors are discharged into the anus, and they become the cause of its exit from its place; and the sign of this is that the leg is extended over the other, when they are compared together; and the place of the dislocation is found empty in it.
Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the afflicted area over the anus itself with a similar circular cautery: after you mark it with ink in a circle around the anus, as it revolves; and that the anus itself should fall in the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of a form that preceded in the cauterization of the stomach.
If this cautery is not present for you, then cauterize it with three cauteries, with a large olive cautery; and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the whole skin.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Sciatica. Chapter XLIII.
When pain occurs in the hip joint, and its cause is cold and moisture; and the patient is treated with what we have stated in the division, and the treatment does not benefit, and it is prolonged: then it is necessary to free the patient from gross humors with foul pills, or with artificial pills, and similar things.
Then cauterize it.
And the method of cautery in it is according to two methods: either cautery with burning medicines, or cautery with fire.
Cautery with fire is according to many methods.
One of which is that you cauterize above the hip joint itself with three triangular cauteries, according to this form.
And make them a good depth, or a bad one.
And let the space that is between every cautery be the quantity of the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Sometimes, however, a cautery is made in the middle above the head of the hip joint itself.
Therefore there are four cauteries.
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded in the cauterization of the dislocation of the hip joint, one: so that the circle contains the entire hip joint.
And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
This is the method of cauterization in sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the hip joint itself, and does not extend down to the thigh and leg.
However, if it extends down to the thigh and leg, then cauterize it with two cauteries upon the thigh, over the place to which the infirm person there points, where the pain is, and with your cautery over the shin four fingers towards the wild side for a short time: and let the cautery be a knife-like one. And let the depth of the cautery be according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
If, however, the infirm person indicates that the pain extends almost to the toes of the foot, then cauterize it there where he points with a pricking cautery, three, or four, or more, if needed.
And if he indicates the pain to be below the knee towards the leg, then cauterize it there with a single knife-like cautery.
And beware in all your cauterizations, that you do not proceed with the cautery so far as to burn a nerve or a large artery, and thereby bring upon the infirm person bad harm or contraction.
And indeed I have already seen one or another of those who have cauterized above the ankle, and proceeded too far in the cauterization, and the leg has become swollen, until a tumor reached the foot, and the entire foot was perforated and decayed: then dissolution of the belly happened, and death after that.
If the pain is in two parts simultaneously, cauterize each according to this method.
And some wise men said in cauterization of the buttock, of which this is the method of cautery.
Make a similar cautery of iron, whose diameter be the half of a palm: and let it be at its opening according to the thickness of a date-stone, or a little less: and within that cautery be a third cautery.
And let the space that is between every cautery be the quantity of a finger's joint: and let the cauteries be open on both sides: and let their height be like a joint, or two joints: and make for them a handle of iron fitting well into the cauteries.
And this is its form.
Then let it be heated in fire until it turns red, and throws off sparks: then let it be placed over the box of the buttock of the sick person lying on the healthy side.
Therefore cauterize him with three round cauteries at one time.
Then leave him for three days.
Afterwards apply plasters with butter: and leave the wound open for many days.
Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
Albucasis says, by this kind of cautery, O children, we have used little, because of the fear of its appearance; and because we find few who will wait on it.
However, it is among the good cauteries for the one who suffers, and finds its place with him.
However, the cautery is with burning medicines, so that you make two samian ones having a perforated armilla, into which descends the hinge of its gate of bronze, or iron, the length of a wall: whose height they should have two knots, or almost themselves.
And let the space that is between both be the thickness of a finger, and let them be open below and above: and let that which contains them be joined together, according to this form.
Then place it upon a box of ashes, the sick person lying on their healthy side.
And press your hand upon the box of ashes firmly.
Then pour between the two circles hot water, which has been warmed a little with fire, and hold it for a quantity of an hour's time: and let the sick person tolerate its burning and its cauterization, for he finds the burning like fire, until the burning ceases.
Then raise your hand with the instrument, and wipe away the hot water from the entire ash with fresh water; then leave it for three days.
And place butter upon it, until the blackness of the cauterization is removed; and leave it for a few days, and pus will run from it.
For it is the last in help.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a poultice on it containing water, in the same manner as you did for the ash.
And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines.
Take alkali and quicklime, of each one part: pulverize both, and place them in a new pot, whose lower part has a small hole, according to the amount that the radius will enter: and place another glass pot beneath the bottom of the pot: and pour over the alkali and lime some fresh water, so that both are submerged by a finger's breadth: after which, you should compress them with your hand with good pressure: and leave the pot until the sharp water descends to the lower part of the glass pot.
Then collect all that water, and pour it over other lime; and strain it until it is renewed.
For it will then be very strong and sharp, which is administered in many surgical operations, and in the cauterization of other limbs.
Because it produces the effect of fire itself.
And among the medicines with which the anchas are cauterized, also like tesisie, and honey of anacard, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together.
And Galen, indeed, relating, reported the cure of a certain man from the ancients, with which the pain of the ancha and sciatica vein was cured; and he magnified its to be very great.
And he said, that he did not need any further treatment, and that he was healed in a single instance, until he reported, that he perhaps had entered a bath carried, and emerged from it already healthy. And it is to be taken from fresh seitaragi: and if fresh is not found, let dry, fresh, be taken; and let it be rubbed much with some fat, and placed upon the ancha, where the pain is, or the leg, or in the thigh: and let it be bound, and let it be left for the quantity of three hours, or for the quantity that the sick person feels a lessening of the burning.
Then immerse him in a bath.
When therefore his body becomes moist, immerse him in a couch.
For the pain recedes, and he is healed.
And know that it is not appropriate for anyone to use a cautery with these medicines unless after evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides, who said that the dung of goats, when cauterized with it the sciatic vein, benefits it: and the cautery is made according to this manner.
Take wool, and soak it in old oil, and place it over the deep place, which is between the big toe and the other toe, and is closer to the other toe.
Then take dry goat dung, and inflame it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Then place it upon the wool, and let it be until it is extinguished.
Then repeat it.
Therefore cease not to do it, until the sensation above the middle reaches the sole, and the pain subsides.
And this method of cautery is called the Vaccinum cautery.
Concerning the cauterization of back pain.
Chapter XLIV.
Sometimes pain occurs in the back from many causes, either from an accident, or a blow, or an evacuation of superfluities, and similar things, from the infusion of cold and moist material: and indeed cautery does not apply, except in this sole case, which is caused by the infusion of cold material.
Therefore, after the patient's evacuation with foul pills, and similar things, let three lines be made on the back, where the pain is, according to the width of the almedate itself.  After marking each line with five cauteries, or more, according to the amount tolerated by the patient's strength, let the cauterization be done with the cauterium puncti.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries with the medial claw cautery, according to this form.
Concerning the method of cauterization in the incipient stages of gibbosity.
Chapter XLV.
This illness often occurs in young infants.
And the sign of its inception in children is: that there is constriction in their breathing upon elevation and movement; and you find in the last vertebra of the dorsal spine and its joints, that it has already begun to project above the other vertebrae.
Therefore, when you see it, and wish to treat it, then cauterize it with a cautery that is circular, according to this form.
And let the cautery take hold equally on the entire area of the vertebra; and if you wish to cauterize the circumference of the vertebra with a pointed cautery, make two or three lines, and let the points be close together.
Then treat the place until it is healed with what we have said.
And be careful not to apply the cautery to the hump which forms in a nerve spasm.
On the method of cauterization for gout and joint pains. Chapter XLVI.
When the pains of the joints are from cold humors, which are shed to any members of the body, then, when such pains occur in the feet, it is customary for physicians to properly call it gout.
Therefore, when gout of a cold cause is treated with methods of cure, and the pains are not removed, then the cautery will remove them.
And it is, that you cauterize it after evacuation in the circumference of the foot joints, with many cauteries, and let the cautery be olive-shaped.
This is its form.
And if you need to puncture on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery.
If the pains ascend to the knees, or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize it above each knee with three or four cauteries on all sides, using this same clavil cautery. If however more of this cautery is necessary for you, then cauterize it. And do not immerse your hand with the cautery, but rather let it be about the thickness of the skin only.
If however the pains ascend to the knees and back, then administer what we have said about the cautery in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, then puncture in a circle around the foci, as two lines revolve.
If however pain remains in the fingers, then puncture them, above each knot a puncture, and above the palm of the hand.
If however the pains ascend after days to the elbows, or to the shoulders, then cauterize both from every side.
And do not remove the sick person from a good regimen, from the taking of medicines.
For if a good regimen is made, and phlegm is evacuated, it will be healed with the help of God with this cautery.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Ruptures.
Chapter XLVII.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine or the spermatic cord descends to the testicle, and it is beginning to approach closely: then it is necessary that you instruct the sick person to discontinue eating on that day.
And let him use from among the lenitives, so that the stool may descend from his belly.
Then let him sit between your hands upon his back; and instruct him to hold his breath, until it emerges, or the spermatic cord, or the intestine appears.
Then reduce it with your fingers, and mark with ink under the rupture upon the pubic bone, with a sign whose extremity is similar to half a circle towards the upper part of the body.
Then cauterize with a cautery, whose form is this, until it becomes white and throws off sparks.
Then reduce the intestine, or spermatic cord, to its cavity.
Then let the assistant place his hand over the place, so that the intestine does not come out; and you have now opened between the legs of the sick person, and placed a pillow under him, and another servant on his legs, and another on his chest who holds his hands.
Then place the cautery upon that mark, with your hand holding the cautery upright.
And hold it until you reach the mouth with it; or again with it a second time, if you have not reached the mouth with it in the first attempt.
And carefully watch for the exit of the intestine during your cauterization, lest you burn it, and thereby cause either death or great harm to the sick person.
And know that when you do not reach the mouth with the cautery, your operation is ineffective.
And the cautery for infants should be small, according to their size.
Then treat with the remaining ointments until it is healed.
And let the sick person lie on their back for forty days, until the wound is sealed.
And it is necessary that you provide him with nourishment for the duration of his treatment, which will soothe his stomach, so that the intestines do not expel[matter] in straining and defecation.
Then, when he wishes to rise after forty days, then administer a properly made bandage, and let him keep it on for another forty days.
For when he follows this regimen, he is thus healed completely.
However, when ruptures occur in the rest of the belly, and are just beginning, and force so that they do not increase, then cauterize the rupture with a round cauterium according to its size; and let that which is cauterized be then like a third of it.
Then treat him, with what we have said; and it will not increase.
And some of the earlier ones have said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cauterium, according to this shape.
After it is marked with ink, and a line is placed which is across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line at the lower one. And place your hand in the middle with the cauterium closed.
But the first cauterium is easier and better. Concerning the method of cauterization in pains due to a fall or blow.
Chapter XLVIII.
When, in certain limbs, pain arises from a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicines is of no avail, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cauterium.
And let the cauterization of each limb be according to its size, its smallness, its weakness, its strength, its location of twisting, and the pain arising from it.
If therefore it is healed from the first cauterization, it is well.
If not, then repeat the cauterization upon it.
Because it is customary for these pains to shift from a limb to that which is near to it.
Therefore, it is necessary to follow them with cauterization, until the afflicted one is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in Leprosy.
Chapter XLIX.
Lepers are sometimes helped greatly by cauterization.
And especially the species of leprosy that arises from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: therefore, when you wish to cauterize it, consider it.
If therefore the leprosy is unyielding, and you have treated it with what we have said in the division, and it does not descend, nor stand still, and you fear that corruption will spread over the whole of his complexion, then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, noted, and a second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, and two above the two horns, and one behind above the nape of the neck.
And keep your hand with the cautery for a short time, until it imprints a small impression in the orifice, and the layers are separated from it, so that the expiration of the thick vapors from it may be alleviated, and cauterize with the cautery also on the spleen itself, according to what has preceded.
But if the leprosy has already spread over the afflicted person, and appears clearly, then it is necessary to cauterize with these cauteries, which we have mentioned for the head, and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two jaws, and with two cauteries on the vertebrae of the neck, and six on the vertebrae of the back, and with one large one on the haunchbones near the base of the tail and one on it itself, in the middle of it; and with two on the hips: namely, one on each hip, and with two on the knees: one on each knee, and with two on the shoulders, and with two on the elbows, and with two on the soft parts of his chest, and cauterize him on every joint, from the joints of his fingers of his hands and feet, and cauterize on every heel of his feet, and the soft parts of his hands.
And beware of the nerves that are above the last heel, so that you do not burn them. And sometimes a cautery is applied to the sternum, and another to the stomach, and another to the liver.
And know that the more you add the cautery, the more beneficial and helpful it is.
And know that the sick person does not experience pain from the cautery as healthy people do, because his body is already numb.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be of a size and smallness according to the members and joints, according to what has preceded concerning the types of instruments.
Chapter L.
When any limb is numb, and is treated with medicines, and oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize that numb limb with cauteries, according to the deserved size, or smallness, of the limb.
And let your cautery be a little way into the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment, until it is healed.
And sometimes a cautery is applied to something numb, which happens to the hand, and the foot, in the spinal column of the back at the exit points of the nerves that move that limb: and the numbness is removed.
But let no one presume upon it, unless he is knowledgeable in the anatomy of limbs, and the exit of the nerves that move the body.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Albaras.
Chapter LI.
When Albaras becomes old and no remedy from the arts of medicine helps it, then cauterize over it with a deep cautery for a short time, according to the thickness of the skin, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed.
Then treat it with flour of herbs and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and dove's blood, and swallow's blood: one part of each; mix these all, and line a cloth with it, and apply it to the place, until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Cancer.
Chapter LII.
When Cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it revolves.
However, the wise have said that it should be cauterized with the final cautery in the middle.
However, it does not seem right to me, since I fear that it will ulcerate, and I have seen it happen several times already. And it is better that it be cauterized around it with a circle, as we said, or with many cauteries. Concerning the method of cauterization in Adubelati.
Chapter LIII.
When someone has an Adubelati, and it is delayed in maturation, either because of excess causing it, or because of the patient's age, when he is decrepit with little blood, or because of the time and the need to hasten the maturation of the Adubelati, then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by puncturing.
Then leave it.
For it will hasten with maturation.
If however you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, whose shape is this.
And place it in the middle of the Adubelati, until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be from that which follows the sick person, so that the course of the purulent matter is alleviated.
Then treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the method of cauterization in a corrosive evil. Chapter LIII.
Corrosion is not unless a corruption is walking in the limb, and it corrodes it; just as fire consumes dry wood.
If therefore you see a corrosive in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then apply many cauteries with fire, small and large clamps, according to what is suitable for the place where the corrosion is.
Then cauterize it from every side until you eradicate the entire corruption, and nothing of it remains at all. Then leave it for three days, and place ground sulphur with oil on the cauterized places, until all the eschars and all corruption are eradicated.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
If therefore you see that after three days healthy flesh is born, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not, then repeat the cautery on that which remained of the corrupted places.
And it is sometimes cured by corrosive medicine.
For indeed it rises in the place of the cautery.
However, cautery with fire is of quicker help; and I have already said that its cauterization with sharp medicine is in division; therefore take it there when you need it.
Concerning the method of cauterization in corns, and warts. Chapter LV.
This ailment often occurs in the lower parts of the feet, and is a thick, filtered thing that hurts the foot. And cautery in them is indeed in two ways: cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
As for that with fire, let the cautery be a concave cautery like a vulture's wing, made of iron, of a size that encompasses the corn on all sides, and with thin edges.
Then place it, heated, upon the corn. Then revolve the hand with the cautery around the corn until the cautery reaches the depth of the corn, and leave it for three days until it begins to emit pus. Then plaster it with wild mallows, crushed with salt, and leave the plaster upon it at night. For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Then treat the place with a generative flesh ointment until it is healed.
If they are not cured, and frequently occur on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet, then apply a cautery to them with hot water.  And it is so that you take a cannula of bronze, or iron, or of a vulture's feather, and place it on the corn, or callus.
Then pour a small quantity of hot water into the cannula; hold your hand, and revolve it with the pressure of your hand for a little while, so that the edge of the cannula presses into the root of the corn and the hot water finds its way to the depth, to the root of the corn; and let the sick person wait for a while on the soaking of the hot water for one hour.
Then leave him, for the corn is eradicated with its roots.
Do this with them one by one, until you come upon all who are of them in the body.
Then treat them after they are eradicated, with that which generates flesh from ointments.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in Tremor.
Chapter LVI.
When tremor occurs in someone from cold in the nerve, or from quartan fever, or otherwise: then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauteries, or five, above the vertebrae of the back, and between each vertebra with a cautery, and on its chest with a cautery, and on its stomach with a cautery.
For tremor ceases with the olive cautery, and the cure of the cold disease hastens. Concerning the method of cauterizing Albathir.
Chapter LVII.
Sometimes foul things, that is, pustules, are expelled in the body of Albathir, which are made from corrupted gross matter.
Therefore, when they appear, it is necessary to cauterize every pustule on the head with a fine cautery made of myrtle wood, whose tip is heated with fire.
Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Or with a lenticular cautery. And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning of their expulsion in this way: and they are not increased: and the excess that makes them is broken, and they are healed from them.
However, it is necessary that this be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
Concerning the method of cauterizing in the flow of blood from an artery in a wound.
Chapter LVIII. Often a flow of blood occurs from an artery that is cut near a wound, which occurs externally, or near the incision of an abscess, or cauterization of a limb, and similar things to these: and it is difficult to stop it.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then quickly apply your index finger to the opening of the artery, and press it firmly until the blood is blocked beneath your finger and no more comes out. Then place small olive-shaped cauteries, and several larger ones, in the fire; and blow over them until they become very hot.
Then take one of them, either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the artery has been ruptured, and place the cautery upon the vein, after you have quickly removed your finger; and hold the cautery until the blood is stopped.
If, when you remove your finger from the artery's opening, and extinguish the cautery, blood then flows out, then quickly take another cautery from the ones prepared in the fire. Therefore do not cease doing this, one after another, until the blood is stopped.
And beware, lest you burn the nerve which is there, and cause another misfortune to the sick person. And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to stop it, especially when the artery is large, unless by one of the four methods.
Or with cautery, as we have said.
Or with extraction, when it is not extracted. For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off.
For when it is extracted, its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off. Or it is bound with a strong ligature.
Or let medicines of a nature to cut off the blood be placed upon it, and it be bound with a fitting constriction of a pillow.
However, whoever performs its excision with a ligature, and constriction with cloth, or by placing burning things, and similar things, does not help it at all, unless rarely.
If, however, this happens to someone, and a physician or medicine is not present, then let him begin with the positioning of the index finger over the opening of the vein itself, as we have narrated, and with a strong constriction of it, until the blood is obstructed from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
And the finger should not be removed, but rather always kept over it with very cold water, until the blood is congealed and thickened, and severed. And meanwhile, let him consider what it needs from cautery or from medicine.
End of the First Part.
Albucasis' Surgical Book, Part II. Concerning incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds, and similar matters.
We have already said in the first chapter, every ailment in which it is appropriate to use cautery with fire and burning medicine, and its occasions, its very causes, and its instruments, and the forms of cauteries. And I have placed there chapters from the head to the foot.
And I will proceed in this chapter along the same path: so that the seeker may be relieved of his inquiry. And before I begin that, it is necessary that you, children, learn that in this chapter there is the terror of that which is in the first chapter concerning cauterization.
And therefore it is necessary that there be greater caution in it, because in the operation which is in this chapter, very often evacuation occurs with blood, with which life stands at the opening of a vein, or the incision upon an abscess, or the opening of an outlet, or the treatment of a wound, or the extraction of an arrow, or the incision upon a stone, and similar things: from all of which trembling and fear are associated, and death results in many of them.
And I warn you, lest that in which there is hesitation fall upon you, for sometimes there fall upon you in this art the ways of men together with the ways of illnesses.
For among them is he who is angered by his illness, and death is light to him; because of the intensity of what he finds from his illness and the length of his malice.
And with illness is the fear that signifies death.
And among them is he who gives his money, and enriches you with it, hoping for health, and his illness is harmful. Therefore, you should not agree with him who comes to you from among them, whose manner is such.
And let your caution be greater than your greed and your rapacity.
And do not presume upon anything from it, unless after certain knowledge, which verifies for you that to which a praiseworthy success has arrived.
And use in the treatment of all your sick persons, prognosis and indication of that to which health will be fitting.
For in that is aid for you in the acquisition of fame and glory, and of memory and praise.
May God inspire you, children, with his understanding, and may he not take away from you direction and inspiration; for it is in his hand.
And I indeed have arranged this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters, according to what went before in the chapter on Cauteries, from the neck up to the feet, so that your desire and need from it may be alleviated.
Concerning the treatment of Water which gathers in the heads of children.
Chapter 1.
Know that this illness often happens to children at birth, or when the midwife tightens the child's head without ease.
And sometimes it happens also from a hidden cause which is not known.
And I myself have not seen this illness in anything other than children, and death has hastened to every one of them whom I have seen afflicted by it; therefore, on account of this observation, it seemed good to me to omit an operation on it.
And indeed I saw one child among them whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day, until it could not sit upon itself because of the size of its head, and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture, indeed, either collects between the skin and the bone, or collects under the bone above the surface.
And if there is moisture between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary to make a single incision in the middle of the head, the width of the incision, and the length of the incision should be about two knots, until the moisture flows out.
And this is the shape of a lancet.
If, therefore, the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then make two incisions, according to this form.
And if the moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side, and water is forced out when you press it with your hand inwards, and it is not hidden from you: then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head, according to this method.
And after the incision, remove all the moisture.
Then apply a liniment of wine and oil to it until the fifth day.
Then loosen the bandage, and treat the wound with tents and ointments.
And do not allow the head to be bound equally tight.
And feed the sick person with all dry food with little moisture, until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is to consider where the size of the abscess and the collection of water appear.
Because sometimes it is more in the back of the head, or in the forehead, or in the right, or in the left.
Therefore, make the incision where the abscess and collection of water appear to you; and cut it according to what is possible for you.
And observe, lest you cut an artery, and a flow of blood occur, and the sick person dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
Of the incision of arteries which are behind the ears.
Chapter II.
When discharges occur to someone in the eyes or chest, and it is prolonged, and treatment with medicines does not help, then the last treatment for that is the incision of these two arteries.
Therefore, when you wish to incise them, it is necessary that the sick person shave their head.
Then rub the area with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Then the sick person should tighten their neck with any cloth they have.
Then consider where the vein beats.
And the places of both are the places which are depressed behind the ears: and it is rarely hidden, except in certain people.
Then mark with ink over each: and cut each with a scalpel on both sides, the incision reaching the bone; and let it be done across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the scalpel under the artery, and cut it upward with the incision.
And the length of the incision be about two fingers joined together.
For when a vein is cut, blood flows out with a pulsating discharge, which leaps inward with frequent jumps.
If, however, the artery is not apparent to the senses, then it is necessary to measure from the ear a space of three fingers' breadth.
Then mark with ink, and split it all the way to the mouth.
And that which must be emitted from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you emit from it more, or less. All of that according to the quantity which appears to you from the weakness of the sick person and the fullness of his artery.
Then consider the wound.
Then, if anything remains on the mouth from the sifac, then cut it so that a hot abscess does not occur; then bind the wound with strips of linen cloth.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Concerning the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Chapter III.
When a man experiences chronic headache, or acute catarrhs due to acrid humors, and heat in the temples, or chronic, severe pain, and similar conditions: and if treatment with the methods of medical cure does not help it: then we are experienced in these illnesses in the extraction of arteries from the temples, or cauterization of them, as we have described.
And the method of operation in extracting them is that the weak person shaves the hair that is in the temples, and directs himself towards the artery appearing in the temple.
For it is indeed shown to you by its pulse, and is rarely hidden except in a few people, or by the intensity of cold.
If it is hidden from you, then let the weak person tighten their head with any cloth of theirs; then rub the place with a rough cloth.
Or apply vapors to the area with warm water, until it appears to you with clear evidence. Then take the spatula, which I have previously formed. Then scrape the skin with it easily, until you reach the artery.
Then insert a hook into it, and pull it upwards, until you pull it out of the skin, and cause it to escape from the tissues beneath it on every side.
If however the artery is delicate: then wrap it with the tip of the hook.
Then cut off a portion of it according to the amount by which its ends will be extended and contracted, and so that no blood flow occurs.
For if it is not cut, and if it is not severed, the blood does not ascend completely. Then evacuate six ounces of blood, up to three.
If the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong double thread, of silk or of alhohod cords, so that decay does not rapidly occur at the wound before its healing, and that blood flow does not happen.
Then cut away the excess, which is between the two ligatures.
Do that at that hour, or after another hour. And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery, even to the bone, with a knife cautery, until its extremities are cut, and it will stand in place of the same work.
And it is a better work, unless the sick person has a fever or is of a hot complexion.
Because cautery is from among those things that help to finish the humors.
Therefore it is a better help.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries, that the place be filled with old cotton: and that cushions made properly be placed upon it.
And after the removal, it should be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until it is healed.
If meanwhile, while you are operating, a flow of blood from an artery occurs, then hurry to cut it off with a cautery, or to fill the place with zegi, and bind your hand tightly until the blood is cut off.
If none of those things are present for you, then place your finger on the area until the blood clots.
And apply the place with water of extreme cold, until the sharpness subsides, and is bound as is appropriate.
And because what is lighter and easier than extracting an artery is to cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades, and the sharpness of the two blades should be like an almond.
However, they are of much less sharpness than two blades.
Because if they are sharp, like two blades, the cold hastens with both: and they do not cut flesh with speed.
Therefore, since there is some thickness in them, the heat of the fire is held within them, and the flesh is cut quickly: with this, therefore, the work is better than any other work, and lighter, and easier.
And let the space between the two blades be the thickness of a finger, after you mark the two places with ink; and place both of them intensely hot until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places, so that that which is between its ends may be lengthened.
For they do not completely consolidate with this cautery.
And this is the form of cautery.
Concerning the treatment of acute and persistent tearing from the eyes.
Chapter IV.
When the tears are constant, and their flow is from the veins on the outer skull: and no medical treatment with medicines is effective for them, and you see the face of the sick person already reddened, and he feels a crawling sensation on his forehead, like the crawling of ants: and his eyes are weakened, moist, so that their hairs are already corroded with corrosion: and his eyelids are inflamed from the severity of the tears: then the ancients needed this operation in their treatment, and they named this treatment, with the Knife.
And it is necessary to instruct the sick person to shave the hairs on their forehead.
Then make three equally spaced incisions along the forehead's length: and the length of each incision should be about two fingers, and one incision should be equidistant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second along the length slightly from the movement of the temples, and the third on the opposite side: and be careful not to cut the arteries which are on either side: and keep your hand away from the continuation of the two lower jaws, and let the space of each incision be the quantity of three joined fingers: and have a piece of sponge prepared, or many dry cloths, with which to absorb the blood.
Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, whose form is as follows.
From the incision that is by the temple, up to the second incision: and scrape away all the skin which is between the two incisions, with a sifac, which is over the bone. Then do that also from the middle incision to the second incision.
Then withdraw this spatula, and insert into the first incision again another instrument, which is called a sharp scalpel, smooth on one side, not sharp on the other side.
And this is its form.
And place its sharp side towards the flesh attached with the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone: and drive it, until it reaches the middle fissure: and cut with it all the vessels which descend from the head to the eyes: except that the incision continues up to that which appears of the skin.
Then do that in the middle fissure up to the other fissure.
And after a quantity of blood runs equal, express the places from the fragments of coagulated blood. Then place in every fissure a linen cloth made from old cotton, and place on them cushions soaked in wine, and oil, or vinegar.
And see that a hot abscess does not occur.
And on the third day loosen the ligature, and administer much infusion with lukewarm water.
Then treat it with basil ointment, and with the other remedies for wounds: until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of acute tears and colds in the eyes from internal parts of the head.
Chapter V.
When acute, harsh, persistent colds afflict someone, and you see his eyes thinned, small, and their appearance already weakened; and the eyelids ulcerated, and hairs fall from them, and there is a sharp, piercing pain deep within the head, and a consequent sneezing; then, from these occurrences, understand that those matters and colds do not arise, unless from many veins.
And the better treatment for them is this.
And it is that you should instruct the sick person to shave his forehead.
Then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead, or slightly wider, and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision reach the bone; and move your hand away from the temporal muscles, which move during mastication, until the bone is exposed; and you will dry up all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with an old cloth or with linen strips.
Then bind it from above with pledgets; and soak the pledgets with wine and oil, so that a hot abscess does not occur.
And when you loosen it, and see that the hot abscess is now diminishing, then it is necessary to rub the bone until flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with a drying regimen that causes flesh to grow; such as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony: and prepare a plaster from them, and administer it for the growth of flesh in these wounds.
Concerning the treatment of that which falls into the ear. Chapter VI. Everything that falls into the ear is one of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or something similar to a stone, such as iron and glass; or it is from a plant, such as a chickpea and beans; or it is a liquid substance, such as water and vinegar, and things like them; or some animal.
Therefore, when a stone, or a kind of stone, falls into the ear, from among those which do not adhere to, nor grow in, the ear, expose the ear to the sun.  If you then see the stone, distil into the ear some of violet oil, or sesame oil.
Then administer its extraction, and make him sneeze with condiments, and close the nostrils at the arrival of the sneeze, after you have placed around the ear fragments of cloth or wool, and have extended the ear upwards.
For it often departs with this treatment.
If, however, it does not depart, then administer its extraction with forceps, that is, with thin tweezers; the shape of which is this.
If, therefore, it departs with the forceps, it is good.
And if not, then administer its extraction with a fine single-pronged hook. If, therefore, it does not depart through that, then make a tube of bronze, and insert the end of the tube into the ear's cavity deeply, and seal that which is around the tube with softened wax mixed with oil, so that there is no passage by wind except through the tube; then extract with your wind by strong suction. For many times it departs with that which we have narrated.
If, however, it does not depart in this way, then take from a helkalimbat, or from birdlime, that is, prepared glue, with which birds are caught, a small amount: and place it at the tip of a rod, after you have wrapped a properly positioned rag around it: then insert it into the ear's cavity easily, after you have dried the ear from moisture.
If, therefore, it does not depart with all that we have narrated, then hasten to incision before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
And the method of incision is, that the phlebotomist, first of all, pierce the cephalic vein, and draw from it blood according to the measure of its strength.
Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear at its fatty, depressed area; and let the incision be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone; then remove it with whatever instruments are possible for you.
Then stitch the incision with your skill quickly, and care for it until it heals.
If the thing falling into the ear is one of the grains that grow and swell, then administer its extraction.
If, however, it does not yield to you for extraction, then take a thin, subtle spatula, according to this shape.
And administer with it the removal of that kind of grain that falls into the ear, and do not do it when you think that the grain is already moistened by the ear's vapor, until you put many small pieces on it; then extract them with hooks, or with a fine probe, or with suction, as we said, for its extraction is thus eased.
However, in water that enters the ear, the patient must use sneezing with condiments at first; and already he has filled his ear with some old lint; and he lies on the ear in which the water is.
If therefore it comes out through that, it is good.
And if not, then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, thin, smooth, and heat them a little with fire, and let the patient insert one of them into the hole of his ear; and let him hop on one foot on that side, and strike with another stone the stone that is in the ear.
Therefore, he must not cease doing that with stone and stone, until all the water comes out.
And now the water comes out so that you take one from papyrus or reed, and insert one end of it into the ear; and set fire to the other end, until most of it is burned.
Then again another reed, and do it many times, until all the water comes out; and extract it with a cannula as was previously described with the stone.
In extracting an animal that has entered it, if it is of small body, such as a flea, and similar to it, treat it as I said in the division.
But if it is of large body, apparent to the senses, then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks; and its removal is easier than all those held in the ear.
In the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you treat it with what we said in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and your treatment does not help: then you must look at the ear in the sun.
If therefore anything of the worms appears there, then extract it with forceps or with fine hooks.
If however nothing appears there, then take a cannula, of which this is the shape, narrow at the bottom, wide at the top: and insert the thin end into the ear according to the amount that the sick person tolerates it; then suck with it with a strong suction.
Do this repeatedly until all the worms come out.
If however they do not obey you for exit, then smear the circumference of the cannula with wax, as I said in the section on stones.
If they do not come out with what we have said, then administer the distillations that the ancients have already experienced in the killing of worms: and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
And let your pouring, by which you pour oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, the shape of which is depicted here.
As you see, make it from silver, or bronze, narrowed below, with a small hole, and wide above.
Let the pusher, which is in the concavity of the cannula, be made of bronze well.
And if you wish, take a rod, and wrap a cloth around the end of it in a suitable wrapping; then pour oil, or juice, or whatever medicine you wish from these, into the cannula; and let it be in the ear; then insert the rod with the cloth from above, and squeeze it with your hand with moderate pressure, until the oil is driven into the concavity of the ear, and the afflicted person feels it inside; and that which is poured into the ear should already be warmed with fire for a short time; and be careful that the substance being distilled into it is not very cold, for the medicines do not tolerate that.
Concerning the treatment of sudden ear blockage.
Chapter VII.
Sometimes infants emerge from their mothers' wombs unperforated.
And sometimes blockage in the ear canal occurs in people due to a wound, or flesh grown in it.
And this blockage sometimes occurs deep within the ear opening, which is not followed by sight; and sometimes it happens close to the outer edge of the opening, and sight follows it.
Therefore, that which occurs deep within the ear, and which sight does not encompass, is in many cases difficult to heal.
And in that which is followed by sight, you should place the patient's ear in the sun, and look into it. Then, if you see the blockage appearing, open it with a thin probe, whose shape is as follows: its tip should have a small width, one part of which is sharp, and the rest of the probe should be of two smooth sides, so as not to injure the ear.
If, therefore, the blockage is from flesh grown in the ear canal, then grasp it with a fine hook, and cut it with a forceful ease, until all the flesh is removed.
If the blockage is deep within the ear, then take a thin, smooth rod and warm it slightly with fire; then insert it into the ear canal.
If therefore you perceive the blockage, with the patient experiencing a difficulty in hearing, attempt its opening with care, and beware of injuring the ear's nerves.
Then place a linen pad, according to the size of the opening you have created, which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are certain of the wound's healing.
Or take a linen pad and soak it in rosewater, and sprinkle crushed zegi upon it, and use it.
If you see that the ear is already abscessed, then it is necessary to remove the linen pad, and to apply another linen pad soaked in cerote made with rose oil, until the hot abscess subsides; then treat it until it is healed.
If, however, a hemorrhage occurs, then immerse a sponge or cloths in cold water, and apply it to the ear; and use the remaining treatment, which cuts off the bleeding previously described in the treatise on distillations.
Concerning the treatment of the eyelids of Altheli.
Chapter VIII. These afflictions of the eyelids, which occur in the eye, are sometimes moist, and sometimes dry.
Therefore, it is necessary to grasp them with forceps, or with a hook, and to cut them with a scalpel from their roots.
Then place pounded zegi on the affected areas.
If blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lenticular cautery.
And to cauterize them is better after the incision.
For they often return when something remains from their roots.
And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and they do not return.
Concerning the treatment of granulations of the eyelids of the eye.
Chapter IX.
Often something occurs on the eyelids that is similar to granulation in its strength and hardness, and because of this it is called granulation: and it is a collection of thick moisture on the upper eyelid and the lower eyelid.
Therefore the operation on them is that you should consider then, if it is a granulation growing on that which appears of the eyelid, and it moves to every part, and its matter is easy.
Therefore make a slit over it in width.
Then scrape it from every side with ease, until it comes out.
Then suspend it with a hook and cut it off.
If, however, its excision is not prepared for you unless after you pierce the eyelid with a small incision, then that harms the sick person in some way.
If the slit is large, then collect it with sutures and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
For ointment restores it and makes it flesh again.
And if the growth is sloping towards the inner surface of the ear, then invert the eyelid, and suspend the growth with a hook; besides which, you will need an incision, and press it from every side.
If the eyelid is prolonged by incision, that will not harm it in any way.
Then wash the eye after the incision of the growth with salty water, and treat the place with that which makes it flesh, until the sick person is healed.
Concerning the treatment of eyelid growths.
Chapter X.
Axirnath is a fat that is produced in the membranes of the upper eyelid; it most often occurs in children.  It weighs down their eyes, and they suffer from morning catarrh, and cannot look at sunlight because tears run to them.  Because of this, you see them always lying on their faces, and they sleep on them; and their eyelids, which are now swollen, are damp beneath their eyebrows.  The prominence of Axirnath is visible to the eye, and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
And the method of its operation is that the sick person should place his head in your lap.
Then take a linen cloth and prepare some threads on it, and make a circle from that thread equal to the size of the Axirnath on all sides.
Then place it on top of it, and press with your fingers on all sides, so that the Axirnath is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Then, with a lancet, make incisions into the middle of that moisture, across its width, and do not make the incision larger than that which occurs in deep phlebotomy.
Or it is necessary that you pierce the entire skin, until you reach the Axirnath; for in many ways the Axirnath proceeds from the incision, according to the form of a piece of white fat.
Therefore extract it with the cloth, which you have inserted between your fingers on the outside; and you will turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed; and beware, lest you press into the incision, so that you do not reach the eye with the lancet, and injure it.
However, if the Axirnath does not appear at the beginning of the incision, you should gently add to the incision until the Axirnath comes forth.
Then extract it, as we said.
Then immerse cloths in vinegar and water, and place them upon the place, and bind it with bandages.
And there are men who grind salt and place it in the concavity of the incision, so that what remains of that moisture may liquefy.
Then treat it until it heals.
If however a hot abscess occurs in the place, then treat it with sedative plasters until it heals.
Concerning the methods for Ataxmir of the eye, that is, when the eyelid of the eye softens, whence it happens that it wrinkles in an improper manner.
Chapter XI.
When additional hairs grow in the eyelids, beyond the natural hair follicles, and grow old, they harm the eye and cause various ailments, such as persistent tears, softening of the eyelids, and white discoloration, until it becomes the cause of the eye's destruction.
And indeed, Ataxmir of the eye is treated according to four methods. Or by cauterization with fire.
Or with a sharp medicine, according to what was previously stated in the chapter on cauterization.
Or Ataxmir is cured by incision and suture.
Or by probes, as I will say.
You should place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
If therefore it turns, it is good.
And if not: insert a needle into it, in which there is a thread from the lower part of the eyelid, and cause the needle with the thread to penetrate from above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid where the hairs sprout; and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a probe.
Then find, in the inner part of the eyelid beneath the hairs, with a spatula sliding from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct.
Then pull out the thread, and place under the eyelid a small cushion of cotton, or cloth; then mark the eyelid with ink, which should be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, it is necessary that the shape be according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, since it is already diversified in humans.
For among them is he who needs that a large amount be cut from the eyelid, according to the amount which softens from the eyelid. Then, with a spatula, find above the two lines you marked, and begin from the larger tear duct to the smaller tear duct, and let the slit be near the natural hairs, as is the thickness of a ray.
Then insert the hook into one of the two corners of the skin. Then scrape off the entire thing. Then stitch together the two lips with a needle and fine wool thread; and wipe away the blood, and make the excess thread adhere above the two eyebrows, with certain invisible things, if you wish to do so; and if not, do not bother.
Then leave the stitches and threads for up to three or four days; afterward, treat it. And if you wish, leave the wound without stitches, and treat it with that which dries and constricts it.
For the eyelid is raised by the sealing and stitching of the wound: but it will be better.
The ancients taught this method of treatment.
However, there is concern for the sick person in it, and it is from good operation, and there is no fear in it.
And another method is in Ataxmir also: and it is that you mark on the eyelid a figure, which is like the figure of a myrtle leaf, as we have recounted.
Then raise the eyelid with three separate hooks, or joined together, according to this following form, then cut what is superfluous with small scissors, according to this form, with evenness of incision.
If however it is not possible for you to hold the hook, and it is not made equal: then take a needle in which there is thread, and insert it into the middle of the figure; and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and a second thread near the smaller tear duct; and join the threads together between your fingers with equality.
Then raise your hand with equal elevation; and raise the skin upon which the sign for the cut has been marked, as we have recounted.
Then join the two lips of the wound with sutures; and treat it until it is healed.
If however an abscess occurs at your incision, or your fissure: soothe that abscess with cauterization, and similar things, from soothing ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid also, that its hairs turn.
Concerning the treatment of Ataxmir with reeds.
And you are to turn the eyelid, and cut the fissure which is within, according to what I have described.
Then artfully make two reeds, or two thin pieces of wood; whose length be according to the length of the eyelid, and their width be less than the width of the spatula; and you have already incised at the extremities of each from both sides where you hold the threads.
Then carefully attach each one to that which is superfluous of the eyelid, and bind the two reeds from both sides with a strong ligature, and leave it for a few days. For the skin being constricted will die, and become black, and putrefy, until it falls off of itself.
If therefore it is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Then care for it until it is healed.
When therefore it is consolidated, the eyelid is raised: and the hairs do not prick.
And this is the form of two canes, which you shall make according to this figure, and quantity in length and breadth.
Concerning the raising of pricking hairs in the eye with a needle.
Chapter XII.
The operation in it is that you shall take a fine needle, and introduce into it a fine, soft silk thread. Then you shall tie its ends, and make a very small knot on each end: and let the length of the threads be one palm.
Then place another fine thread underneath it in a short section, and tie its ends if you wish.
Then let the patient place his head in your bosom, and let it be near the sun so that the operation may be clear, because it is a delicate or minute operation.
Then introduce the needle with the alinxotati into the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly, until you draw it out above the natural hair.
Then pull the hair up above the alinxotati, and introduce that hair into the alinxotati: if it is one, or two, or three, not more.
Then pull your hand with it, until the hair comes out with the alinxotati into the eyelid with the natural hair.
However, if the alinxotati is pulled and the hair does not come out with it, pull the alinxotati downwards, with the thread that you have placed in it, until the alinxotati comes out of the upper opening, and you see it with the vision of the eye.  Then you will pull the alinxotati and the thread and remove both, and close the eye.  And leave it closed for two days or three, until the hair adheres to its place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, then either associate a long hair from the natural hairs with it, and lift it with it, or leave it until it lengthens after a time, and then lift it.
Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati that occurs in the upper eyelid.
Chapter XIII.
When this Alxatrati happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
And this Alxatrati is either natural or accidental.
Accidental, therefore, it arises from the consolidation of a wound, or incision, or cautery, and things similar to those.
And the method of treatment in it is, that you find that consolidation, and that you separate its lips, and place in that which is between them a linen strip, and bind it until it is healed.
And it is not appropriate to use in its treatment things that dry and constrict: for if you do that, the Alxatrati returns worse than it was: rather, use in it things that soften, such as Greek hay: and embrocate with water in which althea, flax seed, has been cooked: and with dyaquilon ointment, which has been liquefied with some oil: and wrap with it a linen strip, and treat with it.
And the treasure of your treatment is to strive with all your ingenuity so that it does not consolidate according to the form it first had.
And this operation, which we have described, is nothing more than a certain rectification of the Alxatrati, so that the form of the place does not return according to what it was entirely. Concerning the treatment of Alxatrati that occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Chapter XIV.
This Alxatrati, which occurs below, is truly called Alxatrati.
And it is natural, and it is accidental.
And the accidental one occurs from a wound, or a fissure, or a cauterization, and similar things.
And the method of operation in it is, that you take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and you dip it into the flesh, and you make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct, until the thread reaches in two extremities of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a wide spatula.
If therefore the eyelid's shape returns as it should, it is good.
And if not, take a spatula, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it; and make two fissures in the inner side of the eyelid, and let the extremities of the two fissures be from the two angles of the incision, until they meet and a corner is made from them; until when they are brought together, their shape becomes this shape, and it is the Greek letter lambda.
Then remove that flesh by the amount that is its acute lower side, from that which follows the eyelid.
Then bring together the separated parts; sew it with wool thread.
Then treat them with what we have said, about softening medicines, and bandages, until they are healed.
And if a laceration occurs from the fissure, and suture, or cautery: then it is necessary that you make a flat fissure under the hairs of the eyelids, even according to what has preceded.
Then separate between the two lips with a bandage, according to what we have said.
And the sum of the discourse concerning the treatment of Alxatrati, when it is superior or inferior, is that the operation should proceed according to the preparation of the form of Alxatrati.
For indeed there are many varieties in form; and a prudent craftsman prepares the method in whatever way possible for it, until it restores the figure to the natural form, or nearly so, and the infirm person himself, according to what is appropriate for him from the operation and the instruments in many arrangements.
Concerning the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Chapter XV.
Sometimes this consolidation occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid becomes consolidated with the white of the eye and prevents it from its natural functions.
Therefore, you should introduce the tip of a probe under the eyelid and lift it up, or extend it with a hook; then cut the adhesion with a thin spatula, which should not be sharp, but slightly blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed during the procedure, and the spatula is removed without harming the eye with its sharpness; and your incision should be such that you gently scrape away the adhesion until the eyelid returns to its natural form and the entire adhesion is healed.
Then pour salt water into the eye, washing it with the water; or distil into it a solution made from dissolved ziniar in water.
Then separate the eyelid from the eye with flax thread; and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white; and after three days use a poultice, and with consolidants, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the toenail and the prominence of the tear flesh.
Chapter XVI.
Know that the toenail is according to two ways. Or it is nervous: and it is similar to hard, fine sinew.
Or it is not nervous, similar to congealed white moisture: which when touched with iron, or you try to grasp it with a hook, is cut off, and the hook does not stick to it.
And both types do not begin, unless from the larger tear duct, until it gradually progresses, until it covers the sight, and obstructs the light, and the movement of the eye.
And the method of operation in its incision is: that the sick person should place his head in your lap.
Then open his eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand.
Then gather the nail with a hook of little doubling, and extend it upwards.
Then take a needle, and insert into it a hair from the hair of a horse, or an ox, or a cow; and let the thread be strong, and double the end of the needle a little, and fix it in the middle of the nail; and pierce it with the needle, and tie the nail with the thread, and extend it upwards; and scrape with the hair the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were sawing it with the hair until its end.
Then cut the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula, or with small scissors: and leave the natural tear duct tissue, so that a constant flow of tears does not occur from its incision.
And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone, or with a thread, as we have said.
Then it is scraped with a gentle spatula, whose form is this.
And beware, lest the spatula touch the horny tunic, and a rupture occur in it, and the pupil be pierced.
Then, after the incision, put some crushed salt into the eye, or a preparation made from ziniar, and leave it until another day.
Then treat it with what is necessary, until it is healed. If the nail is not nervous, and you cannot insert a needle into it, nor is a hook fastened to it, then this type of nail is often treated with medicaments, and is healed as I have described in the division.
If you wish to cut it, then open the sick person's eye, and take a spatula, slender, gentle, of weak sharpness, according to this form.
And scrape the nail from above with precision.
If you see that it thins and breaks, and the scraping imprints on it, then distil from your hour into the eye a sieve made of ziniar, or of red sieve, or of crushed salt; and close the eye until another day.
Then repeat the operation upon it until the whole of it is removed.
Unless there is a hot abscess in the eye; for then leave it, and treat the abscess until it is healed. Then repeat the operation upon it with the scraper, until it is healed.
However, if the prominence of the lacrimal flesh harms the eye with great injury, it should be suspended with a hook and a part of it incised; and do not make the incision too deep, lest the flow of tears be harmed.
Then instill into the lacrimal sac either red or made from ziniari, until it is healed. Concerning the incision of Alguardenic, and flesh grown in the eye.
Chapter XVII.
Sometimes in some people's eyes, red flesh grows, either composed or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches it, or presses on the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward; and it is similar to a rose-hip.
And the treatment in it is also that the patient should lay his head in your bosom.
Then open his eyes, and gather that flesh entirely with suitable hooks for it: and hold it with a single forceps, or pliers.
Then cut the flesh in the first place, until the whole of it is finished with the scalpel.
And be cautious of the eye, so that you do not injure it during the operation: and let your incision, with which you cut it, be either with a lancet, which we described in the incision of a hoof, or with small scissors, with which the asebel is collected, as its form will appear after this chapter.
When therefore your incision is completed, and the whole of the alguardenici is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt: or distill into it a red powder, and similar corrosives from medicines: and place over the eye externally a cloth with the white of an egg, so that it is protected from a hot abscess.
If anything of the alguardenici remains, and hot blood masters you, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye, and treat it with that which quiets the abscess.
Then repeat the operation on it until it is healed.
And similarly do with any added flesh which occurs in the eye from this type.
However, it is necessary that you avoid the treatment of every weak eye by a natural or accidental path, by operating with iron: and do not put your hand into any of these operations until you see that the limb is tolerant of that operation.
Concerning the collection of sebum from the eye.
Chapter XVIII. Sebum are red veins which are woven over the eye, and hinder the operation of the sight; and weaken the eye with the length of days.
Therefore, it is necessary for you first to consider if the eye in which there is sebum is strong, and there is no other illness in it besides the sebum; then collect its sebum.
And it is that you should instruct the sick person to place his head in your lap.
Then suspend those veins with a single hook, or two, according to your judgment; and let the hook be a slender double hook, according to this form, or let there be two hooks graded on a single body, according to this form.
Then collect those veins with fine forceps carefully, and wipe away the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye and dissolved; and beware lest you injure the eye with the tips of the forceps.
And let your operation be in the midday sun, and be very firm in your operation, so that you do not cut anything except those veins.
And when you have finished, then distill into the eye a green or red sief, so that its sharpness may corrode what remains of the sebel.
However, if it is not possible for you to collect it all at that time, then apply a poultice to the eye with that which soothes the pain of the eye, and leave it for a few days until its pain subsides, and is secured from a hot abscess; then repeat it again according to the same method, until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps.
Concerning the reduction of a displaced nose.
Chapter XIX.
Physicians call the fistula Arissati, which you treat with a cautery, or with a burning, sharp medicine, according to its preceding description.
And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it: unless you pierce above the abscess at its origin, and extract all the moisture and pus from it, until the bone is exposed.
When therefore the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness in it, then scrape it with an instrument, whose form is this.
And it is called Asperi's head.
Let it be made of tempered iron, and let its head be round like a zir, that it be punctured with a file's puncture, or with a fine aliskilfer's puncture: and place it upon the corrupted place of the bone. Then revolve it between your fingers, and you press your hand a little, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away: and do it several times.
Then revolve it between your fingers, and you press your hand a little, until you know that the corruption has been scraped away: and do it several times. Then restore the place with drying, astringent medicines.
Therefore, if the place consolidates, and flesh grows in it, and the flow of pus ceases; and it remains for forty days, and is not renewed, and does not suppurate, and no accident occurs in it, then know that it is now healed.
And if not, then there is no remedy for it, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril's opening, according to this form.
And it is, that you expose the bone from the second with iron, or with a sharp medicine; and when the bone is exposed, then take a drill according to this form, let the iron end be triangular; and its wood be a tapered pyramid up to the end, as you see.
Then place it on the bone itself; and let it be near the tear duct; and move your hand away from the eye a little.
Then revolve your hand with the drill, until it penetrates the bone, and the infirm feels it; by this, that he finds air coming out of it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Therefore, then restore the place with astringent drying medicines, as I taught you.
When, therefore, flesh is born, and the place hardens, then the matter which was poured out to the outside returns to the nose; it is therefore lighter for the infirm.
Concerning the reduction of the prominence of the Eye. Chapter XX.
When the eye protrudes in its entirety, and no harm or diminution occurs in the vision, then it is necessary that you loosen the patient; then bleed him; afterwards, apply cupping to the neck without scarification, but with suction.
Then apply a liniment to the eye made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla.
Then compress the eye from above, over the plaster, with many bandages.
And the method of the bandages is: that you take soft cloths, many, and each cloth should be doubled over four times; make many of them; then place them one upon another, according to the amount needed for the eye; then compress them with a hard cloth with a strong constriction.
And again apply cupping with suction, without scarification.
Then remove the cupping, and leave the eye bound day and night.
However, if the bandage softens again, then it is necessary that it be tightened very much; then remove the bandage after one day and night, as we have said.
If therefore you see the eye has now returned to the state of its membrane, it is good; and if not, then again apply the plaster, and bandages, and constriction, and cupping, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the eye's membrane.
Chapter XXI.
When a rupture occurs in the eye's membrane, and then it protrudes and proceeds outside the eyelids like a grape-like swelling, and disfigures the man's appearance because of it, and one wishes to cut it: then the procedure for it is as I describe: and it is that you insert a needle into the root of the eye from the lower to the upper part.
Then insert another needle, on which is a doubled thread, from the tear duct side, and let it penetrate; and leave the first needle in its position.
Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie with it the part of the eye around the needle; and tighten it very much.
Then withdraw the needle, and place over the eye wool soaked in the white of an egg; and leave it until the thread falls with the eye.
Then treat the eye with that which strengthens it, until the wound heals.
And sometimes the eye is tightened from every side with a bandage of cloth, until the eye increases greatly in prominence.
Then it is pierced with a thin spatula, which reaches the depth of the eye, and the white fluid runs out, and the eye descends, and immediately enters; then tighten it until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of Alcomnat.
Chapter XXII.
This illness, called Alcomnat, is nothing but pus that gathers in the eye, similar to descending water, and is not the eye itself.
And the method of treatment in it is that you make the infirm sit on a prepared seat, or upright.
Then take his head in your hands from two sides, and move it until you see the pus descend to the lower part of your eyes.
Then let it be fixed, and do not let it descend, and the light be released: and let the infirm person see things as he saw them before: and if it does not descend further, know that it is water.
If, however, the descent of the pus is not prepared with what we have said, then make the infirm person sit between your hands. Then take a fine spatula, and split with it slightly above the corneal membrane near the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea, until the pus emerges.
When it emerges, then instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey; or water in which you have boiled fenugreek and honey; then treat with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
Concerning the treatment of water that descends in the eye, or cataract.
Chapter XXIII.
We have already discussed the types of water in division, and what is appropriate for piercing, the speech declaring and explaining, then take that same thing according to health.
Then you should have the infirm person sit between your hands, square, opposite the light, near the sun; and bind his healthy eye tightly; then, with your right hand, if the eye in which the water is, is the left eye, or with your left hand, if it is the right eye, press his eyelid.
Then take with your right hand an almagda, if the eye is left, or with your left hand, if the eye is right.
Then place the tip of the almagda near the crown, by the thickness of a ray, in the apparent white of the eye, near the smaller tear duct; then push the almagda with force, and turn your hand with it, until it penetrates the white of the eye; and you will feel that the almagda has now reached the empty space.
And the measure of the almagda's journey to the depth should be the measure of the space from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and it is the crown of the eye.
For you will see them in the very pupil of the eye's vision, because of the clarity of the cornea.
Then place the almagda to the place where there is water.
Then press it downwards, one time after another.
If, therefore, the water descends immediately, then the sick person sees that upon which he opens his sight immediately, and the almagda in his eye.
Then rest a little.
If therefore the water descends, then remove it a second time, except that the almagda comes out.
When therefore it is fixed, and does not ascend, then extract the almagda with ease, and you turn your hand gradually. Then dissolve some of clear gem salt in water, and wash the inside of the eye with it.
Then put over the entire eye a bandage of lint or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, and bind the sound eye with it.
We, and those of our time, place on it pounded cumin with egg white.
If the almagda does not obey you in entering the eye because of its hardness, since it is from human beings, whose eye is very hard, then it is necessary to take a spatula, which is called Alberid, of which this is the form.
Therefore, with it, scrape only the conjunctiva, and do not put your hand into the opening; and it is only that you make a subtle path to the place of the almagda.
Then introduce the almagda, as we have said.
And at the completion of your work, prepare for the patient a properly made sleeping place, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark room; and forbid him all movement, and coughing; and place his food that which soothes his nature; and let him not move his head to the right, nor to the left at all.
And let the bandage remain according to its arrangement until the third day. Then loosen it in that dark room, and test his sight; and make him see things.
Then reduce the bandage until the seventh day.
And it is not necessary that he do this at the time of treatment, or immediately after the incision; rather, it is necessary that he abstain from it; because water rises quickly through intense looking.
If, however, a hot abscess occurs: then it is necessary that you loosen the eye before the seventh [day]; and rectify it with that which soothes the abscess, until it is soothed; then release its sight, and place over its face a covering to regulate its sight beneath it for some days, him being in that dark room.
Then he should gradually emerge from the house and mingle in his own dwellings.
And know that in the zaltea a disciple is not excused from a vision sometimes; then he may venture on the operation.
And now indeed one of those who are from Alayrach has come to us, who said that a perforated magdan was made in Alayrach, from which water is drawn.
But truly I have not seen anyone in your land who has done this; nor have I read it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that it is new.
And these are the forms of the species from the magdan, so that he who is ignorant of them may stand on them.
Let them be made properly of bronze; and let their extremities be triangular with this same subtlety, and let the extremity be pointed.
Forms of the magdan.
Concerning the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
Chapter XXIV.
Sometimes various growths of flesh arise in the nose, some resembling a scorpion with many feet; and of these is cancerous, stony flesh of a dark color; and of these is flesh that is soft, not of a dark color.
In that soft flesh therefore, which is not fraudulent nor cancerous, you should have the sick person sit between your hands facing the ground, and open his nostrils, and insert a hook into that flesh; then pull it outwards, and cut what you have grasped from it with a thin, sharp spatula on one side, until you know that the entire flesh has been removed.
If anything remains from that which cannot be removed: then scrape it with a fine instrument easily, until nothing remains of it.
If, however, blood dominates you, or a hot abscess occurs: then apply to it what is appropriate; or if it is from malignant abscesses, then hasten to cauterize it, until the blood is cut off and all flesh is removed.
Then, after the incision, vinegar, and water, or wine, should be placed in the nose.
If, however, the nose opens, and moisture flows from it to the palate, then you know that it is now healthy.
If, however, the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then know that within it is flesh grown on the upper bones of the nostril, to which the instrument did not reach during the incision.
Then it is necessary to insert a linen thread of some thickness, and tie many knots in it; and place between each knot a quantity of a finger, or less; and let the infirm person, with a rod or whatever is possible for him after he has made it like azer, insert one end of the thread into the nose; and draw out the smell of it, until it reaches the abscess, and exits above his throat.
And many times, children in schools indeed do something similar to this Attomi; and it is an easy matter for him who wishes to do it.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which emerges above the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Then remove the flesh shavings with the knots that are on the thread. Do that until you know that the flesh is now all with the knots of the thread.
Then pull out the thread, and after cleansing the blood, place in the nose the lint you soaked in Egyptian ointment; do this for three days, or longer, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of the flesh.
Then place a lead cannula at the end of the thing in the nose, for several days, until it heals.
If however it needs a treatment that will dry it out, use that.
For performing nasal douching, with which oils and other medicines are distilled into the nose, make it of silver, or bronze; that be like a small lamp, open like a seashell; and its passageway likewise.
And if you wish, make it a closed cannula, like a reed.
And the shell of the instrument for nasal douching, be full, uncovered; to which there be a handle at its end, with which you hold it, when you heat oil in it, or whatever you wish from juices and liquid things.
And this is the form of the instrument. Concerning the treatment of nasal warts.
Chapter XXV.
Often a wart is born at the tip of the nose, and it grows larger and increases with the days until its appearance becomes unsightly.
And therefore it is necessary, that in the beginning of its appearance, you should cauterize it and eradicate the whole of it.
Then apply to the place either a cautery or a burning medicine which stands in its stead.
If its incision is delayed until it grows large, then consider if it is stony, hard, of dark colour, and with little sensation: then do not touch it with iron, because it is a cancerous abscess.
For often I have seen that whoever incised a man's abscess, and great harm resulted from it to the one who had it.
And if the abscess is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that incision is possible throughout it, then evacuate the infirmity, and incise it without fear, without dread, and treat the place with what dries and constricts it, until it is healed.
Concerning the suturing of the nose, lip, and ear.
Chapter XXVI.
Know that when a separation of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, little benefit accrues from surgery in it, except in some individuals.
Therefore, when something of that kind happens to someone, you should consider if it is a fresh wound with its own blood; and then bring together the edges of the wound with sutures, and then treat it until it is healed.
And if the separation of continuity has caused the lips to be already separated, and each part is healthy, then it is necessary to scrape away all the part from its apparent skin, until it bleeds.
Then bring together the two lips with sutures, and tie them, and powder upon it the blood of a dragon, and crushed frankincense: and place over the powders a piece of a Diafinicon plaster, and some other of the consolidating plasters: and leave it bound for two days or three.
Then loosen it, and change the medicine, and leave it until the threads are cut off by themselves. Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of suturing is, that you bring together the separation of continuity, either with needles, as we described in the suturing of the belly, or bring the separation together with thread, as I made known to you.
Concerning the extraction of knots from the lips.
Chapter XXVII. Many people often suffer abscesses hard like herb seeds on the inner parts of their lips, and some of them are smaller, and some larger.
Therefore, it is necessary to turn back the lip, and to cut over every knot on it, and to lift it with a hook, and to cut it away from all sides.
Then, fill the place after the incision with bruised zegi, until the blood ceases.
Then, wash it with vinegar, and treat the area with it, where there is astringency, until the wounds are healed.
Concerning the incision of flesh growing on the gum.
Chapter XXVIII. Often flesh grows on the gum, which the ancients call a protrusion.
Therefore, you must suspend it with a hook; or hold it with forceps, and cut it near its root, and let the pus or blood run.
Then place on the area ground zegi, or other astringent, drying powders.
If that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does, then cut it a second time, and cauterize it; for it will not return after cauterization.
Concerning the removal of teeth with an iron tool.
Chapter XXIX.
Sometimes rough, unsightly, and sometimes darkened, yellowish, or greenish crusts collect on the surfaces of the teeth, both inner and outer, and between the gums, until the decay extends to the gums, and the teeth become disfigured by it.
Therefore, you should place the sick person between your hands, and his head in your lap, and scrape the molar and tooth where the crusts, resembling sand, appear, until nothing remains of them; and similarly treat the blackness, greenness, and yellowness, and other such things until they are cleaned.
If therefore that which is present on them from the beginning of the scraping is removed, it is good; and if not, then repeat the scraping on them another day, a second time, and a third time, until finally the desired result is achieved.
And know that a tooth requires scrapers of different shapes and forms, according to what is prepared for your operation; therefore, the scraper used to scrape the tooth from the lower part is different from the scraper used to scrape between the teeth, according to different shapes.
And have these shapes of scrapers prepared, which you see.
On the extraction of toothache.
Chapter 30.
You should treat the tooth from its pain with all ingenuity, and delay in its eradication.
For there is nothing to replace it when it is eradicated; since it is a subtle substance. Until, when there is no excuse for its eradication, then it is necessary when the sick person is forced to eradicate it, so that it may be strengthened, and the aching tooth be certified by you.
For often pain deceives the sick person, and he thinks that it is in the tooth itself and eradicates it; then the pain does not recede until the sick person's tooth is eradicated.
For we have already seen that from the operation of phlebotomists.
Therefore, when the aching tooth itself is certified by you, then it is necessary that you scarify in the circumference of the tooth with a spatula, in which there is something of virtue, until the gum is loosened on every side; then move it with your fingers, or with fine forceps at first gradually, until you break it.
Then place large forceps in a good position on it, and place the patient's head between your knees; which you have already held firmly so that it does not move; then pull the tooth in a straight line so that you do not break it.
If therefore it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and introduce it under it from every side with ease, and attempt its movement, as you did at first.
If however the tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary that you fill that hole with cloth; and bind it with the extremity of a fine reed, so that it does not break at the time of your constriction upon it with the forceps.
And it is necessary that you act carefully with the scarification around the gum on every side a great deal.
And guard your strength, so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns upon the sick person from that malice which shall be greater pain than his first pain.
And beware, lest you do that which ignorant phlebotomists do in their haste, and their boldness over its eradication, beyond what we have described.
For they often cause great illnesses in men, which are more difficult to break, and leave all its roots, or some of them; or that they extract it with some bones of the jaw; as we have often witnessed that. Then it should be washed after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt. If a flow of blood occurs from the places (for it often happens), then rub some of the zegi and fill the place with it; and if not, cauterize it if the zegi does not help you.
The shapes of the fine forceps with which the tooth is first moved should have long extremities, a short handle, and be thick, so that they do not double when pressed on the tooth; they should be like those with thick handles, so that when you tighten them, they do not give way or double; with short extremities, and be made of strong iron or good steel, with straight extremities; and on their extremities there should be teeth, some of which enter others and grip with a proper, strong constriction.
And sometimes the extremities are shaped like the beak of a bird called a stork, and are of strong constriction.
Concerning the eradication of teeth, and the extraction of fractured mandibular bones.
Chapter XXXI.
When, during the extraction of a tooth, something remains, then you should place a poultice of butter on the area for one or two days, until the area softens; then introduce algast or forceps, whose extremities resemble the beak of a bird called a stork.
The form of these forceps is this.
Let their extremities be made like a file inside, or like an aliskilfegi.
If therefore it does not yield to you for extraction with these forceps, then it is necessary that you carefully pry on the root, and uncover all the flesh, and introduce the instrument called a small lever, whose form is this.
Let it be short in length, somewhat thick, and not be soaked, so that it does not break.
If therefore the root emerges through it, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to assist with these other instruments whose forms are these.
The form of the first one is triangular with a certain thickness at the extremity.
The form of a triangular, slender extremity.
Also, it is assisted with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this. And with other instruments and tools that preceded in the discussion of teeth.
There is also assistance with this instrument, resembling a large hook, of this form: a triangular, twisted extremity, with some thickness so it does not break, and should not be soaked.
And know that there are many instruments for teeth, and similarly, other instruments are not counted; and a skillful craftsman, subtle in his art, finds for himself the instrument according to which the operation and illnesses themselves indicate to him.
Because there are illnesses for which the ancients did not describe an instrument, due to the diversity of their types.
If, however, a bone breaks from the jawbone, or from other bones of the mouth, or it rots: then investigate upon it in its place with what is appropriate to it from the instruments and forceps that I have mentioned in the extraction of roots, and assist with a lever, whose form is this.
Let there be some gradual thickness in it, so that the bone is tightened or held with it, and does not escape and go, until the bone emerges; and restore the place with medicines suitable to it.
If however there is a small rot in the bone, then scrape it from its rot, and treat it until it is healed.
Of the sawing of teeth protruding above others.
Chapter XXXII.
When teeth protrude not according to their natural course, an ugly form is produced by it; and especially when this happens in women and girls, namely those who are available (or for sale).
For if a tooth is born after another tooth, and is not placed correctly, or its sawing, or filing is possible, then extract it; and if it is attached to another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose form is this.
It is similar to a small beak, and is made from tempered iron, with a very sharp tip.
And let your incision be such that you cut it over many days, and because of the tooth's hardness, and so that another tooth is not moved.
If however it is prominent, exposed to its filing, then file it with a file of tempered iron, whose form is this.
Let the whole be of tempered iron, and its handle of small points very numerous, like the file with which needles are made; with which the tooth is filed gradually over many days with ease, so that the tooth is not moved and falls out; then gently smooth it, at the end scrape it with some razors.
If, however, it is a tooth from which a part has broken off, and it injures the tongue, then it is necessary to file it also, until the roughness of that fracture is removed, and it is made level; and is smoothed, and does not injure the tongue, nor corrupt speech.
Concerning the re-attaching of teeth with gold wires.
Chapter XXXIII.
When the front teeth suffer concussion and displacement from a blow or fall, and the patient cannot firmly bite on that which they eat lest it fall out; and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and the treatment has not been successful, then the procedure is to secure them with gold wire; for silver turns green and rots after days, but gold never changes.
And let the wire be of medium fineness and thickness according to the amount it must span between the teeth.
And the method of reattachment is as follows: take a wire, and insert double its length between two healthy teeth; then weave the two ends of the wire between the displaced teeth, whether one or more, until you reach a healthy tooth on the other side with the weaving.
Then repeat the weaving back to the point where you began; and draw your hand with care and skill until the wire is firmly secured; and your tightening of the wire should be near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not slip.
Then cut the excess ends of the wire with scissors; and bring them together, and turn them with forceps; and conceal them between the healthy tooth and the displaced tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue; then let it remain firmly secured.
If however it loosens or breaks, secure them with another wire, and it will remain thus throughout the time.
And this is the method for teeth, and the form of reattachment of two healthy teeth and two displaced teeth, as you see.
And sometimes it happens that one or two teeth return to their places after displacement, and are secured as we described, and remain; and no one but a skilled, prudent, and experienced craftsman can achieve this.
And sometimes a piece of bone is fitted: and it is made into the shape of a tooth, and placed in the gap, by which the tooth is strengthened and secured, as we said: and it remains, and serves it for a long time.
Concerning the incision of the ligament which occurs under the tongue and prevents speech.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
If there be hardness and knotting in it, and it be from the consolidation of a wound, then apply a hook to it, and split it across its width, until you reach the ligament, and the knot is released.
If a flow of blood occurs, then place pounded zegi on the site. If, however, blood overcomes you, then cauterize the site with a lentiginous cautery, suitable for it; then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed. Concerning the extraction of a Ranula located under the tongue.
Chapter XXXV.
Sometimes a boil occurs under the tongue, resembling a small frog, hindering the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it enlarges to such an extent that it fills the mouth.
If therefore you see it of a dark color, or black, hard, to which the sick person has no feeling: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it is inclined to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then insert a hook into it, and cut it with a fine spatula, and free it from every side.
If blood overcomes you during your operation, then put crushed zegi on it until the blood ceases; then return to your operation, until you extract it with its entirety.
Then wash it with vinegar and salt; and treat it with the appropriate further treatment for it, until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of an abscess of the two tonsils.
Chapter XXXVI.
And then either you will pierce it, or it will burst by itself.
And if it is of a white color, round, and its root is fine, then it is necessary to incise it.
And the operation on it is that, before its operation, you should consider if its abscess has rested quietly and been completely finished, or is diminishing with some reduction: then therefore, make the sick person sit in the sun, and let his head be in your lap; and open his mouth, and let a servant take between his hands, and press his tongue downwards with an instrument, whose form is this. Let it be made of silver or bronze, which is as fine as a knife.
When therefore you press the tongue with it, and the abscess is shown to you, and your sight falls upon it, then take a hook, and fasten it to the tonsil, and pull it outward as far as you can, besides pulling out some of the tissues with it.
Then cut it with an instrument, whose form is this which follows.
It is similar to shears; however, its ends should be curved, so that the opening of each is in a direct line with the other's sharp point: therefore, take care that it is made of tempered iron, or of well-tempered steel.
If however this instrument is not present, then cut it with a spatula, whose form is this.
It should be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
And after you have incised one tonsil, cut the other according to this same method of incision.
Then, after the incision, let the patient gargle with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
If however a flow of blood occurs, let him gargle with water in which the peels of pomegranates have been boiled: or with myrtle leaves, and similar astringent things, until the flow of blood is stopped: then treat him until he is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat, besides the two tonsils.
Therefore, cut it according to what I have said in the incision of the two tonsils equally.
And I myself have already treated a woman for an abscess which had arisen between her throat, which was drawing toward blackness, few senses, which had almost closed her throat; and the woman was breathing through a narrow passage, and I had already forbidden her eating and drinking water; and she had already come to death if it had remained for one or two days.
And the abscess had risen so much that it had sent out two branches, until they came out above the two nostrils.
I therefore quickly hastened and fixed a hook in one of them.
Then I pulled it, and a large piece came out from it.
Then I cut it off where I grasped it from the nostril.
Then I did the same to that which came out from the other nostril.
Then I opened its mouth and pressed its tongue; and afterwards I fixed a hook in the abscess; then I cut off a piece from it, and only a little blood flowed from it: thus the woman's throat was cured, and she immediately began to drink water, then to take food.
Therefore I did not cease to cut from that abscess many times over a long time, and the abscess followed in the place of what I was cutting, until it was extended too much, and with it that.
Therefore I devised, and cauterized the abscess between the throat.
Therefore it stood still from further additions; then I walked away, and did not know what God did with it after me.
Concerning the incision of an abscess of the uvula.
Chapter XXXVII.
When the catarrh descends to the uvula, and becomes abscessed, and is long, then it is called a perpendicular one; and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called a grape.
When it is treated with what we said in the division, and the treatment does not help; and you see that the abscess, hot, has ceased from it, and is subtle; then it is necessary that you cut it.
And that which is aggregated round from it, and has no length, and is bloody, or of a dusky colour, or black, and has no feeling: then it is necessary to avoid its incision.
For there is fear upon the infirm.
Therefore, when you see it according to the manner I said, from its whiteness and length, you must make the sick person sit facing the sun; and press his tongue with the instrument, the account of which preceded; then fix a hook in the grape, and pull it downwards; and cut it with one of the two instruments which I said in the incision of the two tonsils.
And it is necessary that you do not cut from it, except that which is added beyond the natural limit without addition.
For if you cut from it more, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then after the incision, use that which we described in the incision of the two tonsils, and care for it until it heals.
If however the sick person is terrified by the incision, then it is necessary that you use skill in cauterizing it without fear and trembling.
And the method of the cautery on it is not, except with sharp water, and it is that you place the head of the sick person in your bosom.
Then press his tongue with the instrument that we mentioned.
Then take from the water which I told you about in the chapter on cauterizing, and make with it quicklime that is not extinguished, and place it neither thick nor thin, and fill with it the concavity of this instrument, which has this form.
Let the concavity in which the medicine is placed be, like the concavity of the radius of a spoon.
And place the instrument with the medicine upon the uvula itself, and let the sick person lie on his side, so that saliva flows from his mouth from the internal medicine, so that nothing descends from it to his throat and harms him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine.
And you should keep it on the uvula for about half an hour, until you see it blackened and the biting of the medicine calmed down.
And if you wish to take the phlegm, and wrap it around the end of the radius, and introduce the phlegm with the medicine, and insert the radius with the phlegm into the cannula from above, until the phlegm adheres to the uvula. Do that repeatedly, until you achieve what you want in terms of cauterizing the uvula.
Then leave it; for it will dry and fall off after three or four days.
If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it.  And after the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with a cotton swab dipped in butter, and clean whatever is around it from the medicine; and rinse with cold water.
And treat it externally with poultices, and internally with gargles, until it is healed.
This method of treatment is therefore more beneficial than incision and further from fear.
And sometimes the uvula is treated even with something finer than cautery and incision; for it is treated with fumigation, according to this method.
Take calamint, hyssop, oregano, rue, sseah, chamomile, and wormwood, and similar herbs: and gather them all, or some of them, in a pot, and soak them with vinegar, and let them boil. And the pot should be properly coated with clay; and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument should be placed according to this method.
Let it be made of silver or bronze; and let the end, on which is the pomegranate, be inserted into the sick person's mouth, until the vapor rises to the uvula above the cannula, until the uvula is very dark.
Then repeat over it many times, until it dries.
And beware, lest you perform this treatment at the beginning of the abscess's onset.
For it usually adds to the abscess; and you should not do it unless at the decline of its hot stage.
If, however, this instrument is not present for you, then take a reed, and attach an egg-shell to its end; so that the sick person's mouth is not burned; because the egg-shell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth; and this is from a good treatment with safety.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Chapter Thirty-Eight.
Often a bone, or a fishbone, or something else adheres in the throat.
Therefore, it is necessary to extract what is apparent to the sight, after pressing the tongue with an instrument in the sun, and it is revealed to you what is in the throat.
And what is not apparent to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make the vomit weak before the food is digested in the stomach.
For perhaps the attached thing will be expelled by vomiting.
Or let the weak person swallow a piece of turnip, or a root of lettuce, or swallow a piece of dry bread; or let him take a piece of soft dried sea sponge, and tie it to a thread, then swallow it.
When therefore it arrives at the place where the spines or bone are, and is extracted, then it emerges. If therefore it does not emerge with what we have said, then use an instrument of lead according to this form.
Let it be thicker than a radius a little, and at its extremity let there be a curvature, which he should introduce into his throat with ease; and let him hold his head raised upwards.
And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, lest a cough befall him, and push with it the bone or spine, or let the physician introduce it with his hand.
However, that the infirm person introduce it is better, because of their knowledge of the location of the attached thing: and let him push downwards, or pull his hand with the instrument upwards, all that according to the quantity prepared for him, until it emerges.
Concerning the extraction of a leech.
Chapter Thirty-Nine.
When a leech is treated with what I have said in the division of treatment with medicines, and it does not work, then consider the throat of the sick person in the light of the sun, or in the sunlight, after pressing his tongue with the instrument that I have told you about.
If, therefore, your sight falls upon the leech, extract it with a small hook, or with slender instruments appropriately.
If this is not possible with them, then take a concave cannula, and insert it into the throat of the sick person until near the throat; then insert into the concavity of the cannula a heated iron with fire.
Do this repeatedly; and let the sick person abstain from water all day.
Then let him take a vial full of cold water, and open his mouth in it; and let him rinse his mouth with it, and not swallow anything from it; and let him move the water one hour after another with his hand.
For the leech immediately, when it feels the water, falls.
If however it does not emerge with what we have narrated, then fumigate the sick person with leeches, or with asa with the instrument that I have narrated in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do that many times, since it will fall.
And the method of operation in fumigation is, that you take a pot, in which there are live prunes with fire; and the pot is covered with a cover, in whose middle there is a hole; and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole.
Then project the fumigation, and let the sick person place his mouth at the end of the tube, and close his mouth, so that the fumigation does not escape, until you know that the fumigation has already reached the leech.
For the leech will fall immediately.
If it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times.
And let the sick person endure thirst, and eat salt, and garlic, and not drink water. Therefore, it is necessary that it departs with this treatment.
And this is the form of the instrument with which the leech is extracted from the throat, when it falls upon it in sight.
It is similar to forceps, as you see: except that it has this curvature which is inserted into the throat.
And its extremity is similar to the beak of a bird called a stork, on which is the roughness of a file: when it grasps something, it does not release it at all.
Concerning the opening of abscesses, and their incision, and their general care.
Chapter XL.
Abscesses are of many kinds, and many modes, according to their recollection, namely one, and one in this book; and they differ in their perforation, and incision from two modes.
One of which is from the species of an abscess in itself, and from that which it encompasses of humors.
And the second mode is because of the places in which it occurs within the body.
Since an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in the joints; and each of them has its own judgment from the operation.
And of abscesses there are some that should not be pierced, unless after the maturation of the pus within them, and its completion; and of them there are some that should be pierced while they are raw, and do not mature according to completion.
Such as abscesses that are near the joints.
Because an abscess, when it occurs near a joint and prolongs its existence until that which is around it putrefies, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted: therefore it is the more proximate cause of the contraction of that member.
Or it is an abscess near a principal member: because if you delay its incision until it matures, it will harm either that member or the principal member through it.
Or it is near the anus, therefore pierce it unripe; and it is not necessary to pierce a raw, incompletely digested abscess, unless it is near the anus, so that it does not putrefy deeply, and extend to the interior of the anus, and become a fistula, or be in a terminal state that does not heal. It is necessary to know the time of incision of the abscess, which is mature according to completion: and it is from the cessation of pain, the recession of fever, and the lessening of redness, and pulsation, and sharpness of the abscess head: and the remaining signs. And it is necessary that you make the same incision in the lowest part of the abscess, and of more prominent elevation; and let the incision be in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in the places of tendons, and chords, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all equal places where there is no reflection.
In those, however, that are reflected, proceed with the incision according to that limb.
However, when an abscess is in fleshy areas, then it is better to leave its incision until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to completion.
Because if you incise it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there is much filth and uncleanliness, and perhaps its edges and depth will harden.
And some abscesses are incised across the body, according to necessity, or according to what the limb requires.
And it is necessary that you administer a small incision in small abscesses, and a large incision in large abscesses, or multiple incisions according to the abscess's size.
And there are some abscesses in which the skin must be hollowed out; and incised when it has already become like a rag, and has reached its end, so that it is already dead; like that which happens in many cases, such as boils and buboes.
And some of them are incised with an incision having three angles.
And some of them are incised like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
Like a groin abscess.
And among them are some in which a round incision, and a crescent-shaped incision are administered; and similar incisions to them.
That which does not have a head, however, such as mild superficial abscesses, ought to be pierced with a superficial, or merely a flat, perforation.
And it is necessary, when the abscess is large and has already collected much pus, and you pierce it, that you do not hurry and extract all the pus at that time; rather, extract only a part of it.
Then, close the abscess until another day.
Then extract some more of the pus again.
Do this repeatedly according to stages, until it is expelled; especially if the patient is weak in strength, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old, decrepit person: for the animal spirit of the animal is repeatedly released with the expulsion of the pus; and perhaps the patient dies, and you do not perceive it.
Therefore, beware of this chapter with great caution.
And after your perforation, with which you perforate these abscesses, it is necessary that you cleanse the wound: and consider.
If therefore the wound of the abscess is small, or is a flat incision, then apply bandages of linen, or of old cloth.
And if the abscess is large, and there are many fissures of perforation, it is then necessary that you insert a bandage into every fissure, until they meet each other.
And if in the abscess you have removed part of the skin, or hollowed it out in the circumference: then it is necessary that you fill it with old cloth, or as when cloth is woven or wool is shaved from linen without moisture: and bind it tightly for up to three days.
Then remove it, and treat it with what is necessary from the ointment, until it is healed.
If however a flow of blood occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after having soaked a cloth in them: and place it repeatedly over the site of the bleeding.
If however the bleeding persists, then it is necessary that you administer the regimen, and the treatment, and the powders, which I have described in many places of this book of ours, and in its division.
If, however, it is during wintertime, and the site of the abscess is of many nerves: then it is necessary that you place heated cloths with wine and oil on those areas.
And if it is in summer, and the areas are fleshy: then it is necessary that you place cloths soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and make it all cold.
Until when the third day arrives, as we have said, then it is necessary to open the abscess, and cleanse it, and administer to it in its treatment whatever is appropriate, until it is healed.
This, therefore, is what is necessary from the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally.
Following the path of distinction, however, I have already spoken of every abscess, how its cure is capitulated singularly.
Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur on the scalp.
Chapter XLI.
Small abscesses occur on the scalp, and they are of the kind of tumors, which the coverings contain, as if they were the sacs of a hen's egg.
And their varieties are many.
Some of them are fatty; and some contain moisture similar to mud; and some contain moisture similar to gruel and porridge; and similar to these, and some are hard, stony.
And there is no fear in the incision and extraction of all of them, as long as the incision does not conflict with an artery.
And the operation in their incision is, to test them with an instrument, whose form comes after this, which is called the Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then cut it with a superficial incision along its length, according to this form.
And begin with an incision from line b to line g. When the moisture is therefore evacuated, then scrape the container that contains that moisture, and do not leave anything from it at all.
For it often returns if anything remains from it. Then immerse the cotum in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; and if not, in water and salt: and fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
For it will corrode what remained from the kist. Then repeat over the cotum with Egyptian ointment a second, and a third time, and if you need it, until you are confident that nothing has remained from the kist; then treat the wound with the ointment until it is healed.
If the abscess contains a fatty tumor, then cut it according to this form, the incision having the shape of a cross; and insert hooks between the two sides of the incision, and scrape it from every side; and try your skill in extracting the membrane that contains it.
If, however, an artery opposes you, then do that which I shall tell you later.
And likewise do in an abscess, if it is stony, by the same incision and treatment, according to what we have said. And the incision over a stony abscess is easier, because it has little blood and moisture.
And sometimes there are some of these abscesses which are on the head in some men, with which there is absolutely no moisture.
Or make their perforation always from their lower part, so that the flow of pus may be eased downwards.
Then treat them with what is suitable for them from the treatment.
Concerning the incision of tumors on the neck.
Chapter XLII.
These abscesses often occur in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
And those that occur in the neck from them are single, and multiple; and they are generated from one another; and every tumor from them is within its own tunic, just as in the knots and abscesses of the head, as we have narrated.
And the types of these tumors are many.
And from them some are stony; and from them some contain humors; and from them some are malignant, which do not obey treatment.
Therefore, in that one from them which you see to be of good disposition to the touch, whose proximity to the skin color is evident, and which moves in every direction, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, nor is deep: it is necessary to remove it by a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along a line, b, to line, g, and to scrape it from every side; and to spread the two skin flaps with a hook, or with many hooks, if you need it, as we said in the abscesses of the head, and to extract it gradually.
And it is a precaution that a vein or nerve be not cut.
And let the scalpel not be very sharp, so that it does not injure your hand with the incision, or disturb the sick person, and you cut what is not necessary.
However, if you cut a vein, or artery, or it hinders you from the operation, then put into the wound ground zegi, or some powders that cut off blood, and bind the wound, and leave it, until the sharpness of the abscess subsides, and the wound softens; or it begins and wants to putrefy.
For the blood is cut off then.  Return therefore to your operation, until you complete it.
Then treat it.
If the entire strophulus is cut, then you should bring together the two edges of the wound and close it immediately, after you see that there is no excess remaining.
If, however, you see that excess remains due to the size of the strophulus, then you should aim to cut its root and extract it, and apply the suture we described.
And any strophulus containing moisture, pierce it with a superficial puncture, so that you may see its place of maturity, and make the puncture from the part that follows below its body, as we said.
Then, after the puncture, apply dressings with ointment, and similar things, to corrode what remains of the corruption, until you see the wound already cleansed; then treat it with a generative flesh ointment, until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of the epiglottis from an abscess occurring within the throat.
Chapter XLIII.
The ancients spoke of this incision in the epiglottis, and I have seen no one in our land who has performed it; and this is the record of their words.
However, in those suffering from quinsy, the incision of the epiglottis should be avoided; since no benefit is derived from it; because all the veins and lungs are weak.
However, in those who have a hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no illness in the canal, one should use the incision of the epiglottis, to avoid the destruction that comes from suffocation. Therefore, when we wish to do so, we should incise the epiglottis below three or four circles of the epiglottis, with a small incision in width, at the point between two circles; an incision to be made in the syriac, not in the cartilage.  This place is suitable for incision, since it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are distant from it.
If the surgeon is timid, then it is necessary to extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Then he should split the skin until, when he reaches the canal, he should avoid blood vessels, if he sees any of them.
Then he should cut the syriac, as we have described: and the incision of the canal is signaled by the phlegm that emerges from it, along with the rupturing and severing of the voice.
And leave the wound open for a time.
When therefore the hour in which suffocation is feared is removed, bring together the two lips of the wound of the skin, and suture only it itself, without the cartilage.
Then administer the medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Says Albucasis.
The summary of this discourse which we have narrated is not an exposition, unless they see that some of these abscesses have already obstructed the throat of the sick person; and the sick person is raised above death, and his breathing is about to be cut off; they proceed to cut the epiglottis, so that the sick person may breathe over the wound with a certain respiration, and be saved from death; and for this reason they prescribed leaving the wound open, until the malice of the illness is consumed, and its malice is three days, and almost as much; then they prescribed sewing up the wound and treating it until it is healed.
And that which I saw with my own eyes is that a certain maid took a knife and thrust it into her throat, and cut a part of the lung passage with it.
And I was called to treat her, and I found her moaning, like the moan of a dead person.
Therefore, I examined the wound, and found blood that had escaped from the small wound.
Therefore, I was confident that she had not cut a vein, nor a jugular; and wind was escaping from the wound.
I quickly therefore dressed the wound, and treated it until it was healthy; and nothing happened to the maid except a hoarseness in her voice; and she returned after days to her better state.
Hence, I say: that there is no fear in the cutting of the epiglottis.
Concerning the cutting of a hernia of the throat.
Chapter XLIV.
This abscess, called a hernia of the throat, is a large abscess, the color of the body; and it is very common in women.
And it is in two ways: either it is natural, or it is accidental. Certainly, in the natural one, there is no ingenuity.
However, the accidental one is in two ways: one of which is similar to fatty lumps.
And the other way is similar to an abscess that forms from the knotting of an artery.
And in it there is fear, and it is not necessary that presumption be made upon it with iron, unless it is small.  And you shall probe it, and investigate it with an instrument.
If therefore you find it similar to a fatty lump, and it is not connected to any vein, then cut it, as lumps are cut: and extract it with whatever it contains from a cyst, if it is in a cyst; and if not, then explore its entire area.
Then treat the area with what is appropriate from treatment, until it heals.
Concerning the incision upon the varieties of Lumps.
Chapter XLV. There are many kinds of lumps, and I have already mentioned all their types in the division [of lumps]; and it is necessary to describe here the difference between a lump and a fistula, since it is a source of doubt. Therefore, I say that when a fistula has heat, fever, and severe pain, until the ebullition of the excess fluid subsides and the putrefaction is complete, then the fever and heat cease.
However, with a lump there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and it contains those little pouches called sifachin, which are their own sacs and are the same color as the body; and their beginning is like a chickpea, and it becomes like a batecha, and larger and smaller.
And they are of two types: either fatty or containing moisture.
And the colors of the moisture are many, according to what I have said in the division. Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a lump, you must examine it and inquire into its form first with an instrument called an Intromissum, according to how its shape will be described in the chapter that follows this one.
And the method of examining abscesses and all lumps is that you should take this instrument and insert it into the wettest place that you find in the abscess; and you should slowly revolve your fingers with it until you know that the instrument has already penetrated the skin.
Then place your hand over it according to the size of the abscess.
Then withdraw the Intromissum, and consider what comes out in its wake.
If, therefore, running moisture of any color comes out, then cut it with a superficial incision, as I have said in other abscesses.
And if no moisture comes out in the wake of the Intromissum, then know that it is fatty.  Therefore, cut over it with a cross-shaped incision, according to this form, as I have taught you. And suspend it with hooks, and scrape the skin from all sides with ease; and preserve the cyst if possible upon it, so as to extract the sound one with the lump.
However, if the cyst breaks during the operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole, for this often happens, then extract it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
For if any small or large part remains of it, the lump returns very often.
If, however, it overcomes you, and a small part remains, then fill the wound at your completion with certain sharp corrosive powders, and constrict the wound, and place upon it what sits warm over the abscess, and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
If therefore the lump is large, then sew its two lips together, and treat it with what causes it to heal. If, however, there is a pulsating or non-pulsating vein, then hurry and fill the place with ground zegi, and leave it constricted for two or three days until the wound is rotten and the ebullition of blood ceases; then return to cutting what remains of the lump.
Concerning the exterior instruments for cutting and piercing.
Chapter XLVI.
Among them are the forms of probes, and they are of three kinds.
For among them is a large one, and among them is a medium one, and among them is a small one.
Let them be made of iron, alfulud, with square ends, fittingly, so that they hasten entry into the abscess.
And these are the forms of instruments, and, no, that is, perforating ones: and one of them is called beris, that is, piercing: and they are of three kinds.
For among them is a large one, and a medium one, and a small one.
They are suitable for investigating abscesses, exits, fistulas, and buboes through that which is between them from the bones.
And others are made round, smooth, and polished, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, namely from amber or bronze or iron or silver. And the best of them are those made from amber.
And also experiences are made from black lead, which are suitable for experiencing fistulas, whose concavity has reflections, so that they may be reflected with their gentleness along those reflections.
And they are again of three kinds. Because some of them are long, some medium, and some short, according to the amount of the fistula's width and its constriction. The shape of hooks, and they are of many kinds. Because some of them are simple, namely those with a single curve: and they are of three kinds as you see, Large, Medium, and Small.
And from among them are blind hooks: and they are of three kinds.
And from among them are hooks having two curves, and they are of three kinds: and from among them are hooks having three curves, and they are of three kinds: and all these are necessary in their place.
And these are the shapes of scalpels, with which knots and abscesses are cut and scraped: and they are of three kinds: because from among them is a large, a medium, and a small one.
Their cutting edges are sharp, the other edges are not sharp: and they are not placed thus, unless they are to be of assistance in scraping knots in fear of cutting a vein or nerve: and that the sick person may be healed by them, and find a little respite from the burning pain that he finds in the scraping of the abscess.
These are large ones, and are of three kinds.
They are made of bronze, and are similar to the tool with which alcohol is made: and on the broad end is a hidden point of a spatula: and on it it runs inward and outward when you wish, as you see.
The shape of spatulas that are hidden between the fingers when perforating abscesses: and the sick do not perceive them: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
The shapes of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is removed: and they are of three kinds, large, medium, and small.
Let them be made of bronze or brass, round, a little in length, as you see: and let them be of a fine thinness.
And it is necessary that these kinds of cupping glasses be large and small with you: so that you may remove blood with speed when necessary, and then when no medicine is available to you.
However, do not use them to remove blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except on fleshy areas: such as the thighs of the legs, and the hips, and the arms, and the breasts, and the belly, and the groin, and similar fleshy, moist parts.
And sometimes other small instruments like hazelnuts are made from them, according to their shape, with which blood is removed when it flows from a phlebotomy site or at the incision of a vein or artery, and sometimes they are made round in this shape.
Concerning the care of men's breasts that resemble women's breasts.
Chapter XLVII.
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell at the completion of sleep (that is, when they begin to be polluted in sleep) until they resemble women's breasts, and remain foul-looking sores.
Therefore, whoever abhors that, it is necessary that he cut over the breasts with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this form from line b to line g.  Then scrape away all the fat.
Afterwards, fill the wound with a flesh-inducing medicine.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound with sutures, and care for it until it is healed.
If, however, the breast inclines downwards and softens due to its size, as happens with women, then it is necessary to cut it in two, along its upper sides, with two incisions similar to a crescent shape, each one containing the other at the ends of each, until a larger line contains a smaller one, according to this form from line b to line g. Afterwards, scrape off the skin between the two lips, and remove the fat, and administer what we said about sutures and powders, what is necessary from the treatment, until it is healed.
However, if you do not complete the incision that you ought to make, due to the patient's distress, or because of blood flow, then you must fill the wound with cloth soaked in corrosive ointment, and leave it until it has corroded what remains of the fat.
Then care for it until it is healed.
Concerning the perforation of an abscess that occurs under the armpit.
Chapter XLVIII. These abscesses which occur under the armpit are of the kind of hard Strophulae, which contain cysts, and of those which contain moisture.
Therefore, those of them that contain moisture should be incised with a lunate incision, according to this form, from line b. to line g.  When, therefore, all that is in the abscess, of pus, is evacuated, then fill it with old lint, and leave it until another day.
Then remove the lint, and treat it with a suitable ointment for it, until it is healed.
If the abscess is of the kind of the knotty Strophulae, then cut upon it, as we said in the section on Strophulae, equally.
If however the wound extends in this so that it emits pus, then apply a cautery to it, according to what we said in what was previously stated.
Of the incision of the abscess that occurs because of the Artery and Vein.
Chapter XLIX.
When an artery is ruptured, and the skin above it is consolidated, then often an abscess occurs from it: and similarly it happens to the vein also, that an abscess and swelling occur in it.
And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and swelling are due to the Artery and Vein, are: because, when the abscess is due to the artery, it is long, aggregated deep in the body: and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a creaking sound to it.
And that which is due to the Vein, is round on the surface of the body.
And incision upon this abscess is an error, and especially that which is under the armpits, and the groins, and the neck, and in many places of the body: and it is very great.
Therefore, its treatment with iron should be avoided, and what is also from them in the extremities, or in the head, should be avoided.
Upon that which is from them, from the inflation of the artery's orifice, make a cut into the skin in the length.
Then open the incision with hooks, afterward the Artery; and free it from its coverings, until it is uncovered.
Then insert a needle beneath it, and cause it to penetrate to the other side, and tie the Artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two Arteries which are in the temples.
Then prick the place, which is between the two ligatures with a lancet, until the blood that is in it entirely emerges, and the abscess is resolved.
Then administer a treatment that produces pus, until the ligatures fall off; afterwards treat it with suitable ointments for it, until it is healed.
If it is an abscess because of the incision of a Vein, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what is possible for you of the abscess with the skin.
Then insert a needle beneath the place you have held with your hand, and cause it to penetrate; and let there be a double thread on it, until you extract it from the other side.
Then tie the abscess with a good ligature, according to what I told you concerning the ligature of the grape, from two sides with two ends of the thread. If however you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert another needle with another thread beneath the entire abscess near the incision of the needle; press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess in its middle, until what is in it comes out; then cut the excess skin, and leave that which is bound from it.
Then place on it a poultice which you have soaked in wine and oil.
Then administer treatment, which is done with bandages and ointments, until it is healed.
Concerning the abscess that arises from the twisting of nerves.
Chapter L.
Just as an abscess occurs in the artery and vein, so too does an abscess occur in the nerves: which occurs in them by impact, or by excessive exertion, and similar causes; and it happens most frequently in the joints of the hands or feet, and in every place where joints move: and it is a serious abscess. Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many cases painless; and when it is pressed forcefully, the sufferer feels a sensation similar to numbness in it.
And it is not a deep-seated, collected abscess, but rather under the skin, and it moves to every part, and does not progress forwards, or backwards.
Therefore, those that are in the joints should not be incised with iron.
For perhaps contraction will result.
However, in those that are on the head or forehead, split the skin with a spatula.
If, therefore, it is a small abscess, then hold it with scissors, and cut it away from the root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook, and scrape it: then remove it, and stitch the wound: and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the incision of an abscess that occurs in the belly.
Chapter LI. Many people have, many times, in their bellies and in their other bodies, tumours, which are called Fungalia, by their resemblance to fungi.
Their root is subtle, and their head is large, and their lips are turned outwards.
And some of them are small, and some of them greatly enlarge.
And I myself have seen a man, and in his belly were two tumours, which were more like fungi than other things: there was no difference between them, being white, small-rooted, and their lips turned outwards, and they split open, and moisture flowed from them constantly.
Therefore I cut them, and found in the weight of one, about ten and eight ounces, and in the other, about six ounces.  And the operation in cutting them is that you must consider, if the sick person is moist and the color of the tumour is white, moist, with a fine root: then cut it with a broad spatula, and have cauteries present in fire.
For often much blood is expelled at its incision; therefore, hurry if blood overwhelms you, then cauterize it.
If you see the sick person afraid and timid of incision with iron, then take a thread of lead, well-made, and bind it to the tumour; by the method we have described, and leave it for two days.
Then add to the lead binding.
Therefore do not cease binding the lead, whenever it presses on the tumour, until it is severed, and falls off by itself without effort.
If however the tumour is of a large root, then in its incision there is some fear and dread; especially that which is in the belly.
However, it is possible to cut half of it.
Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Then treat it until the wound heals.
And beware lest you presume to cut a tumour that is dark-coloured, of little feeling, and foul appearance: for it is a cancerous abscess; and I shall come with a reminder of Cancer after this.
Concerning the treatment of the navel's prominence.
Chapter LII.
The navel's prominence arises from many causes.
Or from fissures in the skin above the abdomen, and from which a part of the caul, or the bowel, protrudes, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Or from blood flowing from a vein or artery, as was previously stated.
Or from constrained wind within it.
If however it is due to a fissure in the caul, and the protrusion of the bowel, then its color is like the color of the body; and it is soft, without pain; and it appears in diverse positions.
And if it is due to the protrusion of the bowel, then its position, with that which we have described, is of more violent diversity.
When therefore you press it with your fingers, it disappears; then it returns, and perhaps with a sound; and it greatly magnifies itself at the entrance of the bath, and in violent exertion.
If however it is due to moisture, it is soft, then it does not disappear when you press it with your hand, nor does it contract, nor is it added to.
If however it is due to blood, then with these signs the abscess appears black on the slope.
If however it is due to generated flesh: then the abscess is severe, large, hard, and fixed according to a single quantity.
If however it is due to windiness, then its touch is soft. And the operation on it is, that you should then consider, if the eminence of the navel is due to blood of the artery, or vein, or windiness: then it is necessary that you refrain from its treatment.
For in it is fear and dread, as I taught you in the chapter, in which I said abscesses due to artery and vein.
If the eminence of the navel is due to the intestine or hernia, then it is necessary that you command the sick person to hold their breath and stand stretched out.
Then mark with ink around the entire navel.
Afterwards, command him to lie on his back between your hands on his back.
Then surround with a broad spatula the area around the navel, over the place you marked with ink.
Afterwards, extend the middle of the abscess upwards with a large hook.
Then tie it around firmly with thread, or with a silken cord or strong ligament; and let the knot of the ligament be tied.
Then open the middle of the abscess, extended above the ligament.
If therefore you find it already grasped by the ligament, then pull out the tied portion, and insert the index finger into it, and push the intestine into the interior of the belly; and if you find a hernia, then take it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
If however the artery or vein is contrary to you, then surround it much.
Then return to your operation.
And take two needles, and insert in them two strong threads; and insert the two needles in the circumference you made around the abscess in the manner of a cross, making them penetrate.
Then tie the abscess in four places above the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the extended flesh putrefies, and falls away by itself; or cut it when it is softened and putrefied.
Then treat it with whatever is necessary from the ointments until it is healed.
If the protrusion of the navel is from flesh rising within it, or from moisture, then it is necessary to excavate the abscess, as we have said.
And extract the blood or moisture that you find in it.
Then treat it with what consolidates the place.
Concerning the treatment of CANCER. Chapter LIII.
For I myself could not cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me who has succeeded in doing so.
And the treatment, when it is located as we have said, is to proceed, and to relieve the afflicted person from the black cholera on several occasions.
Then, if you find it with obvious fullness, phlebotomize it.
Then prepare the patient with the preparation in which he will be placed with the operation.
Then cast into the Cancer the hooks that are suitable for it.
Afterwards, hollow it out from every side with the skin, according to examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and allow the blood to run, and do not cut it quickly, rather express the places, and wipe away all the thick blood with your hand, or with whatever instruments are possible there.
If, however, a contrary flow of thick blood from the incision of an artery or vein occurs to you, then cauterize the vein until the blood ceases.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Of the treatment of dropsy.
Chapter LIII.
We have already narrated in the division of the species of dropsy, and how the aggregation of water occurs, and the signs of every species, and its treatment with medicines.
And that which is treated with iron is only a species of ascites alone; and it is not applied with iron to the species of tympanites; nor to the species of hyposarca entirely; for that is fatal.
When you have already treated this species of dropsy, tympanites, with medicines, and your treatment has not availed, then consider.
For if weakness has already overtaken the sick person, or there is another illness with him besides the dropsy, such as if there be a cough with him, or looseness of the belly, and things similar to these, then beware that you do not treat him with iron, because there is fear of it.
If, however, you see the sick person of abundant strength, and there is no illness with him other than dropsy alone; and he is neither a child nor an old man; then the method of operation in him is that you raise the sick person standing between your hands, and the attendant behind him press his belly with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the chest.
Then take a thorny spatula, according to this form.
Let it be of two sharp parts, long, with sharp extremities like a spatula.
However, let there be something of brevity gradually, so that you do not proceed with it during the operation all the way to the intestine, and harm him.
Then consider.
For if there is generation of dropsy from the part of the intestines, then it is necessary that you extend with the incision from the navel by the quantity of three fingers, downwards in a straight line above the pubic bone.
If however the generation of dropsy is because of disease of the liver, then let your incision be to the left of the navel by three fingers.
And if its generation is because of the spleen, then let the incision be on the right side; and it is also not necessary that the incision be on the side on which the sick person wishes to lie, so that superfluities do not run to that weak place.
Then pierce with the instrument all the skin.
Then insert into that incision, and raise your hand with the Spatumili between the skin, and do so, as if you were to scrape it; and let the amount scraped be the amount of a fingernail, or about that.
Then pierce, doing so until the Spatumile reaches the empty place; and it is the place of water.
Then withdraw it, and insert into the hole the instrument, of which this is the shape.
And it is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, or bronze, or brass, smooth, polished; to which at its lower part is a small hole, and on its sides are three holes, two on one side, and one on the other side; and its end is cut, according to the manner of cutting a reed, as you see; on its upper end is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, then it descends immediately upon the instrument, therefore evacuate from the water in a short time a moderate quantity.
Because if you evacuate from it more than is necessary, perhaps the weak person dies in a short time by the dissolution of his animal spirit; or a syncope happens to him which approaches death.
But evacuate from it according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the patient's conditions signify to you, from the strength of his pulse, and from his well-being.
Then withdraw the instrument, and retain the water.
Because it is immediately retained due to the skin which retains the opening which is above the sifac: of which I have spoken, so that you pierce it in that manner.
Then again use the instrument on the following day, if you see the patient tolerating it; and also extract a small quantity from the water. Do this for several days without fear, and guard against error, until only a little remains of the water.
However, if you fear for the patient, and you release a great deal of water, then treat him with burial in hot sand, and with much sweat in a bath and sun, and let him endure thirst; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed; and cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen, after the extraction of water, according to what I have narrated before.
Concerning the care of infants born in places where their urine passages are not perforated.
Chapter LV. When any infant emerges from its mother's womb, and the opening of its urethra is not perforated, or is a narrow opening, or is in the wrong place.
Therefore, it is necessary to immediately assist with its perforation when it is born with a very fine spatula, according to this form.
Then place a fine leaden peg in the opening and tie it; and hold it for three days or four.
When it then wishes to urinate, it should be removed, and it will urinate.
Then replace it.
And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine flowing over the area will not allow it to close.
However, the one whose opening is narrow is treated with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it widens.
However, those in whom the opening is in an improper place are harmed.
For this reason, those born with an opening at the end of the penis: therefore, they cannot urinate forward until they raise their penis upward with their hand. Nor is there generation for him, because the semen cannot reach the womb properly: and it is a very foul disease.
And the method of operation in him is that the sick person be placed on their back.
Then extend his penis with your left hand forcefully, and cut off the head of the penis from the glans, with a sharp needle or sharp scalpel; like cutting a reed, or like you shave something, so that its middle becomes like the head of the penis, and so that the opening falls in the middle, as is required.
And beware of the flow of blood in your operation.
For it often happens.
Therefore, apply to it whatever stops the bleeding, and treat the wound until it heals.
Concerning the problems that occur in the foreskin and the head of the penis, and its corruption, blackness, and adhesion.
Chapter LVI.
These problems frequently occur in the penis, and there is a prominent growth of foul flesh.
And from it some are malignant, and some are not malignant.
Therefore, the non-malignant one should be suspended with a fine hook, and cut off, until the whole of it is cleansed.
Then place on it a poultice soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then treat it afterward with diaphanicon ointment until it heals.
If, however, it is malignant, of foul colour, then it is necessary to apply a cautery to it after its incision and scraping.
If, however, the ulcer is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised captive, and a part of the ulcer is within the foreskin and another part outside: then it is necessary to remove the ulcer that is within first, until when it is consolidated, then treat it externally; because when you treat it at the same time, the foreskin is not safe from being perforated.
And these also occur in the testicles and the foreskin, a blackness and corruption.
Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize all that is already blackened and that desires to become corrupted, or that is already corrupted.
Then, apply a line over it after with honey that has already been mixed with the flour of pomegranate bark and crushed, sifted herbs.
Then treat it with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
If however, a flow of blood occurs, then apply a cautery with a lunar cautery, according to this form.
For cautery is helpful for two conditions at once, namely for the flow of blood and a wound when it is corrupted.
If the head of the penis is corroded and the entire thing is destroyed within an hour, then it is necessary to insert a lead cannula into the urethra so that the sick man urinates over it.
However, when the foreskin adheres to the glans penis, and this adhesion does not occur unless the foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required upon it; and sometimes adhesion occurs due to a wound or an abscess: therefore, it is necessary to scrape it with a blunt Spatumili, until the ligament is loosened, and the glans penis is freed on all sides.
If it is difficult to discern these things precisely, then it is necessary to scrape something from the glans penis and from the foreskin.
This is because the foreskin, when it is thin, perhaps is perforated quickly because of its thinness.
Then separate the foreskin and the glans penis with a thin linen cloth, which has already been moistened in cold water, so that they do not adhere again.
Then treat it with astringent wine until it is solidified. Concerning the cleansing of infants and the treatment of errors that befall them.
Chapter LVII.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity, like other wounds; however, since it is from our operation, by our will, and its use is properly in boys, it is necessary that we mark it with a better operation and a smoother path leading to health.
Therefore I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, since they do not use it in their laws, and it is only something we have acquired through experience.
This is because I have found most of the artisans and phlebotomists using cleansing, circumcising with a razor and with scissors; and the skilled ones using cauterization, ligation with thread, and incision with a nail.
And I myself have already tested all these methods, and have found no better cleansing than with scissors and ligation with thread.
Because in cleansing with a razor, the skin often escapes.
Since the skin of the foreskin has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper layer is incised, and the lower layer remains; therefore it is necessary to make an incision to cut the other one, and future pain.
And with the cleansing that is done by cauterization, that is, digital, which the surgeons use, the incision of the extremity of the male member is not secured, since perhaps it enters the opening of it.
In cleansing with a nail, perhaps the iron escapes and spoils your operation; and the skin of the boy is short in nature, and they are often born in such a way that they do not need cleansing: and I have already seen that.
However, cleansing with scissors, and ligation with thread, has shown me a good experiment; since scissors are proportional to the incision; because the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
When, therefore, you press your hand, the two sharpnesses are proportioned, and they cut according to one operation at one time; and a compression of similar shape is made, encompassing the skin of the penis from all sides, with which no error falls at all.
And the proper method of operation is that you cause the boy, especially if he is of those who understand a little, to be aware that you do not do anything except tie a thread to his penis, and you leave him until another day.
Then cause him to rejoice and be joyful in every way that is possible for you, from that which his understanding receives.
Then insert your hand into his penis, and blow into the skin, and pull it upward until the head of the penis emerges.
Then cleanse it from the dirt that has accumulated on it.
Then tie the marked place with a double thread.
Then tie a second ligature a little lower. Then hold the lower ligature's place with your index finger and thumb, providing good retention, and cut between the two ligatures.
Then lift the skin quickly upwards and extract the head of the rod.
Then allow the blood to run slowly (for it is better) and put powder on top. And over the powder, a cloth on which the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, mixed with good fresh rose oil, has been spread: and leave it there until another day, and treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
The shape of the scissors for cleaning is this.
Let the two ends be blunt and meet at an angle, so that a nail's branch does not emerge from them, and let the length of the two sharpened parts be equal to the length of the two handles.
A mistake that occurs in cleaning is that perhaps the inner skin is entirely or partially escaped at the incision. Therefore, you should pull it out with your finger before the abscess forms, and cut it evenly.
If you cannot hold it with your finger, then pull it out with a hook, and cut it.
However, if three days have passed and the area under the rod remains swollen, an abscess: then leave it until the abscess has matured, and open it easily, and cut it according to what is prepared for you.  Beware of the rod's head.
For it will not harm it.
Therefore, treat it with that which consolidates a wound from the powders that we have discussed in the treatise on powders.  And if it is cut from the skin beyond measure and goes up, that will not harm it either.
Therefore treat it with what we have said, until it is healed.
On the extraction of retained urine in the bladder.
Chapter LVIII.
Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from an obstruction caused by a stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or grown flesh, and similar things to those which we have stated in the methods of treatment in the division.
And if the urine is not released, and you see its retention to be because of a stone, which is already in the neck of the bladder, then it is necessary that he be weak, bent over his knees.
Then let his feet be placed on his back, and let him extend his belly from the upper part of his back, and let the weak man draw in his breath as much as possible.
Thus he is forced, with the neck of the bladder, to expel the stone to the rear: wherefore the urine is released.
If it is not released with what we have said, and the matter is severe upon the patient, then it is necessary that you administer its extraction with an instrument, which is called a syringe, of which this is the form. It should be of silver, and be slender, smooth, concave, like the quill of a bird's feather in its slenderness, one and a half palms in length; to which there should be a slender tube at its head.
And the mode of the urine's exit through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and tie to its end wool, or tow, with a good ligature; and insert the thread's end into the lower part of the syringe; and cut with scissors if any wool protrudes, but insert it into the tube with force, like a lever.
Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and the white of an egg; and make the patient sit on a seat, and embrocate the bladder and its urethra with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Then introduce the syringe into the urethra with ease, until it reaches the root of the urethra.
Then double it upward from the part of the navel. Then drive the syringe into it, until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it has reached the empty space: and this is not done according to this order, unless because the passage, in which it travels, is tortuous.
Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
For the urine will follow the wool.
Then pull it out, and cause the urine to run through the urinary way: and repeat the syringe, and do not cease to do it, until the bladder is emptied, and the patient finds relief. Concerning the quality of bladder irrigation with a clepsydra.
Chapter LIX.
It is deaf, that is, closed.
And in it are three openings, two on one side, and one on the other side, as you see.
And the hollow place, in which that which impels it is, should be according to the quantity that it can fill without addition, until, when something is pulled with it, humidities are drawn out; and when it is impelled, it is expelled with it to a distance; according to what the clepsydra does, with which naphtha, that is, Greek fire, is projected in naval battles.
Therefore, when force is used to project humidities into the bladder, insert the end of the clepsydra into the humidity, and pull that which impels it upwards, for humidity is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra. Then insert its end into the tube, as we have described in the syringe.
Then propel the humidity with that which impels it; for that humidity reaches the bladder immediately, so that the sick person feels it. A subtle form of clyster with which the bladder is clysterized.
Then introduce a strong thread into those holes, as they revolve. Then aggregate the circle, as a loaf is aggregated: after you place upon it what you wish from humidities, and oils, and waters.
Then tie it to the instrument, and do with it as you did with the bladder by squeezing with your hand, until the humidity reaches the bladder.
On the extraction of the Stone.
Chapter LX. We have already discussed the classification of the types of stone, and its treatment with medicines; and I have explained the difference between stone generated in the kidneys and the bladder, and the signs of each; and I have explained the stone in which manual operation and incision are performed; and the stone generated in the bladder is properly so called; and the one which adheres to the urethra; and I am explaining that with clear exposition and abbreviation.
Therefore, I say that stone generated in the bladder most often occurs in children.
And among its signs is that the urine passes from the bladder like water in its subtlety, and white sand appears in it, and the sick person rubs their urethra and suffers with it, and often hangs down. Then it rises and comes out with the anus in many of them.
And the cure is easy for children, as long as they reach fourteen years.
And it is difficult in the elderly.
However, in young people it is intermediate, in that it is between those two: and the one whose stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, the cure is the opposite of that.
Therefore, when we come to the treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the sick person with an enema, which will remove all the waste that is in his intestines; for it sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone during the examination. Then the sick person should be taken up by their feet and shaken and moved downwards, so that the stone descends to the depth of the bladder, or sometimes leaps from a higher position.
Then have him sit between your hands, prepared, and let his hands be under his thighs, so that the entire bladder is inclined downwards.
Then search him and touch him externally.
If therefore you feel a stone in the space, then immediately proceed with incision above it.
If, however, it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must wipe your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child; or your middle finger if he is a full-grown youth; and insert it into his anus, and search for the stone until it is under your finger; and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press upon it with your finger, and drive it outward against the place which you wish to incise; and command a servant to press the bladder with his hand, and command another servant to raise the testicles with his right hand upward, and with his other hand to draw back the skin that is beneath the testicles, at the side of the place where the incision is to be.
Then insert the Spatumile, which has this shape.
And find it in the space between the anus and testicles, and not in the middle, towards the left buttock; and let the incision be above the stone, and your finger be in the anus; and let the incision be transverse, so that the incision be wide externally and narrow internally, according to how much it is possible for the stone to emerge from it, not larger.
For perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone near the incision, and it emerges without difficulty.
And know that if the stone has angles and edges, therefore its exit becomes difficult because of that.
And if it is smooth, like a gland, and round, its exit becomes easy.
Therefore, to the one with angles and edges, add in the fissure.
If it does not emerge thus, then it is necessary that you devise something over it; or you should bind over it with a suitably formed instrument, whose extremity is like the Moon, which binds over the stone, and does not escape from it; or that you introduce a thin, curved instrument under it.
If, however, you cannot over it, then enlarge the opening slightly.
If, however, something from the blood conquers you, sever it with a zegi.
If, however, the stone is more than one, then drive the largest one first to the mouth of the bladder.
Then cut upon it.
Afterwards, drive the small one after that: and similarly do if there are more than two.
If it is very large, then ignorance it is to cut upon it with a large incision.
For it happens to the sick person one of two things, either that he dies, or that a constant dripping of urine happens to him, because the place is not completely consolidated.
But administer its expulsion, until it comes out: or devise ways in its fracture with forceps, until you extract it piece by piece.
When therefore you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with frankincense, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and put over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water, so that a hot abscess is subdued.
Then lay the sick person on their back, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
When therefore you have loosened it, anoint the place with water and much oil.
Then treat it with diaphoretic ointment, and basilicon ointment, until it is healed.
If however a hot abscess, added to the wound, and corrosives, and similar things happen: such as if blood is congealed in the bladder, and urine is prevented from passing through it, and this is known by the blood being expelled with the urine.
Therefore, insert your finger into the wound, and draw out that blood.
For if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder, and its putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt: and apply whatever remedy is appropriate for its treatment until it is healed.
And it is necessary in the hours of the entire treatment, that you bind the two hips, and bring together, for the sake of the medicines which are placed upon the place.
If a stone is small and situated in the urethra, and is fixed there, and prevents the exit of urine: then treat it with what I have narrated before you arrive at the incision.
For many times you will be spared the incision by this treatment, for I have already proven it. And it is that you should take a perforator of iron, whose shape is this, of a triangular tip, sharp, fixed in wood.
Then take a thread, and tie the urethra with it beneath the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the perforating iron into the urethra with ease, until the perforator reaches the stone itself: and rotate the perforator with your hand on the stone gradually: and try to pierce it, until you make it penetrate on the other side.
For the urine is discharged immediately.
Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone from the outside of the urethra.
For it breaks itself and emerges with the urine, and the sick person is cured.
If, however, this treatment is not prepared for you, due to something that prevents it: then tie a thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone. Then cut above the stone on the very urethra between the two ligatures.
Then extract it.
Afterwards, loosen the ligature, and cleanse the congealed blood which forms in the wound.
And it is not necessary for the ligature of thread under the stone, unless so that it does not return to the bladder; and another ligature above, unless so that when the thread is loosened after the stone's exit, the skin returns to its place and covers the wound; and for that reason it is necessary for you to raise the skin upward when you tie the upper thread, so that it returns to its proper position and covers the wound, as we have said.
Concerning the extraction of the Stone in women.
Chapter LXI.
Little stone is generated in women.
If, however, a stone should befall any of them, then the cure is difficult, and is prohibited because of many methods.
One of them is: that the woman is perhaps a virgin. And the second is, because you do not find a woman who reveals herself to a physician, when she is chaste, or from those who have husbands.
The third is, because you do not find a woman well knowing this art, especially the operation with the hand.
And the fourth is the distance from the place of the stone: wherefore it needs a deep incision, and in that is fear.
If necessity provokes it, then it is necessary that you take a woman physician, well knowing: and few are found.
If however you privately entrust this to her, then seek a chaste, skillful physician, and present a knowledgeable midwife skilled in women's matters, or a woman who hints at skill in this art: thus make her present, and especially to her, have her do everything you prescribe to her in inquiring about the stone. First, that she look if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she introduce her finger into her anus, and seek the stone.
If therefore she finds it, she should hold it under her finger, and then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the woman's vagina and inquire about the stone, after placing her left hand upon the bladder and pressing it with good pressure. If therefore she finds the stone, then it is necessary that she gradually move it from the opening of the bladder downwards with all her strength, until she reaches it with the root of the thigh.
Then she shall cut upon it at the opposing middle of the vulva at the root of the thigh, from whichever side it is prepared for her, and she feels the stone in that part: and her finger shall not be removed from the stone, holding it under it: and let the incision be small at first.
Then insert a probe into that incision.
If therefore she feels the stone, then she should add to the incision according to the proportionate quantity by which the stone emerges from it.
And know that the kinds of stones are many. For among them is the small, and the large, the smooth and the rough, the long, and the round one having branches.
Know therefore its kinds, so that you may be shown by this concerning that which you wish.
If therefore blood overcomes you, then add in the place bruised, crushed, and hold it one hour, until the blood is severed.
If, however, a flow of blood overcomes you, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery that has been cut, then place powder on the area and bind it tightly with suitable bandages; and do not change it; and leave the stone, and do not extract it.
For perhaps the weak woman will die.
Then treat the wound.
When therefore the sharpness of the blood subsides after days, and the area becomes putrid, then return to your operation, until the stone emerges.
Concerning the incision of a watery hernia.
Chapter LXII.
A watery hernia is not there, unless a collection of moisture in a white sifac, which is beneath the skin of the testicle containing the egg: and it is called sifac. And sometimes it is in the proper membrane prepared for it by nature in the part of the egg, until it rots: which is another egg, and there is the skin of the testicle between the white sifac, which we mentioned: and this does not happen except rarely.
And the generation of this hernia indeed is from weakness which happens to the testicles: wherefore this matter is poured out to them.
And sometimes it happens from a blow on the testicles.
And this moisture has many colours. For either its color is inclined to yellowness, or it is blood-red, or foul, black, or watery white, and that is what is more.
For if it is in the white sifac that we mentioned, then the abscess is round to a small length like the shape of an egg: and the testicle does not appear, because the moisture contains it from every side.
And if the moisture is in the proper pannicle to itself, then the abscess is round with a part of an egg, and because of this a man estimates that it is another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white sifac, then it falls under the sense.
Therefore, when you wish knowledge of the color of the moisture, then experience the color of the moisture in the abscess with the introduced square, whose form preceded.
Therefore, according to that which emerges in the trace of the Intromiss, judge of that which is between it.
When, therefore, we come to treatment with iron, then it is necessary that you instruct the sick person, that he be bled if possible for him, and you see his body full.
Then he will be laid on his back on a slightly raised object, and place many cloths under him.
Then sit you on his left side, and instruct the attendant to sit on his right, who will extend his rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the navel of the belly.
Then take a wide spatula, and cut the skin of the testicles from the middle lengthwise, until near the groin; and let the incision be according to the straightness of an equidistant line which divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the white sifac that encompasses it; and scrape it and observe it, or be cautious about this, so that you cut it: and let your scraping, by which you scrape it, be from the part which hangs with the egg more; and search subtly with the scraping according to the amount that is possible for you.
Then pierce the sifac full of water with a wide perforation, and draw out all the water. Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the sifac upwards, and do not touch the skin of the testicles that encompasses it; and cut the sifac however it is possible for you to cut it, either with its entirety or in pieces, especially its slender side.
For if you do not carefully examine it, there is no security in its incision, lest the water return.
If however the egg protrudes externally from its skin during your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the sifac, pull it back.
Then bring together the two lips of the scrotal skin with sutures.
Then treat it as other wounds until it heals.
If you find a corrupted egg from another blackness, then it is necessary to tie the vessels, which are the suspensory ligaments, fearing the flow of blood.
Then cut off the testicle with the suspensory ligament, and remove the egg; afterwards treat it with what we have said.
If, however, water is collected in two parts, then know that there are two branches: therefore cut the other part in the same way as you did the other, equally.
And if it is equal to you, so that it is a single operation, then do it; then wipe away the blood.
And introduce into the incisions wool soaked in oil, or in rose oil; and place outside wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the two testicles, and the belly; and put on top doubled cloths, and they are cushions; and tie them on top with a bandage, which has six parts according to this form.
Then take two cloths, and sew them together, and fill them with dyed wool, according to this likeness; and let the edges with which it is pressed be of linen, or damp wool; and let them be gathered with a constriction at the lumbar region of the breeches; and one edge take over the anus up to the back, and the second take to the side of the pubis; and two edges over the two thighs below, and two other edges over the two groins, and let the entire constriction be gathered at the lumbar region of the breeches.
And sometimes this branch is artificially treated with a cautery at the site of the incision with iron: and it is as if you take a fine cautery knife, and cut the skin of the testicles with it; and it is heated, as we have stated; until when white, milky pus containing water is revealed; then take a cautery, according to this form.
It is similar to the Greek letter.
Then pierce it with it, and let it be heated, until all the moisture comes out.
Then spread the pus with hooks, and scrape it with a heated fine cautery, and cut it as much as possible until you remove the whole of it.
And beware, from the egg, lest the fire touch it.
And know that this operation is safer, and further from blood flow, and better than an operation with a cut.
If, however, in the hour of the incision, or in the hour of the cautery, a hot abscess, or blood flow, or anything else, presents opposition to you: then it is necessary that you treat that which opposes you from it with the treatment which is suitable for it, according to what has been stated previously.
But if the sick person is fearful, and does not expect this operation because of its horror: then administer a perforation according to what I tell of it: and that is it.
When it is certified to you by what we have said about the signs that the branch is watery, then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit on a raised seat.
Then pierce the abscess in its lower part with a wide spatula, and make the perforation along the length of the body, and let the opening be wide, until all the water runs out.
Then place a poultice over the area, and bind it, and let it run until the remaining water drains out; then treat it until the wound heals.
But if there is an obstruction to the outflow of water at the time you pierce it, and it is not due to anything but that a white bandage causes an obstruction in the wound opening and prevents the water from exiting, then you must insert a pen into the wound, or an instrument with which the water of the hydrops is extracted, whose form has been previously described, or add a little more to the wound operation.
And know that the water returns and gathers after six months, or approximately that time.
When it gathers again, then it should be pierced according to the same method, and the sick person will pass their days.
Concerning the treatment of fleshy tumors.
Chapter LXIII.
Know that in the section above this tumor, there is fear leading to harm in many dispositions.
Therefore, it seems to me that its release is to be saved from that.
And I am recalling the operation on it, and the appearance of the abscess.
Therefore, I say that many abscesses occur in the bodies from which the testicles are composed; and it happens from many causes, namely. Or from an acute or acrid superfluity, which is poured out to the testicles.
Or from a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it; and it is a serious abscess.
And perhaps it is a stony abscess, whose color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it arises from the knotting of arteries, and their swelling: as its recollection has already preceded; or from the swelling of veins.
Therefore, what is from them, from the swelling of the arteries, is recognized by the disposition of the abscess, when you press it with your fingers.
And you should not touch it completely.
But that which arises from the swelling of veins, does not disperse anything from it upon compression with the fingers. And it is possible now that a section be made upon this kind, and upon the other flesh; and it is, as if one should sever the skin of the testicles.
Then extend the egg upwards, and extract it with a white sifach; and free the suspensory from the vessels, and tie the vessels; and cut the suspensory after you have freed it from every part from the parts of the egg.
If therefore the egg is consolidated with those born flesh, then it is necessary to pull the egg, and cut it. And if there is adhesion between any of the siphaket, or in that which is between the vessels, then it is necessary to free all that adhesion, and cut it with a circular incision.
If however there is a birth of flesh in the place of adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary to cut all of it, and extract the egg, as we have said. When therefore your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool infused in rose-oil and wine; then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
Of the treatment of Ramicis, which is with Vite.
Chapter Sixty-four.
Vitis is an abscess enveloped by a certain wrapping, resembling a cluster of grapes, accompanied by softening of the testicles; and it makes movement and exercise, and walking, difficult for the infirm person.
And in the treatment of this illness there is fear, because of that which preceded it, remembered.
But it is necessary, that we speak of the operation upon it according to what the first ones did. I say therefore, that it is necessary to make the sick person sit on a raised seat.
Then, with a broad, sharp spatule, make a transverse incision directly over the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Then, scrape away from all sides, as we told you in the extraction of arteries in the temples.
Then cut it in the middle, straight across, lengthwise, and remove the material that has accumulated from corrupt, putrid moisture.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of the other wounds, in which the force generates pus, so that the vessels that nourish one testicle may fall.
For there is no harm through it.
However, if all the vessels are affected, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed with the vessels, so that the egg is not deprived of nourishment, due to the incision, and becomes wasted, or dries up, and is not beneficial with them.
On the treatment of intestinal colic. Chapter LXV.
Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
And this rupture is either from sifach, or its extension.
And these two types occur from many causes: either from a blow, or a jump, or a shout, or the lifting of a heavy object, and similar things.
And a sign, when it is from the extension of sifach.
It is that which happens gradually over a long time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess equal to the depth; because the sifach compresses the intestine.
And a sign of it, when it is from a section of sifach, because it causes a sudden, intense pain at its beginning; and the abscess is different, appearing under the skin nearby; and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and its course to the exterior of the sifach.
And sometimes it emerges with the intestine as a zirbum; and this is called a intestinal ramex, and zirbia; and sometimes it happens with windiness.
And sometimes faeces runs into the intestine and is retained there; and this is harmful to the sick person, because it causes a slight pain, and especially when it is pressed.
And in the treatment of these types of illnesses, there is a fear with iron; therefore, one must beware of injury in it.
And the method of operation is that you instruct the sick person to pull back the intestine with his own hand into the interior concavity of his body, if it yields to the withdrawal.
Then let him be placed supine on his back between your hands, and raise his legs.
Then stretch the skin which follows the skin upwards, and cut the skin of the testicles completely along its length.
Then fix hooks in the two lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them; and let the incision be according to the amount, that it is possible for the egg to emerge from it.
Then scrape away the siphak, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when the white, hard siphak is revealed on all sides; then insert your index finger into that which follows the testicle, into that which is between the white siphak, which is under the skin of the egg, and the second siphak, and loosen with it the adhesion that is on the posterior part of the egg.
Then move the skin of the testicles inwards with your right hand; and with this, pull the white siphak upwards with your left hand; and lift the egg with the siphak towards the incision; and order the attendant to pull the egg upwards; and you loosen the adhesion which is behind the complete release.
And examine with your fingers, that there is nothing there from the intestine wrapped in the hard white siphak.
If however you find something of it: then push it towards the lower abdomen.
Then take a needle with a thick thread, made of linen from ten threads; and insert it at the last siphak, that is, of the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the incision; then cut the ends which project from the thread, until there are four threads.
Then place some of them over some with a cross-shaped figure; and tie with them the alsifach, of which we spoke, because it is under the skin of the testicles with a strong ligature, until no blood vessels that nourish them can send anything to them; so that no hot abscess may occur from this.
And place another ligature again, outside the first ligature, a distance of less than two fingers from it.
And after these two ligatures, leave from the sifach, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity the size of a finger; and cut the rest completely around, and remove the egg from it.
Then cut in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, at the incision from which blood and pus runs, as we have described in what has been said before.
Then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wound; and apply the ligature that we have described.
And sometimes the white sifach that we mentioned is cauterized after its incision, fearing the flow of blood.
For this often happens.
And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
If however its falling is delayed, then it should be moistened with warm water; and place upon it that which we have mentioned, until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with the rest of the treatment for wounds, until it is healed.
Concerning the windy (or tympanic) ramia.
Chapter LXVI.
In this ramia, I have not seen anyone who dared to use iron in its treatment.
And indeed the first ones said that it happens as we have described in the ramia that is with the vine.
That is, to tie the vessels after the incision, then cut in the middle, and finally treat it with that which opens it, until the vessels fall out: and treat the wound as we said, until it is healed.
Concerning the rupture that occurs in the groin.
Chapter LXVII.
When rupture occurs in the groin, as we said, and the area protrudes, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles; and if it descends, it is little, and returns at all hours; but if time passes with it, a fissure is added to the sifach, until the intestines descend into the sifach.
And that occurs from the stretching of the sifach, which is in the groin, as we said.
Because the sifach is stretched, then the area softens, and an abscess forms, and it protrudes.
And its treatment is with a cautery, as its preceding description stated.
And sometimes it is treated with iron, according to this method: and it is that the sick person should lie on their back between your hands.
Then cut the location of the suppurated and protruding rupture, cutting across its width, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Then squeeze the alsifak and what is beneath the skin, until when the white sifach is revealed, which is beneath the skin that follows it.
Then take a radius, and place it over the protruding location of the sifach, and press it to the depth of the belly.
Then sew the two protruding locations above the extremity of the radius from the sifach, and connect one of them with the other with a suture; then pull out the extremity of the radius.
And do not cut the alsifach at all, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, as I have made you know in the treatment of intestinal twigs. Then treat it with the treatment of wounds.
When therefore you cut the filaments, cleanse it, and restore the wound, until it consolidates.
For the sisach contracts, and no protrusion of the rupture is added.
And a cautery is better in this place, because it is nearer to health.
Concerning the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Chapter LXVIII.
The skin of the testicles is often softened in some men, so that the flesh between them softens as well, and its appearance becomes disfigured.
Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is asked about its treatment, to make the sick person lie on their back, and to cut all the softened skin over the natural skin. Then he should bring together the two lips with sutures: and if he wishes, he should first suture the excess of softened skin with three or four sutures, and make the suture firm.
Then treat the remaining wounds with care until they heal and the threads fall out.
Concerning Castration.
Chapter LXIX.
Know that castration is excommunicated in our law; and because of that, I might not have mentioned it in this book of mine; and its mention is not necessary except for two reasons.
One of which is that it should be in the knowledge of a physician when questioned about it, and that he may know the treatment of one who has undergone it.
And the other reason is that we often need castration of certain animals, for our benefit through it, such as rams, boars, and cats, and similar animals.
Therefore, I say that castration is done according to two methods. Or by attrition.
Or by fissure and section.
In that which is done by attrition, the method of operation is: that we should place the animal in warm water, until its testicles soften and loosen and hang; then rub them with your hand, until they dissolve and no longer appear under touch.
In castration by fissure and section, it is necessary to hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
And this method of castration is better than that which is done by attrition, because attrition perhaps leaves some of the testicles, wherefore the animal desires intercourse.
Then treat the wound until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of a hermaphrodite, there are two methods.
Chapter 70.
A hermaphrodite is from males in two ways.
One of them is that, appearing in the space that follows, or in the skin of the testicles, in the area between the two testicles, there is a figure like a woman's vulva, with hair in it; and sometimes urine runs from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In females, however, there is one type, and it is a woman's vulva on the pubic bone, like very small male testicles protruding outwards; one of which is like a man's penis, and two like two testicles.
And the treatment of three types, two from males, and one type from females, is: because it is necessary to cut away the added flesh, until its impression disappears.
Then treat them with the treatment of the other wounds.
In the second type of males, from which urine comes forth, which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is there any treatment at all.
Concerning the incision of the labia, and protruding flesh in women's vulvas.
Chapter LXXI.
The labia may perhaps be added to the natural state, until its appearance becomes ugly and foul: and sometimes in some women it is greatly enlarged, until it expands like in men, and reaches the point of intercourse.
Therefore, you must grasp the excess of the labia with your hand, or with a hook, and make an incision: and do not make the incision too deep, particularly into the root: so that a flow of blood does not occur.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds, until it is healed.
However, the flesh that arises is flesh that is born in the orifice of the womb, until it fills it: and perhaps it emerges to the exterior, resembling a tail: and on account of this some first name the ailment a tailed disease.
Therefore, it is necessary to incise it as we incise the labia, and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the treatment of Alratica, which is the unperforated vulva of a woman.
Chapter LXXII.
Alratica is, as it were, the unperforated vulva of a woman, or one with a small opening.
And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is it from illness that has preceded: and indeed it is made either from added flesh grown, or by a subtle, or thick sifach: and it is made either in the deep of the womb, or on its sides, or above it, or below it: and it prevents intercourse and impregnation, and childbirth, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
And its knowledge is made by the obstetrician's observation, if there is an apparent nearby obstruction.
If however it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with a rod.
If however the obstruction is from a subtle sifach, and is near the two lips: then hurry, and break it apart.
And it is, that you place cushions on the two lips.
Then place your index fingers of both hands together, and let the woman be on her back with her legs outstretched.
Then extend the two lips with strength, until the subtle sifach is broken, and the obstruction is opened.
Then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the place: and let the woman apply it every day, so that the place is not solidified again.
If however the sifach is thick, dense: then it is necessary that you cut it with a spatula broad similar to a myrtle leaf.
If however the obstruction is born from flesh, then suspend it with hooks, and cut it: and let there be with you medicines that stop the flow of blood without causing harm, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense mixed with the white of an egg.
Then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not heal quickly, hold it for a few days: and administer a bandage of dry linen, then treat with the remaining treatment, until it is healed.
And sometimes a birth of other flesh occurs in the womb: it is therefore necessary that they be cut in this way: as long as it is not a cancerous abscess; for a cancerous abscess that is in the womb, do not use any opposition with iron at all.
Concerning the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and Bothor, a red inflammation in women's vulvas.
Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorrhoids indeed are an opening of the veins' orifices, until much blood flows from them constantly.
Therefore, when hemorrhoids become chronic, they become thelil: and I have already stated in the division of their kinds and their signs: and I shall say here which of them receive a cure, and which do not.
I say therefore, that hemorrhoids which are in the orifice of the womb, and do not appear to the senses, then there is no cure with iron for them.
However, those of them that are in the orifice of the womb, over which the senses fall, are those that are cured.
Therefore, it is necessary that you introduce the woman into a cool house.
Then, extend the thelil with scissors, or with a rough cloth, and cut them from their roots.
Then, sprinkle over them, at the flow of blood, from one of the powdered incisions without mordication, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar things to them.
Then let him propel her feet against the wall for one hour.
Then place her in cold water.
If the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumach, and the bark of pomegranates, and gallnuts, and similar things.
Then take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on her back.
If, therefore, the blood is cut off with it, it is good; and if not, make cupping adhere to the back and armpits, without incision.
Then take wool and immerse it in the juice of tarathit, or the juice of arnoglossa, or the juice of alaulat branches, that is, aglanter, or Pontic wine, and make it adhere to the place.
When the abscess therefore subsides, then treat the place with ointments until it is healed.
Albarth, however, is red, similar to the heads of alhaasse, and is of harsh appearance.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut away what appears from it, according to what I have said about the thelil equally: and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the perforation of the outlet that occurs in the womb.
Chapter LXXIV.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, and stony abscess, and ulcers, and adubelati, and alekilati, that is, herpes, boils, and fistulas, and hemorrhoids, and cracks, and thelil, and a hot abscess.
And I have indeed already described all these diseases and their types, and their signs, and their cures in the divisions: it is necessary that I say in this treatise about the hot abscess that occurs in the womb, when it is from the abscesses which collect pus, and you wish to know how its opening is made with an iron.
Therefore, it is necessary to consider.
Then if the pain of the abscess in its beginning is sharp with its striking, and burning, and fever: and you see it red: if the touch falls upon it, then do not rush with its perforation: and treat it with that which is helpful for maturation, until when the sharpness of the afflictions subsides.
Then it is necessary that you have the woman sit on a seat that inclines with two cushions, or lean on her back, and draw her feet to the lower part of her abdomen: and let her thighs be spread, and let her place her arms under her knees, and bind each with a suitable bandage to it.
Then let the midwife sit on the right side, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is opened.
Whose form comes in those that are after.
And it is necessary when you wish to administer this instrument, that you fix it with the rod deep within the woman's womb, so that what enters from the instrument be no more than the depth of the womb, and injure the infant.
However, if the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary that you place cushions over the lining of the womb's depth, so that the full entry of the instrument into the womb's depth is prevented; and it is necessary that it place the wheel, which runs on the instrument, from the upper side; and so that the attendant holds the instrument and turns the wheel until the womb's depth is opened.
When therefore the exit appears, and is touched by the hand, and is soft and supple, then it is necessary to separate it at its head with a wide spatula.
When therefore the pus is evacuated, then it is necessary to place on the wound a lint soaked in rose oil, or green oil, in which there is some astringency; and place the lint, and extract the section within the womb's depth.
And place externally on the womb, and on the pubic area, clean wool soaked in water in which mulberries have been boiled.
Then treat it after two days with an ointment suitable for it, until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and wound are washed, so that it is cleansed with water and honey; then with water in which the root of lily or long aristolochia has been boiled; then return to the ointment.
If the wound is hidden inside the womb, then it is necessary that you refrain from treating it with iron, rather treat it with what we have said in the division.
Instructions for Midwives, how to treat living embryos which have emerged in a non-natural form.
Chapter 70.
It is necessary for the midwife to know first the form of a natural birth.
Therefore, among its signs is this: when you see a woman pressing downwards, and she desires to smell the air, and is relieved of that which is upon her regarding birth, and the exit of the embryo is hastened: then know that this birth is according to the natural form, and its exit is over her head, and the afterbirth with it: either suspended, or hanging from the navel. Therefore, when you see these signs, then it is necessary that her belly be pressed, so that the embryo descends quickly.
However, that which is beyond this birth is unnatural, blameworthy.
For sometimes the fetus emerges over its feet, and its body emerges before its head, and its feet and hands together, or one of its feet: or its head and one of its hands emerges: or the abdomen emerges: and perhaps it turns on its neck, and similar figures from blameworthy forms.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be prudent, subtle in all these matters, and to guard herself from error and deception; and I am showing every form among them, and how the disposition is in it, and what is signified by it, and how to act upon it.
When the fetus emerges over its head in its natural expulsion, and it is difficult for the woman, and the labor is difficult for her, and you see her strength already weakened: then have her sit on a seat, or have women hold her; and bathe her vulva with decocted fenugreek and with moist oils.
Then let the midwife insert a small spatula between her fingers, and split the afterbirth with it, and cut it with her fingernail until that which is in it from moisture runs out; and press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then it is necessary for the woman to be administered an enema of fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Then command her, after the enema, to be compressed; and make her sneeze with a spice, and hold her mouth and nose for one hour.
For the fetus will emerge immediately.
If two hands of the fetus emerge first, you should gently and gradually draw them back.
If, however, it does not yield in entering, then place the woman on a seat, and raise her feet upward; then shake the seat on the ground; and let the woman be held so that she does not fall during the shaking.
If, therefore, the hands do not emerge, and the fetus dies, then cut them, and extract the remaining fetus; and tie its hand with cloth, and extract it with equanimity; for it will emerge.
The exit of the embryo is above its feet.
When the fetus emerges above its feet, then it is necessary to push them upward; then turn the fetus gradually; afterward, straighten it.
Then take one of its feet and extend it gradually.
When, therefore, they emerge up to the hips, then command him to compress it, and make it sneeze with the application of medicine; for it will emerge, if God wills.
And if it does not emerge with what we have described, then return the fetus gradually until you place it in its natural position.
For it will then emerge with easy exit.
If it is prevented by all that we have described, then take from marshmallow mucilage, and sesame oil, and dissolved gum; and pound the whole in a mortar with a good pounding; then line with it the woman's vulva and the lower part of her abdomen.
Then have her sit in warm water until she reaches the hypochondria.
When you therefore see that her lower parts are now warmed, then make for her a poultice of myrrh and apply it.
When therefore the poultice has held for one hour, then have her sit on a seat.
Then have her sneeze; and bind her mouth and nose; and press the lower part of her abdomen with gentle pressure.
For the pus will come out immediately.
The exit of the fetus is upon the knees and hands.
When it emerges in this manner, then gently insert her hands.
Then the woman will be placed on her back, and her feet will hang down; and she will lie on the bed, and fold her hands.
Then press gently on her abdomen.
Then pull out what is under her feet from the cushions until it is prepared in the lower part.
If the fetus does not emerge, then take her feet and move them with a vigorous motion.
Then press gently on what is above the hypochondria until the fetus rises upwards.
Then let her insert her hands, and gently straighten the fetus; and instruct the woman to compress herself until the fetus emerges.
The exit of the fetus hangs lengthwise from the hands.
Let his hand be skillfully applied to the reduction.
If however he cannot reduce it, then raise the woman and make her walk.
If indeed she cannot walk, then make her lie on a bed, and shake her legs with a violent shaking.
Then administer the liniment which you have prepared from mucilages.
If she receives it through childbirth, then make her sit upon a seat.
Then strive in the reduction of the hand, and adjust the foetus according to its natural form; and make the woman sneeze, and order her to compress herself until it emerges.
The exit of the foetus is over her neck, with outstretched hands, and its face is toward the back of its mother.
The midwife should hold the foetus's hand, then slowly turn it over, and adjust it with ease.
When it is adjusted, then place upon its vulva what we have narrated of oil and mucilaginous substances.
Then order her to move slowly.
When you have done that, then make her sit upon a seat, and order her to lean to her right side.
Then order her to press; and make her sneeze with a seasoning.
The exit of the prepared fetus on the side.
When it descends to the orifice of the womb in this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your fingernail until it is evacuated from the moisture.
If therefore it hangs over the face of the fetus, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it is not retained, and dies.
Then push the fetus inward, until you place it as it ought to be; and order the woman to compress herself several times; for it will exit by an easy exit.
The exit of twins, or many fetuses.
Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three and four are born.
However, that is unusual, and rarely occurs.
Five, however, is unnatural, and they do not entirely survive; and although they multiply, they are contained by one afterbirth; and they are separated by a sort of membrane, distinguishing them, bound to the navel of each of them.
And sometimes they emerge just as a single fetus emerges through a natural, easy exit, and they emerge in a way that is not to be praised, as we have narrated. If some of them are difficult at birth, and reach the unnatural figures we mentioned, then treat them as we have described. Let the midwife be skillful, and do what she does with ease and caution, and devise a way that corresponds to every shape, with what is prepared for her by a skilled guide towards salvation.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten are formed in the womb.  And it has been verified by me that a woman expelled seven and another fifteen, all formed, through miscarriage.
That which occurred through the measurement of the glorious sage.
Therefore, all of this must be within the knowledge of the midwife. For perhaps something similar will come to her; therefore, let her oppose it with what is necessary.
Concerning the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you treat a dead fetus with what I have said about medicine, and it does not emerge, and you are compelled to use an operation with your hand, then it is necessary to consider.
If then the woman is of sound strength, and is not with any of the accidents from which harm is feared for her: then it is necessary that the woman be laid on her back upon the bed, and her head be inclined downwards, and her legs raised; and let the attendant hold her on both sides, or let her be bound to the bed, so that her body is not pulled during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the mouth of the womb with humid oils with the mucilage of marshmallow, and fenugreek, and linseed. Then let the midwife anoint her hand with these oils and mucilages; then let her introduce it into the womb with ease.
Then let her seek with it the place where to fix the hooks from the fetus, and the suitable places for it.
Therefore, consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend on its head: then fix the hooks into its eyes, or its neck, or its mouth, or its palate, or under its chin, or in its fork, or in the nearby ribs, and under the hypochondria.
If, however, the descent is upon its feet, then in its pubic bone and its middle ribs.
And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand; and place its curve in that which is between the fingers of the left hand; and introduce it with the hand with ease, and fix the hook in any of those places which we have said, until it reaches the empty space.
Then let it be extended with equal extension, and let the extension not only be straight, but rather move in every direction, so that its exit is eased; as is done with a tooth during its extraction.
And it is necessary in that which is between them, that the extension be softened.
If a part is retained from it, then the midwife ought to anoint some fingers with oil, and introduce them from the side, so that she may revolve with them that which is retained.
If therefore a part of the fetus emerges, then let the hooks be changed to a higher place; do this until the entire fetus emerges.
If, therefore, a hand emerges before other parts, and it is not possible to return it, due to its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it.
Then pull it out until, when the entire hand emerges, cut it either at the ankle joint, or at the elbow: and thus it is necessary that you should do in the other hand, and in the two feet.
If, however, the fetus's head is large, or constriction occurs in its exit, or water is collected in its head, then it is necessary that the midwife insert prickly Spatumile between the fingers, and split the head with it, and remove the water; or break it with the instrument called Almisdac, whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which is after this.
Similarly, let him do this if the fetus is of a large head by nature, then it is necessary that he cut it with an algengematu or remove it with a misdach, as we said.
Then pull the bones with forceps.
If the head emerges and is constricted at the fork, then it should be split until the moisture that is in the chest is discharged.
If, however, it does not become entangled, nor yields to exit, then cut the head into fragments, as far as possible for you.
If the lower part of the belly is ulcerated or contains dropsy, then it is necessary that you pierce it, until moisture flows from it.
If the fetus is on its feet, then its extraction is easy, and its direction towards the mouth of the womb is gentle.
If, however, it is constricted at the belly or chest, then it is necessary that you extract it with a cloth which you have wrapped around your hand, and split the belly or chest until that which is within them flows out.
If the other limbs are removed, and the head returns, then let the midwife insert her left hand. If therefore the mouth of the womb is open, then let her insert her hand deep into the womb, and seek out the head with it, and pull it with her fingers until it reaches the mouth of the womb; then let her insert into it one hook, or two hooks, and pull it with it.
If, however, the mouth of the womb is constricted, due to a hot abscess that occurs in it, then it is not necessary to labor over it, but rather it is necessary then to administer the outflow of moist, greasy things, and to administer plasters; and she should sit in waters that soften and moisten.
If the fetus is on its side, then it is possible to equalize it; then let that which we said about a living fetus be administered.
If this is not possible, then it should be cut into pieces and extracted.
And it is necessary that you not leave anything of the afterbirth inside at all.
When, therefore, you have completed your operation, then administer that which we said about hot abscesses that occur in wombs.
If a flow of blood occurs, then it should descend into astringent waters, and administer the rest of the treatment.
And indeed I have already seen a woman, in whose womb a dead fetus was: then she became pregnant again over it, afterwards another fetus died as well.
Therefore, a long time later, an abscess occurred in her navel, and it became swollen, until it opened: and it began to emit pus.
Therefore, I was called to treat her, and I medicated her for a long time: and the wound was not healed.
Therefore, I placed upon it some plasters of strong attraction: and the bone came out of the place.
Then several days passed, and another bone came out.
Therefore, I was surprised by this, since there is no bone in the belly.
Therefore, I thought that they were from the bones of a dead fetus.
Therefore, I investigated the wound, and extracted many bones, the woman being in her best condition: and she lived thus for a long time, and emitted little pus from the place.
And I have not confirmed this as extraneous, unless because there is knowledge and help in it, for the artificer physician to administer it with a hand from healing.
Concerning the forms of necessary instruments in the extraction of a fetus.
Chapter LXXVII.
Here below is the form of the Strictorium, by which books are made equal, to which are equally two hinges at the two extremities of two pieces of wood.
However, this hinge must be finer than the strictorium: and to be made, either of ebony or of boxwood.
And the width of each piece of wood is about two fingers; and the edge of each of the two is about one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half; and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two additions of the same kind of wood, which are already fastened to both, whose length is half a palm and a little more; and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix, so that it opens with them when you turn the two hinges.
The form of the hinge by which the matrix is opened.
Another form, similar to that, finer, and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony wood, or boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
However, at its extremity let there be two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each of these additions is about a palm: and the breadth of each is two fingers.
When therefore you wish to open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging down, the part between her thighs open.
Then introduce these two joined additions into the womb: and you are holding the lower end of the instrument between her thighs.
Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount of opening of the womb's mouth, until the midwife does what she wants.
Another form of Vertigo, as the ancients called it, the form of the Impeller by which the fetus is propelled.
The Almisdac form, with which the small head is crushed. The form of a hook with a single spine.
The form of a hook with two spines.
The form of forceps with saw teeth, with which the fetus' head is crushed.
The form of a spatula with two ends for severing the head.
The form of two spatulas, also broad.
All these instruments are used, and the more their varieties are multiplied, and prepared by the craftsman, the more swift his operation, and the higher his reputation among men, because of their quantity.
Therefore, do not despise any instrument, so that it may be prepared for you.
For their necessity is inexcusable.
Concerning the extraction of the Secundina.
Chapter LXXVIII.
When the Secundina is retained at childbirth, then it is necessary that you instruct the woman to hold her breath.
Then make her sneeze with condiments; and press your hand upon her mouth and nostrils.
If therefore it emerges by this means, it is good.
If not, then take a pot and pierce a hole in the lid; and place in it herbs that open the mother's mouth, such as calamint, rue, dill, chamomile, sese, cinnamon wood, and centaury; take all these herbs, or some of them, and immerse them in water, and place them on the fire.
Then place a reed plug over the hole in the pot's lid, and the other end in the woman's womb; and let her hold it until the vapor reaches the concavity of the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we have said.
For the afterbirth will emerge with ease.
If, however, it remains after this treatment, and does not emerge, then instruct the midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil, or marsh-mallow mucilage. Then let her introduce it into the vagina, and search for the afterbirth with it.
When therefore she finds it, then let her take it, and gently extend it.
If, however, it is attached deep within the womb, then let her introduce her hand, as we have described, until, when she finds the afterbirth, she extracts it gently in a straight line, so that the womb does not fall with a violent pull; rather, it must be moved easily to the right and left sides, then the amount of pulling should be increased.
For then it yields, and is preserved, and escapes from adhesion.
If the opening of the womb is constricted, as we have already described: treat it with sneezing and with a decoction of herbs from a pot.
If, however, it does not emerge with all that we have described, then beware of tiring yourself out repeatedly pulling at it.
But it is necessary that whatever emerges from the womb at the opening be tied to the woman's hip.
Then administer an enema with the four-drug ointment.
For this will cause it to putrefy after days, and it will dissolve and emerge.
However, when it putrefies, a foul odor rises from it to the stomach and head, and harms the weak.
Therefore, suitable fumigations should be administered to it.
Some of the ancients have already experienced fumigation with nasturtium and dried figs.
Form of the instrument by which a woman is fumigated during retention of the Secundinae and menses.
Let it be made of glass similar to alembic, or of earthenware: and let the wide end be placed over the fire: and let the fumigation be placed over the pruns: let her hold it, until that fumigation is consumed: and again another.
On the treatment of the unperforated anus.
Chapter LXXIX.
Many children are born with their anuses unperforated, which have already been obstructed by a fine sifac.
Therefore, the midwife ought to pierce that sifac with her finger: and if not, she ought to pierce it with a sharp spatula: and let her be careful not to touch it with her arm.
Then place on it wool steeped in wine and oil.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If you fear that it will be obstructed, then place a lead cannula in the opening for many days, and it will be removed when the child wishes to pass stool.
And blockage of the anus also occurs from the consolidation of a wound, or an abscess.
Therefore, that consolidation must be cut, then treated with what we said about treatment and lead. Concerning the treatment of Fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Chapter Eighty.
Fistulas that occur in the lower part are a knotting and a thickening that occur near the anus externally, or in the space of one part; and it is one fistula, or several.
When that knotting becomes old, it opens, and watery white moisture, or thin pus, runs from it.
And sometimes there are penetrating ones from these fistulas.
And some of them, when they are penetrating in the space, extend to the bladder and to the urethra.
And some of them penetrate up to the hip joint and up to the tailbone.
By this one can recognize a fistula penetrating to the anus, even from one that does not penetrate, is, that you introduce your index finger into the anus; and introduce a slender thread into the fistula through air, or iron, when there is no twisting.
If there is twisting in it, then introduce a thin lead thread into it, or a strand from horsehair, until you feel the thread or hair in your finger.
If you do not feel it completely, nor does anything exit from the opening in terms of excretion, nor wind, nor a worm as I said: then know that it is not penetrating: therefore hurry to the treatment.
And when the fistula penetrates to the bladder, or to the urinary meatus: then its indication is the outflow of urine from it, and prevention of it from this so that the place is consolidated with medicines.
However, if it is penetrating to the hip joint, or to the hip bone: then its sign is that the thread reaches there, if there is no twisting in it to the bone; and the finding of pain in the surrounding area, and that pus emerges from it always; and that the treatment is not effective in it, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure at all; and their treatment is labour and vanity for him, from foolish physicians, upon whom it is formed. However, in that which is not penetrating, and is not old, healing is hoped for with a saw: according to what I tell you, and I have already proven; and it is that the sick person lies between your hands on their back; and elevate their legs above their hips, and their hips should be inclined toward their stomach.
Then introduce a lead or copper thread, if there is twisting in the fistula, until you know where the thread reaches.
If, however, the patient feels it near the anus, then you must insert your index finger into the anus.
If, therefore, you feel the probe through itself detected in your finger, beyond what you feel between your finger and the fistula, or flesh, then you know for certain that it is penetrating; therefore you do not work on it, because there is no cure for it, as we said.
However, they say that in some men the flesh is healed, and from the medication by which they hope for help, it is that you cauterize a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as before, and introduce it, hot, into the fistula, until it reaches the vicinity of the anus.
Then do this twice or thrice, until you know that all those added, filtered flesh which are similar to the hollow quill of a bird are now burned.
Then treat it with lint wrapped in butter, until those burned flesh parts emerge; then treat it with ointments that generate flesh and consolidate it.
If, therefore, it is healed, it is good.
And if not, then it will never be healed with any other treatment.
And if the probe emerges, and does not reach your finger in the anus, and there is a thick layer of flesh between it and the probe, or if such a thing is: and you see a fistula in that which follows the skin's surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you proceed cutting with the probe that is in the fistula, until the cut reaches where the probe's end reaches, and the probe is released and falls out.
Then cleanse those filtered flesh parts, which resemble the hollow of a bird's feather, so that nothing remains of them.
However, if blood overcomes you, and separates you from your operation as you cut those flesh parts: then it is better and quicker to help, to cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
Because cautery with fire aggregates good qualities, burning those added flesh parts, and cutting off the blood, and drying the moistures.
Then treat it with cloths dipped in butter, or crushed herbs, until the place discharges pus, and those burned flesh parts emerge in the pus.
Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments, which produce hard flesh: and there are medicines in which there are astringency and drying.
For when it is restored, then it is already healed: and you do not fear a recurrence. If however the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus, and extends from the superfluity of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and investigate with it.
If therefore you feel a tightness, and between you and it is a covering of sifted material or flesh, and it is close to penetration: then there is no operation on it, except according to the way of trust and hope.
For this is because one of three methods is administered in it: either to cauterize it, as we said; or to dissect it, until you reach its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert lint, and a cure from close by.
And do not proceed too much with the incision, lest you strike the ligament containing the anus, and misfortune befall the patient's bowel movements without will. Then treat it with what we said. Perhaps it will be healed; or you will draw back the covering, and cleanse it after you have cut it back close to the anus, as we said, either with probes or with another instrument with a sharp end.
Then cleanse those filtered flesh which are in the incision, up to where you can with examination.
Then attempt the restoration of the entire wound with the incision, and the upper opening where it consolidates; and a fistula remains open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be easier on the patient.
And sometimes the fistula is sutured in this manner: and it is, when you insert a probe into the fistula; and it is on the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the skin and edge of the anus; then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like a needle of aleskef, that is, of those preparing leather, according to this form.
And insert into it a thread wrapped with five threads, and approximately that.
Then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches the concavity of it.
If therefore it penetrates the inner edge of the anus nearby, then pull the thread out of that opening; so that you insert your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together; and tighten each, and leave it for one or two days; and the more the thread enters the flesh, tighten it well, until those flesh that are between the two ends of the thread are cut and fall away; then treat the wound until it consolidates and heals.
For you do not have the ability to do that for the sake of the muscle, so as not to injure it.
Then do with it as we have said, until it heals.
A sharp, pointed spatula with which the fistula is split, whose curvature is very sharp, and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not injure that which is not necessary, as you see.
Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision, and the treatment of fissures.
Chapter Eighty-One.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds.
For they are either within the anus, like the bladders of coals or plums, or like grapes themselves.
And of them are small and large: and blood flows from them always, and there is one, and there are many.
And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those which are outside the anus, are for the most part few, moist, from which yellow water or a little blood runs with constant flow: and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is within the anus is, that you instruct the sick person to press: and it is to be expressed, until it issues from the anus, and appear clear to you.
Therefore also suspend them with hooks, or hold them with your fingernail.
Then cut them at their roots.
However, if the hooks are not retained in them, due to their moisture and their softening, then take them with a rough cloth, or with cotton from doubled wool, and pull them out with your fingers.
Then cut them, and after the incision, sprinkle some hot powders over them, so that they act as a cautery.
Or cauterize them according to what preceded in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat them with the remaining treatment, until they heal.
If the anus does not yield to the evacuation, then administer an enema to the sick person containing a small amount of mordicant, so that it may wash out what is in the anus, and yield to the evacuation quickly when the sick person expels it.
If, however, the piles are external to the anus, then their removal is easy and simple:  you may grasp them with your fingernail or forceps and excise them.
Then treat them with what we have said, until they heal.
And whoever recoils from incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer their suture in this manner.
Take a wrapped thread, and insert it into the needle.
Then pull the piles upwards, and make it penetrate with the needle into its root on the other side: and wrap the two ends of the thread, at the lower part of the needle, and let them be laterally: and tighten the piles with a strong ligature.
Then tie the thread, and remove the needle.
Do that with all the piles, and leave one out of them: nor let it be such, that blood flows from it.
Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil, or cera, over the anus, and place it over the anus: and instruct the sick person to rest.
Then leave it until it falls.
When therefore the piles fall, treat them with ointments and other treatment, until they are healed.
Concerning the treatment of Fissures.
For they often occur from the drying up of feces and the constriction of nature.
When therefore they are old and medicine is of no avail for them, then it is necessary to scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your fingernail, until they become moist, and the upper bark which prevents their consolidation is removed.
Then treat them until they are consolidated as they should be.
However, if they do not consolidate, then scrape them again with a more forceful instrument than the first, until they bleed much, and are then scaled; subsequently treat them until they heal.
Concerning the treatment of inverted and non-inverted Almirmar, and of dry Athelil and Formicae.
Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it according to what has been described in its chapter.
From dry athelil, one is a small, rough, filtered, round eminence on the surface of the body.
And they frequently occur in the hands of children.
And its treatment is, to stretch the athelil, and cut it; or to bind it with silk thread; or with a needle, until it falls off.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what was previously stated with fire, or with a sharp medicine; and now inverted athelil are eradicated, and not inverted with the instrument which I shall name. A formica is also a small, filtered, thick eminence on the surface of the body, going deep into it very much; and when cold encounters it, a sensation similar to an ant's bite is felt in it, and it spreads throughout the body; and most of it occurs in the hands.
And its treatment is, to take a cannula from a goose feather, or a strong vulture's feather; and place that cannula over the Formica, until the circle of the cannula encloses its parts.
Then turn your hand with the cannula, until you sever that which is around the Formica; and place it deep within the flesh, and eradicate the Formica from its root. And if you wish, do it with a cannula of air, or iron, according to this form.
Let the upper part of the cannula be raised to draw the deaf wrapping, so that the grasping and turning of it and itself may be alleviated above the finger.
And if you wish, cauterize the Formica according to what was stated previously in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cautery.
Of the forms of instruments that are administered for clysters in diseases of the anus, and evacuation of the bowels, and colic.
Chapter LXXXIII.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver, or of brass, or of cast bronze, or of hammered bronze.
And sometimes it is made from these instruments small, and large, according to those in which they are administered.
Therefore, that which is administered in the treatment of young children should be small; and those whose anuses are weak or painful, likewise their clysters.
Large clyster.
Small clyster.
Its tube, that is, the upper head in which the uterus is tied, should be wide according to this measure; and it should have a distinction so that the uterus is tied as you see, and its lower end which is introduced into the anus should be blunt, that is, not open, smooth, very much, drawn to subtlety; and on one side of it there should be two openings, and on the other side one opening.
And the size of the opening should be according to the thickness of the rays, and a little thicker; and let the uterus into which the medicines are placed be from the bladder of an animal, or from the parchment of an egg, which should be according to the form of a small asofrat; whose root should be one palm.
When therefore the uterus is placed in it, it should be tightened at the head of the enema between two distinguishing constrictions with strong force.
Then irrigate with it.
And this is the form of the uterus depicted here, and the holes. However, the quality of irrigating with it is: that you fill the bladder or pouch with medicine that is warmed according to the patient's tolerance, and be careful that it is not excessively hot or cold.
Then the patient should lie on their back, and elevate their legs upwards, and place beneath them a *inthaan*, that is, a skin upon which people lie, or a linen cloth.
Then anoint the end of the clyster with oil, or with the white of an egg, or with the mucilage of fenugreek, or similar things.
Then introduce it into the anus with ease.
Then let the attendant take the pouch with both hands together, and squeeze it forcefully, until all that is in the clyster is evacuated into the intestines. Then withdraw the clyster, and let the patient raise their legs towards the wall. If the medicine compels him towards an end, then let him hold on as long as he can.
And if he sleeps with it all night, it is more beneficial in its aid.
If, however, you administer a clyster in diseases of the abdominal looseness, and his death is hastened, then administer the clyster again, until he is healed.
If there are hemorrhoids or damaging abscesses in the anus, then let the clyster be very fine, gentle, from the clysters with which children are given clysters.
And this be the form of a fine clyster above which shall be tight skin.
Concerning the treatment of head wounds without fracture of the bone.
Chapter LXXXIV.
I have already spoken in the division of the treatment of wounds that it was fitting for this book, and I shall say here about their treatment with the hand, and with medicines according to their completion.
I say therefore, that wounds are diversified according to that by which wounds are made, and according to the place upon which the wound falls.
The things by which wounds are made are often, as a stone's throw; or the incision of a sword or knife; or a blow with a spear, or wood, or an arrow; and by similar things from many things.
And the wounds that occur according to the places of the body are, such as a wound that falls upon the head, or the neck, or the breast, or the belly, or the liver; and similar ones from those limbs.
And I am narrating the treatments of some wounds, so as to set forth that reasoning and rule over the remaining wounds.
And I shall begin with simple wounds of the head, because the recollection of composite wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
I say therefore.
When a simple wound occurs on the head, and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it is from the throwing of a stone, or similar things, and it has only broken the skin: and is a large wound, and you fear a bad outcome of a hot abscess: then hurry, and immediately perform a cephalic phlebotomy; and do not delay it; and draw from its blood according to the quantity of its strength; if nothing is preventing it from phlebotomy, especially if the blood issuing from the wound is scant.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the patient beware of repletion, and wine, and heavy foods.
If, however, something prohibits lessening, then lessen from food, and let him not approach meats, nor wines.
And if a hot abscess happens to him, place on the wound a poultice infused in rose oil alone, or with wine in which there is astringency.
If, however, you are certain about a hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its own blood, and the air has not changed it, the powder that I will describe shortly; and if the air has already changed it, then apply some ointments to it until it is healed.
If, however, the wound is large, or from a sword cut, and similar things: and its edges do not come together with bandages, then bring them together with sutures, according to what I will describe in wounds of the belly concerning their sutures.
If, however, the wound is already exposed by bone, and hangs, and its retention is only in a small suspender: then cut it.
Then treat the wound with medicines, and restore the hard flesh in it in place of skin, and prescribe to the sick person that he be nourished with foods in which there is thickness, such as heads [of animals] and cooked wheat, until it is like porridge, and similar things.
If you find putrefaction in the skin, and it does not adhere to the bone, then cut away the entire putrefied part and cast it off; then treat it.
If, however, in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows: and it is not stopped by medicines, then investigate the artery.
If therefore you find it not severed, then sever it with a Spatumili, or tie it.
If necessity demands when that which we have said is not helpful, then cauterize it until the blood is stopped.
Method of the flesh-healing powder.
Take one part of frankincense, two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of quicklime: grind all thoroughly, and sift it: and fill the wound with it, and bind it with a good bandage, until it adheres well to it and coagulates with the blood.
Then bind it over with bandages, and leave it, and do not loosen it while it remains, so that it does not fester.
For the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until they are healed.
Concerning wounds of the Neck.
Chapter LXXXV.
However, if a wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in its treatment from a simple wound of the head.
If, however, a nerve of the neck or artery has already been cut: then, if it is a nerve, there is no cure for it, except to avoid treatment that causes extreme astringency, such as ziniar, and zegi, and similar things.
Because they harm the nerves and constrict them.
And do not place anything cold on the wound at all, because the substance of nerves is cold, and its connection is with the brain, which is higher than the limbs: and let that by which it is cured be mild in medicines, such as lime washed with sweet water sometimes infused with oil, or with rose oil, and tutty, when it is also washed with sweet water: and the other mineral stones, in this manner, and moist ointments.
If, however, the wound is large, then apply sutures: or constrict its lips with bandages.
Then treat it until it is healed.
If however the wound has depth, or a sinus occurs within it at its lower part, in which pus already gathers, then pierce it in the more depressed place within it.
If, however, an artery has already been incised in the wound, and its blood flow has ensued: then separate, or cut it, and tie it: or cauterize it, if necessity prompts it.
If, however, the larynx's cartilage has already been cut, or all of it, and the other parts have been saved: then bring together the skin's edges with sutures over the larynx's cartilage, and do not touch the larynx itself, rather, straighten it and return it to its natural shape.
Then bind it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for a few days.
Then treat it with ointments that possess astringency and drying properties, until it is healed.
If, however, the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then investigate it; then if there are fragments of bone within, remove all of them, or as many as you can: and that which cannot be removed, leave it, until the wound becomes suppurated, and the discharge from it is separated and lessened.
If the wound is recent, then sprinkle the powder I mentioned upon it.
If, however, a bone is seen in the wound, and it becomes a fistula, then treat it with that which is recalled in its chapter.
Chapter LXXXVI.
If, therefore, wind escapes from the wound when the sick person breathes heavily from it, then know that the wound is mortal.
If it does not have depth, and is fresh with its own blood, then do not put powder on it from the first hour, nor bind it, so that the blood is not retained in its depth, and returns to the heart, and kills the sick person: but put attracting ointment on it, and loosen it twice a day.
If, however, ointment is not present for you, then place an old cloth in the wound's opening, so that it sucks what escapes from it, from the humidities; and make the sick person sleep upon the wound, so that what is gathered in it may run.
If, however, three days or more have passed since the wound, and no spasm occurs to the sick person, nor bad tremor of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and you see the other conditions of him good, then know that the wound is safe.
Therefore treat him with bandages and the other treatment, until he is healed.
If, however, his healing is excused, and it continually opens, then know that a fistula has already formed.
Therefore treat it according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from the cut of a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the chest or back, then treat it with what has preceded concerning sutures, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
If, however, it has already made an impression on the bone, and cut off fragments from it: then investigate the wound, and hasten to extract those fragments, if they are separate.
If however they are not separate, then leave them until the wound putrefies, for the extraction of them will be eased.
However, for the treatment of other accidental wounds in the other limbs, the judgment is that which we have stated.
Concerning wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestines, and their exit.
Chapter LXXXVII.
A rupture that occurs in the belly is great, and medium, and small.
From the great one, therefore, sometimes the intestine, or a number of intestines, emerges.
Therefore, why does their intromission occur, and their suturing more vehement and more difficult?
And a small rupture also becomes difficult in another way.
Therefore it follows, that their reduction is more difficult, if you do not hasten their intromission to their place immediately: because it is inflated, opened, and thickened: wherefore its entrance becomes difficult.
Therefore, a middle rupture is better, because when it occurs, the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in these two kinds.
Know that the suturing of the belly is according to four ways.
Two common sutures agree in the suturing of the belly, and in the suturing of the other wounds of the body: and two other sutures properly agree with the other wounds.
However, they are more proper with the suturing of the belly: and I tell you each one with explanation and declaration. Therefore, I say that when the wound is small, and something from the intestine comes out of it, and it becomes difficult to reduce it, then that is because of one of two ways.
Either because of the smallness of the disruption, as we said: or because there is an inflation in the intestine from the cold of the air.
When therefore that is so, then it is necessary to warm it, so that you submerge a sponge, or a damp cloth, in lukewarm water alone.
Or boil it in water with squinants, and cyperus, and spike, and embrocate the intestine with it, until the inflation is resolved.
Sometimes wine in which there is astringency does it; and it is better than water alone in the resolution of the inflation.
When therefore you see the inflation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow, or mallow, has been boiled.
For by it the entrance of it is eased with a small thing.
If however its return is excused after this treatment, then make a small incision in the disruption, with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut.
And the first treatment is better when it is prepared than the incision; and no compulsion is made to incise after necessity and the instrument's failure.
Let one part of it be twisted and sharp, and the other part not sharp, and the subtle extremity not be with the subtlety of a spatula, rather be somewhat duller: and that is what resembles a caia, as you see.
Therefore, when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine enters, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form in its own proper place, if possible over it, since it is better.
When, however, the disruption is wide in the lower part of the abdomen, then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head.
And if it is in the upper part of the abdomen, then place his head and chest higher than his lower parts.
And similarly, if the disruption is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then place your intention and your consideration always in this, that the part in which the wound is be higher than the other part.
And thus it is necessary to administer that in large wounds, and in medium wounds.
In small wounds, however, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Then cause to be present between your hands a pious minister, who shall hold the entire disruption with his hand: and bring together its lips.
Then uncover from it to him who follows the suture something after something: and this is the method of a single common suture.
And it is, that you take a needle, or a number of needles according to the quantity of the wound's breadth.
Then leave from the extremity of the disruption a quantity of the ring finger, that is, of the physician's: and fix a single needle past that, into which you introduce thread on both its ends, with both ends of which thread you do what is under the skin from the interiors, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have already brought together two extremities of skin, and two ends of the thread: and four rows are made.
Then tighten with the double thread in the circumference of the needle several times from both sides together, until both lips of the wound are brought together in a proper union.
Then leave a thickness of a finger also, and fix another needle in them; afterwards pass it with the thread, as you did with the first needle.
Therefore do not cease to do that with whatever needles you need, until you complete the constriction of the entire wound.
And let the needles be intermediate in thickness and thinness, because very thin needles pierce flesh very quickly, and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin; therefore they ought to be intermediate in thinness and thickness.
And it is not fitting that the needle be fixed in the two closely positioned skin extremities too much, so that the flesh is not pierced quickly and the wound is opened before its consolidation, and nor should they be pulled out too far with the suture, so that the wound is not hindered from healing.
Then cut the ends of the needles, so that they do not harm the sick person during their sleep; and place cushions of cloth on them from every side, which hold the ends of the needles; and leave them until you know that the wound is now healed.
And this type of suture with needles is indeed more suitable for small wounds.
Because one, or two, or about that many needles are sufficient in their suture.
However, the second common suture is to gather together with the suture four extremities: two skin extremities and two sinew extremities at once, with a needle on which a thread is wound equal in fineness and thickness.
Then, when you have pierced these four extremities with the needle, withdraw the needle from the side from which you began, so that the thread is drawn back from the upper part of the wound; so that the suture will be like the suture of a cloth with which cloths are tied together, and place between each suture a quantity of thickness less than a small finger.
However, men know this suture.
And with this suture I healed a wound that had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was a greater rupture than one palm: and about two palms of the middle intestine had protruded from the intestines, and there was a rupture in the middle of the belly.
Therefore, I returned it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
Therefore, the wound was consolidated in a space of about fifteen days: and I treated it, and he was healed; and he lived after that many years, engaged in his affairs.
And the physicians had judged that it would not be healed.
And it was miraculous that I did not treat it with ointment.
Because I was in a place where no ointment was found, nor any medicines.
Therefore I placed aged linen upon the wound twice a day, and I diligently washed it with honey water, until it was healed.
I will now describe two proper types of suture, according to the account of the speech.
And it is, that you begin with a sharp suture: and you insert the needle from the exterior to the interior part.
When therefore the needle penetrates the skin, and the muscle proceeding along the length and breadth of the entire body: leave the extremity of the thread on the side where you inserted the needle, and cause it to penetrate to the other extremity from the interior part to the exterior, at the other extremity of the wound.
When you have thus caused it to penetrate, then cause it to penetrate in the same manner, at this extremity, from the exterior to the interior: and leave the extremity of the thread, which is on this side, and cause the needle to penetrate the other extremity from the interior to the exterior: and cause it to penetrate with your penetration, in the way you make it penetrate in the thread's extremity, which is on its side, until it penetrates the entire wound.
Then begin also from this same side, and sew it with the extremity which is of the thread on the other side, and withdraw the needle from the skin which it has penetrated.
Then return it to that skin, and sew the extremity of the thread, which is on the other side, with this extremity of the wound: and withdraw it from the skin on its side, and do this successively, one and another: and do this turn by turn, until you have sewn the entire wound according to this example.
And the summary of this suturing is that it should be sewn like the suturing of leatherworkers, who sew hides: so that you should sew the thread successively from one side of one extremity of the skin, and leave it successively from the other side, until you complete it.
The second kind of proper suture, which Galen said.
His discourse relates that one should sew it according to the likeness in which certain physicians sew them, so that they assemble each part to its natural corresponding part: and they apply the extremity of the thread to its other extremity, and the extremity of the wound to its other extremity.
And that is done according to what I tell you.
You should insert the needle into the nearby extremity of the wound from the outside, and make it penetrate to the inside in that spot alone, and leave the two ends of the thread.
Then turn the needle, and make it penetrate from the outside to the inside in the two ends of the thread, namely on both sides.
Then turn both, also make both penetrate from the inside to the outside, into the two other extremities of the wound, which are on the opposite side.
And this method of suture is better than the common easy suture, and is a suture whose recollection precedes.
This is therefore also the speech of Galen.
And some said.
The suture of the belly is rectified with two needles.
That is, that you insert one thread into each of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from that which is with you, and make it penetrate to the other side, according to the suture of those who suture hides evenly.
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than the other places of the belly.
The judgment of the medication of a wound is the judgment of the other wounds.
That is, because when you obtain a fresh wound with its blood, before the air alters it, and you reduce the intestine, and suture it, and adapt it, then put over it powdered flesh-producing medicine.
If the air has already altered the wound, then put on it some ointments that are present to you, until they cause pus: and the filaments fall away, and they are consolidated, and mirach.
Then treat it as is the treatment of the other wounds, until it is healed.
However, if you do not have the remedies present, then put on it immediately, from when it begins to emit pus, old lint: and change it twice a day, as I taught you, until it is healed.
If, however, you fear that the wound will communicate with the main limbs in the injury, then you ought to submerge soft wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rose oil, and place it around the areas between the groin and under the armpits.
If, however, he feels pain, or prickings, or putrefaction in his bowels (for this often happens) then enema him with astringent, black, lukewarm wine: especially if putrefaction has already reached the bowel and made an exit penetrating to its concavity.
And know that that which is from the large intestine is of easier cure, and that which is from the small intestine is of more difficult cure.
However, the intestine called the Jejunum does not receive healing from a wound that occurs in it at all: and this is because of its multitude of veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nerve nature.
If, however, that which comes forth from the wound is a zirbum, and you obtain it fresh, reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
If, however, a space has passed it, and it has already become green or black, then it is necessary to tie it with a thread above the place that has become blackened by it, so that a flow of blood does not occur.
For in a zirbum are veins and arteries.
Then cut that which is beyond that ligature, and place the two ends of the thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside it, so that the traction of it may be eased upon you, and its extraction in the case of a zirbum, and the emission of the wound's pus.
A remembrance of the wound that occurred in the Intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it is possible that it may be restored in some people. For this reason, because I saw one who was wounded in his belly with a lance blow, and the wound was from the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old, and it became a fistula, and excrement and wind issued from it.
Therefore, I applied treatment until I was not confident in his cure; nor did I cease to refine it until he was healed and the place was consolidated.
After I saw the place already consolidated, I feared for the sick person, that an evil accident might befall him in his belly; and no evil accident befell him from that.
And he remained in better dispositions, eating and drinking, and having sexual relations, and entered the bath, and exercised in his daily activities.
And now some of the experimenters have said that when a wound occurs in the Intestine, and it is small, then it ought to be tied in this manner.
And it is, that you should take ants of large heads.
Then bring together the two lips of the wound, and place one ant of those which have an open mouth upon the two lips of the wound.
When therefore it takes hold upon them, and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres, and does not come loose.
Then place another ant near the first, and do not cease to do that with ant after ant according to the quantity of the entire wound.
Then reduce it, and sew the wound.
For those heads remain attached in the intestine, until the intestine is consumed, and healed, and no harm comes to the sick person at all. And now it is possible that the intestine be tied also with a fine thread: which has been scraped from the intestine of an animal, attached to it after it has been inserted into a needle.
And it is to take the extremity of this thread from the intestine, and to scrape it much.
Then tie a fine linen thread wrapped around its extremity.
Then insert that thread into a needle, and sew the intestine with it.
Then reduce it into the disruption. And this method of suturing with ants and intestine is only according to the way of trust and hope.
Know that a wound which is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, then there is no skill but refinement, nor is its healing complete.
Concerning the treatment of Zuchemen, and Fistulas.
Chapter LXXXVIII.
Know that any wound, or abscess, when it grows old and becomes an ulcer, and does not heal, and always discharges pus, and is not cut off: then it is universally named a Fistula, wherever in the member it may be, and we call it Zuchemen.
And a fistula, indeed, is, in truth, a filtered, hard, white knot: with which there is no pain, which has the concavity of a bird's feather; and on account of this some call it Risati, that is, feather.
And in some instances it is moist, which emits pus.
And perhaps the moisture is cut open in some instances.
And sometimes this moisture is much, and sometimes little; and it is thick, and sometimes thin.
And I have already mentioned in the division, when I said wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal, nor flesh grows in it, is not that unless for one of nine causes.
Of which one is, either because of the lack of blood in the body; or because of its bad quality; or because between it and the edges of it is hard flesh, preventing the growth of flesh; or because of much dirt and grime; or because the ulcer itself is putrid, and the matter which is applied to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is unsuitable in its treatment; or because corruption prevailing in the region is a type of pestilence, or through a property in the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where there is difficult digestion of illnesses, and healing of abscesses is delayed by nature; or because there is one bone, or a number of bones, in it.
And I have already shown all these causes and their signs, and their treatments with remedies in the division; and it is necessary here to let you know the treatment of Fistula and Zuken, which is done by the way of surgery with the hand.
Know therefore, that Fistula occurs in all members of the body.
For among them are Fistulas that reach large veins and arteries, or nerves, or sinews; or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to any of the ribs; or to any of the vertebrae of the back, or to any of the compound joints, such as hand and foot; and among them are those which go to the proximity of the principal limb and similar ones.
Therefore, which of these Fistulas is of this sort, is from illnesses difficult of healing, and does not receive treatment, and the work with it is labor and ignorance.
If, however, there is any Fistula among them whose depth does not reach these places which I have mentioned; and you hope and trust in its treatment, and wish to attain knowledge of it, then take a probe of air or iron, if the fistula tends in a straight line, and explore it with it.
If, however, there is twisting in the Fistula, then investigate it with a thin lead probe.
Since lead, with the lightness of its body, is eased and bends around the twisting.
If the Fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to indicate upon it with a probe.
Therefore, irrigate it from its openings.
For the moisture with which you irrigate it goes towards the other openings and runs from them.
Then inquire carefully in what way it is possible for you to know whether there is a bone or nerve there, and whether the fistula's cavity is distant or close; or whether it is a single fistula with many openings, and stand over the whole of it with all your strength, with your questioning, as you question the sick person, and with the discovery of pain on compression with your hand on the place, and with similar signs and causes of accidents happening to the abscess.
When you have thus stood over all that place correctly, then proceed to treatment with confidence, considering if the fistula is a close, visible one, or in a safe place distant from a joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places I have told you: then cut the fistula as was previously explained in my account, and remove what is in it by filtration, and the corrupted flesh, that arises in its opening from the flesh or the whelk, and the like: and treat it until it is healed.
If, however, the fistula is of distant depth, and is in a straight line, then it is necessary that you cut it in the depth as much as possible.
Then cleanse it from all its corrupted flesh.
Then apply strips wrapped in sharp medicines, and introduce them into the cavity of the fistula which you have grasped with the iron. Do this with them repeatedly until the sharp medicine corrodes all that remains in the cavity of the fistula from the corruption.
Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
If, however, it is not healed by that, then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.
If therefore the cause of the fistula is bone, and it is ascertained by you that it is so, then seek it out, and cut it out according to what I have told you; if nothing from a vein, or nerve, or principal limb hinders you, as we have said.
If therefore bone is detected by you, and there is something of corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until all its corruption is removed.
Then treat it with that which causes it to flesh over, until it is healed.
If it is not healed, and emits pus as it did before: then know that you have not reached a complete eradication of the corruption.
Therefore, expose it a second time, and thoroughly perform its scraping and cleansing with all your strength.
Then restore it.
If therefore it is healed, it is good; and if not, then know that that corruption is in a deep and distant part of the body, which you have not reached.
Therefore, you have no skill in it, unless you leave it to nature.
If the small bone is corrupted, and it is possible for you, draw it out with fine forceps suited to it.
If however there are many bones, then carefully draw them all out, and do not leave any of them behind with your strength.
If, however, some moisture presents an obstacle, and there is no fear or error in their incision: then cut through those moistures and flesh, if there are any, and free the bones.
If, however, you have no preparation for removing the bones from your hour, then place over the wound something that will corrupt it, and leave it until that which is around those bones, of flesh and moisture, is corrupted.
And guard the wound so that it does not heal.
And constrict the incision that you made in your operation.
Indeed, place over it, if you fear, a poultice soaked in crushed sulfur mixed with oil, or a poultice soaked in Egyptian unguent, or any green unguents.
For when those moistures, namely, putrefy, and the bones are separated from them, the removal and extraction of them is alleviated.
If, however, there is one large bone, such as the bone of the leg or the bone of the hip, and similar to them, and that which is corrupted from it is a large part: then scrape it with the utmost scraping, until that blackness and corruption are removed.
Then restore the wound.
If however the corrupted part within it is large, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it and cut it entirely to the place where the corruption has reached; then treat it until it is consolidated. And I tell you a case, which happened to a man in his leg: that you might set it as an example and aid in your operation.
There was a young man, approximately thirty years of age, upon whom pain arose in his leg, from a cause which arose within his body, that is, from the interior, until the materials reached his leg, and it became a large abscess; and there was no external cause for it.
Therefore, time passed with him and with the error of the physicians, until the abscess was opened, and many materials gathered together with it.
And his treatment was delayed until his leg became fistulous, and many openings were made in it; which all emitted pus and bodily humors.
Therefore, a multitude of physicians treated him for approximately two years, and there was no one skilled in the art of the hand among them, until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the materials flowing from those openings with great force; moreover, the entire body of the man had already decayed, and his complexion was yellow.
I therefore inserted a probe into one of the openings, and the probe reached the bone.
Then I examined all the openings, and found them to connect to each other from every part of the leg. I therefore hastened and cut open one of those openings, until I exposed a part of the bone; and I found it corrupted: it was already corroded, and blackened, and decayed, and perforated, until it had penetrated to the marrow.
I therefore removed what was revealed to me, and prepared it from the corrupted bone.
And I judged that there was nothing in the bone except that corruption, which I cut away and removed.
And I had already eradicated it.
Then I placed the restoration of the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time.
And it was not consolidated.
Then I attempted its restoration.
And it was not restored.
Then I restored it with medicines, and it consolidated quickly, and was healed: and this repetition in its operation, and section, was not necessary, except because of the disposition of the patient's weakness, and his little tolerance, and my fear for him of death: since he was experiencing in every hour, from the excess of evacuation, bad syncopes.
Thus, he was healed with complete healing: and hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good disposition was made in his body, and his strength returned: and he was restored to his former condition: and no harm was done to him in walking at all.
If however a prominent bone in a previously fractured part of the body is present, then it is necessary to saw it, according to this method: and it is so that you take a ligature, and tighten it on the end of the prominent bone; and instruct someone to extend it upward; and place another thicker wool ligature over the first ligature. Then bind it over the flesh which is under the bone: and extend its extremity, so that you pull the flesh downwards: and you uncover the flesh over the place you wish to saw, so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
Place wood, or a plank, under the bone properly below: because when you do that, it is not prevented from cutting the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be over the corrupted place for a short time, so that there is no corruption in the concavity of the bone: and it does not appear in its appearance to the senses, and compels another sawing in its place. If the bone is corrupted, and is not prominent, but rather its part is continuous with another part, and the corruption is in its middle or in a part of it, then uncover the flesh from all sides completely.
Then place wood underneath.
Then saw it from the first part, where the corruption is, until the sawing is continued on the other part: and let the sawing be along the length from the corruption for a short distance, as we have said.
If the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and saw the bone where it continues on the other part.
If, however, the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no cleverness in it but only abrasion.
If the corruption is in the hand's or foot's hinge, then the matter is very difficult.
But you must inquire how the corruption appears to you.
And abrade it, and cleanse it according to whatever arrangement is possible for you, and with whatever cleverness it is rectified for you, when the vein or nerve does not create opposition for you.
And know that there are many incisions and saws for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness and their rarity.
Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a suitable instrument for every kind of operation.
And know that these operations indicate to you the kind of instrument you need, when you have a long study with you.
And knowledge of the methods of this art is a testament to the methods of illnesses: for then you will find within yourself that which suits it from the instruments for every infirmity.
Saw shape.
Shape of another saw.
Shape of another saw.
Shape of another saw.
This saw shape depicted, let it be done properly. Let its upper arch be sharp from iron; and its handle from boxwood, and let it be a pyramidally well-made one.
Shape of the connections of the razor.
Let the head of this razor be, according to the form of the head of a star-shaped nail; and its points be according to the form of the points of a flint-scraper.
And it is not suitable, unless the heads of the joints are rubbed with it, when they are damaged, or the bone is large and prominent.
Form of the larger razor.
Form of the middle razor.
Form of the broad razor.
Form of the razor in which there is a concavity.
Form of another slender razor.
Form of another razor with a curved end.
Form of a small, slender, taut razor.
Form of the razor with which bones are cut.
Form also of a large razor.
This is similar to a saw, and its end is like a saw; it is shown in many places for the cutting of bones.
Form of a razor suitable for cutting that which is perforated in bones.
Its tip is triangular, with sharp edges.
It is made of Indian steel.
And similarly, all that we have said about razors, and knives, and saws should be done.
On the incision of extremities and the sawing of bones.
Chapter LXXXIX.
Extremities putrefy, either from an external or internal cause.
Therefore, if you have treated that corruption with medicinal cures, and the treatment does not help; and you see the corruption spreading to the limb, which nothing else repels; then it is necessary to cut off that limb, up to where the corruption reaches, so that it escapes from death or from the greater harm caused by the lack of the limb.
And the sign of this happening is that the limb darkens until it rots; that fire has burned it, or it rots after darkening; until that rot is cut away down to what follows that limb, and spreads throughout the entire body.
Therefore, hurry with its incision, and similarly if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of certain venomous creatures, such as the sea scorpion, and viper, and adder, and similar ones.
If, therefore, the corruption, or injury, is in the extremity of the finger, then cut off the finger, and do not give space to the corruption to spread to the rest of the hand.
And similarly, if it happens in the hand, then cut it off at the root of the forearm, and do not give space to the corruption until it reaches the forearm.
And if it invades it, then cut off the arm at the elbow at its joint. If however the corruption passes, and you see it about the elbow, then in that is the death of the infirm.
And to administer beyond that from a cure, is the amount of virtue.
And similarly do with the foot, when corruption invades the toe, then cut it off at one of the joints; and if it reaches the foot's instep, then cut off the entire foot.
If however it ascends to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint.
If however the corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no skill in it, except for dismissal, and leaving the infirm to death.
And the method of cutting off a limb, or sawing it, is that you should tighten the ligament below the one you wish to cut: and tighten another ligament above the spot.
And let the assistant extend one ligament downwards, and let the other assistant extend the ligament upwards.
And you shall separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments, with a broad spatula, until all the flesh is exposed.
Then it shall be cut, or sawn.
And it is necessary to place linen cloths on all sides, and let the saw not touch the healthy area: and let the patient suffer no further injury, and a hot abscess.
If, however, an internal flow of blood occurs during your work, then cauterize the area quickly, or place upon it certain powders that staunch the blood.
Then return to your treatment, until it is completed.
Then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, the same accident that I am telling you about.
That is because it happened in his foot with a blackness, like a burning that is similar to the burning of fire: and that corruption first happened in his toe, until it began the whole foot.
Therefore, the man hastened himself, after seeing the corruption descend upon his limb with its violence, which he found from its pain and burning: and it struck him at the joint, and he was healed.
And after a long time passed, the same corruption happened to him in the index finger of his hand. So he came to me, and I tried to recover that superfluity with what I placed on his hand from medicines after purifying his body: and the superfluity was not repelled, and it began to proceed to another finger: until the corruption began in his hand.
Therefore, he called me to cut his hand: and I did not want that, hoping in myself concerning the repulsion of that superfluity: and I also feared for him death at the cutting of his hand.
Because the man's strength was over the case.
After he despaired of me, he returned to his land: and it reached me concerning him, that he hastened, and cut his whole hand: and he was healed.
And I have not brought forth this account, unless that it be a help concerning that which falls under this sort of sickness: and that it be a signification by which it is signified, and according to which it is done.
Concerning the treatment of sinuses, and the quality of clysterization with medicines.
Chapter 90.
When an abscess occurs in certain fleshy limbs, and the space of the abscess is prolonged until it collects pus: then it bursts, or is pierced, and what is within it of pus emerges, and a hollow place remains, as if it were a vessel: and the skin over it is like a cloth which has already become thin: and it does not reach the ultimate stage of corruption, nor does it impinge on the bone, nor on the nerve, nor on the ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and it is not called a Fistula: but nevertheless, if its space is prolonged until the corruption impinges on any of these members, then it is called a Fistula, or zuken.
And its treatment is to cut away that entire skin as it is turned back; and especially when it is thin and made like a cloth: and you trust that it does not adhere to the place, because of its corruption.
However, if you hope that the skin adheres, and that corruption does not result from that ultimate adhesion; and if there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with a clyster; and it is that you should consider it as a Sinus.
Then, if it is large, and the pus that emerges from it has a foul odor, then clysterize it with Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and ziniar, taking equal parts, to be mixed in a vessel: and let them be boiled over the fire until the medicine turns red: and it comes to the thickness of honey.
Then take from that what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clysterize the Sinus with it: and tighten its opening, and leave the medicine in it for a quantity of two hours.
Then extract it with pressure; do this for so many days, until the sinus is cleansed, and the foul odor is removed.
And sometimes it is clysterized with ash water, when this medicine is not present to you; and it is so that you should take the ash of vine wood, or the ash from the wood of the holly: and pour water over it.
Then strain it, and clysterize with it, until you are confident that the sinus is now cleansed.
If the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, nor the ash water, then clysterize him with water and honey, to which some crushed ziniar has already been mixed.
Or clysterize him with mixed honey and wine, because of the property of honey to cleanse and wash away; and wine makes the sinus adhere, especially when there is an excess of astringency and dryness in the wine.
When you have done this several times, and are confident that the corruption of the sinus is now removed, then clysterize him with that which causes flesh to grow in it.
And it is, that you take from the diafinicon plaster, and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or clysterize him with certain medicines and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
If the sinus opening is narrow, in which the clyster tube does not fit, then enlarge it a little with iron; or place on it linen wrapped in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it is enlarged.
And similarly if the opening is also wide, then gather its lips together with sutures, and leave in it a quantity into which the clyster can enter without addition.
And similarly, if the opening from which pus flows is elevated upwards, then cut it in the lower place within it, so that the pus flows downwards; because when pus is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from growing in it.
If it is not possible for you to cut the sinus approximately below it as you wish, then try to prepare the limb in a way that the pus flows from it easily, as is prepared for you.
Try that nothing of the pus is retained in it at all, and take consolidating medicines which are placed upon a sign, suitable for what you wish.
And spread them over a linen cloth.
And let the cloth be of such a size that the whole sinus is covered.
Then cut with scissors in the direction of the sinus opening a hole, a little larger than the sinus opening.
Then spread some gentle ointments onto another cloth, according to the size of the hole, and place it over it, some distance away from the sinus opening, so that the pus may more easily exit from it; and do not remove the large cloth, except after a few days, at once.
However, the one over the sinus opening is the one you remove every hour, so that what collects in it from the pus may exit: and so that you may know whether the fluid running from it is much, or little; or digested, or undigested.
And with this, again consider the location of the sinus itself, whether the patient feels pain in it, or there is no pain, and whether there is an abscess in it, or not.
When therefore your treatment is thus prolonged, and you see the material that exits over the sinus opening, then know that the sinus is now adhering, or approaching adhesion; then, therefore, loosen it in the morning, or on the third day; and when you loosen the wound, then change the cloth, and renew the ointment. However, if after a long period a thin fluid exits from the sinus, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, since there are people whose flesh generation in their wounds is slow, and there are others who act the opposite of that.
If, however, undigested pus exits from the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not adhere.
If therefore the adhesion of the sinus is delayed and its condition prolonged, then add to the drying medicines, but let the physicians see to it that the medicines are moist in their substance and dry in their potency; such as the unguentum dyafinicon, when added to it, the superfluous addition of zegi.
And of the last remedies used for its treatment, it is that you should take the unguentum dyafinicon and dissolve it with rose oil, and sprinkle over it old wine equal in its substance.
Then mix it with that, and use it.
And it does a similar action to this, when the unguentum dyafinicon is not present for you, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and use it.
Or take myrrh and aloes and frankincense: grind all of it and powder it over the honey while it is on the fire.
Then line a cloth over it and tie it over the sinus: and line it with the honey that you boiled until it thickened: and powder spices over it, and place it over the cloth, and tie it.
And sometimes long birthwort and the roots of the celestial lily, and the lily, and the herb's flour, and centaury are administered in it.
Use them, simple or aggregated, grind them and sift them: and powder them over the honey I mentioned, and use it.
If the sinus persists and is not healed by this treatment, then know that there is corruption deep within it; or it is already making an impression on the bones, or on other hard members, or ligaments: then treat it with the treatment for Fistulae, as was previously stated. Concerning the treatment of whitlow and a worn nail, and the incision of a swollen finger, and section.
Chapter XCI.
A whitlow is an abscess which arises under the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot, and perhaps arises in the other fingers.
Therefore, when its condition prolongs, and its treatment is neglected, and the abscess becomes a hot abscess, or it is corrupted and emits pus until it corrodes the root of the nail, and perhaps it corrupts the whole nail, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until it has a foul odour, and the end of the finger becomes broad, and its colour becomes dark.
Therefore, when you treat it, according to what we have said before, and your treatment does not help, then it is necessary to cut away with an iron instrument all the excess remaining from the nail.
Then cauterize the wound after that.
For the cautery is very helpful.
However, if the bone is sound, and the nail is also healthy, and the unnecessary additions of the nail are now pressing the flesh inwards, and begin to prick it and injure it, then it is necessary to place a thin blade under the corner of the nail that pricks the flesh, and drive it upwards, and cut the flesh easily, and place upon what remains of the flesh burning, corrosive medicines, until the whole of it is removed.
Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
If, however, corruption has already taken hold of the bone, then it is necessary to cut that bone and remove it: for it will never be healed while corrupt bone remains in it.
If you see corrosion and decay entering the finger, then cut it at one of its joints, according to the prior description of it.
Then treat it until it is healed.
If, however, the nail suffers attrition or a blow, and severe pain results, then it is necessary to first bleed the afflicted person.
Then cut the nail with a sharp spatula, making a transverse cut from above to below.
And be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for you will cause great pain to the sufferer, and it will be the cause of the birth of additional flesh in that place.
Then treat the area with something that relieves pain.
The extra finger that is born in some people's hands is perhaps entirely fleshy; and perhaps some have bones in them, and perhaps there is a nail on it; and some of them are born at the joint's root, or its birth is in some of the finger's knots.
Therefore, the one that is born in some of the finger's knots does not move; and the one that is born near the finger's joint, perhaps moves.
Therefore, the one that is fleshy among them, its incision is easy.
That is, to cut it at its root with a wide scalpel.
However, the treatment of the one whose birth is at the root of the joint is difficult.
Therefore, abstain from its incision.
In that one which is born on the finger at the last of the nodes, then it is necessary to cut first its flesh in a circular incision, up to the bone.
Then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for it.
Then treat it until it is healed.
The consolidation that occurs between fingers often happens either from the man's birth, that is, he is born with it, or from the consolidation of a wound, or from burning by fire, and similar things.
Therefore, it is necessary to separate that consolidation, until the fingers return to their natural form.
Then place between them linen bandages, or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate them; or place a thin sheet of lead between them until the place is consolidated as it ought to be.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs between certain fingers and the palm, then cut that consolidation, according to what is prepared and appropriate for the shape of the limb.
Concerning the incision of a defect.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
Ulcers are veins enveloped, thick, full of melancholic humors which occur in many members of the body; and their effect is most often in the legs, especially in the legs of those who travel and work, and those who carry heavy loads.
Therefore, it is necessary that you administer a purging of the body of black bile sometimes with a strong purge.
Then, phlebotomize the patient's arm.
The treatment of them with iron is according to two methods.
One of them is that they be cut, and the black blood be extracted.
And the other method is that the vein be raised, and the whole of it be extracted.
However, the cutting of it is according to this method.
First, bathe the leg thoroughly with warm water, until the thick, foul blood is dissolved.
Then bind the patient's leg from the upper part of the thigh, down to the lower part of the knee with a bandage.
Then cut the vein in one, or two, or three places with a wide incision.
Then cut the nail downward until a quantity of blood emerges which you see as sufficient and which the patient's strength can tolerate.
Afterwards, tie it off; and instruct him to abstain from foods that generate black bile; and repeat the evacuation and bloodletting when the veins are full and it harms the patient.
The elevation of it is in this manner.
Shave the leg of the patient if there are many hairs on it.
Then immerse him in a bath; or embrocate his leg with hot water until it turns red and the veins swell; or have him exercise vigorously if a bath is not available until the limb warms up.
Then cut the skin along the vein's course, either at its end near the knee, or at its lower part near the heel.
Then open the skin with hooks, and scrape the vein from all sides until it is visible; and at its appearance, you will see it sloping from red to black.
When it emerges from the skin, you will see it white like a string.
Then introduce a probe beneath it until it rises and emerges from the skin; suspend it with a blunt, gentle hook.
Then make another incision near that incision, three fingers away.
Then scrape the skin from above the vein, until it appears.
Then lift it with probes as you did, and suspend it with another hook, as you did at first.
Then make another incision, or several incisions, if you need them.
Then lift it and cut it at the very last incision near the heel.
Then pull it out to the incision above it.
And do that until you pull it out of the incision that is higher, or from all the higher incisions, until the whole thing comes out: then cut it.
However, if it does not yield to being pulled and lifted, then insert a needle with a strong thread doubled, and tie it, and pull it out; or insert a rod under it, and turn your hand around every part until it comes out.
And beware that it is not cut.
For if it is cut, it becomes very difficult for you to lift it, and it enters upon the weak from it harm.
When therefore you have pulled it all out, then put on the wound-place wool soaked in wine and rose-oil, or oil, and treat it until it is healed.
If the vine is contracted, having a twisting to which there is a wrapping to parts, and is not, as we said, according to straightness, then it is necessary that you cut along every part of its twisting and the places of its wrapping.
Then suspend it with hooks until you lift it all, and beware at your incision on it lest you cut a vein, or wound it: for it will become difficult for you to lift or extract it.
Therefore, preserve your prudence.
Form of the Injury by which the Vine is Healed.
Form of the blind hook.
It does not have the curvature like the other hooks, nor is its end sharp, so as not to injure a vein; and it is of thick, smooth flexibility, for if it were subtle, it would cut a vein by its subtlety; indeed, it has superfluous thickness, as we said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg. Chapter XCIII.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Al-Andalus, and the land of the Arabs, and in dry, hot lands, with little softness, that is, in which no grass grows, nor trees.
And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And indeed its generation is from the putrefaction that occurs under the skin, as happens within the bodies of snakes and worms, ascarides, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
And the sign of the beginning of this Vein's occurrence is that a violent inflammation occurs in the leg.
Then the place becomes blistered.
Then the Vein begins to emerge from the place of that blistering, as if it were the root of a plant, or an animal.
Therefore, when its extremity appears from it, you must wrap a piece of lead around it, whose weight is from one drachma keil up to two drachmas, and tie it; and leave the lead hanging from the leg.
Whenever, therefore, something emerges from it to the exterior, wrap it in lead and tie it.
If it extends a great deal, then cut off part of it and wrap the remainder.
And do not cut it at the root before the whole of it emerges.
Because if you cut it, it contracts and enters the flesh; and causes an abscess, and putrefaction in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it should be gently handled and pulled out gradually, until the last part emerges from it, and nothing of it remains in the body; and from this vein, in some people, emerges something that is in length five palms and ten.
And it has already come to my attention that it emerged from a man of twenty palms.
If, however, it is incised in your hour of medication, then insert a probe into its opening, and pierce it with a long hole, along with the body, until everything in it is evacuated from the material; and treat the putrefaction of the area with medicines for several days. Then treat it with the treatment for abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot or in the foot itself; and many openings occur to it, and a branch emerges from every opening.
Therefore, treat it as we said in the division, and with what was stated beforehand.
Concerning the incision on worms generated under the skin, and it is called the Cattle Disease.
Chapter Ninety-Four.
This disease is called in a certain land among us the Cattle Disease; because it often happens to oxen, and is a small worm that is born between the skin and the flesh.
And it goes throughout the body, ascending and descending, and is noticeable to the senses as it moves from limb to limb, until it breaks through wherever it breaks through the skin, and emerges.
And its generation is from the putrefaction of certain humors.
Just as worms and snakes, that is, intestinal worms, and ascarids, occur in the belly.
And it is feared because of its malice.
Because when it travels through the body, and rises to the head, and reaches a place, then perhaps it breaks open there and emerges and destroys the eye, and this happens many times.
Therefore, when one wishes to cure it and extract it, then this is not done except at its movement and its appearance to the senses.
Therefore, it is necessary to tie that which is above it and that which is below it with a strong ligature.
Then cut above it and extract it.
If it penetrates into the flesh, and you do not find it, then place a cautery on the area with fire until it dies.
And the greater fear is its corruption, by which it corrupts the eye, as we said. If however you see it already having reached the head near the eye, then tie the eyebrow below it with a good ligature.
Then cut above it and extract it.
And it is necessary for the sick person to use a cleansing of their body, with medicines that dissolve bad putrid humours.
And let him beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
Concerning the incision above the ailment Nakir.
Chapter XCV.
This ailment is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that happens in some limbs, then changes from limb to limb.
And I myself have already seen it, as I tell you.
I was called to a weak woman in certain villages.
And she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm's cord.
And after I remained one hour, I saw one swelling moving with the pulse, as a worm moves, ascending to her shoulder more quickly than is possible, so that it is like quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
Therefore, the pain receded from that place and settled in the shoulder.
Then I sat for one hour, and it ran through the rest of the body until it reached the other arm.
Then she told me that it was moving throughout her whole body, just as I had seen.
Therefore, I was amazed at the speed of its movement from limb to limb.
And indeed, before that, I had not seen this illness with my own eyes in such a way.
However, I have seen many who experience pain moving from limb to limb, but I did not see it with my own eyes as I did in the woman.
And I do not think it is so unless it is because the woman was from those who are of dry bodies with detected veins; hence this blowing about appears to the senses in that manner.
And it is necessary that they do not appear in this way in those who are delicate, and with moist bodies, of hidden veins.
When therefore you wish to cure it, and the patient feels the pain: then if it is evident to your eye, as we said, then draw tight upon it and beneath it quickly: and cut upon it, until that constricted windiness comes out; and cauterize the place.
If, however, you do not see it with your own eyes, then treat it with shaking of the body, and with that which expels winds, and soothes them with foul pills, and pills of serapion, and similar things.
On the extraction of Arrows.
Chapter XCVI. Arrows differ according to their types, and according to the places in which they enter the body.
Their diversity is such, because among them are those with large points, and small: and concave, and blunt.
And among them are those with three angles.
And among them are those with tongues.
And among them are those with stars.
Those, however, that are according to the members on which they fall, are according to two methods.
For either the members are from the principal concave members, such as the brain, and heart, and liver, and lung, and kidneys, and intestines, and bladder, and similar to them.
Therefore, when it falls into any of these members, and signs of death appear to you, which I relate to you later, then it is necessary to avoid extracting that arrow from them, for death follows it in whom it is, in many dispositions.
And when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden in the depth of the member, then extract it, and treat the wound.
For the signs of the brain, when an arrow falls into it, and penetrates the bone, and exits through the siphac that is above the brain, are: because vehement sweat, and scotoma, and dizziness, and redness in the eyes, and swelling, and redness of the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of intellect, and vomiting of cholera, result from it.
And perhaps blood exits from the nostrils or ears.
And perhaps speech is cut off, and the voice is destroyed.
And a white moisture like gruel exits from the place of the wound.
And something like the watery part of flesh comes out of it.
If therefore these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not come out.
The signs of an arrow striking the heart are: that it is near the left breast; and that one feels as if it were fixed in a hard substance, not in an empty one.
And perhaps the arrow's movement is similar to the movement of a pulse; and black blood runs from the wound.
And that is followed by coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting.
Know therefore, that death descends without a doubt.
And a sign of an arrow wounding the lung is the exit of frothy blood from the wound; and the vessels following the neck become inflamed, and the sick person's colour changes.
And he breathes out a large, deep breath; and seeks the attraction of cold air.
If an arrow strikes the covering, which is in the breast, then it is near the small ribs; and there is a great gasping with intense pain, with a sigh; and all the arm's limbs move.
And if an arrow strikes the stomach, then perhaps something undigested will exit from the wound from the food.
And if an arrow strikes the abdomen, and is fixed in it, something of the faeces, or zirbum, or the already ruptured intestine will exit from the wound.
Therefore, there is no hope for its cure, nor in extracting the arrow.
If an arrow strikes the bladder, and urine exits, and something flows from it to the outside, and the pain is stronger than the weakness, then know that it is mortal.
However, the remaining members, such as the face, and neck, and throat, and shoulder, and arm, and the vertebrae of the back, and collarbone, and hip, and leg, and similar members are saved according to many dispositions when the arrow does not strike an artery or nerve and is not a poisoned arrow.
And I tell you what I have seen concerning these arrows, that you may signify by it upon your treatment.
Because an arrow struck a man in the tear duct of his eye, at the root of his nose.
Therefore, I drew it out for him from the other side, beneath the fat of his ear; and he was healed, and no harm befell his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which struck him in the fat of his eye beneath the lower eyelid; and the arrow was already hidden, and I was not able to obtain from it but a small tip, with which it adheres to its shaft; and it was a large arrow from the Turkish bows, with soft iron, in which there are no ears.
Therefore, the Jew was healed, and no ill accident befell his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arabic arrow, and it is of the kind which has ears.
Therefore I cut upon it between the two guidegi: and it was already submerged in his throat.
Therefore I worked carefully with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from the man which had fallen into his belly: and we thought that he would die from it.
After therefore thirty days had passed, and nothing had changed in his condition, I cut upon the arrow: and I worked upon it, and extracted it: and he was healed, and no evil accident befell him.
And I saw a man upon whom an arrow fell on his back, and the wound on it was consolidated.
After therefore seven years had passed, an arrow emerged in the root of his hip.
And I saw a woman on whom an arrow fell into her belly, and the wound on it was consolidated, and the arrow remained within her: and no change was there in her condition, and the woman found no harm in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man, upon whose face an arrow fell: and the wound was consolidated, and it remained, not causing him much pain: and many similar things to these.
And I extracted the arrow from the king's chief officer, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and it had already deviated slightly to the right side: and the arrow was entirely concealed.
I was therefore called to treat him after the arrow's impact for up to three days.
I therefore found the arrow wound to be very tight.
I therefore sought it with a fine probe, and did not feel it: and he himself felt a prick and pain under his right ear.
I therefore hoped that the prick was from the arrowhead.
I therefore plastered the area with a plaster containing attractive and digestive properties, confident that the area would suppurate, and that I would see a sign of the arrowhead, so that I could cut over it: and there did not occur in the area any sign indicating that the arrow had struck the area.
I therefore applied the plaster to him over many days: and no sign occurred, and the wound meanwhile healed: and he remained weak from its extraction for several days, until one day he felt the arrow within his nose.
And he told me that.
I therefore applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to that wound for many days, until it opened: and when I probed it, I felt a thin arrowhead adhering to the wood.
Then I added to the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine, until the arrowhead became visible to us: and it took me approximately four months with that.
Then, after the wound had widened, and I was able to insert forceps into it and move it, and it did not yield to removal, I did not cease to refine and devise methods for it, until one day I began to use specially crafted forceps, as will be shown in the form they take at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Then I restored the wound.
And indeed, physicians judge that the cartilage of the nose is not restored.
Therefore, I restored it, and the wound was consolidated, and the patient was healed with complete health; and nothing harmed him at all.
And I tell you about the quality of extracting certain arrows: so that you may set that as a rule and meaning upon what I have not said.
Because the parts of this art and their distinctions are not comprehended with the narrative; nor does the book encompass it, and a skillful craftsman compares the little with the much: and with what is present, over what is absent; and finds a new operation, and a new instrument, concerning the descent of foreign matters of this art when they occur.
I say therefore, that arrows do not emerge from the limbs in which they are fixed, except in two ways. Or by extraction from the place from which it entered.
Or by the contrary of another part.
And that which emerges from where it entered, either is an arrow proceeding in a fleshy place: and is pulled, and emerges.
If it does not yield to exiting from the hour in which it falls, then it is necessary to leave it for a few days, until the flesh that is around it rots: and its extraction will be eased, and its emergence.
And similarly if it is fixed in bone, and does not yield to you for exit, then leave it also for a few days: and repeatedly pull and move it every day, until it emerges.
If it does not yield to you for exit after days, then it is necessary to pierce around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine drill, until the arrow's path is enlarged.
Then pull it and extract it.
However, if the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head, and has already progressed into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of the accidents which I have mentioned appear from the patient, then refrain from pulling the arrow, and leave it, until its state is equalized after days.
For if the arrow reaches the sifach, then death is not prolonged for him.
And if the arrow is not fixed, except in the body of the bone only, and does not penetrate to the sifach: and the sick person remains for a few days, and nothing from those accidents happens to him: then proceed with the extraction of the arrow.
However, if it is fixed firmly, and does not obey you in extraction: then administer a drill around the arrow, as I have told you: then treat the place until it is healed.
If however the arrow is already hidden in a place of the body, and is concealed and hidden from sight, then search for it with probes.
If however you feel it, then extract it with certain instruments suitable for its extraction.
If however you cannot extract it, due to the constriction of the wound, and because of the arrow's length deep within: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then widen the wound above it, until the wound is enlarged, and it is possible to extract the arrow.
If it has ears by which it is held, then free the flesh fixed to them from every side, with any ingenuity that you can, and devices, if it is not possible by the escape of flesh in the fracture of the ears, and twisting of them, until it escapes.
And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hand, with forceps on all sides, until you make it escape: and with the utmost delicacy, so that the arrow is not broken, and its extraction becomes difficult for you.
If you cannot extract it within one hour, then leave it for a few days, until the things around it putrefy.
Then try again: for it will then be easier.  But if a contrary flow of blood troubles you, then administer what we have said concerning healing in its chapter: and guard your skill from incising a vein, or a nerve, or a tendon.
And apply all the ingenuity you can to the escape of the arrow: and let it be with ease and calmness, or slowness and firmness, as I have told you.
And it is necessary, when you pull out the arrow, that the wounded person be in the same posture as when the arrow entered.
Because it is more helpful.
If, however, that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from the figures.
However, an arrow that emerges from the opposite side of the other part, either something already protrudes from it outward, or the arrowhead forms a swelling on the surface of the nearby skin, and you see it protruding: therefore cut above it, and let the cut be the size that forceps can grasp.
Then pull it out: for it becomes easy to remove.
If, however, it remains in the bone, then turn your hand in a circular motion until the arrow is pressed against the bone, and it enlarges itself; then pull it out.
And if not, leave it for a few days; then try again, until it emerges.
If the arrow's shaft is in it, then push it along with it.
If, however, the shaft has fallen off, and you wish to administer a push, then insert a concave instrument into it, so that its concavity enters the arrow's tail; then push it along with it.
If, however, the arrow is concave, then push it with an instrument entering it.
For the arrow is eased by it.
If, however, the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cauterize all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you.
Then treat it with what is appropriate for it.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or in the side; and it is close to what you touch with the probe, and it is possible for you to cut above it; then cut, and beware of cutting a vein or a nerve, and pull it out.
Then suture the wound, if you see fit, and treat it until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps with which arrows are extracted.
Let the ends be similar to the beak of a bird, made of iron; when they grasp the arrow, they do not release it.
And many forms of them are made, large, small, and medium, according to the quantity, size, and smallness of the arrow, and the breadth and constriction of the wound.
The shape of the impelling concave.
And the shape of the impelling deaf.
This is a deaf extremity, like a radius, so that its entry into the concave arrow may be eased, and it may be propelled with it.
The extremity of this impelling concave is concave like a bird's feather, so that the entry of the arrow into it and its propulsion may be eased.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins.
Chapter XCVII. Thirty veins are those to be opened, whose use runs through the body.
Of these, sixteen are in the head: two pulsating veins, which are behind the ears, called the two Herbs; and two arteries, which are apparent in the two temples; and two veins which are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, called the Lookers; and the prepared vein in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the tip of the nose.
And two Guidegi, which are in the neck.
And two veins which are in the upper lip of the mouth.
And two veins which are in the lower lip.
And these are the veins called Algecherich.
And two veins which are under the tongue.
The veins, however, which are opened in the arms, are five veins in each arm.
One of them is the Cephalic, and it is from the wild side: and the common people call it the vein of the head.
And the Fusca.
And the Middle vein, and it is composed of a branch of the Basilic and a branch of the Cephalic: and the common people call it the vein of the body.
And the Basilic, and it is situated on the domestic side: and it is also called Titillicaris.
And the common people call it the vein of the belly.
And the Brachial vein, and it is situated above the elbow: and it is that in which bloodletting is done, and it is that which is clearly seen above the thumb.
And the Saluatella: and it is the vein which is between the ring finger and the little finger: and it has two branches.
And in the leg and foot there are three veins.
One of them is which is under the curve of the thumb on the wild side.
And the second is the Saphena: and its place is at the heel on the domestic side.
And the vein Nesse: and its place is at the heel on the wild side.
And in the other leg are three veins similar to those.
Concerning phlebotomy of the two veins behind the ears.
Phlebotomies of the two veins behind the ears are helpful for chronic colds, and hemiplegia, and sahafati, and bad chronic head ulcers.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is according to what I describe.
And it is so that the head of the sick person is shaved, and his occiput is rubbed in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth, a good rubbing.
Then let the sick person tie his neck with a cloth, until the two veins appear.
And their locations are behind the ears in two depressed areas of the head.
Therefore, seek them with your finger, and where you feel their pulse beneath your finger, mark that place with ink.
Then take a cupping lancet, and it is the one called Incidens.
Then insert it beneath the vein in the skin, until the lancet reaches the mouth [of the vein].
Then raise your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and cut the vein with the skin with an incisive incision.
And let the length of the incision be the amount of two joined fingers, or approximately that: and cause as much blood to come out as you wish.
Then bind it with compresses, and leave it until it is healed.
And already in the beginning of the book was the incision of them, and their cauterization.
Concerning the phlebotomy of two arteries in the temples.
Phlebotomy of the two arteries located in the two temples is beneficial for old hemiplegia, and crookedness of the neck, and continual ophthalmia, and the discharge of excess acute fluids to the eyes. And the quality of phlebotomizing them is according to what I tell you.
Let the sick man hold his neck tight, until two veins become clearly visible; and their pulse be shown under your finger.
Then mark them with ink.
Then lift the skin above the vein upward with your index finger, and insert the lancet underneath, and lift the vein upward.
And cut it, as you did in the other two veins, and make the blood flow according to your need. Then loosen the sick person's constriction, and place your finger on the vein for an hour.
Afterwards, place a cloth and pads over it, and bind it tightly over the constriction; and leave it until it is healed.
And already the remembrance of them, and their incision, and their extraction were previously mentioned at the beginning of the book.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the frontal vein after phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
Indeed, the benefit of phlebotomy of the frontal vein, after phlebotomy of the cephalic vein, is for old facial ailments; and for hemicrania, and redness; and foul ulcers.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is, according to what I tell you.
The infirm patient tightens his neck with a bandage until the vein appears.
Then take the instrument called a Fossorium.
Its form is this.
Place the prominent point that is on the head of the Fossorium above the vein itself, and strike upon it with a spatula, or with something else in its manner; and allow the blood to run according to the quantity you desire.
Then loosen the wound of the infirm person, and bind it, until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a broad phlebotom.
However, it is not necessary that the phlebotom have a sharp end, like the other phlebotoms, but rather a broad end.
And lance it across the vein; because the bone is near, and perhaps the phlebotom will break in it when it is slender.
Concerning the lancing of the veins in the two tear ducts.
The lancing of the two veins in the two tear ducts is for the eye from scabies and redness, and for spots in the eye, and diseases of the face.
And the quality of lancing them is that a weak person tightens his neck with a bandage.
Then lance them, and you should stand over his head.
And let the lancing be transverse, slightly along the length, with a small, somewhat wide lancet, for there is no flesh in the place.
For if the lancet is of slender make, perhaps it will break.
Then make the blood run out as much as you need.
And place a compress over them, and bind them one night, and unbind them.
Concerning the lancing of the veins of the Nose.
The lancing of the veins of the Nose is beneficial for acute fevers, and violent headaches, and diseases of the face, such as hemicrania, and redness which occurs on the face, especially when it is chronic.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that the weak person tightens his neck.
Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a slender, long lancet, and place it in the middle of his nostril, between that which distinguishes the nose in terms of its straightness.
Because the vein is not visible there to the eye, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
And you should hold your hand with the lancet for a little while, and make the blood flow according to your need.
Then tie it with one bandage.
For it is restored quickly.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins of the Guidegi.
Indeed, the benefit of Guidegi phlebotomy is for the constriction of breathing, and the inception of leprosy, and melancholic illnesses, and impetigo and evil ulcers, and those that corrode, that is, eruptive herpes.
And the quality of their phlebotomy is such that the infirm person is bound beneath both sides of his neck with a bandage: and the craftsman stands over the head of the infirm person, and the infirm person sits upon a seat.
Then the phlebotomist cuts the vein to a length, the phlebotomy being somewhat wide.
Then extract from the blood a moderate amount, or according to what you see to be necessary for that.
Then do likewise with the other vein.
Afterwards, loosen the bandage, and bind the two veins with a middle constriction, so that the infirm person is not over-constricted.
And leave it until morning.
For the wound is healed.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the veins, by Algeberich.
However, Algeberich's vein-opening is helpful, because it contributes to ulcers in the mouth, and gum corruption; and bad sores; and lip cracks, and bad sores, even those that are on the nose and its surroundings.
And the quality of their phlebotomy is such that you should make the infirm person sit before you, and tie his neck with a strip.
Then, turn back his lip, and look at the two veins: of which one is to the right of the lip, and the second to its left; and the demonstration of each is by the blackness of both.
And that is true, because in their surroundings are small, black veins.
Therefore, cut each with a cut coming in. However, if there is doubt upon you, and you do not know which of them it is, then aim at the incision of the larger of them, and the more manifest of them.
And similarly do concerning the two veins which are in the upper lip; and indeed the custom runs most with it; and cut the two veins which are in the lower lip.
Concerning phlebotomy of the veins under the tongue after the phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
However, the benefit of the phlebotomy of the two veins which are under the tongue is that phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is for the suffocations which are in the throat, and the illness of the uvula, and the illnesses of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomizing them is such that the sick person sits between your hands in the presence of the sun; and raise his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side of it for a vein, and on the other side of it for a vein; and the color of each of them slopes toward blackness.
Therefore phlebotomize each of them; and beware lest you finally place your hand on phlebotomizing them.
For under them are arteries, and perhaps a flow of blood from those arteries will occur.
Concerning the three veins in the elbow.
The three veins, however, which are phlebotomized in the elbow, are those whose phlebotomy is customary in all men.
And their phlebotomy is done according to two methods.
Either by puncturing with a broad myrtle phlebotome, or an olive-like one to the sharpness of a slope, or by cutting with a knife phlebotome, and it is Alnesil.
And this is its form.
Thus Alnesil is, that which is suitable for cutting.
And of them there are broad and narrow types, according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The form of the myrtle phlebotome is broad, as you see.
And it is suitable for opening concave, full, proceeding, apparent, large veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotome is of lesser width, and of finer extremity.
And it is suitable for the phlebotomy of thin veins, which contain thin, yellow blood.
Of the phlebotomy of the Basilic vein.
The Basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, is an aid to phlebotomy. Because it draws blood from illnesses which are beneath the throat and neck, from there following to the chest, and the abdomen: and it is fitting for the phlebotomist, when phlebotomizing it, to be cautious and to be above fear from it, for there is an artery under it.
Therefore, if he errs, and adds in the puncture of phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and a flow of blood will occur.
Therefore, it is necessary that he not phlebotomize it with a phlebotomy lancet; rather, let him be cutting with a scalpel.
If the Basilic vein is not clearly visible, then it is necessary to seek another, and change to another, or seek one of its branches; or phlebotomize the brachial vein in its place.
For it is indeed clear, and cut it with a phlebotomy lancet, as we have said.
If, however, you wish to phlebotomize the same arm, then it is necessary before the constriction of the arm, that you touch the place, until you know the location of the pulse.
Then mark the spot with ink, afterwards the arm, and cut the vein with a concave incision using the phlebotomy lancet, as we have said.
And beware that the blow does not fall in a space from the location of the artery.
And when you see, when you constrict the ligature, an inflation in the place which you marked with ink, then that inflation is the inflation of the artery: therefore avoid it.
If you see blood at the phlebotomy leaping, like a child's urine, and it is thin, red blood: then know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Then quickly place your finger over it for a long space, then remove your finger.
If, therefore, blood is cut off (for it is often cut off), then constrict the arm, and release it; and let the sick person be cautious of its movement; and let it be upon his fear.
And do not move it for several days, until it is healed.
If, however, the blood is not cut off, and it overcomes you, and there is no medicine present for you at that moment, then cut the artery, if it appears to you.
For its extremities contract, and the blood is cut off.
Or take the bark of a fig tree, and split it: take one half, and tie it over the place of the vein's proper constriction, with a bandage and dressings until another day.
Then if the blood is cut off, it is good.
And if not, then treat it with that which preceded in memory from the place of powders cutting off the flow of blood: and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in many cases, on account of the small place of the wound, and the possibility of a bandage from the arm.
Concerning the phlebotomy of the Fusca vein.
The phlebotomy of the Fusca vein is helpful, because it draws blood from the upper part of the head, and the lower part of the body; because it is composed of a branch of the Basilica vein and a branch of the Cephalica vein, as we have said.
And it is fitting for the phlebotomist that she be cautious regarding her phlebotomy, for there is a nerve beneath it.
If therefore the phlebotomist adds in the puncture, and finds a nerve, there occurs in her numbness, and the healing of it becomes difficult, and perhaps it is not healed completely.
And this nerve frequently appears to the sense.
However, if it is hidden in some people, and is subtle, and does not show itself: then it is necessary that you place your phlebotomy, whereby you phlebotomize, the incision with Alnesil, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
If the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise.
Concerning the Cephalic vein.
Phlebotomy of the Cephalic vein is helpful, because it draws blood from the head, and is beneficial for diseases of the eyes.
And it is necessary in this vein properly, if you wish, that you phlebotomize it by piercing with an olive-shaped lancet, or with a myrtle-shaped lancet, because it is safer than all the veins, because there is no artery, nor nerve, beneath it. However, it befits you in phlebotomy to avoid the head of the forearm with the lancet, and to seek a smoother place.  And it does not harm it if it is not found with the first puncture, so that it is repeated with phlebotomy several times. However, perhaps it becomes a boil in some people when it is not phlebotomized on the first puncture, but that boil does not harm them in any way.
On the usefulness of phlebotomy, and the precautions to be observed in it.
The quality of phlebotomy, and the accidents that arise from it, which you must consider to correct.
First, you should know that phlebotomy is not performed except for the preservation of health, and its persistence, and caution from the onset of illnesses.
And so that phlebotomy is performed in one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the Cephalic, the Basilic, and the Median cubital vein.
And that phlebotomy should be performed at the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, in spring and summer; and in autumn and winter after eating, when signs of fullness appear.
And phlebotomy should be performed on the first or third day after three hours have passed.
However, phlebotomy administered in illnesses does not have a determined hour; but when the appropriateness and necessity call for it, by night or day, and in every hour and every time.
And it is not appropriate for boys to be bled until they reach fourteen years of age.
Nor should a pregnant woman be bled, except from the fourth to the seventh month.
Nor should elderly people who have already passed sixty years be bled.
Therefore, when someone wishes to be bled, no matter for what reason, it is necessary that they cleanse their bowels before the phlebotomy with a gentle clyster, if there is much retained stool within them, so that the veins during the phlebotomy do not draw out putrid impurities harmful to the main limbs from the intestines.
Nor should a patient suffering from nausea, or surfeit, or recovering from drunkenness be bled until that is removed from them.
Nor the sick person with dropsy.
And phlebotomy should be avoided again after colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive intercourse, labor, exercise, wakefulness, fasting, and anything that dissolves strength from the body or the animal.
Then consider in the subtlety of the humors beforehand, if the blood is thick with foods and drinks and medicines; if it is possible for him to do so.
Then let him enter a bath, if nothing prevents him; or let him exercise with some exercise, so that the blood is made more subtle.
And place his phlebotomy on his chest, around the third day, as we said: and strive that his chest be emptied that day of all bad animal accidents, such as anxiety, anger, and fear; and of all bodily accidents, such as labor, pain, excessive discharge, and similar things.
And let him have present in his seat things with the use of which men are accustomed to run, from aromatics, and scents, and dancing and things similar to those to the extent possible.
Then let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion higher than the phlebotomist's cushion; afterwards, let him draw his arm out, and let the phlebotomist rub it with his hand twice or three times.
Then bind the ligament with a strap, and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for when the constriction is unequal, or by excess in the constriction, then it hinders the flow of blood; or in loosening, then it also hinders the flow of blood.
Then after the constriction, it is necessary that the phlebotomist rub his hands together until the veins swell and become apparent to the senses.
Then the phlebotomist should wipe the phlebotomized area with a little old oil, properly.
Then let him place his left index finger on the vein itself, just under the place where he wishes to phlebotomize it, a little: so that the vein does not escape, and the incision is not missed.
Because there are veins that, like a fleeing chord during phlebotomy, and from them are those that are full of windiness; and when you place the phlebotom on them, it contracts under the phlebotom, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and does not open the vein; and if he opens it, it is constricted; therefore, for this reason, it is necessary that the phlebotomist be firm and careful in all these matters.
Then he should remove the phlebotom.
And if not, then repeat it another time a little under that place, or above it with haste, if the place is not becoming inflamed.
If, however, it becomes inflamed, or the patient becomes frightened, then let him be left alone for a day or two days, and do not tighten the ligature.
For perhaps it will attract a hot abscess.
Nor let him enter a bath.
Then he should repeat the phlebotomy, if he desires.
If the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly, and you fear that the desired quantity will not flow from the blood, then repeat the phlebotomy in the same opening in a straight line, and add a little in the procedure.
And do this with haste, before the place becomes an abscess, for a place becomes abscessed in many people from a small operation.
If therefore you see it already abscessed, then do not repeat on it at all, for nothing excuses it in your view. And place something from the dregs of oil on it, because it alleviates the flow of blood.
And it is better in this place than the oil itself, and than other oils.
And similarly administer the dregs of oil in all your phlebotomies, where phlebotomies cut veins to prohibit the flow of blood: and the Tyrian alfarach and sagzenea do it, when one of them is placed on the place.
For blood is refined and resolved when it is thick.
If a large abscess should occur at the site of the phlebotomy, for it often happens, especially to one who is not a phlebotomist but that occasion, or if the vein opening is small, then quickly place a sponge soaked in water and salt, warmed slightly, upon the place, and compress it for one hour, because it is resolved.
And it is necessary that you do this after the blood has exited from the vein itself, with its completion, or from another vein.
And very often indeed, abscesses and swellings occur at phlebotomy in the Basilica.
Therefore, place your hand upon it; then, if you find softness upon pressing it, then that swelling is bad.
Therefore, be careful to place something upon it from what we have said.
For perhaps blood from an artery will flow from it.
But make a plaster for it with that which has astringency, so that the place may be hardened.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment, until it is healed.
And it is necessary to extract from every man's blood according to the quantity of his strength.
And what appears from the color prevailing over the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let it be allowed to exit until it turns red; and likewise, if you see it thick, then let it be allowed to exit until it becomes thin; and likewise, if it is sharp, until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for him who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting in one instance, that the phlebotomy of the vein be widened and the phlebotomist be wide: and in him who is weak, let it be the opposite of that.
And it is necessary to extract it in stages, and that the opening be narrow: and better for the administration in the phlebotomy of the vein is that it be a transverse incision, not a puncture.
And this method of phlebotomy is safe from a flow of blood, and from the incision of the nerve: and is more praiseworthy, and safer than phlebotomy by width and length.
And to whom it is customary to reach syncope during phlebotomy, it is necessary that he eat before phlebotomy a little bread soaked in pomegranate juice water; or secaniabin, if it is warmed; and draw from his blood in three or four instances.
And if he is of a cold complexion, then let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in quince syrup, or in syrup of scented honey with spices, or in fragrant scented syrup.
If syncope occurs during phlebotomy, and its cause is the outflow of much blood, then it is necessary that he take in drink water from meat, and a subtle fragrant syrup; and that he use aromatics with algalia, and that his chest be lined with it; and that he use the rest that we said in the division in the chapter of syncope from evacuation.
Whoever wishes to evacuate his arm, and resolve his blood a second time: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is for great evacuation, and whose strength is weak, to resolve his blood little by little by the amount of strength in continuous days.
However, whoever wishes to evacuate his arm, and resolve his blood a second time, and his body is strong: then let him do it after seven or nine hours from his first phlebotomy.
Whoever wishes to draw blood from his body to the opposite part to which it inclines: it is necessary that it be evacuated for him on the second or third day.
In whose body, however, is much blood already heated and sharpened, and causes fever to occur: it is necessary that blood depart from it in one turn, and a great quantity be drawn from it; and the opening be amplified until syncope occurs; after you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy; and that you place your hand upon his pulse at the flow of blood, so that death does not occur in place of syncope.
For often that happens, when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligence occurs.
And it is not appropriate, when you wish to resolve the arm, and resolve the blood a second time, when the opening of the vein has already closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, to press upon it with vehemence, and quickly bend or extend it.
For that is very bad; indeed, leave it, until it is phlebotomized a second time.
Or remove with the sharpness of the phlebotomist that which is clotted from the blood in the opening of the vein, and place upon it some dissolved salt in water.
And place upon it something of tyriaca alfaroch, or sagzenea, and place it with gentle pressure, until blood comes forth.
If however the vein is already suppurated, then leave it, and do not cover it, until the suppuration subsides.
If necessity provokes you to draw blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize it above that place, or in another arm in another vein.
However, the arm's vein is phlebotomized in the place of the Fusca and Basilica veins, when these are not found, and are hidden, since it is composed of them.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is such that the weak person should immerse their hand in warm water, until the skin reddens easily and the vein becomes clearly visible.
Then a ligature is to be tied around it with moderate constriction.
Then phlebotomize along a transverse cut, gradually, not laterally, nor lengthwise; and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be a little above the joint of the hand.
And indeed, the flow of blood is most often placed in warm water in the time of winter.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all veins, since there is no pulsating vein nor nerve beneath it.
Phlebotomy of the Saluatella vein of the right hand is helpful for liver ailments.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that you should tighten the mahason of the hand with a bandage, or with your hand, after you immerse it in warm water, until the vein swells, and is clearly visible to the sense.
Then, cut the vein transversely.
And if you cut it completely, it will not harm it in any way.
And be careful not to injure your hand with the lancet.
For under it are the nerves of the fingers, bare of flesh.
Then return the hand to warm water, and let the blood flow into it.
For if you do not return it to warm water, the blood clots in the vein's opening and is prevented from flowing.
When therefore you have extracted the necessary quantity of blood, then place oil and salt over the vein: so that it does not quickly solidify.
And similarly it is necessary that you do with every tight branch.
The benefit of phlebotomy from the left hand, however, is: because it is beneficial to diseases of the spleen: and similarly, do in its phlebotomy as you did in the second equally.
The benefit of saphenous phlebotomy, however, is for illnesses in the lower part of the body, such as illnesses of the womb, and retention of menses, and weaknesses of the kidneys, and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is that the sick person should immerse their foot in warm water, and apply friction to it until the veins swell, and tie above the joint of the foot with a strap.
And indeed the vein's location is near the heel, appearing towards the big toe, and branching from it into many branches on the foot's surface.
Therefore, phlebotomize it in its larger branch, or near the heel in its confluence, because it is better and safer.
If you phlebotomize it on the foot's surface, then beware of the nerves that are under it on the foot's surface.
And place your phlebotomy where you will phlebotomize it transversely, as if you wish to cut it: and let the phlebotomist be skilled.
If however the exit of blood is prohibited, then repeatedly immerse his foot in warm water, and allow the blood to flow into it, until it is evacuated.
If, however, the phlebotomist errs in the first instance, then repeat the phlebotomy a little higher up, for the place is safe, and you do not fear harm from it, when you beware of the nerves, as we said.
And similarly with the saphena of the other foot equally.
The Sciatic vein's location, as we said, is near the heel on the outer side.
And the application of phlebotomy is beneficial for the pain of the hip, when it is due to hot blood.
And the method of the phlebotomy is that the sick person should enter a bath and hurry; and tighten his leg from the side of the hip up to the heel by four fingers with a long thin bandage; for it does not appear unless because of that.
Therefore, when it appears, then the phlebotomist should cut it according to whatever ability is possible for you, either transversely; and it is better either to pierce it with an incision, or to cut it with a section.
For its location is safer, and it is very hidden in many people.
If you do not find it, and it does not appear to the senses at all, then the phlebotomist should cut one of its branches, and that is the one which appears on the back of the foot and towards the ear; and beware of the nerves, and make the blood flow in the quantity that you wish.
Then loosen the constriction, and place a skin over the phlebotomy site, and tighten the place.
For it heals quickly.
Concerning Cupping, and the quality of its use.
Chapter XCVIII.
Cupping instruments are made from horns, and from air, and from glass.
And cupping indeed is done according to two methods.
One with scarification, and the extraction of blood; and the other is cupping without scarification. And this cupping which is without scarification, is according to two methods.
For it is either with fire.
Or it is without fire.
And cuppings which are administered with scarification and the extraction of blood are fourteen places of the body.
Of which one is the cupping of Alnocrati, and it is at the back of the head; and Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; and the cuppings of Alhagdahim, and they are two blades of the neck on both sides together; and the cuppings of the chin, and it is beneath the jaw in the lower part of the mouth; and the cuppings of the two shoulder blades; and the cuppings of Alachosos above the end of the tail; and the cuppings of the two armpits, and they are in the middle of the two arms; and the cuppings of the two thighs; and the cuppings of the two calves.
And indeed cupping does not extract blood from the tiny veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that no virtue is lost from them, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Nor should cupping, whether with or without fire, be administered for any illness arising from fullness until the whole body is evacuated.
If necessity prompts cupping for an illness or because of custom, we administer it at any time during the beginning, end, or middle of the month, and at any time whatsoever.
This is because there are people who, when blood accumulates in them until they need its extraction by cupping, find heaviness and dullness in their head.
And among them are those who find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck.
And among them are those who find itching in their face and forehead, and darkness and dullness in their eyes.
And among them is one who scratches the place of their cupping. And among them is one whose laughter increases.
And among them is one who finds the taste of blood in their mouth: or the tongue is suppurated, and they spit blood.
And among them is one whose sleep increases.
And among them is one who sees in their sleep blood and redness, and slain ones, and wounds, and things similar to those. Therefore, when we see any of these, and especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order a venesection to be performed, after two or three hours have passed during the day. The benefit of venesection of the nape of the neck is, because it contributes to the heaviness in the head, and what is discharged to the eyes.
