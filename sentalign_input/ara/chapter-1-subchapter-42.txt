Chapter Forty-Two.
On Cauterizing Back Pain.
Pain may occur in the back from many causes, either from a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and the like. It results from an outpouring of a cold, moist substance, and cauterization is done only for this type.
That which is from an outpouring of a cold substance, it is necessary, after emptying the patient with حبّ المنتن (habb al-muntin) and the like, to cauterize on their back where the pain is, three rows across the width of the area, after marking the place with ink. In each row, five cauterizations or more, according to what you see of the patient's tolerance and strength.
And the cauterization should be with a point cautery, and if you wish, cauterize it three or four times with a medium nail-shaped cautery, in this manner.
