If they swell in dropsy and fill with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize on the dorsum of the foot in the depression between the little toe and the ring finger.	When, in the sufferer from dropsy, these swell and become full of yellowish fluid, you should cauterize the upper surface of the feet in the depression between the little and fourth toes; hold your hand upright with the cautery; do not let it slant.	0.6773525
Keep your hand steady with the cautery iron and do not twist it. Then lift your hand and do not bring it back at all, for it will drain the yellow water. The cautery iron should be of this shape:	Then remove your hand and do no more cauterization whatever; for the yellowish fluid will exude.	0.6164691
Then cauterize the legs, two cauterizations on each leg. The cauterization should be done with the knife-edge of the cautery iron and should be along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another below it towards the middle of the leg. And on each thigh, two cauterizations.	The cautery should be of this type. Then sear the legs with two cauterizations on each leg; cauterize with the bladed end of the cautery, and let it be along the length of the leg: one under the knee, the other lower than that, about the middle of the leg; and two more cauterizations over each femur.	0.8989494
Leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time so that the water drains from it, then treat it with all that we have mentioned.	Leave the burns open without treatment for a long while during which the fluid will exude from them. Then dress with all that we have described.	0.73044604
