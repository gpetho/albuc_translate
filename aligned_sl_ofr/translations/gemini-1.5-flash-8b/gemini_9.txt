O you, very dear children, I have completed this book, which is the last of the science of medicine, along with its fullness, and have made the end through its expositions and through its declarations. And it came to me in a vision that I would complete it with this treatise, which is a part of the work of hands, that is to say, "surgery.
And because the work of hands is very difficult in our region and is unknown in all respects, the science is lost and cut off, and nothing remains of its strength except for the small descriptions in books of the ancients that the hands have changed. And from this came error and vanity, and the intentions are closed and the science is distant.
Or it seems to me that I want to revive it, along with the arrangement of this treatise, according to the way of exposition and declaration and abbreviation; and will bring together the shapes of cautery irons, and the other instruments of the work, with the addition of the declaration and preparation of them, as is necessary.
And for the reason that no good masters of hands are found in our time, the art of medicine is distant. And it is necessary for whoever undertakes this to excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so that he knows the arrangement of the limbs, and their shapes and their junctions and separations, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and veins and their number, and the movement and of the moving and resting veins, and the place of their exit.
And for this, Hippocrates said that the name, along with the name, is much, and with the work is little; and especially in the art of hand.
We tell you in the introduction of this book that whoever is not knowledgeable of the previously mentioned things, should guard himself from falling into error and killing men;
Thus, I have often seen several of those who undertake this science and abandon themselves without science and without experience.
For I saw a foolish man who cut an abscess of scrofulous sores on a woman's neck and cut the neck's arteries; because so much blood flowed out that the woman fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another man who extracted a stone from an old man, and the stone was large; he took away a piece of the bladder with it, and the man died within three days.
And I had already been called to remove it, and saw the patient's condition and the size of the stone, and knew that if it was cut into, he would die.
And I saw another man who took on the treatment of a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the breakage there was a wound;
and the physician, full of ignorance, bound the break over the wound with strong bandages, and did not leave the wound any space, and left it thus until it was healed.
and he instructed him not to loosen it at all;
and it remained like that until the leg, the foot, and the whole thing swelled up and it became ruined.
I was called to go to him, and I hastened to come to untie the leg; and when I loosened it, it was at peace and did not feel any pain.
But nevertheless, the corruption had already taken hold in the limb, and I could not heal it;
and the corruption continued to spread throughout the limb until the entire limb was lost.
And I saw another sore that burst the festering abscess, and then inflamed further because of the malice of its affliction.
For a chancre, when it is free of melancholic humor, it should not be touched with iron if it is not in a place where all that is corrupt can be removed.
And therefore, my dear son, you need to know that the work of the hands is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work where there is danger in many situations;
and I will show in each place of this book where there is fear and danger.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to protect yourself, so that foolish people cannot speak ill of you.
Take your weapons in readiness, and undertake your patients lightly and firmly, and use the best method so that by the grace of God you come to safety and are praised;
and leave the terrible diseases of grievous sickness;
and remove the weapons that cause you fear, and have strength in yourselves so that you may go from this world to the other in glory.
Galen said in some of his admonitions: Do not undertake a serious illness, lest you be called a foolish doctor.
I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
The first chapter is on cauteries by fire and cauteries by sharp medicine, and the chapter is arranged from the head down to the feet;
and of the forms of instruments, and the preparations for cauterization, and of everything necessary for the work.
The second chapter is on cutting and piercing, and on cupping and wounds, and on the extraction of arrows, and similar things;
and the chapter is arranged, and the forms of instruments.
The third chapter is on restoring dislocations and twisting injuries, and similar things;
and is arranged from the head down to the feet, and the forms of instruments.
Before we recall the work, it is necessary for me to describe the quality of the aid and the harm of each complexion.
I say that the quality of aid, and of harm, is the longest, most subtle science, and a secret answer.
and about this, many wise men spoke, and agreed upon this.
and their words suffice me little, for I fear the length.
I say that cautery aids universally in every complexion where there is matter, except in two complexions: that is to say, a hot complexion without matter, and a dry complexion without matter.
In a hot and dry complexion together with matter, some debated and said that cautery is great help; and others said the opposite: that cautery is of no value for an illness arising from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is hot, and should not be used to treat a hot illness by heat, nor by dryness;
and those who said the opposite stated that cautery is of great help in hot and dry illnesses that affect the human body. For when you compare the human body and its moisture to the nature of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it so on several occasions by experiment.
And nevertheless, let no one interfere unless he has tested it and knows, through long use, the chapter of cauteries, and the diversity of human complexions, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and their occurrences and the duration of time;
Of other complexions we are not at all fearful, especially in cold and moist illnesses. And all the physicians gathered together and agreed to cautery.
And know, son, that cautery with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater goodness than cautery with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and it only affects the afflicted limb, and does not harm other limbs very much.
Burning medicines spread from limb to limb, and cause serious illnesses in the limbs; and perhaps kill the patient.
Fire, because of its intensity and the goodness of its substance, does not cause that, unless there is excess.
And this I have found through experience and through the length of service and study I have put into the art, and it is based on the truth of things;
And for this, I apologize for the length of the speech, for it does not please me to deprive you of the secret hidden in fire, and the nature of the work, how it drives illnesses from the body, as the philosopher states in demonstrating; or receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on the time when cauteries should be done, and chose springtime.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the harm that arises is put down by the help of cautery; and especially if the cauteries are necessary for pains, more urgently than waiting for the time when greater harm might befall the limb.
And do not think about it, dear son, as fools do; for the illness that is cured by cautery has no return; and they say it thus;
and they say it thus; but it is not as they believe, because cauteries are only a medicine that changes the complexion, and dries the humors that are the cause of the pain, and are more effective than other medicines due to their speed, and because of the virtue of their work and their power.
And it is possible that the illness comes sometimes according to the complexion of the ill person, and the location of the illness and its virtue;
and if superfluities gather in him through the consumption of food and similar things, if it is not cauteries administered in a place where there is little superfluity and moisture, such as cauteries for toothache, and similar things, then such pain does not return; but this happens rarely.
And many people do not understand why cauteries are called the last resort of medicine, and it is true;
but they do not believe that cauteries are of use after other medicine, but their intentions are false, and cauteries are the last resort of medicine because when we administer various treatments for a disease, and they are not effective, then we administer the cautery, and it is effective.
Therefore it is clear that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention of foolish minds.
The ancients said that cauteries of gold are more effective than those of iron, and they said this only because of the quality of gold and the high value of its substance;
and they said that the cautery's location does not cause decay, but this is not true, for I have experienced it, and have found it to be true in some men;
and cauteries of gold are more effective than those of iron, as they said. And yet when you heat a gold instrument, you do not know when it is hot by the color of gold, and it cools quickly;
and if it is heated too much; so do they in the fire; and thus there is enough hindrance.
Now I have ordered this chapter from the head down to the feet, so that the way might be easier to find.
These cauteries are good for moisture and cold on the brain, and there are two that are done because of a disease called "soda", and because of many humors that descend from the head to the eyes, and to the ears, and for a multitude of dreams and toothaches and sore throats, and especially for all diseases that come from cold such as paralysis and soda and apoplexy and similar illnesses.
The form of this cautery is that the patient should be purged by a dissolving medicine, cleansing the head for three or four nights, according to the strength and age and temperament of the patient. and then, cauterize the patient's head.
And then make him sit cross-legged between your hands, and put his hands on his thighs.
Afterwards, place the base of your palm on the bridge of his nose between his two eyes; and let your middle fingers come to rest on the bridge of his nose, then heat the cautery, called "olivare," of which this is the form: And place it on the spot marked with ink, and move your hand down and inwards little by little while turning it; then lift your hand quickly, and observe the spot if you see the bone slightly protruding; and if you do not see it, then repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I told you;
afterwards take a little of linen, and put it in water and soft cotton inside, and place it on the spot, and let it remain for three days;
afterwards put moist cotton in butter; and leave it on until the burning is gone; afterwards treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrafarmaçon" until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer a wound remains open, the more it cleanses; and therefore it is helped thus.
And some of them said that one should leave the cautery on long enough that part of the bone is burned, then one should remove what is burned from the bone, and it should be cured.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on so long, and press so hard, that one removes from the bone as much as a little spindle that women use in their spindles, so that the humours may come out thus.
And one should leave the wound open for a long time; after that one should cure and close it.
And these two kinds of cauteries do not seem to me at all good, except in some men, or if there is fear.
and I seem to want to leave it.
for the shoulder is weakened by the continual solutions of nature, as we testify in other members.
and even when the patient's shoulder is weak by nature, and the first appearance of cautery is safer and milder for me, and with this I use work in this way for a wholesome result.
When chronic pain affects the entire head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use herbs and pills called "cochie", and remedies for clearing the head, oils, and plasters. and if one applies the cautery that we have previously described, and it is of no use. Beware if the patient's shoulder is of strong nature, and if it is not too cold; Then cauterize just below that cautery we spoke of above. Then apply cautery to each horn of the head down to the bone, as we said before, and apply cautery to the place called "vasselz". and it is the place where one places leeches; and hold your hand so that you do not see down to the bone: the patient feels much greater pain in this cautery than in others, and I will speak of it elsewhere;
and the cauteries on the horns should be finer than those used to cauterize the middle of the head, and this is the form:
of the cautery of the head When sudden pain arises in a part of the head, and the ailment extends to the eye, and the head has been cleansed by purifying medicines, and the other cures I have mentioned in the division of illnesses have been applied, and none of this provides benefit: Then apply cauteries in two ways, that is to say, with sharp medicine and with fire.
The cautery of sharp medicine is that you take a piece of garlic, remove the skin, and cut it into two or three pieces, and then make an incision in the temple where the pain is located in such a way that you can place the piece of garlic beneath the skin;
and when it is placed, bind and compress it well, and leave it thus for twelve hours; and then unbind it and remove the piece of garlic, and leave the wound thus for two or three days; then put on a pledget soaked in butter until the suppuration ceases.
After the ointment treatment, until it is healed;
and if you wish, use some of the burning medicines that I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The cautery of iron is thus according to this method. Heat the cautery iron, of which here is the form:
And it is called "close" because its head is shaped like a closed container with a slight curve, and in the middle a small projection;
and place it on the painful area, and hold your hand and turn the iron slightly, until half the thickness of the core is burned;
and lift your hand so that the artery, which is outside, does not burn, and let an abundance of blood flow.
After, place cotton in a salted water and put it on the area for 3 days; then place moistened cotton in butter, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish to cauterize this migraine with the cautery called "cultellare", at the very tip, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine, which is not ancient.
of migraine
When you treat a migraine as we have previously said in the divisions of diseases, and it does not help, and you see that the previously mentioned cauteries of medicine and of iron do not suffice, then you must heat the cautery called "cultellare" until it is white;
and then make a cut on the painful area, one and a half finger's widths long, and remove your hand once, and be careful not to cut the artery and not to reach the bone;
and beware of the jaw which moves when one chews, and that the nerve does not have to do with the movement and that spasm does not come to the patient, and beware of the bleeding from the artery when it is cut, or if the cut causes great fear, especially to one who does not know it and who is not a student and experienced; and leave the work halfway;
but I will tell you how to stop the blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it is appropriate in this book.
And if you see that this cautery is not enough for the sickness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed;
and if you wish, administer the cautery that we have said in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery which has two blades; and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
of the pain of the ears due to cold.
When pain in the ear comes from cold, and one has used dissolving medicines and other treatments as we have said in the division, and the pain does not change, then heat this cautery which is called "poins," of which this is the shape:
Then prick all around the afflicted ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and move a little above the root of the ear after you have marked the area of insertion; and make ten pricks around each ear;
then treat the area until it is healed.
of the torture of the mouth
Torture that must be treated with cautery is no more than those caused by phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illness;
and do not apply cautery to those that arise from dryness and spasm of the nerves.
When you treat this type of torture caused by phlegm, by emetics and purges, and these do not work, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, another a little outside the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips;
and place the cautery on the healthy-appearing part, and cauterize it at the top of the ear, slightly below the head's horn, and another in the temple, as long as a thumb; and leave the cautery there until half the flesh is burned;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And it resembles the scalpel we have described before, but it is a bit more subtle, and the knife should be a little thicker;
after treating the area as I said before, until it is healed.
When the apoplexy is longstanding and you treat it as we have said, and it is not beneficial, and the patient does not have a fever, then apply four cauteries: Two on the two horns of the head, and one in the middle of the head, and one at the place called "vessels" as we said before, and the last cautery on the mouth of the stomach;
and be treated as we said before.
of lethargy
For this illness, the patient should be given large pills and powders that cleanse the brain;
Afterwards, the head of the sick person is completely shaved, and a mustard plaster, as described in the treatise on plasters, is placed on the back of the head;
and this is the manner of the cautery: if it is done as I have said.
If it is thus healed, it is good; and if it is not, apply three cauteries from the middle of the head downwards to the neck, and let there be one finger's breadth of space between each cautery;
and treat it as the others, and if you wish to add more, and the patient is tolerant, apply one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two more on the two horns, and treat it until it is healed;
and let the cauteries be what are called "olivare," as I have said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of sores and of what we have said before;
After this, treat the patient's head, then cauterize it in the middle of the head and on each horn, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck;
And if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is suffering, and the illness is severe, then apply four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until most of the heart is burned, and raise your hand; after the treatment until it is healed, and let the cauteries called "olivare" be as we have said before.
of the epilepsy
The epileptic should not use strong cauteries except for those who are phlegmatic, and it is necessary first to cleanse the brain with years and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division when the patient is great and suffers from taking medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot bear it, then give him gargling and chewing, cleansing the brain frequently with good food;
After the head is shaved in the middle, and apply cauteries according to what we have said before, and cauteries on the vessel, and on each horn; And if the patient is strong and able to bear it, apply cauteries as I have said for those with paralysis and softening of the body, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped, according to the manner I have described.
If the patient is a child, apply subtle cauteries according to this manner:
When, due to melancholy, the superfluities or moistures are corrupted and the phlegm is thick, then cauterize with the kind of cauteries we have described for those with paralysis.
And if, due to melancholy, the superfluities tend towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give him to drink something to purify the brain, according to what has been said before in the division.
After that, treat the patient's head. Then, make a well-made linen bandage, like a circle, and place it on the head;
and the patient sits cross-legged, and be well held on all sides;
Then apply the liniment, and it is worth using old badger butter; and warm it gently over a fire, so that the patient can bear the heat of it. Then empty the circle within the head, and let it cool.
and do this to the patient once each week with other good treatment, until he is healthy.
Or if you wish to cauterize it, make several punctures with the cautery.
This method of cautery softens the brain equally.
and then place moistened cotton in butter and goose fat.
of the water of the eyes When water comes first to the eyes, according to the signs I've described in the division, then begin giving the patient something to drink that purifies the head, and keep it free from moisture, and make it sweat in a bath several times fasting.
Afterwards, he commands him to raise his head, and he applies cautery in the middle of the head, and applies two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of water is in both eyes together, or on one if the descent is in one.
and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin, and let the cautery be long according to the width of the temple;
and be careful of blood flowing out, and if you see too much blood coming out, then stop it with the power you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision the caution on how to stop it;
And sometimes cautery or a heated instrument is applied under the two bones behind.
and if one sees that it is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities, then apply the cautery that I mentioned at the beginning of the descending ailment to the eyes: one cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries or heated instruments under the two bones; and if more is needed, then carefully cauterize above the eyebrow with one small cautery.
When you treat it according to what we have said in the division, and it does not benefit, then give the sick person three nights of broth to drink; afterward bind the head, and cauterize it in the middle of the olive-shaped cautery; and make two cauteries with the cautery called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair;
and beware of the artery that you do not cut.
And this is the form of the cautery that is called "clavilis":
When the eyelid is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery that is called "olivare". of which this is the form:
And if you wish, make two cauteries upon the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not leave the hand there except until the third part of the eyelid is burned, according to the manner that I have said.
from hair that pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyelids turn inward and prick the eye, and cauteries are made according to two manners: that is to say, by fire, or by burning medicine.
For cautery by fire, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they have grown and are even, then place the patient in your care; afterwards, mark on the skin of the eyelids a shape that is like the leaf of myrtle, and let the beginning of the sign be next to the hairs;
then place moistened cotton in egg white and parsley poultice over the eye, then heat the cautery with the shape described here:
Afterwards cauterize over the shape you have marked little by little many times, so that the heart is burned in that place;
and the sign of the success of the work is that you see the skin retracted, and the hairs raised at the puncture of the eye;
Then remove your hand, and leave it thus for three days, then apply moistened cotton in butter until the burning is gone; afterwards, treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if afterwards the hair grows, and the skin is softened, then recommence the cautery over the same place, as you did at first;
and if the hair is gone, cauterize it until the skin is raised to its natural position, and is even, and the hair does not prick the eye.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you instruct the patient to let the hairs grow large and even, then make the shape of a myrtle leaf from parchment;
then take of French soap and of live charcoal, of each one ounce, and grind them well together; and do it quickly, so it does not cool down, then spread it over the shape you have made, like the myrtle leaf, and place it on the skin of the eyes; and if the illness is in one eye only, one should work on one, and if in both, likewise. and place under the eye cotton soaked in egg white;
and the patient's head should be in your lap, and place your index finger on the medicine, and press lightly and move it every time the patient feels a burning sensation from the medicine, for they feel a burning sensation like fire.
When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine from your finger. And when the burning sensation has passed, raise the place with water, and see if you see the tissue raised as if it had been raised by the force of fire or by an incision; and if it is so, it is well.
If not, then again place medicine on the area where the medicine hasn't worked, until your efforts are equal, and your eyes are focused.
then place moistened cotton on butter until the burning sensation is gone, then treat the area with the ointment called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And if you need to be careful in your work, take great care that no medicine gets in your eyes.
And if the paper becomes soft afterward, and the hair pricks the eye, then repeat the medicine on that area of the paper that has softened properly, just as you did before; after treating it until it is healed;
and this is the form of the myrtle leaf:
And know that the eyes of men vary in size and smallness, and according to that should be your restraints;
and the right path should not be concealed from him who studies this art.
of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula as we have described in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments do not help, then it is necessary that you apply cautery to it in this manner.
Instruct the patient to place his head on your lap; and let the attendant hold his head between your hands in such a way that it does not move, nor does his head shift;
after place cotton soaked in egg white or in persillion juice on the eye;
after heat the cautery which is such:
and is shaped at the head like the shape of a swallow's feather, and to which the cautery is attached;
if you wish, it may be pointed from one end to the other, and if you wish, it may also be like a tent;
however, this one that is shaped is better for your work.
After press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the corruption, and dry it; and if it is closed, then open it, and draw out the pus;
after place the hot cautery firmly, and hold your hand to the cautery on the part near the eye, so that your hand does not cause harm; and place the cautery in the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If you come to the beginning of the cautery all the way to the bone, that would be good. If not, then repeat the cautery once more, and again if you need it, and leave it for three days;
After that, place moistened cotton in butter, and treat it with desiccant ointment until it is healed; and if forty days pass and it is not healed, then apply an acute corrosive medicine until the bone is uncovered; and proceed according to what would appear in its chapter.
And there is a manner of cautery of fistula that some of the ancients said. Understand a fistula, and open the place; Then place in the fissure a subtle camphor, of which this is the form: and there is made in the quantity of a lead. and hold your hand on the camphor firmly, and let the patient not move at all, so the melted lead does not run into their eye;
and it is necessary that one place on the patient's eye cotton moistened in egg white or in water:
The lead burns the fistula's place, and heals it with marvelous soundness.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have mentioned, that is good. If not, then it is necessary to administer a puncture to the nose, and to return the fistula to the body of the nose to its proper place.
Of cracks in the lips Very often cracks appear in the lips, called "poil," especially in children's lips.
When you treat these cracks with what we have said in the divisions, and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small, knife-like cautery according to this form:
And place it quickly onto those cracks until it reaches the bottom;
afterward, treat the area with a plaster until it is healed.
When an abscess develops at the root of the throat or in the uvula, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, after it creates decay and rottenness and becomes inflamed and turns into a fistula; and you treat it as we have said in the divisions, and it does no good: Then it is necessary for you to use cautery according to the size of the fistula; after the opening or hole of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and the deepest point;
and do so once or twice, after the treatment that we have mentioned in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is thus cured, it is good; and if not, then the area must be uncovered and the corrupted bone removed, according to what you find in its chapter.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth move, and you cure it with medicines, and that is of no use, then place the head of the sick person on your own healthy one; after that, heat the cautery with which its shape will come next in such a way that you place a rod over the tooth;
and quickly place the hot cautery inside, and hold your hand there until the patient feels the heat reaching the root of the tooth;
Then lift your hand and repeat the cautery as you wish;
Afterwards, let the patient fill their mouth with salt water, and let it remain an hour and then spit it out.
And in this way, the tooth that was moving is now fixed, and the soft gum is tightened, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
Of the pain of the teeth
When toothache comes from cold, or if there is cold or true cold, and the cures of medicine are not working, then there is need of cautery in two ways: and cautery with butter and cautery with fire.
Cautery with butter is such that you take cow's butter, and put the tip in an iron or bronze spoon; then take cotton and wrap it around the point of a tent, and dip it in boiling butter, and place it on the aching tooth quickly and hold it until it is cooled;
and thus do it often until its virtue reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, dip wool and cotton in cold butter, and place it on the aching tooth, and place hot iron so that the heat reaches the point of the tooth.
Cauterization with fire is such that you take an iron or bronze rod, and it should be thick enough so that the fire does not reach the patient's mouth;
after heat the cautery, from which the form will come after, and place it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery is cooled;
do this often, for the pain will be removed either that same day or the next.
And it is necessary for the patient to fill his mouth with good butter at the time of this cautery, and then wipe it out;
and this is the form of the cautery:
And make cautery of whatever head you want, and according to what you have the power to do;
and this is the form of the chain:
of the scrofulas When the scrofulas are of phlegm and cold moistures, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, then heat the cautery according to what is hereinafter the form, and have two openings for the fumes to escape to the cautery from the other side;
and place the hot cautery on the abscess once, or where it is needed, until it comes to the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it thus for three days; and put on cotton soaked in butter until the burning is gone;
afterward treat the place with ointments and dressings until it is healed.
When moisture prevails in the bronchial passages, and especially when it comes from a cold constitution, then the patient must first be purged by soluble medicines;
Afterward, apply cautery to the root of the throat, and be careful not to reach the throat itself, and do not burn the heart even a little.
Afterward, apply another cautery to the joint of the neck at the head of the spine, and let the cautery, which is called "clavile" whose form we have before us, be used.
and treat the area as we have said before until it is healed.
When coughs and lung illnesses are caused by cold moisture, and the patient has neither fever nor dryness, and the illness is long-standing, then apply two cauteries above the collarbone in empty spaces. and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts;
and let the cauteries, which are called "clavile," be according to the form that has been previously described.
And if you wish, make a cautery by pricking all the way through the cautery called "point," whose form is previously shown in the illness of the ears;
and let the points be up to thirty, or thereabouts.
After treating the place as previously described, and let the cauteries be in three rows according to this form:
And because the cauteries are lighter, because you make three at a time.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterwards, the patient should be supported on their back and side; afterward, lift the heart which is inside the titillite (with) the fingers of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated inside, heat the cautery which has two nerves, of which this is the form:
and cauterize the heart until it pierces the side, and the figure of the cautery would be the same as four cauteries;
and for this is made a cautery with the cautery that has three nerves, so the figure of cauterization are six cauteries;
and the nerves are according to the subtlety of a tent and this is the form of the cautery that has three nerves:
And sometimes one nerve is added to that, so there are eight cauteries.
Then put on the cautery for the burning with a seal; After make the patient rest, and let the limb be still for a long time until it is well healed.
And if it is dislocated above, which rarely happens, then make a cautery on the thick part of the cautery's handle, or many cauteries by pricking.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.
When chills and much moisture enter the stomach, so that they disturb its temperament, and phlegm multiplies within him, and the usual methods of treatment are ineffective, then the patient should be laid on their back, and extend their legs and arms. Thereafter, he makes three cauteries: one under the breastbone, the size of a finger, across the whole handle of the cautery; and two cauteries on the outside of the two ribs, so that the figure of the cauteries is a three-sided shape, and there is such space between each that they do not join together when they emit pus;
and let the cauteries be so deep that they reach both sides of the heart, and let the shape of the cauteries be according to this form without joining:
And if you wish to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form;
and he who fears this cautery, cauterize by pricking and marking upon the stomach at so many points according to the amount you wish to do; then cauterize with the whole cautery which is called "points".
After the treatment of the treatment that we have had before, until it is healed.
When the liver suffers pain from cold and moisture and great windiness, so that it is forced out of its natural complexion by superfluities; and the patient is treated with what we have said in divisions, and it does not help him, then the patient must be examined thoroughly; and mark three cauteries according to this shape and this figure and this quantity on the liver, to drive away the hypochondria, where the pain of the man comes;
and have a space between each cautery the thickness of a finger; and let the cauteries be the length of the body, and do not press your hand too hard on the entire cautery;
and let only half of the heart be burned, and let the patient be straight on his feet;
and if he cannot, let him lie down, and extend his legs, and raise his arms;
And if you wish, cauterize these cauteries with a scalpel, if you are skillful and wise in the art, and beware that you do not burn the entire heart, for you would dry up the entire body; and that it not reach the boil, for the heart is very delicate in that place, and you know this to be true.
When he has an abscess in the liver, and you wish to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient feels pain, but not too strong;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels fierce pain.
And when this treatment begins to work, the patient must be supported on his head;
and then drain the area where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery which is similar to a ray, of which this is the form: And cauterize with the cautery until the core is burned, and it comes down to the surface, until the perforation is completely healed;
after the treatment according to the treatment of dressings until it is healed;
and it is certainly not appropriate for anyone to use this cautery except for those who have long studied the art of medicine, and through whose hands these illnesses have often been cured.
Then he may confidently work, and yet I think it is better to leave it.
by cautery with a cauterizing iron
The ancients said that one should make cauteries with aristolochia roots, and in this manner: Take a long aristolochia root, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and also as thick and as long as your fingers; and soak it in oil, and heat it in the fire, and cauterize I cautery between the jaw and the neck, and II small cauteries a little further down in the area below the beard;
and II cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, sloping slightly backward; and I cautery in the middle of the breast, and I other on the stomach, and I between the two shoulders, and II on the two sides of the breast outside the cautery that is between the two shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but do it openly, as if smelling.
And some ancients said that some men used a fire cautery resembling a razor, and heat it and place it between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess; and the pain will quickly leave, as we have said in the abscess of the liver.
But in this work there is fear that the patient dies now, or a fistula comes that cannot be healed.
of the mouse
When you treat the disease of the mouse from what we have said about the divisions of cures, and it does not benefit at all, then three kinds of cautery are useful.
Of which one manner is that you make three, or four, cauteries, by drawing along the length of the mouse, according to the figure of the cautery of the liver that we have said before;
and do not press your hand too hard on the entire cautery, and let the patient often be on their back;
And another manner of cautery is that you heat the cautery which has two nerves, as we showed it in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and lift the heart that is in the place of the mouse, or the patient's elbow comes towards the left, and let the elevation with which you lift the heart be according to the heart, according to the length of the body, and the cauteries be according to the width of the body.
Afterwards, put the two inflamed nerves until the heart is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four.
And if you wish, cauterize with the entire cautery with three nerves.
After the cure, when it has cast off corruption for a long time, and this is worth more than the other cures mentioned before.
Cautery is of no use to a person with dropsy, except in the manner called "asclytes.
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in divisions, and your treatment does not help at all, then you must apply four cauteries around the belly, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, two behind the back on the spine, and one on the breast. And let the cauteries be close to the thickness of the skin.
Afterwards, leave the cautery open to discharge pus for a long time, and do not abandon the patient's treatment after the cautery. And healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will be combined with God's help.
The shape of the cautery for the belly should be the clavile that we have shown before. And that for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what has been stated previously.
When the feet of the hydrops patient are swollen, and full of yellow water, you should cauterize on the back of the foot between the auricular and annular bones. and raise your hand with the cautery without turning.
And do not enter too deeply, lest the yellow water should be forced out, and the cautery should be according to this shape:
After that, make two cauteries on each leg at the tip of the shin. and let the cauteries be long, one beneath the knee in front and the other outside, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open for a long time without treating, so that the fluid flows out;
after treating the other cures that we have mentioned.
When abdominal distress arises from cold and moisture, such that the powers of retention and digestion in the stomach and intestines are weakened, and cannot be cured by ordinary treatments; and you see the patient suffering greatly and with a strong constitution, then make a large cautery on the stomach according to what has been previously discussed, or a circular cautery of the stomach; and four smaller cauteries around the abdomen, one smaller cautery on each hip.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient suffering, then make a cautery on the navel, and one cautery on each flank, and two small cauteries on the stomach next to the large one, for the cure is beneficial when there is good assistance.
of the cure of hemorrhoids
When the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, one or more, and are old and are of large, cold, moist, corrupted humors, and have been treated as we have said in divisions, and it does not help at all, then apply cauteries: Three on the spine of the back, the one that is entirely outside the buttocks, little by little in a triangular shape, and one cautery under the abdomen two inches.
And if you think that his stomach is cold, and the food does not cook, and the face is seen to swell, then on the face, one large cautery on the stomach, as it has been said before, and one on the liver, and another on the spleen, to the point of the cautery; and leave the cautery open a long time. After the treatment, leave the place until it is healed.
When you cut the swelling, heat the cautery, which resembles a scraper, and then place it, all burning, on the cut swelling. and leave it there until the cautery reaches the beginning of the vein, from which the blood flows.
Do this once or twice, and if there is a lot of swelling, cauterize each one as we have said. after treating with ointments until they are healed;
and if you cauterize with a large cautery on the wound, it will provide greater help.
When the patient cannot tolerate incision or opening, which we will discuss in its place, such illness comes that cannot be healed except by cautery.
When a fistula appears on someone, and it is aged and casts forth putrid and corrupted moisture, you should probe it with a thin probe, and be sure to know the depth of the probe.
After heating the cautery, which resembles a scraper, and insert it into the fistula according to the amount that the probe has entered, and repeat the cautery until that putrid and corrupted flesh is burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to its need.
and beware of burning the nerves that are nearby, and the large veins.
If the fistula goes to the bladder and to the intestine, be careful of those places, and do not apply the fire except to fleshy areas, and consider that it is not penetrating.
Then treat the area until it is healed, and if the area is sealed, and the matter has been removed for a long time, then know that the area is completely healed.
And if the matter has not been removed, know that the area is open, and the bone at the bottom is corrupt. And thus, like one of those we will describe in its place.
When pain from cold comes to the kidneys, and from great windiness, and does not take on the nature of a woman, then you must cauterize the kidneys on one side and the other with the cautery we spoke of before.
And if we cauterize it in the middle, then there will be three cauteries in a line, and greater aid will be achieved.
Of the bladder When the bladder is weak and soft from cold and moisture, so that the patient retains urine, then cauterize on the outer part of the bladder, where the blade's point begins, one on the right and one on the left, and each cautery should be as long as the width of a fingernail.
And make one cautery on the back, or two if you need them.
And let the cauteries be shaped as previously described.
When the marrow is cold and damp, and does not allow conception, and the blossoms are corrupted and their ends delayed; and when they come, there is great pain. Then it is necessary that one make three cauteries around the buttock, as we have said in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries outside the back;
and let the cauteries be pointed, as we have said.
When viscous moisture descends into the socket of the hip, and for this reason it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together;
And if the place of the separation is found empty, then you should cauterize the patient on the hip socket with one cautery shaped like a circle, and mark it in front of the place around the socket as it rotates, so that the socket is within the circle;
and let the cauteries be like those used to cauterize the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available, make three large olive-shaped cauteries, and let the cauteries be as deep as all the heart-shaped ones;
and treat it until it is healed.
of the pain of the hip When pain comes to the hip joint, and it is from cold and moisture, and the patient is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment is ineffective, and the ailment is old: then it is necessary that you purge the patient of the large foul humors with fetid pills, or other similar good pills. After that, apply cautery;
and the manner of the cautery is according to two manners: that is to say, together burning medicines, and cautery by fire.
Cautery by fire is according to many manners, of which one is such:
that you cauterize above the hip joint three triangular cauteries according to this shape, and make them deep and wide, and have a space of the width of a finger between each cautery, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped;
Sometimes cautery is done in the middle above the head of the hip, so there are four according to this shape:
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circular cautery that we have previously mentioned in the dislocation of the hip;
but do it in such a way that the circle encompasses the entire hip, and all the flesh of the core is burned.
And this is the method used in sciatica, when the pain is in the hip, and does not extend to the thigh or leg.
And if it extends to the thigh and leg, then make two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle four fingers, slightly to the left side;
and let the cauteries be incisive, and let the thickness of the core be burned;
and if the patient feels the pain extend to the toe or near the heel, cauterize it where the pain is, three or four points with a cautery called "points". And if necessary, then make more.
And if the pain is below the knee toward the thigh, make a cautery with an incisive or circular cautery, and take great care in all your cauteries that you do not leave the cautery so long that you burn the nerves and large arteries, and that you do not cause the patient more harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen several who have made cauteries on the ankle of the foot, and left them so long that the leg was all swollen, and the foot as well, and the entire foot was pierced and corrupted. After a treatment of the belly from which he died.
And if the pain is in two parts together, make cauteries on each, according to this manner.
And the wise men said, concerning the cautery of the hip, that this is the manner: make one such iron, and let it be at the head as thick as a fingernail, or a little less, and let it be with notches, and from one notch to the other, the space of a finger's width;
and let the notches be opposite on two sides, and be like knots, and let there be one handle of iron well made;
and this is the shape:
And let it be heated until it is all red and throws sparks, and then place it on the affected hip joint, and let it be turned towards the healthy side;
and cauterize it once, and let it remain three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open a long time; after the treatment with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasim says that we rarely use this cautery because of the fear of its effects, and we see few who use it;
and nevertheless, it is a good cautery, for those who can endure it, and in the places where it is appropriate.
The cautery of burning medicine is done by making a device with crossbars where the edge of the opening descends, and it should be of bronze or iron, with one long side, and have two notches, and there should be the thickness of a finger between each. and let them be open in front and above, and they join together according to this form:
Then place the box of the hip on the sick person lying on their healthy side, and press your hand firmly on the hip box; then pour between the two circles of hot water that has been heated in the fire for a short time, and leave it for an hour, and the sick person endures the heat and burning.
For it finds mortification like that of fire;
and when the mortification is past, remove your hand with the instrument and remove the hip from the sweet water, and leave it for three days, and put on butter until that which is black from the scalding is removed; and leave it three days for the putrefaction to come out;
and that would be the final help after the treatment with ointments until it is healthy.
And if the pain has extended to the thigh or to the leg, make an instrument that stains with water according to what you have done to the hip similarly;
and that is the manner of hot water, and I have written it in the treatment of the rectification of medicine. Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in one new pot. where it has a small hole to let the point of a razor enter;
where it has a small hole to let the point of a razor enter; and put on top of that pot another pot well-sealed, and put on alkali and lime and sweet water above, so that there is one finger's breadth of liquid above the powders, once you have held it firmly in your hand;
and leave it like that until the water descends and drips into the sealed pot, then take all that water, and pour it over the lime and alkali as before.
And then it will be very strong and is administered in many medical treatments and for cauterizing other parts of the body.
For it works like fire, and there are other medicines used for cauterization, like the hip, as well as thistle, honey, anacardium, and lime with soap, all mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a treatment with which a man was cured of hip and sciatic pain, and he praises it highly, saying that no other treatment was given, and that he was healed in one single session after this treatment, and that he was bathed as he will teach afterwards.
And he says to take fresh and dry green litharge, and grind it finely with a little fat, and apply it to the hip, thigh and leg where the pain is located, and bandage it.
and leave it on for three hours, and to the extent that the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then have him enter the bath until his body is slightly wet, and put him in bed, and the pain will go away entirely and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with such medicines, unless it is after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic nerve is cauterized with goat's dung, it helps a lot.
and the cauteries should be done in such a manner. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the hollow that is between the big toe and the other, which is called the foscile.
Afterwards, take dry goat's dung, and heat it in the fire until it is embers, and place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
and do this again, and do not cease doing so until you believe through your senses that it has reached the hip, and that the pain is stopped;
and this method of cautery is called "cautery of the goat.
of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, whether through falling, or percussion, or through excessive evacuation, or through the spread of cold matter, none of these methods is suitable for cautery, except for that which comes from the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary, after the patient has been emptied of foul pills or similar things, to apply to the back, where the pain is, three lines of cauterization, and in each line five cauteries or more, according to the strength and quantity that the patient can endure;
and let the cauteries be made according to the cautery that is called "puncture";
and if you wish, make three or four cauteries on the middle cautery (or "clavil") according to this form:
This illness often comes to young children, and the sign of its beginning is that they have a tight chest when they stand up, and fear; and you find it in the lowest spine of the back, and in those appearances that come on the other spines.
When you see this and wish to cure it, cauterize it with a circular cautery according to this form. So that the cautery encompasses each part of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with a cautery that punctures two or three lines, and let the punctures be close together.
After curing the area, let it heal as we have said, and be careful not to administer cautery to a swelling that is in a nerve's area.
Of the pain of the joints
When pains in the joints are from moisture spread throughout the body's limbs, and when the pain is in the feet, which proper physicians call "podagra," and when it is caused by cold and medical cures cannot heal it, it is treated with cauteries in this manner:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if it is necessary that you prick on the sole of the foot, then make a cautery throughout the entire cautery called "point. And if the pains reach the knees and other joints, and this happens many times, then make three or four cauteries on each knee, of each part, the whole cautery olive-shaped;
and if you need more, then make more, but do not hold your hand too long on it, just until the flesh of the heart is burned.
And if the pains descend to the knee and back, then administer the cautery that we have described in its chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, then make pricks around the bone two lines;
and if any pain remains in the fingers, then make pricks on each joint and on the skin of the hand;
and if the pains come to the elbows or to the shoulders, then cauterize each part, and give good treatment to the patient and take medicines.
For if you give him good treatment and purge phlegm, he will be healthy with God's help.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the boil descends to the testicles, and it is new, then when you wish to treat it, he must not urinate that day; and that he use things that loosen the belly, so that the stool descends from his belly;
after that, make him sit on his back between your hands, and instruct him to hold his breath until the boil is repaired, and bring them to your fingers, and apply a sign below the rupture on the bone of the groin, and a complete sign that resembles half a circle above the body;
then heat the cautery with the shape of:
until it is white and emits sparks. Then return the bowels to their place; and let the attendant hold his hand over them so that they do not return.
and properly bind the patient's thighs, and place a cushion underneath him and a servant upon his thighs, and another upon his chest to hold his hands.
then place the cautery upon the mark with your entire hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, then begin again another time until you get to the bone. and carefully watch that the bowel does not jump when you are doing the cautery. that you do not burn it. and that through this the patient does not die, or other harm.
And know that when you do not come to the bone with the cautery, your work is worth nothing.
And it is necessary that the cauteries for children be subtle according to their size, and for large people also large according to their size.
after three days treat the cautery site with butter until the burning is gone.
afterwards apply other ointments until it is healed, and let the patient lie on their back for forty days until the wound is well-joined.
and it is necessary that his/her nourishment be light for a long time, so that the bowels do not swell when he/she tries to walk about.
And after forty days, when he wishes to get up, give him/her a well-made bandage, and keep it on for forty more days.
and let him/her have good rest, let him/her work little and beware of overeating and drinking, and of excessive exertion.
and when he/she follows this instruction, he/she will be completely healed.
And I will tell you next the treatment for cutting in its chapter.
When ruptures occur in other bellies and are known, and you see that they are no longer growing, use the cautery cautery according to its size, and let the third part of the wound be burned. after the treatment according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients have said that it should be cauterized with a three-angled cautery according to this shape:
But first mark the spot and make a line along the width above the rupture, and another outside, and then place your hand in the middle over the entire cautery, (or cauterizing tool)
But the first cauteries are lighter and milder.
of ancient pain in any limb When pain comes to any limb, from falling or hitting, and that pain lasts a long time, and the medical treatments are of no use, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with the cautery called "point," and the cautery should be according to the length of the limb and its smallness and weakness and its virtue and its location of twisting and its pain.
If it is healed from the first cautery, that is good;
if not, restart another cautery on that one, because such a custom is that it must move to the limb that is nearby, therefore it is necessary that you make the cauteries until the patient is healed.
Sores are sometimes helped greatly by cautery, and especially those that come from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it to be cauterized, be watchful if the illness is in its beginning, and if it is cured according to what we have said in the division, and it does not descend or linger, and you doubt that the corruption will spread to the entire patient, then make five cauteries on the head: One in the middle of the head, and another towards the forehead at the end of the hair; and two on the two temples, and one behind on the nape of the neck;
and let your hand do so that the cauteries reach the bone, and so that the scabs come out, so that the vapors of the thick humors can escape;
and cauterize on the mice according to what it is before.
And if the swelling is everywhere scattered; and if it loses its form obviously, you should cauterize it with these cauteries we have described: one cautery on the nose, two cauteries on the spine of the neck, six cauteries on the spine of the back, one large one on the rump and another beside it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the elbows, and two on the tendons of the breast, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and be careful of the nerves that are under the buttock, that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one cauterizes on the bone of the fist, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more you help, and the more the benefit.
And know that the sick person does not feel any pain from the cautery as healthy people do, because the body is already completely corrupted.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you find in the manner of the irons.
After the treatment, apply a mixture of flour of wheat with honey and other remedies until it is healed.
When swelling comes to any limb and is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and it is not yet healed, then you make cauteries on the limb according to the size and smallness of the limb;
and let the cauteries be a little deep into the flesh. then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes cauteries are applied to the hand, foot, and back, at the point of the nerve that numbs the limb, and in this way the swelling is removed;
However, no one should intervene unless they know the limbs and the points of the nerves moving the body.
When the disease called "albaras" has progressed, and the tools of medicine are of no use, then cauterize it with a cautery a little deeply, according to the thickness of the heart, until the whiteness is removed, and its color changed;
Then cure it with flour of vetch and lentils, with rose oil and plantain leaves, and blood of a colon and blood of an almond, one part of each; and let it all be mixed together, and be bound with a cloth, and be kept in air until it is healed.
The treatment of a sore by cautery
When a sore appears at the beginning, and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the sore.
And nevertheless, the wise say that one should also cauterize the middle of the sore;
and nevertheless, this does not seem good to me, for I fear that it may become ulcerated and corrupted, and I have seen it happen several times already;
and a more correct thing is that it be cauterized around, with the cautery called "circle," as we have said in many cauteries.
When someone has a disease called "adubelati," and it delays healing, either due to the excess it creates, or because of the patient's age when they are decrepit (that is, too old) and have little blood, or due to the time; and you wish to hasten its healing: then cauterize it around with many small cauteries by pricking; after that leave it thus. For it will hasten to heal.
And if you wish to pierce it with the whole cautery, heat the cautery like this form:
And place your hand in the middle of that illness called "adubelati" until the cautery has pierced the core, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it from the outside in such a manner that the course of the corruption is eased.
After that, treat it until it is perfectly healed.
There is another kind of illness called "corrodens," which is nothing other than a consuming of the limb, for it consumes the limbs just as fire consumes dry wood.
If you see this illness in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then heat the cauteries small and large, according to what is appropriate for the location where the illness is.
After cauterizing from all sides, until you have eradicated all corruption, and nothing remains of it, so that all that is corrupted is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and apply to the cauterized places softened poultices with oil, until the heat from the fire is removed, and all corruption.
After the treatment with ointments that generate flesh.
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh does not grow, that is good;
and if not, then repeat the cautery on whatever remains of the corrupted places.
And this lesion is sometimes cured with sharp medicine instead of fire cautery;
However, fire cautery is of greater help, and I have already described the treatment with sharp medicine in the division: Take it when you need it.
of the sores that come to the feet Often it happens that on the feet, from outside, a disease arises which is called "clos" according to our understanding, and is a large, foul-looking thing that hurts the foot.
And the cauteries for this disease are according to two manners. That is to say, cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Cauterization with fire is that you heat a cautery iron, just like a vaulted roof, and it should be made of good iron, sized so it can grasp the ulcer from all sides, and that it has subtle margins;
Afterwards, put it hot on the ulcer, and turn your hand all around the ulcer until it reaches the bottom of the ulcer; and leave it thus three days until it begins to throw off pus; then make him a poultice of wild mallows crushed with salt, and leave the poultice on all night, and the ulcer will fall away and be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the area with an ointment that heals flesh until it is healed.
And if they are turned outward on the body, and this often happens on the hands and feet, you must apply a cautery with hot water; and is of such a nature: take a copper or iron rod, or a pointed bit, and apply it to the ulcer and the ailment, which is to say for warts; and apply the rod so it encompasses the entire area, then put a little hot water on it, and hold your hand firmly, and press your hand while turning so the edge of the rod reaches the root of the ulcer, and allows the hot water to travel deep to the root;
and let the patient endure a little the burning of the hot water for an hour; then leave it like that, and it will uproot itself from all its roots.
Do this one after the other, until you have removed all those on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
When someone trembles from cold nerves, or from a quartan fever or other, you should make four cauteries on the spine of the back, one cautery between each spine; and one cautery on the feet, and one on the stomach with an olive-shaped cautery;
This will stop the trembling, and the patient's health will recover from the cold sickness.
Sometimes, foul-smelling pustules appear on the body, caused by corrupted matter.
If they appear, a cautery should be applied to the head of each pustule first. A subtle cautery of myrtle wood, whose tip is heated in fire, or of long aristolochia root, or a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the start, when they appear, in this manner, and they cannot grow any further, but the superfluities from which they arose are broken, and they heal.
But it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of blood.
Many times great flows of blood occur from the artery that is cut in the wound that comes from external causes, or in the incision of an abscess, or in the cautery of the limb, and similar things; and it is a very grievous thing to staunch.
And yet, when this happens to anyone, quickly place your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press firmly until the blood is stilled beneath your finger, and no more drips out;
then put the olive-shaped cauteries, several small and large ones, into the fire until they are all red-hot;
then take one, large or small depending on the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and place the cautery onto that vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stanched.
And if it spurts out strongly when you remove your finger from the vein, and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another cautery from the fire.
And do not cease to do this, one after the other, until the blood is stopped;
and be careful not to burn the nerve that is nearby, and that no other harm comes to the patient;
and know that when blood flows from the artery, it cannot be well stanched, especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four methods that we have mentioned: or by cautery, or by extraction if it is not treated, or by a strong tying of thread, or by medicines applied that have the power to stop blood; and be bound and held tight afterward.
Whoever applies a styptic by tightly binding bandages or applying burning things, or other similar things, will not profit much.
And if this happens to someone and they do not have a styptic or medicine present, they should put their index finger over the wound of the vein as we have said, and extend it well until it is stanched over the wound and over the vein; and do not move the finger, but wet it with cold water often, that it be very cold, until the blood is congealed and thickened and stanched;
and make inquiries beforehand regarding the cauteries and medicines needed.
We have told you in the first chapter all illnesses in which fire cautery, or burning medicine, is appropriate, and the reasons and causes, and the instruments and forms of cauteries;
and have arranged that chapter from head to foot, and I will proceed through this chapter in the same way so that one can more readily find what one wants.
And before I begin this, dear son, you must understand that this chapter involves more peril and fear than the first on cauteries, and therefore requires greater caution.
For in the work of this chapter, there is often an evacuation of blood when opening a vein, and incising an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in cutting into stones, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and death comes to many.
And I warn you not to undertake folly. For many kinds of people come for cures. For some come with such anger towards their illness that they die easily because of the fury they find in their illness and the severity of their malice; and of these one should be afraid.
And of these there are those who give you their sense, and say: wait, I am cured"; and the illness is spiteful.
You should not agree with those who come to you with this manner, but place more importance on your honor than your greed, and do not act foolishly but wisely concerning that of which you are certain, and from which you can obtain praise.
and use prognostication and indication in the treatment of your patients, so that health may be restored;
and this will help you acquire good renown, glory, and a memory of praise.
Dearest son, Our Lord grant you good understanding and righteousness, and may you wish to be inspired by the holy inspiration of his hand, amen.
Now I have ordered this chapter in divisions, according to what is before, or the chapter on cauteries, which I have described from head to foot, so that you may more easily find what you need.
Know that this illness often comes to children during childbirth, and when the mother pulls the child's head too tightly;
and sometimes it comes from an unknown cause.
And I never saw this illness outside of children, and in all those I have seen, death hastened. And therefore, it seems to me that it is better to leave such treatments alone.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and whose head grew larger each day until he could not support it.
and the moisture increased so much that he died, and this moisture is gathered beneath the bone on the surface, between the heart and the bone;
and the treatment is such that if the moisture is between the heart and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you split open a wide fissure in the head;
and be as long as two fingers, until the moisture flows out.
and see here the form of the spatula:
If the moisture is deeper, and the abscess is larger, then make two fissures in the manner of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is under the bone, and the signs are that you see the seams of the head open on each side, and the pus jumps out when you press it with your hand inside, and this is not resolved: then it is necessary that you split the head into three fissures according to this method:
And after the incision, remove all the moisture outward. Afterwards, bind the fissures with bandages and powders, and put wine and oil on them, and leave it like this until the fifth day;
then unbind it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and leave the head to be bandaged evenly, and give the patient dry food with little moisture until the limb is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you look at the size of the abscess, and the collection of water;
for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes to the right; and sometimes to the left.
Then cut there where the abscess is apparent, and the filling of water, and cut it according to what you are able to do;
and beware that you do not cut the artery; and if blood flows, so that the patient dies from the flow of blood and the evacuation of moisture.
When a disease called "catarrh" occurs in someone's eyes or chest, and the illness is longstanding, and the treatment of medicine does no good, then the final cure is cautery, with this, they will cut the two arteries.
It is necessary then, when you are about to cut them, that the patient hold his head back; After that, they rub the place with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient tightens his neck with the entire cloth; Then look at where the veins are, and the places of one and the other are near the ears, and the spots are rejoined;
Then mark the places, then cut one and the other with a sharp spatula from two sides, until the incision reaches the bone, and this be by the width of the head.
And if you wish, put the spatula under the artery and cut above it, cutting as you should through it.
And when the vein is cut, the blood will leap out continuously upward.
And if the artery does not appear upon feeling, you must measure the space of three fingers, then mark and cut down to the bone;
and that which is necessary to draw out of the blood is six ounces, and perhaps a little more or less, according to what the patient can tolerate, and the fullness of the artery.
then examine the wound: if a small piece of the bone remains on the surface, cut it so that inflamed abscesses do not come about, then constrict the wound and bind it, and apply ointment to heal it.
of migraine When a chronic migraine comes, and an acute catarrh, due to moisture from tears and heat in the temples, and chronic madness and similar things, and he is treated with various medical remedies and none of this benefits him, we would extract the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have described.
And the method of extracting them is that the patient should pull back the hair of his temples, and find the artery that shows itself in the temple, for it shows itself clearly by its beating, and is scarcely perceptible in the outer regions, except in some very cold individuals.
And if it is perceptible, the patient should tighten its neck with some cloths, then rub the area with a rough cloth, and bathe the area with hot water until the artery becomes clearly apparent; then take the spatule, of which this is the form: then scrape the skin lightly until you reach the artery, then pull it upwards with pincers, and separate it well from the tissues that are underneath it on each side;
and if the artery is thin, then turn it with the point of the hook, and cut it from that part according to the quantity of two heads. For if it is not cut, the blood will not flow completely.
And draw the blood from six (c, presumably meaning cups), down to three;
and if the artery is large, you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that no rot comes before the healing of the wound, and bleeding occurs.
then cut the excess that is between the two ties at that same time, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with a knife cautery down to the bone until the heads are cut off;
and that is the best work, if the patient does not have a fever and is of a hot complexion. For cauteries are a help to end moisture: Therefore, it is of greater help for moistures.
Where it is necessary for the extraction of arteries that one fill the place with old cotton and place on well-made bandages;
and when they are unbound, they should be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with bandages, until they are healed;
and if blood flows from the artery as long as you work on it, then hurry to cauterize it, or fill the place with vitriol and hold it with your hand so the blood is stopped; and if you do not have this present, then place your finger on the area until the blood is congealed, and wash the area with cold water until the blood stops, and hold it as is necessary;
And there should be one finger's width of space between the two blades, and then when you have marked the two areas, and you place the burning iron on it until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and they should be separated between the two sides, because they are not completely fused by this cautery.
and this is the shape of the cautery:
And the most gentle and easier way to extract the artery is to cauterize the vein with this sharp cautery from two sides, but the sharp edges should be thick to hold their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it holds its heat less.
of tears When tears from the eyes flow down the veins on the head, and no medical treatment helps, and you see the patient's face turn red, and feel tremor-like movement on the forehead; and where the skin is thin and moist, so that the hair on the skin has fallen out, and the skin is hot, and scorched by the heat of the tears, then this treatment is needed. And the ancients called it "contusive treatment," and you should do this to the patient who has this illness: shave the hair from their forehead, then make three equal lengthwise cuts on the forehead;
And the ancients called it "contusive treatment," and you should do this to the patient who has this illness: shave the hair from their forehead, then make three equal lengthwise cuts on the forehead; and one of the cuts should be in the middle of the forehead, going down to the nose, and the other two along either side of the skin, and be careful to avoid cutting any arteries that are along the sides of the skin.
and keep your hand away from the junction of the two jawbones, and each wound should be about three fingers wide.
and have prepared a sponge and many cloths to wipe away the blood, then apply a pointed spatula from both sides, like this:
from the incision that is next to the temple to the second incision; and scrape all the flesh between the two cuts on the entire surface above the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second one, and then remove this spatula. then insert into the first cut the instrument called a "cultellaire", which is very sharp on one side, and on the other side is blunt, not sharp, and this is the shape:
And place the sharp side of the knife towards the flesh next to the heart, and the blunt side towards the bone, and push it until it reaches the middle cut.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous to the one that opens from the heart, and then do the same in the middle cut to the other one.
and then draw out the blood equally, and squeeze the area for the blood taken.
then place a tent of old cotton in each cut, and put over cloths soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and guard so that hot abscesses do not come there.
and on the third day loosen the bandage, and apply a large amount of lukewarm water, then treat with basil ointment with rose oil, and other treatments with which wounds are treated, until it is healed.
When some people have a sudden cold coming on, and you see the eyes swollen and small, and vision weakening, and the eyelids burning; and the hair falls out, and there is sharp pain in the head, and the patient sneezes; Then know by these symptoms that that matter and that cold comes from many veins, and the best cure for it is this.
And you should tell the patient to lean back, then make a large incision through their forehead, and another through the wide area of their head. And begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision go down to the bone; and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move when eating;
and when the bone is exposed, wipe away all the blood with a sponge, and then separate the two edges of the incision and put old cotton and linen strips in there; then bind over it cloths soaked in wine and oil, and be careful of a hot abscess;
when it is removed, you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow there, then treat it with things that dry up and cause flesh to grow.
In such a manner: Take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and make a poultice; and apply it to these wounds to make flesh grow everywhere.
of the stoppage of the ears
All that falls into the ears is one of the four things: or grains, or an animal, or a mineral stone or similar things like iron; or seeds, such as acorns, beans, peas; or flowing things such as water and oils and similar things.
When a stone or another object falls into the ear that does not adhere to or grow within the ear, place the ear in the sun.
If you see the stone, then distill a small amount of violet oil or sesame oil, then administer extraction; and make him sneeze with a condiment, and plug his nostrils when the sneezing comes, and put pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and extend the ear upwards.
Often, pus comes out by this treatment;
and if it does not come out, then administer extraction with fine forceps, of which here is the form:
If it comes out with the forceps, it is good;
If not, then administer extraction with a fine, small double-bladed lancet;
and if it does not come out by that, make a copper chain and put the head of the chain into the hole of the ear firmly, and seal what is around the chain with soft wax so that the wind cannot enter with the chain; then pull it out firmly, for many times it comes out, as we have said;
and if it does not come out in such a way, take a glue that birds are caught with, and put some tool that is ready for this onto it, and place a little cotton around it; then press the glue onto the stone or whatever it may be, and pull out.
And if it does not come out by all these things that we have said, hasten to lance the ear before a hot abscess comes there and a spasm;
and the method of the lancing is that you first make the patient bleed from the cephalic vein, and draw blood according to the measure of its potency, then have the patient sit between your hands and turn the ear upward, and make a small incision in the root of the ear at the fat or dependent area; and let the incision be like a crescent moon, until you come to the stone, then remove it according to your ability, and suck it quickly into your mouth;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is a grain that is inside and it swells, administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, administer a thin, subtle spatumile according to this form: and administer an incision to that grain.
But do not do this when you think the grain is moist because of ear moisture, until you have made many pieces;
then extract with delicate tweezers and suction, as we have said, so that the extraction is eased.
In the water that falls into the ear, the patient must first use sneezing remedies and stuff the ear with old cotton. And let him lie on that same ear where the water is. If it should leak out by this, it is good.
If not, he takes many stones, according to the length of your finger, small and light, and warms them a little in the fire; and the patient puts one or more in the opening of his ear, and rises up on his feet on the other side, and places another stone on top of the stone that is in the ear; and does not cease to put stone on stone until the water comes out entirely, and thus it leaks out entirely;
and if you wish, he takes a reed, and puts one end in the ear, and the other end holds over fire until the most of the reed is burned;
then do the same with other reeds until the water comes out completely, as we have said about the stone.
In the extraction of a creature, if it is small, such as a flea and similar things, treat it as we have said in the division;
but if it is large enough to be felt, administer extraction with pincers; and this is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In the extraction of embedded worms in the ears, when you treat it as we have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and the treatment does not work, then you must examine the ear in the sun: if any worms appear, extract them with fine pincers, and if none appear, take the implement of which this is the shape:
And it should be narrow below and wide above. And place the finest end into the ear according to the extent of the patient's suffering, then suck strongly on the entire implement; do this repeatedly until all the worms exit.
And if they do not obey to exit, plug around the implement with cotton, as I have said concerning the stone;
and if they do not leap forth, as we have said, then administer distillations that the ancients have tested in the killing of worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations;
and distill your oils and medicines into the ear using this instrument, of which the form is as you see: And it is of silver or brass, narrow beneath with small holes, and open above for distilling;
and to press the distillation with a well-made brass instrument for this, and if you wish, take a scraper and wrap cotton around the pointed end; then pour your oil or juice, and whatever medicine you want into the tube, and the tube should be in the ear;
then put the scraper with the cotton inside, and press gently with your hand until the oil is distilled into the ear's cavity; and the patient smells it inside, and let the distillation be a little heated by the fire before distilling it into the ear; and guard that it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be very good.
of the stopping of the ears
No child is born who does not have any holes in their ears;
and this same thing happens to men from the stoppage of a wound, or from flesh growing inside the ear, and these stoppages sometimes go deep into the ear, so that one cannot see them;
and sometimes there is a little bit of pus coming out of the hole, and one sees it clearly.
That which goes deep, which one cannot see, is of difficult healing in many cases, and in that which one can see, you must place the patient's ear in the sun; and look inside: if you see the obstruction clearly, if you treat it with all the instruments of which this is the form:
And let it be sharp and cutting both in front and behind, smooth so as not to injure the ear;
If the obstruction is of flesh born or of the cartilage of the ear, then hold it with fine forceps and cut it lightly, until all the flesh is removed.
And if the obstruction is deep within the ear, then take a fine, light scraper, heat it slightly in the fire, and then place it on the cartilage of the ear.
If you sense the obstruction of which the patient feels pain when hearing, pierce lightly, and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear;
Then place a tent in the ear according to the width of the opening, and moisten it with Egyptian ointment. Do this for a few days until the wound is healed, or take a tent and moisten it in rose water, and powder it with crushed vitriol;
and if you see the ear swollen, you must remove the tent and apply another tent moistened in a cerote made of rose oil and wax, until the swelling is gone; then treat it until it is healed.
And if a discharge of blood comes, dip a sponge and cloths in cold water, and place it on the ear, and use other treatments that stop the discharge of blood, which are in the treatment of distillations.
This affliction, which comes in papillomas of the eyes when they are moist and dry, requires that you extend them with tweezers and forceps, and cut them with a spatula from their roots; then put powdered vitriol on the area.
And if blood flows, cauterize it with a thin lens cautery, and the cauterization after the incision is worthwhile.
and many times they return, as long as anything remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
of hail Many times, there come in the eye sockets things that resemble hail in shape and hardness, and for this reason this disease is called "grandine," and it is a collection of thick moisture in the eye sockets above and below; The work is such:
The work is such: Watch if the grandine moves from side to side, and that is an easy thing to know;
Then cut it open wide, then lightly scrape it from each part, then take it with tweezers and cut it.
If you cannot cut it without piercing the eye socket a little, then do not harm the patient;
And if the fissure is large, assemble it with stitches, and treat it until it is healed;
And if it is small, do not use force, for the ointments will quickly restore it and generate flesh.
And if the gravel is descending into the inner ear toward the upper part, turn the eye socket, and pull the gravel out with tweezers, and cut it and press it from one side and the other;
And if the eye socket is displaced by the incision, this causes no harm;
And when the gravel is cut, wash the eye with salty water, and treat the area with what generates flesh until the patient is healthy.
Of the fat of the eyes Exinach is a fat that is generated in webs of the eye sockets, and this happens more to children than to adults, and it causes their eyes great suffering.  Catarrh comes to them in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight because tears rush to their eyes.
And because of this, they often lie on their faces and sleep, and their eye sockets below their eyebrows are dampened, because swelling and appearance are covered by the exinach, which appears in the eye. And when you press the area with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the method of treatment is that the patient places their head in your bosom;
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the shape of a circle according to the amount of exinach in each part, then place it over it; and press with your fingers on either side, so that the exinach is gathered within the circle;
then cut into the middle of the moisture with a sharp instrument, a slit of the appropriate width, and not any larger than a blood-letting incision from a vein;
and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach; and in various ways exinach comes from the slit, according to the shape of a piece of white fat.
Then remove it entirely with a piece of cloth held between your fingers, and turn your hand to the right and left until it is dispersed;
and be careful not to add anything to the slit, so as not to reach the entire spatumile to the eye, lest you injure it.
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the slit, then slightly widen the slit a little until it appears;
then remove it as we have said, then moisten cloths in oil and water, and place over the place, and bind tightly with bandages.
And some people grind salt and put it on to corrupt the moisture that remains.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if there comes a hot abscess to the place, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
of the hairs of the stones When extra hairs grow on the stones, and are old, they harm the eyes, and cause various illnesses such as customary tears and softening of the stones and albuginea, so that it is the cause of destruction of the eyes;
and the cure is according to four manners: or by cautery with fire, or by sharp medicine according to what is before, or the chapter on cautery, and it is done either by incision and stitching or by cauterization, according to what I will say.
You must place the patient's head on your lap, then turn the stone of the eye to your left hand;
if it is turned, that is good; if not, then put a needle along the entire thread on top; and let it be next to the edge of the stone where the hairs grow next to these hairs, and draw the thread over the entire stone, and turn it with a scraper;
then cut in the part below the stone, beneath the attached hairs, cutting all the way, from the large tear duct down to the small one;
then remove the thread, and put a small tent of cotton and linen beneath the stone, then place a figure of an incision on the stone, like the leaf of myrtle, and nevertheless, the figure must be according to the quantity you wish to raise the stone which is divided into all.
And if there is such a need, that a large quantity of the stone be cut according to the softening of the stone;
then cut along the entire space above the two lines you have marked, and begin from the large tear duct down to the small one; and let one of the incisions be close to the natural hairs, the thickness of a root, then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the core, then scrape the entire thing.
then bring the two edges together with a stitch of a fine thread needle, and wipe away the blood, and dry the excess threads over the two brows with some gluey substance, if you wish to do so.
and if not, do not treat it, then leave the stitches and threads for three or four days.
then treat the wound without stitches with drying and constricting substances, for the paper adheres to the wound and its assembly, but stitching is weaker (as the ancients said), and this is a painless procedure. and if there is another method:
and if there is another method: and it is that you shape the paper into a shape like a myrtle leaf, as we have described, in three separate sections according to the form that is here:
then cut what rises above with small, equal forces, according to the form that is here:
And if you are unable to hold the tongs, and the thing is not equal, take a needle with one thread and insert it into the shape; and place one thread next to the large tear, and the second thread next to the small one, and hold the threads evenly between your fingers;
then raise your hand equally, and lift all the skin above what you have marked, as we have described, then bring together the two edges of the wound with stitches and treat it until it is healed;
and if an abscess comes to your incision, soothe it with cerote and similar softening ointments;
and sometimes it happens that the hair on the skin is converted:
if so, you must use what we have said about the incision;
but the stitching in one and the other is more artificial.
The treatment of canes is according to this form: and it is that you convert the skin and the wound according to what I have said, and then make two canes by art, and two thin bands as long as the skin and the width of the spatula is; and cut as two ends of two parts where you hold the threads;
then assemble one and the other subtly over what rises from the skin of the eye, and bind the two canes of the two parts tightly; and leave it thus for some days, and the skin that is bound will die and harden and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it delays, then cut it with a sharp force, then treat it until it is healed;
and when the wound is healed, and the skin is raised, and the hairs will no longer prick;
and this is the form of the two canes that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity of length and width:
The work is such that you take a fine needle, and put a fine and soft silk thread in it; then assemble the ends and tie one and the other subtly, and let the length of the threads be one palm long;
then arrange in the chase another fine silk thread briefly, and tie the ends of the thread;
then place the patient's head on your chest;
and let it be beside the sun so that the work is clear, for it is a subtle and small work, then put the needle with all the chase into the root of the hair closely, and pierce it through the skin quickly until you pull it through above the natural hair;
then pull the hair out to the top of the chase, and put that hair into the chase, if there is one or two or three or more;
then pull your hand away so that the hairs come out of the whole chase into the skin with the natural hair.
And if the chase is pulled out and the hairs do not come out with it, then pull the chase back beneath along all the thread that you have ordered it, until the chase comes out of the opening above and you see it through the vision of the eye;
then you will pull out the chase and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair heals in its place and the flesh grows;
and if the hair is small, then attach one long hair from the natural ones and let it be lifted up with that one, or leave it until it is lengthened, and then lift it.
of the corruption of the eye When this illness, which is called "aleacrati" or corruption, comes to the eye, there are two types of it:
one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it happens through the inflammation of a wound, or from a cut or cautery, and similar things.
And the way to treat it is that you split the inflammation, and separate its edges, and put linen pads inside, and bind it until it is healed;
and you should not use things that dry and constrict in treating it. For if you do that, the illness will return worse than before;
but use softening things, such as fenugreek; and irrigate with water or cooked flax seed, and ointments of diachylon melted into any oil, and wrap a pad in it, and treat it with this.
And the secret of your treatment is that you must take care that it does not heal in the same shape as before;
and these works which we have said are only remedies for this illness, so that it does not return in the same form as before.
This illness, which is truly called "axacrati," is both natural and accidental.
The accident comes from wounds and cuts and cautery and similar things;
And the method of treatment is that you take a needle, on which there is double thread, and pierce the flesh, from the left tear duct until it reaches the right, so that the thread comes out in two points on the flesh;
Then stretch the flesh over the entire needle, and cut it with a spatula wide. And if the shape of the paper returns according to what is necessary, it is good;
If not, take a rasp and place it in the cut, and turn the paper, and make two cuts on the sides inside the paper;
and let the points of the two cuts be at the two corners of the incision you have made, and let the angles be such that when they are assembled, the shape is like the shape of a letter called "I Greek";
then remove that flesh, according to the amount that its edges are sharp below, from what was under the paper, then join the two separated parts, and sew them with a woolen thread;
then treat it with what we have said about softening medicines and poultices until it is healed.
And if the ailment comes from a cut, or stitching, or cautery, then you must make a clean cut beneath the hairs of the papers, and according to what is said before; then separate between the two edges of a poultice, as I have said;
then separate between the two edges of a poultice, as I have said; and one must do the work according to the form of the disease, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise masters devise remedies with all their power so that it may return to its natural form;
and the patient himself, according to what work and instruments are required in various conditions.
When this joining happens to men in such a way that the paper on top is glued with the white of the eye, and cannot move or do its natural work, then you must put the tip of a razor under the paper, and lift it up;
and extend it with tweezers, until you cut what is attached to the delicate spatula, which should not be too sharp nor too sharp, so that the patient cannot endure the too sharp spatula injuring the eye;
and make your incision, with which you scorch that assembly, lightly, so that the paper returns to its natural form;
and the entire assembly is healed, and sometimes they make a saline solution in the eye, and wash it with fresh water and poultices;
then place a linen tent between the paper and the eye, and put wool soaked in abundance of egg on the eye; and after the third day use poultices and healing things until it is healed.
Know that the nail is according to two types: It is nervous and resembling hard skin, and another that is not nervous, but is like frozen white moisture; and when one touches it with iron and tries to remove it with tweezers, one cannot.
And both types begin near the large tear duct, and grow little by little until they cover the entire sight, all the light, and the movement of the eye.
And the manner of the incision is that the patient places their head in your hand, then you open their eyes; and lift the paper in your hand, then remove the nail with small tweezers, and extend it above. Then take a needle, and put a horse's hair, or a cow's, or an ox's, and strong thread; and double the point of the needle a little and place it in the middle of the nail, and pierce it all the way through with the needle, and tie the nail with thread and extend it above, and scrape all the hair from the side of the nail that touches the pupil and the silk with hair to the head, then cut the rest at the root of the tear duct with subtle and small forces, and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct so that the flow of tears is not disturbed by the incision;
and sometimes the nail is extended only with the forceps and with the thread, as we have said. Then one scrapes it with all the soft spatumile of which this is the form:
And be careful that the spatumile does not touch and break the fleshy tissue, and that the pupil is not pierced;
and after the incision, put a little of boiled salt and lead-based eye medicine in the eye, and leave it until the next day; then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not nervous, and you cannot push the needle, and the lancet cannot enter, this kind of nail is often cured with medicines;
and they grow as I have described in the division, and if you want to cut it, open the patient's eye and take a small, sharp spatumile according to this shape: And carefully cut the nail from above, and if you see it getting smaller and the flesh is pressing in, then distill lead-based eye medicine, red eye medicine, and boiled salt from your mouth into the eye, and cover the eye until the next day;
If something prevents you in the eye, such as a boil, then leave it, and first treat the boil until it is healed, then repeat the procedure as before until it is healed.
then repeat the other procedure according to this same method until it is completely removed.
And if the appearance of the tear duct tissue hurts the eye with great harm, then suspend it from the hook, and cut off a part of it, and not all of it, so that the tears do not come out;
then distill red eye medicine, which is made of lead, into the eye.
Sometimes red flesh grows in the eyes of some people, and covers the pupil and stretches over the eyelids and turns to a blush, and resembles a pomegranate flower.
and the treatment is that the patient put their head in your lap, then open their eyes, and pull all that flesh to hooks suitable for this, and hold it tight by force;
then cut off the first layer of flesh, and keep cutting with a razor until the end, and be careful not to injure the eye in the process;
and let the incision be of the spatula that we have mentioned in the incision of the nail and with little force by which one removes the scab, as the form after this chapter shows.
and when the incision is complete and all the flesh removed, then apply the eye with silkworm or you distill red colic and similar corrosive medicines, and place over the eye a linen cloth with a bandage of egg white, so that it is secure from a hot abscess;
and if anything remains, and the blood boils and you suspect a hot abscess, then leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that soothe a hot abscess;
then return to your work until it is healed, and thus do when many layers of flesh are added to the eye in this manner.
However, it is necessary that you alleviate the treatment of each eye weak in its natural way; and from the accidental way, in the work of iron;
and do not put your hand on any of these works until you see that this limb is enduring that work.
There are red veins covering the eye, and they hinder its function and weaken the eye daily.
It is necessary, therefore, that you first examine if the eye, in which the blood vessel is, is strong, and there is no other illness other than the blood vessel; then the eye in this manner:
instruct the patient to place their head on your chest, then squeeze those veins with the entire instrument according to his wisdom, and let the instruments be thin and double according to this shape:
And let there be two instruments in a row according to this shape:
then, when the eye has force those veins subtly, and wipe the blood hour after hour, until you see those veins removed from the eye;
and be careful that you do not injure the eye with the tips of the spatulas, and do this work at midday before the sun, and be very diligent in your work so that you do not cut anything but those veins;
and when you have done this, instill green and red bile into the eye to corrupt what remains of the pus.
And if you cannot collect all of it at that time, make a plaster on the eye of things that soothe eye pain, and leave it for a few days until the pain is relieved and it is certain that the inflammation has subsided, then start again according to this method that is before until it is healed;
and this is the form of the forces:
The mire are called "arissati" fistula:
When you treat it with cautery and with burning sharp medicine according to what I have said before, and it is not healed, then you must carefully cut open the abscess, where it should be cured, and remove all the moisture that is there, until the bone is exposed.
And when the bone is exposed, and you see the corruption and blackness, remove it with all the tools of which the form is here;
and is called "aspre chief", and be made of iron, pointed at the head, and be pointed like a file, as it is in the present form:
And place it on the place of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that the corruption is removed;
and do this several times, then restore the place with drying medicines.
if the wound is closed, and flesh grows, and the body of the swelling is closed, and it remains like this for 40 days, and it does not renew and is not inflamed, and no bad accident comes to it, know that it is healed;
if not, there is no other remedy than to return the fistula to the opening of the nose according to this form: and that you uncover the bone a second time with iron, and with sharp medicines, and when it is uncovered, take a drill according to this form, and let the iron point have three angles, and the shaft be sharpened to the end as you see here:
then place it on the bone next to the tear duct, and move your hand away from the eye a little, then turn the entire drill until it pierces the bone, and the patient feels it because wind comes out if he holds his hand over his nose;
and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the wound hardens, the matter goes to the nose; so it is a lighter thing for the patient.
When the eyes are completely open, and there is no disturbance in the nose, nor any lessening, then you must bind the patient;
then heal it, then put leeches or cupping glasses on it without striking to draw the moisture, then put over the eye a compress made of acacia, aloe, frankincense and sarcocolla, and then constrict the eye, and place the plaster over it with bandages and cloths;
and the way of the cloths is that you take cloths soft enough, and double each one in four, and then place one over the other according to the quantity the eye needs;
then constrict it over a hard bandage tightly, and renew the cupping glasses to draw the moisture without striking;
then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye constricted day and night, and if the compress softens, then you must constrict it strongly;
then remove the compress after the day and the night, and if you see the eye recovering, that is good;
if not; then renew the plaster, the bandages, the compress, and the cupping glasses until it is healed.
from the tearing of cloth or skin When disruptions occur in the skin, it then opens, and pus flows from the sores like grains of resin, and is frightful to behold;
Then, if you see it cut, the work is such that you put a needle into the root of the affected area down to the surface, then put another needle where there is a double thread from the tear's edge. and pierce it, and leave the first needle in its position.
Then cut the double thread and tie a part of the skin around, and tighten it well, then pull out the needle and put a wet wool dressing on top of abundant egg white;
and leave it until the thread comes off with the skin, then treat the eye with comforting things until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is constricted by the skin on each part of a cloth circle, until it is healed.
And if the eye shows great appearance, then pierce it with a very thin needle that goes deep into the eye, and draw out the whitish moisture and lower the eye, and it will enter promptly;
then pull it out until it is healed.
This illness, called "alcunnati," is nothing more than swelling gathered in the eye, resembling a descending sharp point, and it is not truly a sharp point;
and the method of the work is that you should have the sick person sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take the head between your hands on both sides, and move it until you see the swelling rise above your eyes; then it should be fixed, and not descend, and the light should be clear, and the sick person should see things as he used to;
and if it does not descend below, know that it is an affliction, and if the descent of the swelling is not arranged as we have said.
then have the sick person sit between your hands, then take the fine spatula and cut a small opening into the cornea along the conjunctiva's continuation with the cornea and the crown, until the swelling comes out;
and when it has come out, then instill into the eye hot water mixed with honey, or water or fenugreek boiled and honey, then it should be treated with other remedies until it is healed.
of the afflictions of the eye We have already discussed the types of afflictions in the division, and what is necessary for piercing; so proceed according to the health.
You should make the sick person sit between your crossed hands, away from the sun's light, and bind the healthy eye tightly.
then place the paper of the eye in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right;
then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument called "almagda", or in your left hand, if the eye is right;
then place the tip of the instrument beside the brow, about the width of a finger, on that white part of the eye near the tear duct, then push the instrument called "almagda" forcefully, and turn your hand until it pierces the white part of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the empty space;
and it is necessary that the measure of the almagda's path be to the depth of the space between the pupil and the end of the blackness; and that is the brow of the eye;
so you will see the bone in that membrane through the clarity of the cornea, and then put the instrument to the place where the point is, then press it along one path after another.
if the point descends now, the patient sees before him and the instrument in his eye.
After resting a little, and if the point ascends the second path, apply force with the instrument, and when it is deeply fixed and it does not ascend, then extract the almagda gently by turning your hand little by little;
and then put a little of gem-salt on the point, and remove the eye from the instrument. Then apply over the eye bandages or wool soaked in rose oil and abundant egg white, and bind with the healthy eye.
We, and those of our time, place over it a compress with abundant egg white.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye due to its hardness, because some people have excessively hard eyes, you must take the instrument called "alberit," of which this is the form:
And then pierce only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a subtle opening, then put in the almagda, as we have said;
and at the completion of the work prepare a suitable bed for the patient, in which he sleeps on his back in a dark place;
and be kept from all movements, and eat light foods, and do not move his head to either the right or the left, and be bandaged according to his condition until the third day;
then unbind him in the same dark room, and test his vision, and make him see certain things, and then reapply the bandage until the seventh day;
and it is not necessary for you to do this during the treatment time or immediately after the incision, but you must do this later, because the fluid rises quickly.
if a hot abscess comes, that you unbind the eye before the seventh day, and address it with that which soothes the abscess;
and when it is calmed, then unbind the eye and place a bandage over his face for a few days, and let him remain in that dark room.
And then slowly leave the room, and return to his condition;
and know that no disciple should interfere in this case. And one came to us who was from Iraq, who told us that in their country they made an almagda, with which they draw water, but nonetheless I have never seen one in our land, nor have I ever read about it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the appearances of the shapes of almagda, so that those who do not know them might see them;
and are of brass properly: And let their head be of this same fineness, and the back end in three sharp angles.
Sometimes various extra pieces of flesh grow on the nose, some of which resemble scorpions with many legs;
and there are some where there is flesh dug into it with a dark color, and there is soft flesh of good color. In the case of that flesh which is soft, and not dug in, you must have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun;
In the case of that flesh which is soft, and not dug in, you must have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun; and open his nostrils, and apply the lancet to that flesh, and draw it out; then cut what you can hold with a sharp, thin scalpel on one side, until you know that the flesh is all removed.
And if any remains that cannot be cut, then treat it with all the fine instruments gently, so that nothing remains. and if it swells, or the abscess is hot, then treat it as is appropriate.
And if it is a malignant abscess, then hurry and cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then apply oil and vinegar or wine. If the oil opens, and moisture comes out to the palate, know that it is cured.
And if the moisture does not come out as it should, know that there is flesh growing on the bone above, which the instruments cannot cut through.
Then you must put in a linen thread, somewhat thick, and tied by hand, and have a space of a finger or less between each knot. and let the patient hold the end of the thread in his nose as much as possible, and pull it while smelling, until it comes through the nose into the mouth;
and often children do this in schools, and it is an easy thing for him who wants to do it;
Then hold the end that came through the nose in one hand, and the other end that came through the mouth in the other hand, and draw them one after the other, holding the knots that are on the thread.
Do this until you know that the knots have rotted the flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe away the blood, and soak the thread in Egyptian ointment, and put it back in the nose as before;
Do this for three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remains of flesh;
and then put a lead chain in the nose for a few days until it is healed, and if it needs drying medicines, use them;
and this is the form of the instrument for purging the head, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nose:
And it should be of silver or bronze, resembling an open lamp, like a cane, and the conduit likewise;
and if you wish, make a closed cane, and let the instrument be full for purging the head;
and let it have a handle at the head for holding it when heating the oil or any liquid.
of the cloth over the nose
Many times, a disease called "telul" arises at the head of the nose, and grows and becomes large frequently, until it is a visible thing to look at;
and for this, you must cut it at the beginning, and remove it entirely, then place the cautery or burning medicine over the spot;
and if one delays cutting it until it is large, be wary if it is hard, of a foul color, of poor sensation:
if so, do not touch it with iron, for it is a festering abscess, for when it is cut sometimes, great harm comes to the sick person;
and if the abscess is of soft touch, not of foul color, and you see that it can be entirely cut out, empty the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the spot with drying and astringent things.
Know that when a solution of continuation comes to one of these cartilage works, it profits little, except in some men.
It is necessary, therefore, when this happens to anyone, to see if the wound is fresh with all its blood; and then join the two lips with a stitch, then treat it until it is healed;
and if the lips are already separated on one side and the other, then you must cauterize all parts of their core until they bleed, then join the two lips with a stitch, and bind it, and sprinkle blood of dragon powder and crushed incense; and place a piece of strong or other joining plaster over the powders, and leave it until it dries by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The method of the stitch is that you assemble the solution: or with needles, as we have said in the stitching of the belly; or with thread, as I have shown you.
of abscesses of the lips
To men happen within the lips abscesses hard, resembling grains of barley, and smaller and larger;
Then it is necessary that you turn back the lips, and cut open each spot, and take it with forceps and cut it in each part;
then fill the place after the incision with powdered vitriol, until the blood is stopped;
and then lift it up, and cure the spot with dry things until it is healed.
Many times flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients call "albulus";
if so, you must hold it with pliers, and cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood run out;
then put powdered vitriol, or other astringent and drying powders, on the spot;
and if that flesh returns after the incision, and it often happens, then cut it a second time and cauterize it: if it does not return after the cautery;
Sometimes there are gatherings at the head of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, scabs that are unsightly and rough; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellowish and wormy, so that the decay reaches the gums, and the teeth are foul-smelling;
so it is necessary that you seat the sick person between your hands, and his head is on your lap, and remove the teeth or scabs where they appear, until nothing remains; and thus do with the blackness and greenness, and the yellowness and other marks, until they are cleansed;
and if one removes what is there at the first attempt, that is good; if not, then start again on the second and third day, until you have completely removed it;
and know that teeth require different types of tools for removal, according to what the practitioner demonstrates, because the scrapers used to remove teeth on the outside have different shapes than those used to remove teeth between the teeth; and these shapes and others should be prepared with you.
It is necessary when you treat a toothache that you delay pulling it out as much as possible, for this should not be done at all; for it is a very high matter until there is no excuse for removing it.
Then when the patient is constrained to remove it, it is necessary that you be certain of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and he believes it is in the healthy tooth, and has the good tooth pulled out; and nonetheless the pain does not depart because of this, until the bad extraction, for we have already wanted to do this to these lords;
And when you are certain of the aching tooth, you must cauterize around the tooth thoroughly with strong spatumile to protect the gum on all sides;
Then move it with your fingers or with delicate pliers, little by little, until it is properly loosened, then firmly grip the pliers; And let the patient's head be between your knees, and hold it firmly so that it does not move.
Afterwards, extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it does not easily come out, take one of these instruments and gently place it on each side, and move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is pierced and decayed, you must fill it with linen strips where the holes are; and if you grip it gently with pliers, so that it does not break when you grip it;
and you must work very carefully around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And be very careful not to break it, and leave a part of it, and that the patient will return with greater pain from the root than the initial pain.
And beware that you do not act like ignorant healers, who, through their haste and boldness, sometimes break the jawbone, and do not achieve the results we have described;
but sometimes cause a great illness by the remaining roots or by breaking the jawbone, as we have often seen;
and when the tooth is extracted, wash the area with wine or vinegar and oil;
and if bleeding occurs, which often happens, fill the area with ground vitriol;
and if that does not work, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments, which one uses to pull teeth first, should have long points and large handles, so that they do not bend when you extract the tooth;
and these are the shapes: And they should have thick limbs so that they do not bend when pulling, and should be of good, strong iron, and should be toothed to hold the tooth.
of the root of the teeth When the root remains when pulling, you must put moistened cotton in butter for one or two days, until the area is softened, then insert the pliers called "algefri," whose head resembles a bird's beak;
and the teeth should be made like a file, and this is the shape:
And if the roots do not want to come out with all these pliers, you must expose the flesh all around the root, and insert the instrument called "althali", that is to say, a file, of which this is the shape:
And be strong and thick so that it does not break, and if the root comes out with this, it is good;
if not, use all the instruments, of which the shapes come after:
And if one uses this instrument that has two prongs, of which this is the shape: and other tools that are in front, in the form of teeth, and of this instrument that looks like large pliers, of which this is the shape:
And let these instruments be strong so that they cannot break, and know that many instruments of teeth are; and also other instruments, which are not counted;
and the skilled master subtly finds his own instrument, according to his works and the sickness shows him, for there are such illnesses where the ancients did not teach any instrument because of the diversity of others; and if one breaks the chariot or other bones, or if it might, one searches for the instruments that are necessary, as I have told you, and helps with the gestures, of which this is the shape:
And let them be thick and well-holding to hold the bone, that it may not escape, but that it may be held and removed;
and then restore the place with suitable medicines, and if there be rot in the bone, and it is small, then remove it with this whole instrument:
When the teeth appear not according to the natural body, and the form is ugly, and especially in maidens, you must know if the tooth is born after the tooth, and is not in the right place, and cannot be filed nor ground:
Then remove it; and if it is air with the tooth, then take this instrument, of which here is the form, and it is similar to a small beak, and let it be of sharp, tempered iron at the top:
And cut it little by little over several days because of the tooth's hardness, and so that you do not move the others, and if it appears that it can be filed, then file it with a file such as this one shown here:
and is also like the file with which needles are made;
and file the tooth little by little over several days gently, so that it does not move as it breaks;
then finally flatten it with a rasp, and if the tooth is too sharp and it hurts the tongue, then it is necessary to file down the roughness until it is even, so that it does not hurt the tongue or spoil the speech.
When the front teeth ache, either from a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot bear down on what they eat without pain, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and this is of no use;
then they must be bound with a gold thread, for the silver thread turns green and rots, but gold never changes.
and let the thread be neither too thick nor too thin, according to the amount of space between the teeth;
and if you wish to straighten the teeth, take the thread and place it doubled between the two healthy teeth, then put the ends between the loose teeth, if there is one or more, until you have reached the healthy tooth on the other side in a careful manner; then repeat the covering process back to the point where you started, and gently and carefully tighten your hand until it doesn't move any more;
and let your binding be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the thread with pliers, and join them, and place them between the healthy tooth, and position them so that they do not injure the tongue;
and then leave it as tightly as it can stay, and if it loosens, or the thread weakens, tighten it with another thread;
if it stays and serves in this way all the time, and this is the form of the teeth and the arrangement of the two healthy teeth and the two gums, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, one replaces it in its place, fresh by fresh, as we have said;
and no one but the skilled and the patient should intervene, and sometimes one makes the shape of a tooth from cow's bone, and puts it in the place where the tooth is missing, and tightens it as we have said, and it stays and serves this way for a long time.
Sometimes this ligament that comes under the tongue is natural, that one is born with; or by accident of a closed wound;
and the work is such that you open the patient's mouth, and hold their head in your grasp, and lift their tongue;
then cut the nerve ligament from the wide side, so that the tongue is loosened from its attachment, and if there is hardness or stiffness, and it is from a closed wound, then use the hook and cut that ligament from the wide side;
and be careful that the incision is not too deep, because of the artery underneath;
and when you have done this, remove the place with rose water and oil, or cold water, then put a linen tent under the tongue;
and the patient should tend to it every night, so that the place may not heal.
And if a discharge of blood comes, then put powdered vitriol on the area; and if the blood is strong, cauterize it with a lentiginous cautery, which is good for this; then cure it with other remedies until it is healed,
and if you see it of a foul color, or black or hard, so that the patient does not feel it, do not touch it, for it is a cancer;
and if it is tending towards a pimple, and there is moisture, one places a lancet, and cuts it with a thin spatula, and releases it from one side and the other; and if the blood resists your work, put powdered vitriol on it until it is stopped, then return to your work until you have withdrawn all the blood;
then lift the place of ease and rest, and cure it with other treatments until it is healed.
of abscesses of the throat Sometimes there are boils in the throat, called "godath," and properly called the two tonsils; and when you treat them, as we have said in the division, and they are not healed, be careful:
if it is a hard abscess of small size and dull color, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is large, do not touch it with iron, also because of the discharge of blood; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will lance it, or it will burst on its own;
and if it is a whitish, rounded color, and the root is small, prepare the instrument to cut, but first look to see if the abscess is warm and calm.
Then make the patient sit facing the sun, and his head be in your sight, and open his mouth and the surgeon grasp the tongue with his hands, and press the tongue down with the instrument, of which this is the form;
and it should be of silver or fine brass, like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, then take the lancet and place it in the opening, and pull sharply upwards as much as you can;
and pull out some material from the tissues with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which this is the form, which resembles a wedge; and although the head is curved, and one part sharper than the other, and made of iron or steel:
And if you do not have this instrument present, cut it with pliers, of which this is the form: And be sharp on one side, and blunt on the other;
and when you have cut one of the almonds, cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision, the patient gargles with hot, sharp, and easy water, and if bleeding occurs, the patient gargles with water, or with cooked pomegranate peels, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the bleeding stops; then cure it until it is healed;
and sometimes other abscesses arise in the throat besides the two almonds, so cut them likewise as the two almonds.
And I treated a woman for an abscess that had formed within her throat, namely a small abscess;
and it had almost completely closed the entire throat, so that the woman could not breathe because the passage was blocked, and could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she remained like this for one or two days.
And the abscess had swollen so much that it had pushed two veins through the two nostrils.
I quickly acted, and inserted a lancet into one, then pulled it out, and extracted a large amount of pus;
then I did the same in the other nostril, and opened her mouth and pressed on her tongue;
then I inserted the lancet into these abscesses, and cut a part of them, and only a little blood came out; and thus the passage in the woman's throat was cleared, and she now began to drink water and then wine, and I continued to cut away at this abscess for a long time;
and the abscess would re-grow, filling the space I had emptied, until it became very large;
then I cauterized it inside her throat; thus it remained without growing;
and I departed from those parts, and I do not know what God did to her after me.
of the eye
When rheum descends to the eye, and it is swollen and elongated, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is below large and round, it is called "eye".
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment is of no benefit, and you see that the swollen abscess is calmed, and it is subtle, then you should cut it.
and the one that is round assembled and is not elongated; and if it is bloody or of dusky color or black, you should avoid cutting it. For there is great danger to the patient.
Therefore, when you see it, according to the method I have described, its whiteness and length, have the patient sit facing the sun, and press their tongue with the instrument we previously mentioned; then insert the hook into the uvula, and pull it downward, and cut it with one of the two instruments I mentioned in the incision of the two almonds.
And you should not cut more than the excess that is beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, it harms the voice and speech;
and after the incision, use what we have said about the incision of the two almonds, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient fears the cutting, you should use a method to alleviate the fear.
And the manner of the cautery is sharp. And have the patient put their head in your lap, and then press the tongue onto the instrument we spoke of in the cautery chapter, and cauterize with sharp, hot iron, neither too thick nor too thin; and fill the tip of this instrument, of which this is the shape:
And have a head on the tip where one places the medicine, like the bowl of a spoon, and place the instrument fully on the medicine above the ulcer;
and let the patient lie on their side, so that the saliva and mucus run from their mouth into the medicine inside, so that it does not go down the throat, and hurt it;
then hold your hand over all the medicine and press it onto the ulcer, for the amount of half an hour, until you see it become numb, and the burning of the medicine is calmed;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around any instrument, and moisten the cotton in the medicine, and put the instrument with all the cotton into the ulcer, so that the cotton adheres to the ulcer;
and do this often, until the cauteries are perfect, then let it dry, and it will fall off after four or five days.
And if you need to reapply the cautery medicine, reapply it, and after the cautery wipe around the ulcer with cotton dipped in butter, and cleanse what is around the medicine;
and it should be rinsed with cold water, and treated with gargles until it is healed.
This treatment is more effective than incision, than cautery;
if it is treated with fumigation according to this method, take calamint and ysop and origanum and rue and chamomile and avronne and similar herbs, and put them all or some of them in a pot, and add water, and boil;
and the pot should be well sealed with strong clay, and in the middle of the pot there should be an instrument heated according to this method: And it should be of silver or bronze, and one of the ends placed in the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the eye through the channel, until the eye is dead;
then repeat often, until the eye dries, and be careful not to do this at the beginning of a hot abscess, because many things can happen; and do not apply this heat except at the decline of a hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not available, take a tube and place a piece of egg shell inside, so that the patient's mouth is not too hot; for the egg shell does not let the vapor burn the mouth, and this is a good and safe treatment overall.
Many times a fish bone or spine, or some other thing, gets lodged in the throat;
so you should pull out what you can see, and press the tongue with the instrument toward the sun, so that you see the object move;
and that which is hidden and lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach; perhaps the lodged object will be expelled by vomiting;
or the patient swallows a piece of sponge, or a piece of navel, or a lettuce root, or a morsel of dry bread; and ties a thread to the sponge and then swallows it; and when it reaches the place, it will stick, and then you will pull forcefully;
and if it does not come out by what we have said, take a lead instrument according to this shape:
And let the instrument be curved at the head so that it can more easily enter the throat, and have the head raised high; and beware that you do not touch the epiglottis, lest harm come to it, or push the bone inside;
and it is better that the patient pushes the instrument, so that it is known where the thing is stuck; if it pushes down, or if it is pulled out with the whole instrument equally, until it is out.
of the leech of the throat
Sometimes the leech is medicated, as I have said in the division, by the treatment with medicines; and when this does not help at all, then look into the throat of the sick person in the sun, then press his tongue with the instrument I have told you.
And if you see the leech, then pull it out with a very small hook, or with delicate pliers that are suitable for this.
And if that doesn't work, then take a thin, twisted wire, and put it in the throat of the sick person, then place a hot iron at the end of the wire, and do this often. And if the sick person is feverish every day.
then take a full glass of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it with his hand often; and as soon as the leech feels the water, it falls off.
And if it doesn't fall off as we have said, then fumigate the sick person with asafoetida, with the instrument that I have described in the fumigation of the eye.
Do this many times, for it will fall off without delay.
And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are live embers, and the bottom is covered with a pierced cover, and in that hole is the head of the instrument;
then you pour your fumigation into it, and the sick person places the head of the cane in their mouth, and closes their mouth, so that the smoke does not escape, but goes down to the leech;
and the leech will fall off now, and if it does not fall off, then resume the fumigation many times;
and let the sick person suffer thirst, and eat salty and dry things, and drink no water;
and then it will be necessary for it to come out fully through this treatment.
And the shape of the instrument with which the leech is pulled out, if one can see it, is like bent pliers so as to enter the throat; and have the appearance of a bird's beak, and have the roughness of a file, so that what it seizes, it cannot let go;
Many types of abscesses are found, according to what is remembered here in this book, from one and another, and they differ in their perforation and their incision;
and it is in two ways, one of which is in its own appearance, and of what it holds moist.
And the second way is due to the places where they are on the body.
For the abscesses of the head are different from those of the foundation, and the abscesses of the fleshy area are different from those that arise in the joints, and each has its own judgment in the work.
And there are abscesses that should not be pierced until the boil is ripe according to its completion;
and there are some that must be pierced when they are swollen, and do not ripen according to their completion, such as abscesses that are next to joints.
For when an abscess comes next to a joint, and one leaves it until it is rotten around, perhaps the ligament and nerve of the joint are corrupted, which is the cause of contraction in that limb.
If the abscess is next to the main limb, and you delay the perforation until it is ripe, it will harm the main limb;
or if it is next to the foundation, it is pierced before it is ripe;
and you should not pierce a swollen abscess without complete digestion, except for the one next to the foundation, lest it rot deeply, be prolonged inside, and a fistula result; and cannot heal in a long time.
And you must know the time for the perforation of a ripe abscess according to its completion, and that is when the pain is relieved, and the fever subsides, and the decrease in pain and redness, and the cessation of throbbing and the softening of the abscess head, and the other signs;
and you must make the perforation in the most dependent part of the abscess, and where it appears softened;
and let the perforation be along the body's length, and if the abscess is on the hands or feet, or in joints, and nerves and arteries, and in all places alike where there is no membrane. In those that bend, according to that limb.
And when the abscess is in a fleshy area, it is better to leave the perforation until it is confirmed in complete digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the body of the venom will spread, and it will be full of much filth. and perhaps harden the lips and deepen it.
And if some abscesses are pierced according to the width of the body, according to what the limb needs.
And it is necessary that you make small abscesses, small openings; and in large abscesses, large openings, and many fissures according to the appearance of the size of the abscess;
and if there are such abscesses where it is necessary to cut out the core, and to cut; when it has become as if a flag, and is softened, then it is necessary to do as one does to boils:
and there are some that are split into three angles, and there are some that one cuts like myrtle leaves, just like abscesses of the groin;
and there are some where one makes a round incision, and other incisions and similar cuts.
Those which do not have a head, like a superficial soft abscess, it is necessary for you to pierce it completely;
and it is necessary when the abscess is large, and it has collected a great amount of pus, and you pierce it, then do not draw out all the pus at that time, but draw out a portion; then plug the abscess until the next day, then draw out some more again; do this repeatedly in increments, until all the pus is out;
especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or young children, or decrepit old men. For the spirit sometimes jumps with the exit of pus, so that perhaps the patient dies, and you don't realize it.
Therefore, avoid this chapter with great caution, and when you have pierced your abscess, wipe the wound, and check if the wound of the abscess is small; and if it is a wide opening, apply linen or old cotton bandages; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings, you must put a bandage in each one so that they meet each other;
and if you have cut a part of the skin in the abscess and have sewn it up, you must fill it with old cotton or linen rags without moisture, and bind it until the third day;
then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if blood flows from your work, apply cold water and ease, and wet a cloth, and apply it repeatedly to the flowing area.
And if the blood flow persists, apply treatment and remedies, and the powders I mentioned in this book, and if it is in winter, and the area where the abscess is very sensitive, you must apply bandages and cloths soaked in hot wine and oil;
and if it is in summer, and the area is fleshy, you must apply cloths soaked in water and oil, or in cold wine and oil, until the third day, as we have said;
and then open the abscess, and dry it and treat it, as is appropriate, until it is healed.
And this must be known universally in the treatment of abscesses:
or I have told you how one should proceed with the treatment of abscesses, and here is the chapter.
Where the crown of the head comes small abscesses, and there are types of them that are in webs, just like the membrane of a hen's egg, and many similar ones.
There are some that are fatty and others where there is moisture, like pus;
and there are some that are hard and stony to cut, and there is no doubt if the vein does not oppose it.
And the work of the cutting is that you try with any instrument that is called an "entromissoire", from which the shape comes afterwards, what thing it contains.
For if it contains moisture, pierce it above along the length.
And when the moisture is emptied, then cauterize without leaving any of the skin that contained that moisture, for it returns often when anything is left.
Then dip cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; if not, in water and salt, and fill the wound, and leave it until the other day; and that which has remained overnight will run.
And then repeat the cotton, as before, on the second day, and the third, until you know well that it does not remain overnight;
then treat the wound with ointment suitable for it, until it is healed.
And if the abscess holds a fatty substance, cut it along this form, lengthwise; and insert your lancets, and scrape it from all sides, and put all your care to draw out the matter where it lies;
and if the artery resists you, do what I told you afterwards.
And also do this with the abscess if it is stony, and in cutting and curing it as I have told you.
And cutting on the stony and moist abscess is easier, for it contains little blood. And if there are some of these abscesses on the head where there is no moisture, and these were the abscesses that I cut on the head of an old woman;
and I found the abscess like a hard, rough, white stone, and could not break it; and if one had struck any of them, one would have caused a wound as with a stone.
In other abscesses coming to the head, except those that come to the heads of children and to the roots of the ears, the opening should always be in the most dependent place, to cause the pus to exit;
and treat them as necessary.
Many times these abscesses occur on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes come to other parts of the body, and are numerous, and are interwoven with one another.
And each scrofulous boil is properly within its own cavity, like the boil and abscess of the head, as we have said; And the appearances of these scrofulas are many.
And the appearances of these scrofulas are many. Some contain moisture, and there are malignant ones that do not wish to obey health.
In those you see of good disposition to touch, and are similar in color to the body, and move in all parts and are not inflamed by the nerves of the neck nor the artery nor the conduit, and are not deep;
If it is, you should cut it open, and scrape each part, and spread the two lips of the core with tweezers, if you need them, as we have said about abscesses of the head;
and draw it out little by little, and be sure that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and let the spatula not be sharp nor cutting, so that the hand does not slip, and do not go too far, so that you do not cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or artery, and this prevents you from working, put powdered vitriol or some blood-stopping powders into the wound, and tighten the wound; and leave it until the abscess is calmed, and the wound becomes softened, and begins to rot.
And when the blood is stopped, then return to your work until you complete it;
Then examine with your index finger if any small sores remain, and cut and clean them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the sore, you should not cut that sore at its root, but tie it with a strong double thread and let it fall off without harming it;
Then fill the wound with old cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.
And if you cut the entire sore, you must bring together the two edges of the wound and stitch them now, since no excess remains due to the size of the sore. You must then proceed to cut the root of it, and pull it out, and stitch it as we have said.
You must then proceed to cut the root of it, and pull it out, and stitch it as we have said. Those sores that have excess, pierce there where it appears ripe.
And pierce it in the same way as the previously mentioned one, hanging down, then apply dressings with ointment and similar things, so that it will corrupt what remains of the corruption. And when the wound is properly cleansed, treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth until it is healed.
The ancients spoke of the sore throat. But I have never seen anyone in our land who did this, and this is the record of their words.
For those with quinsy, it is necessary that the slit in the throat, called the "epiglottis," be drained. and that no help be given by this, because all the veins and the body fluids of the ill are affected by the hot abscess in the mouth, or throat, or in the tonsils.
When the sickness is in the channel of the lung, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the death that comes from strangulation.
Therefore, when we wish to cut the epiglottis, we must cut it below three or four small transverse slits, between the two circles or by the amount of the slit's width, and not into the cartilage.
And these places are suitable for cutting the epiglottis because there is no flesh there, and the vessels are far apart.
And if the master is afraid, he must stretch the skin of the throat to the entire edge, then cut through it until he reaches the channel. And drain the blood vessels, if you see anything, and then cut the surface, as we have said.
And it is demonstrated by the cutting of the phlegm in the channel which leaps out through the broken place, and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for a while.
And when the time has passed for which strangulation is feared, bring together the two edges of the wound in the heart, and stitch it all together without the cartilage.
Then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Albucasim says that one should not do this until the throat is completely blocked, and the patient is deemed to be dying, and breath fails him. Then one cuts the epiglottis so that the patient cannot breathe, and breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death;
and for this the ancients commanded to leave the wound open until the malice of the illness has passed, and it has passed in three days or four. And then they commanded to stitch the wound and heal it, until it was healed;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw that a damsel took a knife and stuck it into her throat, and cut part of the channels of the windpipe;
and I was called to treat her, and found her as if dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood that had issued from it, and saw clearly that she had not cut any vein or artery other than the throat, and the wind was issuing forth through the wound.
I hurried and sewed up the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and the damsel suffered nothing more than a sore throat, and returned to her proper state afterwards;
Therefore, I say that one should not be afraid of cutting the epiglottis.
This abscess is called "gullet hernia", and is a large abscess the color of a guinea-pig, and is very common in women;
and it is according to two manners: natural, and accidental;
where natural has no device.
And the accidental is according to two manners, of which one is similar to fat in us, and the other manner is similar to an abscess that comes from an artery in us; and if there is fear, and one should not work forcefully except in that which is small, and one should prove and search through the whole interior: if you find it like a bit of fat, and it is not attached to any vein, cut it, as one cuts fat, and pull the whole of its covering, if it has one; and search well throughout, and treat it as is proper, until it is perfectly healthy.
Many types of fat there are, of which I shall describe all the varieties;
and it is necessary that I describe the entire difference between fat and issue.
I say that issue is hot and feverish, until the boiling has passed, and the putrefaction is complete; Then the fever and heat cease.
With fat there is no heat, nor fever, nor pain, and it contains a surface, which is its own sac and is according to the color of the body, and begins like a scab, and becomes large;
and they are according to two appearances, either greasy or moist, and many colors are as I have said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to treat the fat, that you first test and inquire into it with all the instrument called "entromissoire," according to what its form will be in the chapter that follows.
And the manner of inquiring into abscesses of fat is that you take the most moist place you find in the abscess, and turn your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, then according to the size of the abscess;
Then withdraw the instrument, and beware lest it burst.
If the moisture runs swiftly, whatever color it may have, then pierce it as I have said of the other abscesses;
and if, after the instrument, no moisture comes, know that it is fat, then pierce it in a cross, and take it with tweezers, and lightly scrape it from each side, and guard the skin where it lies so you draw it out healthy with the fat;
and if you cannot draw it out healthy, then draw it out in pieces so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the pus will return many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood bothers you, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, constrict the wound, and put soothing things on the hot abscess, and cure it with other treatments until it is healed;
and if the pus is large, then sew the two edges of the wound, and cure it with what generates flesh.
and if the throbbing vein is contrary to you or another, then hurry and fill the place with powdered vitriol, and leave it for two or three days, until the wound putrefies, and the boiling of blood rests; then return to cauterize what remains of the pus.
See here the forms of the intrusive instruments, and they are of three kinds: large and medium and small;
and of them there are three squares which are called "albaret", and one which is called "breb", and of them there are three kinds: large, medium, and small, to search for abscesses of fistula;
and are also like the needles with which one sews the sores, and are of yellow bronze, or of iron, or of silver, and those which are yellow are better, and are more tested with black lead to search for the corruptions of fistula;
and are of three kinds: large, medium, and small, according to the quantity of the width of the openings.
The shapes of the probes are of many appearances, as you see here:
and there are probes that have two curves of three kinds as well;
and there are probes that have three curves, and are also of three kinds;
and there are probes that have two curves, and probes of one curve only, and are of three kinds;
and all these are necessary in their place.
The head of these, which one cuts, is sharp, and some of them do not cut very much from one side only, with which one scrapes the flesh, so that one does not cut the vein or the nerve;
and of these instruments are the probes fitted into handles, so that the patient does not feel them when opening abscesses;
and are of three kinds: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and one uses them mostly in fleshy places, such as legs, arms, breasts, and the groin, and in similar places;
and sometimes one makes another small instrument, resembling the bark of hazelnuts, according to this shape, with which one stops blood: and it is placed sometimes at the place where the veins or arteries are cut, and sometimes according to this large shape:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to be corrupted, so that they seem like a woman's breasts;
and remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wants to cure them must do so according to this shape from this line .b. to .g.: then scrape off the fat, and fill the wound with a medicine that creates flesh, then bring the two edges of the wound together with stitches, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast inclines downward and is softened by its size, as happens in women, then cut it into two sides on top, by two similar cuts; so that one is attached to the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller one according to this shape, from this line .b. up to the line .g.; then scrape off the skin between the two edges, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about stitches and powders, and whatever is necessary for the treatment, until they are healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not completely made, because the patient does not want to rest, or due to the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remaining tissue and fat, then treat it until it is healed.
These abscesses that come from under the armpits are types of hard scrofulas, where there are lumps, and some contain moisture.
Those, therefore, which contain moisture, must be cut according to this form, from line b to line g: And when all the pus in the abscess is emptied, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with appropriate ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is like scrofulas, cut it as we said in the description of scrofulas's cuts, and if the wound discharges pus, apply cautery as we said before.
When the artery is ruptured, and the skin above is closed, there often comes abscesses, and the same happens to a swollen vein and abscess.
and if one recognizes it as being from the artery, the abscess is long and deep. and when you feel it with your fingers, you sense a tightening.
and when it's from the vein, the redness is evident.
and it is foolish to cut this abscess, especially when it is beneath the armpits, or in the groin, or the neck, and in many other places, and is very large. Therefore, avoid iron treatment, and one that is on the surface should also be avoided, and in those that are swollen from an artery, a long incision should be made above the skin.
Then open the incision with knives, and neatly separate the artery from the tissues, until it is exposed.
Then place a needle underneath it, and pierce it through to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of the two arteries that are in the temples.
Then prick the area between the two ligatures with a lancet until the blood that is there comes out, and the abscess will be drained.
Then apply the treatment that causes swelling, until the ligature falls off. Then treat it with the appropriate ointment, until it is healed.
And if the abscess is along the vein's course, then you must hold with your hand as much of the abscess as you can along the skin, then place the needle below the area you hold in your hand, pierce it, and tie one double thread so you pull it from the other side. Then tie the abscess, as I told you, or tie the ligature from one of the two sides to the two ends of the thread.
And if you fear that the thread will not hold, then reinsert another needle along the entire thread underneath the entire abscess at the incision of the first needle, and tighten the threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess until the excess comes out, then cut the excess from the core and leave what is tied.
Then place a damp cloth soaked in wine and oil, then administer cures of poultices and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses come to the artery and vein, abscesses come to the nerves when they are wounded, or by excessive labor, and similar things.
And this happens more often to the shoulders and arms and in all places where there are joints, and it is a grievous abscess, and its color resembles the color of the flesh, and is in various dispositions without pain;
and when it is squeezed tightly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep within the body, but under the skin;
and it moves well from all sides, and does not go neither forward nor backward, nor below nor above, and the one that is in the joints should not be cut with iron: perhaps contraction would result; and that which is on the head or forehead, cut the skin with a spatula.
and that which is on the head or forehead, cut the skin with a spatula. If the abscess is small, hold it with pincers and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, suspend it with a hook, and scrape it, then remove it and stitch the wound together, and treat it until it is healed.
Sometimes it occurs in the belly and nowhere else, a disease called "fungus" because of its resemblance to mushrooms, and its root is subtle, and its head large;
and there are small and very large ones;
and I saw a man who had two in his belly that were more like mushrooms than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had fine roots, and were slightly split, and moisture often flowed from them.
I cut them and found eighteen ounces in one, and six in the other, and the work in the incision is that you look to see if the patient is moist, and the color of the growth is white and moist, and of a subtle root; if you cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery in your presence.
if you cut it with a wide spatula, and have the fire cautery in your presence. For in the cutting, there often comes too great a flow of blood, and if the blood overwhelms you, then hurry to cauterize;
and if you see the sick person frightened and afraid of the incision with the iron, then take a well-made lead thread, and tie the growth with it as we have said, and leave it for two days;
and then restrain it, and do not cease to tighten the lead thread until it cuts the growth, and it breaks off without difficulty;
and if the roots are large, there is a fear of cutting it entirely, especially the belly, but you may well cut it in half, then cauterize it so it does not return;
then treat the wound, and be careful not to cut the tissue that is of a fixed color and of poor sense and milky appearance.
For this is a festering abscess, and I will come to the treatment of sores later.
when the wound is open If the appearance of the wound comes from cautery, or a fissure of the surface, and it is on the abdomen, and some pus comes out, as happens in other ruptures, or from blood that flows from veins or arteries according to what is before, or from wind;
And if it is by the rupture of the surface and through the discharge of pus, the color of the abscess is similar to the color of the body, and is a light thing without pain, and appears from various exits. And if it is from the discharge of the intestines, then it is more diverse, and when pressed with one's fingers, it retreats, and then returns, and perhaps it is hardened, and it greatly enlarges at the entrance to the bath and from hard work.
And if it is from moisture, it is a light thing, and clearly apparent when you press it with your hand, and does not constrain at all;
And if it is from blood, the abscess appears large and hard through these signs, and is fixed according to a quantity; And if it is from wind, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you look to see if the appearance is due to blood from the artery, or the vein, or wind.
And if it is from wind, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you look to see if the appearance is due to blood from the artery, or the vein, or wind. Then you should leave the treatment. For there is doubt and fear, as I have told you in the chapter on abscesses, concerning the artery and the vein.
And if the appearance is from the intestine or the belly, you must instruct the patient to hold his breath, and be stretched out completely straight, then mark around the wound; then instruct him to lie still between your hands, then go around the place you have marked with all the spatule, then extend the half of the abscess above with the whole large curette; then tie it around with a strong thread, or a strong silk cord firmly, and let the wound be completely tied;
then open the half of the abscess extended above the tie, and place your index finger in it, and seek the intestine; if you find it caught by the tie, untie it, and put the intestine outside the belly;
and if you find the bowel, take it with the curette, and cut off the excess;
and if the artery or vein opposes you, then go around carefully, then return to your work and take two needles, and put two strong threads in them, and put the two needles around what you have made in a cross that you made pierce;
then squeeze the abscess in four places above the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the area until it rots, and the dead flesh will fall off by itself; or you cut it when it is softened and rotten, then treat it with what is necessary, and heal the abscess as we have said;
or you cut it when it is softened and rotten, then treat it with what is necessary, and heal the abscess as we have said; and extract the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the area with what is appropriate, and close it up.
about a chancre We have discussed the types of chancre, and how to treat them with medicine, and how to avoid using iron for treatment;
and we say that a chancre develops in the skin, and great care is required in its treatment, and the ancients said that when a chancre is in a place where it can be scraped away, like a chancre that is on the breasts, and in the thigh, and in similar places, it should be entirely removed when it is in its early stages;
No one has ever cured one before me.
And the treatment, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is to purge the patient of black bile several times;
then bleed him if he has a clear overabundance, then prepare the patient a good place to do the work;
then discard your tools or cauterize, and shave the head from all sides, and remove everything from all sides without leaving anything;
and let the blood run freely, and press the area well with your hand or something else, and if the bleeding makes it difficult to see the incision in the artery or vein, cauterize until the bleeding stops; then cure it with another treatment until it is healthy.
of dropsy We have already discussed the types of dropsy, and how the accumulation of water is formed, and the signs of each type, and the treatment using medicine, and that which is cured by iron:
and one should not touch with iron in these two types: that is to say, tympanites and yposarche, for it is a mortal thing;
Therefore, when you treat this type of dropsy, which is called "eclites," with medicine, and the treatment is ineffective, examine if the patient is weak, or if they have another illness besides dropsy, such as diarrhea and similar conditions; if you should not touch it with iron, for there is danger;
and if you see the patient is strong and has no other illness but dropsy alone, and is neither too young nor too old, you should work thus: Raise the patient straight onto your hands, and the attendant should press on the belly, forcing the water to the lowest part of the chest, then take the spatumile espinous according to this form: And let it be sharp on two sides. pointed, and yet not so penetrating that it can reach the intestines when inserted, and cannot pierce;
then look to see if the dropsy is lodged near the intestines: if it is, you should cut open above the swelling three straight lines under the blade; and if the dropsy is due to liver disease, then your incision should be on the left side of the swelling three inches;
and if it is due to the spleen, it should be on the right, and it is not necessary for the patient to lie on the incision so that the excess fluids do not flow to that weak place;
then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and push it, and lift your hand throughout the whole space between the skin and the surface as in skinning it to the thickness of a fingernail or a bit more;
then pierce the surface until the space reaches the empty place, and that is the place of the water, then push it out, and put this instrument which has this form: And it is similar to a thin silver chain, and is made of bronze or light bronze, and has one small hole on the lower part; and on one side are three holes; and two on the other side, and one on the other;
and the tip is cut like a feather, and that is the form of the incision by which the scribe cuts the feather:
at the top of it is the spout, so that when the instrument goes into the water, it immediately falls onto the instrument;
empty then half or a third of it, because if you empty more than is necessary at that time, perhaps the patient will die because of the resolution of his spirit from the wound, or he will fall unconscious, or he will approach death;
but empty according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the patient's virtue and his pulse signify;
then pull out the instrument and retain the water, and it is now retained by the heart which stops the hole that is on the surface, of which I have spoken, that you pierce in this manner;
then resume the instrument the next day, if you see the patient suffering this, and draw a small quantity of water;
Do this for several days, and be careful not to overdo it until only a little water remains.
And if you doubt about the patient, and you leave too much water there, cure him with a hot grave or hot sand, and through much sweating, or bath, and in the sun, and let him drink; and cure him with drying medicines until he is healed, and cauterize on the stomach and on the liver and on the spleen after the extraction of the water, as I have said before.
Sometimes children are born who have no opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its proper place.
If it is necessary, he must immediately pierce it with a very fine needle according to this shape:
then put a thin lead plug in the opening, and bind it, and keep it like this for three or four days, and when he wants to urinate, remove the plug, and let him urinate, and then replace it;
and perhaps it is not necessary, because the urine that comes to flow does not leave it closed.
Those whose opening is small, shall be treated with a lead plug, as we have said, and will widen.
Those who do not have the opening in their place are wounded, because some are born with the opening at the top of the penis, so that they cannot urinate before lifting their penis up; and cannot ejaculate because the material cannot reach the bladder, and this is a bad illness.
And the method of the work is that the patient lies often on their back, then extends the head of the penis and cuts it like the notch of a feather, so that the opening falls in the middle, as is fitting;
and beware of bleeding which often occurs, and if it happens, stop it with what stops blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the pustules of the penis Often these white spots appear on the penis, and there is an appearance of ugly flesh;
and some are malignant and some are not;
so you should take them with a thin forceps, and cut and clean all of them, then put moistened cotton on Egyptian ointment; then treat with diafinicon ointment until healed.
And if the white spot is malignant, of foul colour and smelling, then you must apply cautery.
When you have cut it, and if the white spot is on the shaft, and part of it is within the skin and part outside, then you must remove the white spot that is inside first; and when it is sealed, then treat the outside.
For if you treat it together, the shaft of the penis is not guaranteed to be healed, and blackening and corruption will arise in the shaft and in the testicles;
Then you must remove all that is black and corrupt, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from pomegranate bark and poppy seeds, then treat it with further remedies until it is healthy.
And if a discharge of blood comes, then apply the lunar cautery according to this form:
The cauteries help in two dispositions together: that is to say, to the discharge of blood, and to the corruption;
And if the head of the penis is corrupt and retracted, you must insert a lead pipe into the penis, and the patient must urinate through it;
And when the skin is sore on the head of the penis, which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or which happens due to a wound or an abscess, then you must burn it with a sharp instrument, until the membrane is broken, and the head of the penis is freed from all sides;
And if it is a severe case, you must burn a small area of the head of the penis and the skin with a spatula;
Then gently separate them and place a thin, damp linen cloth on it, so that it does not become sore again.
Circumcision is not simply the breaking of continuity like other wounds; Nevertheless, when we perform this operation of our own free will, and especially on children, it is necessary that we perform the best and least harmful operation.
I say that the ancients did not practice circumcision on their children, for they did not use it in their laws, and we have only what we have acquired through experience.
For I have seen most of the masters and noblemen who performed circumcision with a knife, and with force, and a whole new kind of blade;
If the heart moved, for there are two blades, and perhaps one above is cut, and the one below remains. Or it needs to be cut again, and the pain is doubled, and the cleansing of the blade does not properly heal the end of the member;
and with the cleansing of the nail, perhaps the iron slips, and the work is corrupted, and many times they are born in such a way that they do not need cleansing, and I have seen it.
Of the cleansing done with force, throughout the entire thread, I have found the goodness of the experiment, for the forces cut justly, as well above as below.
For when you press your hand, it cuts equally in one whole time; but let the thread be very tight around the skin;
and the manner of the first work is such that you make the child think, if he understands, that you are only tying the thread around the stick, and you can make him happy in all the ways that you can;
then hold it between your hands upright, and place the forces between your hands or under your feet so that the child cannot see them, nor any of the instruments;
then put your hand on the stick and blow into it, and pull it up until the head of the stick is in; then clean it well of the dirt that has gathered there, then tie the marked spot with a double thread, then tie it under one knot to another knot;
then clean it well of the dirt that has gathered there, then tie the marked spot with a double thread, then tie it under one knot to another knot; and hold it with your two fingers by the second knot with your thumb and index finger, and cut between the two knots, then quickly lift the heart and pull the head of the stick; then let the blood run drop by drop, for this is the way; and put powder on and on the powder a layer of glue made from a boiled egg yolk mixed with rosewater, mixed with fragrant and fresh rose oil, and leave it there until the next day, and treat it with another treatment until it is healed.
The form of the forces for cleansing is this:
the two edges should be taut and sharp, and the edges should be as wide as the handle as well:
The error in the cleansing is when the heart is inside the incision;
Then you must extend it with your fingernail, lest the place form an abscess;
and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then hold it with pliers, and then cut it.
And if it passes three days, and that which is under the rod is swollen, let it be until the hot abscess is calmed, and lightly scrape it;
cut it as you can, and beware of the part of the rod, that will not harm it at all.
Then treat the area with wound powders, as we have said in the chapter on powders, and if one cuts too deeply into the heart, and it rises, it will not hurt at all;
Then cure it, as we have said, until it is healed.
Of the retention of urine
The retention of urine comes from an obstruction of stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or dead flesh, or similar things, as we have said in the division;
And if the urine is not released, and you see the retention is due to a stone lodged in the neck or bladder, then the patient should be bent over his knees; and his feet should be placed on the back, and he should stretch his belly from the upper part of the back, and the patient should restrain his breathing as much as he can; and then the neck of the bladder is constricted to expel the stone above, so that the urine is released;
And if it does not come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you should administer extraction with the instrument called "syringe," of which this is the form:
and it should be of fine, light silver, like the feather of a bird; and it should be a palm and a half long, and thin at the head.
And the manner of releasing the urine is that you take a double thread, and tie a small piece of wool or cotton to the head, and put the head of the thread inside the syringe;
and cut off the excess wool and put it up to the head of the syringe, then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and make the patient sit on a seat, and lubricate the bladder and penis with moist oil and olive oil and warm water;
then gently place the syringe on the penis, until it reaches the root of the penis, then double the penis over towards the groin;
then push the syringe forward until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it coming down to the empty part, and this is not done according to this order, except that the passage through which it goes is crooked;
then extend the thread along all the wool bit by bit, and the urine follows the wool, then pull it out, and make the urine flow;
and repeat the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
When sores or blood come into the bladder, or putrefaction gathers there, and you wish to instill sharp remedies and medicines, do so through the whole instrument called "clepsydra," and this is its form:
It is closed, and has three openings: Two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the channels through which the medicine flows should be such that they tightly plug the urethra without addition, so that moisture can be drawn out and pushed in when necessary;
And when you wish to pour your medicines into the bladder, place the head of the applicator into the moisture, and pull on the drawcord within;
You will draw the moisture to the applicator, and then strongly push the drawcord back in; The moisture will then enter, and will now come to the bladder, so that the patient will feel it;
And this is the form of the subtle clyster with which one clysters the bladder:
And it is of silver or of archaut, and the head is higher;
and below to the breast or where the ligament falls;
then take a sheep's bladder and put the moisture with which you wish to clyster the bladder, then tie it between the two breasts with a good double thread, and heat the moisture a little over the fire;
then place the head of the clyster in the rod, then hold your hand on the bladder against all the moisture's coming, until the patient feels that the moisture has fully reached the bladder;
and if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle, and pierce it round about; then put a strong thread into these holes, then assemble the circle as one assembles a shield, and put inside it what you wish of oil and moisture and water, and tie it to the instrument;
and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
of the stone
We have already spoken in the division about the types of stones, and the extraction along with the medicines;
and have described the difference between stones formed in the kidneys, and all the signs, and which stones one should work on by cutting; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you plainly and briefly.
I say that stones formed in the bladder happen more often to children, and this is a sign that water leaks from the bladder resembling water in its subtlety;
and it appears as sand, and the patient scratches his penis, and it hangs down many times, and then hardens; and much of this leaking weakens the foundations;
and the healing is easy in children until they are four years old, and is very difficult in the elderly, and is moderate in young adults, in those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those who have large stones than for those who have small ones.
And when we come to the treatment, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient with an enema, to remove all the filth that is in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders the search for the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and raise and move them downwards, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes comes up from its high position;
then have him sit between your hands, and his hands under his thighs, so that the bladder is completely inclined downwards;
then search for and touch it inside;
if you feel the stone in the space, then hurry now to cut above the stone.
And if it does not fall out upon touching at all, then moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger if the patient is a fully grown young man; and put it into its base, and search for the stone, and when you feel it on your finger, then bring it to the neck of the bladder;
then press on your finger, and put it away from the place where you want to cut.
And instruct the assistant to press on the bladder with his hand, and tell him to raise the nipples with his right hand, and with his left hand to remove the skin beneath the nipples in the area where the incision will be made;
then put the scalpel, the shape of which is this: and cut between that which is between the nipples and the base, not in the middle but on the side of the left buttock;
and be straight over the stone, and your fingers are constantly on the base, and the incision should be wider towards the outside, and narrower inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
perhaps the pressure from your fingers on the base will cause it to jump out without difficulty;
and know that there are stones with angles and edges: so it is difficult to remove;
and there are some that are flat, like a disc, and round, from which the removal is easy.
For those with angles and edges, make the incision larger;
and if it does not yield, you must use pliers which are like a file at the tip, to forcefully pull the stone so that it does not slip away; or you place under it a thin, curved instrument at the tip;
and if you cannot extract it thus, enlarge the opening, and if the blood flows, stop it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, first remove the largest one to the neck of the bladder, then cut above it, then forcefully pull it out, and remove the smaller ones afterwards if there are more.
And if it is very large, it must be carefully handled, and a larger incision made. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or his urine comes out again through a gap that the wound cannot close;
but nonetheless, strive to pull it out, or to break it with pliers, until you pull it out in pieces;
and when you have completed your work, apply the wound with frankincense, aloes, and dragon's blood, and compress it, and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in oil and rose water and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess; then bind the patient's neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
And when you loosen it, thoroughly wash the area with oil and water, then treat it with diaphanic ointment and basil ointment, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses, and corrosions, and blood clots form in the bladder, and the urine is retained by this, which is known as a blockage with the urine: Then put your finger into the wound, and remove that blood, for if it remains, it will rot the bladder and corrupt it;
then wash the wound with water, and vinegar, and salt, and assist him in every way you know, until he is healed;
and it is necessary that every time you treat him, you bind his two thighs, and bring the medicines together over the spot.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the urethra, and stuck in, and the urine cannot exit; if you treat it as I have said before, you should cut it many times, and you are excused from the cutting by this treatment. I have already proven it thus.
Take an iron rod according to this shape, and let it have three angles fixed into a single blaze.
Then take a thread and tie it around the urethra below the stone, so that it cannot return to the bladder;
Then insert the rod into the urethra gently, until it reaches the stone; and turn the rod in your hand against the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone from the other side;
Then the urine will come forth immediately, then press your hand on what remains of the stone that is within the urethra. Thus it is soon broken and jumps out with the urine, and the patient is healed;
And if you cannot do this for any reason that prevents it, then tie a thread below the stone and another above, then cut the urethra at the stone between the two threads, then pull it out, and untie the thread, and clean the congealed blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
of the stone of women
Sometimes a stone is lodged in women, and if it occurs, the treatment is difficult, and is forbidden for three things:
One is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a woman knowledgeable enough to expose herself to mirrors, especially when she is chaste.
And the third way is that perhaps one cannot find a woman skilled enough in this art of hands;
And the fourth way is that the stone of the woman is deeper than the stone of a man, therefore it requires a deeper incision, and there is much fear. And if necessity demands this, you must take a skilled midwife, and rarely is one found. If you cannot find one, seek a subtle, skilled mirror.
and present a wise woman experienced in the lives of women, or a woman skilled in part of the art, and instruct her to do what you command regarding the inquiry into the stone; and carefully examine if the woman is a virgin:
and carefully examine if the woman is a virgin: then she must push her finger into the foundation and seek the stone;
and if she finds it, she should hold it under her finger, and instruct her to place her finger where the ailment is, and seek and press her left hand firmly on the bladder.
If she finds it, she should move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder down to under the root of the thigh;
then cut onto the stone at the root of the thigh, opposite the middle of the groin, where the stone is most apparent, and feel the stone in that area; and do not move her finger over or under the stone, and let the incision be small at first;
and do not move her finger over or under the stone, and let the incision be small at first; then put the instrument into the incision; if you feel the stone, enlarge the wound until the stone can emerge forcefully, and know that there are many kinds of stones:
that is to say, small and large, rough and smooth, long and round, and those that have grooves.
so recognize the appearances in order to know the outcome.
And if the blood overwhelms you, place crushed vitriol in the area, and hold it for an hour until the blood is stopped;
then return to your task, until the stone is forcefully removed, and have instruments, as I have told you, to help in your work for extracting the stone from the man.
and if the blood overwhelms you, and it is from a cut artery, place the powder on the area, and bind it with strips and bandages; and do not begin again; leave the stone and do not remove it, lest the patient die. then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood has calmed, and the area is healed, then return to your task, until the stone is forcefully removed.
Watery hernia is nothing more than a collection of moisture or white pus, beneath the skin of the testicles, which contains the egg;
and is called "syfac", and sometimes is properly in the egg's membrane, so one might think it is another egg; and it is the skin of the testicle between the white pus that we have mentioned;
and this does not happen often. And the generation of this hernia is from weakness that comes to the testicles, and that matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: or it is a color declining to jaundice, or it is blood-red, or black, or watery white, and this happens more;
and these are the signs to recognize this assembly, for if it is as white as we have said, the abscess is round, barely long as the shape of an egg, and the testicles are not visible, because it has moisture all around.
And if it has moisture within the very tissue, the abscess is round with a part of the egg, and for that one thinks that it is another egg;
and if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white surface, one feels it well;
So when you wish to know the color of the moisture, you must test through the entire cavity, whose shape is as described above. According to that which comes after the cavity, judge what is inside.
And when we treat it with iron, it is necessary that the patient be healed according to their power and the fullness of their body;
then place him on his back, on something a bit high, and put many cloths underneath him;
then sit on his left side, and instruct the minister to sit on the right, and extend the rod to one of the two ribs of the heart of the testicles;
then take the spatula and cut the skin of the testicles along their length, all the way to the edge of the blade, and make your incision completely straight, dividing the skin of the testicles until the white skin is visible, and carefully peel it off according to your ability;
then pierce the plain skin with a large hole, and extract all the water, and then place your hooks, and pull the skin upwards;
and do not touch the heart of the testicles, but only the skin; cut it all, or in pieces, even the side of it carefully, that if you do not cut it wisely, the water will return;
and if the testicle jumps out during your work, then return it to its place when you have completed the work on the skin;
then stitch the two leathers of the heart of the testicles together with a suture, then treat it like other wounds until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another illness, you must tie the vessels that are suspensory, fearing the flow of blood;
then cut the testicle along the entire suspensory ligament, and remove the testicle, and treat it as we have said.
And if a limb is joined into two parts together, know that these are two splinters; then cut the other part in the same way as you did the first, then wipe away the blood and put moistened wool in rose oil on the wound;
then cut the other part in the same way as you did the first, then wipe away the blood and put moistened wool in rose oil on the wound; and place more wool moistened in wine and oil over the two splinters, and place doubled cloths over them, and bind it over the entire bandage according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with woven wool according to this likeness and let them be sewn together at the crotch of the drawers, and one end should extend over the buttocks down to the back, and the other to the part near the groin;
and the other two ends over the two shoulders, and let the entire constriction be gathered at the buckle of the breeches;
and sometimes this wound is treated with a cautery instead of a cut with iron, and it is that you take a thin cautery knife, and cut the skin over the splinters, and heat it as we have said, so that the white surface containing the liquid is exposed;
then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce that surface with the prongs, and scorch it with this hot, thin cautery:
And cut it in all the ways that you can, until you have removed all of it;
and be careful that the fire does not touch the egg;
and know that this work is more beneficial; and be watchful for any bleeding, and remember that the work of cutting;
and if anything prevents you, whether an abscess, or bleeding, or something else, then treat what prevents you, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is afraid and does not want to endure this work because of its horror, then perform the perforation, as I tell you, and that when you are certain, through the signs we have discussed, that the watery humour is present, then have the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the lower part, with a wide spatula, and place the perforation along the length of the body;
and let the opening be large, so that all the water can flow out;
then place cotton on the area, and bind it, and let the remaining water drain, then treat it until the wound is healed;
and if the white linen does not allow the water to exit the wound's opening, then you must insert a reed or the instrument used to draw water from the hydrops, of which the shape is previously shown;
and enlarge the wound's opening, and know that the water will return, and is gathered after six months or so, and when it is gathered as before, and thus the patient will pass their days.
Know that in the section of this branch there is fear in many dispositions, wherefore it seems to me that it is better to leave it alone;
and I will tell you the work and the appearances of the abscess.
I say therefore that many abscesses come upon the body, and especially on the testicles; and this is in many cases.
This is to know by a superfluity of sharp and acute matter, spread to the testicles, or by percussion;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and it finds no pain, and is a grievous abscess;
and perhaps it is a grievous, fearful, and painful abscess, and of a fixed color, and sometimes comes from the rupture of an artery, or from inflammation of a vein.
When it is from the rupture of an artery, it is known by the disposition of a hot abscess when you press it with your fingers; and you should not touch it at all.
That which is made from vein inflammation is known by its disposition to the pressure of the touch of the fingers, and one can well make the incision on this likeness, and on other wounds; and it is that you cut the roots of the testicles, then lift the testicle upwards, and pull the white skin away, and deliver the supporting ligament from all sides of the testicle.
If the testicle is already swollen with those nascent wounds, then you must pull the testicle and cut it.
And if it is air in the skin, or within the vessels, you must free all that vein and cut it roundly.
And if the origin of the wound is in the back, you must cut it all, and remove the testicle, as we have said.
And when your work is complete, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with further remedies until it is healed.
This is an abscess surrounded by a swelling similar to a tumor, accompanied by softening of the testicles, and the patient suffers greatly when he walks.
And the treatment for this illness is just as difficult and frightening as the previous one, and nonetheless, we will tell you the method, according to that of the ancients.
You must make the patient sit on a raised seat, then place the support for the testicles below his hands, encompassing all the vessels close to the penis, and the master will grasp and stretch them firmly.
Then, with a sharp, wide scalpel, cut across the vessels, until they are exposed, and then cauterize each side, as we have said in the extraction of arteries from the temples.
Then insert a needle where there is a double thread, and tie it to the first point where the thread emerged, and tie it again to the other end. Then cut them in the middle straight, along the length of the body, and remove the corrupted moisture.
Then treat the wound as with others where pus forms, so that no vessels fall that nourish one of the testicles.
For by this, no harm comes, and if blood comes to all the vessels, then the testicles must be removed by all the vessels. So that the testicle does not lose its nourishment due to the incision of the vessels, and dries up and cannot be helped.
The occurrence of this wound is due to the incision on the surface, or the extension on the abdomen in the region of the groin, so that the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles.
And this rupture is either on the surface, or from its extension, and these two types arise from many causes:
or from a blow, or a fall, or a kick, or lifting a heavy load, and similar things;
And the signs when it is from the extension of the surface are that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; And the abscesses are equal all the way to the bottom, because the surface presses on the intestines.
And the signs are when it is from the section of the surface, that it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the abscess appears different, under the skin close to it, and this is due to the exit of the intestines and the body away from the surface.
And sometimes the intestines descend with the bowels, and are caught in there, and cause great suffering to the patient, especially when they are pressed.
And in these treatments with iron there is fear, so it should be avoided.
And the method of the work is that you instruct the patient to return the intestine to its place with their hand inside the wound, if it can be repositioned; then be supported on their neck, between your hands, and lift the thighs;
then extend the heart above, and cut all the skin from the testicles lengthwise; then put inside the edges of the incision small hooks, according to what you need to open the wound, and let them be such that the pus can escape;
then scrape the surface underneath the skin of the testicles, until the hard white surface is exposed on all sides;
then put your index finger into what surrounds the testicle, into what is between the white surface underneath the skin of the testicle and the second surface, and separate what is behind the testicle and between the second surface;
and then move your right hand inside the heart of the testicles, and stretch the white surface upward with your left hand, and lift the testicle with all its surface towards the groin; and instruct the attendant to stretch the testicle upwards, and loosen what is above behind the ligament;
and feel with your fingers if there is any intestine wrapped around the hard white surface, and if you find anything, place it back into the abdomen underneath;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of many threads, and place it in the posterior part of the surface, which is after the skin of the testicles; after the groin, then cut the threads that appear from the threads, until there are four threads; then assemble them one over the other in the manner of a cross, and tie the surface, of which we have said that is beneath the skin of the testicles, with a strong bandage of two parts; then wrap the threads of the threads, and tie them firmly in two parts, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter, lest a hot abscess arise; and put again the bandage according to the first bandage, along two fingers of it, and after these two bandages leave of the surface which is beneath the skin of the testicles the width of one finger; and after all the other according to the roundness that the egg bears;
then cut in the part that is beneath the skin of the testicles, as long as the blood flows, and the swelling, as we have said before;
then administer wool soaked in oil, and apply to the wounds, and administer the bandage that we have mentioned. And sometimes the white surface that we have mentioned is cauterized after the incision, out of fear of the outflow of blood. For this happens many times, and leave the bandage until it falls off by itself;
and if it is slow to fall off, it should be warmed with hot water, and apply what we have said, until it falls off;
then treat the wound with another treatment, until it is completely healed.
of fleshy hernia
In this text I have never seen anyone who dared to use an iron to perform the treatment.
And the ancients said that it is done as if the veins were tied together, in this way, you tie the vessels, after the incision, above or slightly below;
then cut it in half, and treat the abscess of that which opens, until the vessel bleeds;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes a rupture occurs within the veins, as we have said, and the place opens;
and no intestines descend into the groin, and if any do descend, it is little, and it repairs itself every hour;
and yet if it remains too long in this condition, the wound or ulcer grows, until the intestines descend;
and this happens through the spreading of the ulcer that is within the veins, as we have said, for it spreads, then the place softens and swells and opens;
and the cure is by cautery, as we have previously said;
and sometimes is cured by iron in this manner: and it is that the patient lies often on his back between your hands, then cut the place of the broken swelling with a width according to the quantity of three fingers;
and then remove the ulcer that is under the skin that surrounds it, then take the reed and place it over the exposed area of the ulcer;
and press it deep into the belly, then stitch the two exposed areas of the ulcer onto the head of the reed, and stitch both;
then remove the head of the reed, and do not cut into the ulcer or stretch the egg or anything else, just as I have shown you in the treatment of the ramification of the intestines; then treat it with the treatment for wounds.
then treat it with the treatment for wounds. And when you cut the threads, clean it and treat the wound until it is healed.
The ulcer is constricted, and has no appearance of rupture, and the cauteries are milder in this place, and closer to healing.
of the softening of the skin of the testicles
Many times the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because the flesh within is softened, and it is easy to see;
and it is necessary, when one wants to cure it, that one lay the sick man on his back, and cut the softened skin over the natural skin;
then bring together the two edges with stitches, and if you wish, first stitch the excess of softened skin with three or four firm stitches;
then cut between the stitches, and cure it like other wounds until it is healed, and the thread falls out.
of the castration
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, and therefore I would prefer not to speak of it in this book;
and it is necessary only for two reasons:
one is that the male knows how to respond when questioned, and knows the cure;
and the other, because we often need to castrate some animals to help us, such as goats and sheep and cats and other beasts.
I say, therefore, that castration is done in two ways: or by pulling, or by cutting.
In the one that we do by pulling, we make the beast sit in hot water, so that the testicles are softened and hanging; then take them in your hand, until they are reset and you no longer feel them.
Of the castration of the testicles: You must tie the beast, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory, and cut on each testicle in one cut, when you have well skinned them;
and leave no bit of the surface and the subtle surface which is over the vessels;
and this manner of castration is gentler than that which is done by pulling, because with pulling perhaps some thing remains of the testicles, by which the beast desires lust;
then treat the wound until it is healed.
of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism is according to two manners in men: one is that between the two testicles appears also as the figure of a woman's nature, or there is hair, and sometimes urine comes out.
And the other manner is in women, and has on the pubis also like a penis and two testicles.
And the cure of the man and the woman is that you cut the added flesh entirely, and heal it as other wounds;
in the second manner, of men whose urine leaks through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
Tentigene is an added flesh upon the natural part, as long as it is too unsightly to see; and some women have it as large as a hand, and that is the cure.
You should carefully cut away the excess tentigene with your hand or shears.
and do not go too deep, lest blood flow, then cure it with another treatment until it is healed;
and there is another flesh that grows at the mouth of the wound, and fills it, and perhaps bursts forth, and resembles a cow, and for this reason the ancients called it "cow-disease". If it is necessary, cut it, as we have said of the tentigene, and treat it until it is healed.
Wandering is so when the nature of the woman is not pierced, or the opening is small; and is natural at birth, or accidental through illness that has come to it;
and is natural at birth, or accidental through illness that has come to it; or it is by added flesh, or by a subtle or thick surface, and is done deep in the womb, or in the ribs, or below, or wherever it may be;
and prevents conception, and childbirth, and perhaps the flowers to have;
and the knowledge of this is by the gaze of the woman.
If the numbness is clearly present, seek it with your fingers or the rod.
If it is of a subtle surface, and it is close to the two lips, hasten, and do it thus:
place your two index fingers together, and let the woman be on her back, her legs spread.
then stretch the two lips widely, so that the subtle surface is rounded and the numbness is overcome;
then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it over the area, and let the woman lie on her back each day, so that it cannot heal.
And if the surface is hard and thick, you must cut it with a spatula, resembling a myrtle leaf.
If the numbness is from a new wound, then suspend it from a hook and cut it.
and have medicines that stop blood, such as dragon's blood, frankincense, mixed with egg white;
then administer a wide lead band, so that the wound cannot heal;
and so be it for a long time, and administer a tent of dry linen;
then be treated with other remedies until it is healed.
And when in the sore comes dead flesh, it must be cut away in this manner, if it is not festering abscesses. For a festering abscess that is in the sore, one should not touch with fire.
of hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood flows habitually, and when the hemorrhoids are old they become painful.
And we have already discussed the types and signs of these, and now I will describe those that are receptive to treatment.
I say that hemorrhoids and pain, when they are deep within the sore, and do not appear externally, are not curable with iron.
Those that are at the opening of the sore, which can be felt, are those that can be cured.
Therefore, you must place the woman in a cold room, then seize the pain with pincers and cut it at its roots, then powder it with medicines that stop blood flow, such as oak galls, dragon's blood, and frankincense, and similar substances;
then place her feet against the wall for an hour, then put her in cold water;
and if a discharge of blood comes, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate bark, galls, and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and oil, and make a plaster for her back.
And if it stops, it is good. If not, then apply leeches to her back and breasts without causing injury;
then take wool, and soak it in plantain juice or elderberry juice with old wine, and apply it to the area.
And when the abscess subsides, treat the area with ointments until it is healed;
and the one called "albathir" is red, and resembles a rough head, if it is necessary to cut it off like I have said the boil; and then treat it until it is healed.
Many kinds of abscesses come in the body, such as chancres and stony abscesses and herpes and sores and fistulas and hemorrhoids and hot abscesses, and many other diseases that I have mentioned in the division.
It is necessary therefore that I say in this treatise the hot abscess which comes in the body, which is not among the abscesses that collect pus;
and if you wish to know the treatment of it, observe if the abscess is sharp at the beginning of its appearance, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red so that you can see it. Then do not hurry to pierce it, but let it mature until the pain is appeased;
and then make the sick person sit on a seat, and have two small seats where he leans, and rest on his back and bring his feet to the sides of the leg;
and let his thighs be spread out, and let him place his arms under his knees, and bind them well with a good bandage;
then suck the wound towards the right side, and administer the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the sore, of which the form comes afterward;
and it is necessary that when you wish to administer this instrument, that you first insert the rod to know the depth of the sore, so that what enters the instrument does not go any deeper than it should, and that it does not injure the sick person; and if the instrument is larger, then it is necessary to cover the depth of the sore with cloths, so that the instrument does not injure it;
and it is necessary that he place the horn of the instrument on top, and that he hold the instrument.
And when the abscess is open, and one cuts it with a soft hand, then it must be cut at the top, with a lancet.
and when the boil is emptied, then it is necessary that you place in the wound soaked cloths in rose oil, or in dry green oil;
and place the cloth deep within the wound, and put over the wound and the lancet clean wool soaked in water or boiled mallows;
then treat it after two days of suitable ointment, until it is healed;
and sometimes one cleanses the wound with a clyster of water and honey, and then with water or the roots of lilies and aristolochia long, boiled; then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is reopened in the wound, you must beware of using iron, but treat it as we have said in the division.
of childbirth It is first necessary for the midwife to understand the natural process of childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman pressing down, and desires to smell the air.
then the child hastens to emerge. Then know that this childbirth is according to nature, and the issue is beneath its head, and the afterbirth with it.
And when you see these signs, then it is necessary to gently press her abdomen, so that the child emerges quickly.
For when it descends beneath its head, the afterbirth emerges with it, and the mother is cleansed of her superfluities by good cleansing.
And that which comes otherwise does not come naturally.
For it sometimes comes upon its feet, and comes out of the body or the head, or the hands, or it comes upon its belly, or sometimes, and is turned perhaps upon its neck, and by other bad positions.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and subtle in these matters, and to guard against error and deception, and I will show you all the positions, how one should help her.
If the child comes out upon its head through natural birth, and the woman is laboring hard, and her strength is weak, then have her sit upon a stool, or let women hold her.
and apply her nature of oil or fenugreek that is cooked, and then let the midwife put the small spatula, of which this is the form, between her fingers: and sever the afterbirth, and cut with her fingernail until the moisture which is within escapes outward;
and grasp the woman's belly until the child descends, and if it does not descend, then it is necessary to administer an enema to the woman of fenugreek-muslin with sesame oil;
then have her drink and sneeze with the concoction, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour: then the child will now emerge.
And if the two hands are protruding outward, it is necessary that you gently reset them little by little; and if they cannot go back in, then place the woman on a seat, and raise her feet up; then lower the seat to the ground, and hold the woman so that she does not fall when it is lowered;
and if the hands cannot go back in, and the child dies, then cut the hands off with the knife that is mentioned previously, and remove the child, and gently reset them as well.
of the child's exit from between its feet When the child comes out between its feet, then it must be pushed upwards; and then turn it slowly, until it is straight;
then take it by the feet and stretch it slowly.
If it leaps to the thighs, then command it to be grasped, and make it sneeze forcefully; if it leaps away, if God wills it.
And if it does not leap away as we have said, then turn it slowly, until it is in its natural position. For then it is easily done.
And if it does not leap away as we have said, then take a mixture of aloe, and oil of sesame, and melted gum, and grind everything together in a mortar; and place this ointment on the affected area, and then have her sit in warm water up to below her ribs;
and when she is softened below, then apply a poultice of myrrh, and place it below, and leave it for an hour; then have her sit on a chair, then make her sneeze and restrain her mouth and nose, and gently grasp her belly, for the child will now jump out.
from the delivery of the child onto her knees When the child comes in this form, the midwife will gently place her hands over it; then she should be placed on her back, with her feet hanging down, and lie on the bed; and gently bend her hands, and then grasp her hands on her belly, and remove the cushions underneath, until she is ready to deliver; and if the child does not emerge, she should take her feet and shake them firmly, then gently move the belly upwards, then apply pressure with your hands; and gently draw the child out; and instruct the woman to strain until the child emerges.
of the child's emergence, which comes from a wide opening with a hand extending. It is necessary to devise a method for pulling back the hand: if it cannot be pulled back, then have the woman rise and walk;
if she cannot walk, then have her lie down on the bed, and straighten her legs firmly;
then administer the poultice that I have described;
and if she does not give birth, then have her sit on the seat, then study how to pull back the hand; and draw the child according to natural form, and have her sneeze, and instruct her to strain until the child comes out.
of the child's exit from its position on her neck, and have her hands spread out, and her face turned toward her mother's back It is necessary that the attendant hold her hand, then turn it slowly, and draw it lightly;
and when it is equal, then place upon the natural mucous membrane of the uterus, and oil, as we have said, then instruct her to move slowly;
and when you have done this, have her sit on the seat, and instruct her to strain; and have her sneeze. in this same manner for the entire afterbirth
in this same manner for the entire afterbirth When it comes forth in this manner for the entire afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your fingernail, until the moisture is emptied;
and if the infant hangs by its face and its neck, then cut it from the neck, so it is not held, and the infant dies;
then put the child inside, until you have placed it as it should be, and instruct the woman to take it sometimes:
of the issue of twins Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four are born; and this is not a strange thing, and rarely happens. Two are a strange thing, and do not live, if rarely named;
Two are a strange thing, and do not live, if rarely named; I know that they are multiplied, and are separated by the surface that divides them, which is attached to the womb;
and sometimes they emerge as naturally as a single child, as we have said.
And if they emerge with difficulty, then treat them as we have said, and let the treatment be subtle, and quickly and lightly do what it does; and do so as it deserves to be moved to health. of several children
Sometimes they are formed in the womb I or II or III or IV or V or VI or VII, or several as many as fifteen, and are fully formed in the form of a child by the measurement of the wise glorious, and it is necessary for the physician to know all of this, for perhaps similar things happen to him; then do according to what is necessary.
of the dead child
When you treat a woman of a dead child in the womb, as I have said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are constrained to work with your hands; then it is necessary that you know if the woman is of sound constitution, and has no accident or fear of death;
then it is necessary that the woman be placed on her back, and her head inclined downward, and her legs raised;
and the minister should hold her in two places, or bind her to the bed so that she is not pulled down by the child;
then rub the mouth of the woman with moist oils with the mucilage of mallow and fenugreek and flaxseed, then anoint the woman's hands with these oils and mucilages;
then put them lightly into the woman's mouth, then seek the place where she puts the tongs so that they are appropriate for it, and watch if the child is ready to descend on its head;
if place the tongs in its eyes or neck or mouth or palate or under the chin or in the throat or near the sides, and if the descent is on its feet, then place it on the chin and on the middle ribs;
and it is necessary that he hold the tong in his right hand, and place the curve between the fingers of his left hand, and gently apply it with all his hand, and place the tong in any of these places that we have said, until it reaches the empty space;
then place the other tong, or the third if you need it, so that the extractions are equal;
and then extend it equally by moving it from one side to the other, to pull it out, and let the tongs have teeth to hold it, as this is the shape:
And if part of it remains, then lubricate some of his fingers with oil, and place them on that part, and pull the other part;
and if any remains, then place this tong on a higher position, and do so until it comes out completely.
And if one hand comes in front of the other, and it cannot be brought back due to constriction, you must wrap it in a cloth, until it comes out completely; then cut it at the joint of the sole or with a knife, and thus you must do it in the other hand, and in the two feet.
And if the child's head is large and the birth canal is narrow, or if there is a sharp object lodged in the head, you must place the pointed spatula between your fingers, and split the head and remove the object; or you round it with the instrument called "almidach," of which the shape comes with the instruments or chapter that follows this one;
and likewise do this if the infant has a large head naturally;
and then pull the bones with pliers, and if the head slips out and it is constricted by force, let it be split, so that the moisture that is in the pus issues out;
and if it cannot come out, cut it into pieces as much as you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, you must pierce it until the moisture runs.
And if the infant is on its feet, the traction is slight, and the repositioning to the mouth of the wound is slight.
And if it is tight in the belly or in the breast, you must pull it out with a cloth wrapped around the hand; and slit the belly or breast, until the moisture that is in it runs out;
and if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains, the healer puts their hand deep into the wound, and pulls it until the mouth of the wound; then he puts one or two hooks in it and pulls forcefully;
and if the wound's mouth is constricted due to a hot abscess that has formed there, you should not work on it, but rather administer moist and greasy things; and apply poultices, and soak in soft and moist water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can put it upright, administer what we have said about the living child;
and if one cannot, pull it forcefully in pieces, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, administer what we have said about hot abscesses that appear in the wound;
and if a discharge of blood occurs, it should be placed in constricting water, and administer other remedies.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had been dead, then another was sewn onto that one, and the other one died too. After a long time, an abscess appeared in the groin, and swelled until it opened, and began to fester greatly.
I was called to treat it, and pondered it for a long time, and could not close the wound.
I applied a strong-drawing plaster, and one bone came out, and after a few days, another. I marvelled greatly, because the belly has no bones.
I thought it was the bones of a dead child.
I probed the wound, and drew out many bones, until the woman was in better condition; and the woman lived a long time like this, and sometimes a little pus would come out of the place;
and I have recorded this chapter only so that when masters encounter a strange condition, they might know how to provide help.
Here after comes the form of the press, with which one has pressed the books;
and to two turns at two ends of two cords. However, the horns should be more subtle than the restrictor, and be made of ebony or boxwood;
and let the mouth of the tube be one finger wide, and the margin of the wood one finger, and in length one palm and a half; and in between the two cords should be two joints of this same wood, which should be fastened in both, of half a palm in length or a little more;
and these two joints are placed in the mouth of the mortise to open when the two horns are turned.
Another form, similar to it but more subtle and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, resembling pincers; and have two joints at the two ends, as you see, one palm in length, and two fingers wide;
and when you wish to open the mortise with the entire instrument, then make the woman sit on a bed, feet dangling and legs open, then place the two joined joints together in the mortise, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs; then operate your hand on the entire instrument, as you did with the pliers likewise, according to the amount you wish to open the mouth of the mortise, so that the patient does what she wants.
These instruments are all superior, and their forms are multiplied; and when the master has prepared them, the work is hastened, and the men are more skilled because of their quantity.
Do not neglect the instrument until you have prepared it, for their necessities cannot be excused.
When the secondine is retained during childbirth, you must instruct the woman to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze with a concoction, and hold your hands tightly around her mouth and nose. And if she jumps because of this, well then.
If not, she takes a pot, makes a hole in the cover, and puts herbs in that can open the passage of the womb, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia, and centaury; All these herbs, or some of them, are boiled in water over the fire;
then place one end of the reed in the hole of the pot, and the other end in the mouth of the womb, and let it sit until the vapors come inside the womb;
then make her sneeze, as we have said. The afterbirth will come out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out easily, instruct the woman to moisten her left hand in oil of sesamum or in the juice of marshmallow, and then place it in the opening, and seek the afterbirth; and when she has found it, she should take it and extend it slowly and straightly, so that the womb does not rupture during the extraction;
but it must be moved gently to the right and to the left, and then pull; it will come out and separate.
And if the opening of the womb is tightly closed, we have described the treatment of sneezing and fumigation with herbs;
and if it is not by any of what we have said, be careful not to force it during the pulling;
but it is necessary that what is at the opening of the womb, that you bind it to the woman's thigh, then inject a four-herb ointment; if it will rot and reset, and come out;
However, when it rots, a foul odor comes to the stomach and head, and harms the patient. Thus, suitable fumigations are necessary for this:
None of the ancients have tried fumigation with cress and dried figs.
The form of the instrument with which one fumigates a woman for the retention of flowers and the afterbirth is this:
And it is of glass-like appearance, and one places the narrow end in the nature, and the wide ends over the fire;
and let the fumigations be over the embers, and the scab until it is gone, and start another.
Many children are born who do not have the fundament pierced, but it is stopped by a small septum: Therefore, the midwife must pierce that septum with her finger, and do not pierce it with a sharp instrument, and watch that she does not touch the ligature.
then put on wool soaked in wine and oil, then apply ointment until it is healed.
And if you doubt that it might close up again, place a lead chain in the opening and leave it in place for several days, and have it removed when the child wants to go to the chamber.
And sometimes these blockages come from the closure of a wound or an abscess; if it is necessary to cut that blockage. if it is treated, as we have said about the lead chain.
Fistulas that come from under the fundament are swellings, and boils that come from beside the fundament, or in the space between the two parts, there is one fistula or many;
and when that swelling is old, it opens, and still moisture oozes white or subtle pus, and sometimes these fistulas are penetrating;
and are recognized by the fact that wind or flatulence comes out when the sick person expels it, and perhaps a worm jumps out.
And there are fistulas that pierce through to the bladder, and to the middle of the penis; and reach to the hip joint, and to the groin.
And thus one recognizes a penetrating fistula of the fundament, and not one that is not penetrating: and it is that you place your index finger on the fundament, and insert a thin needle of bronze or iron into the fistula when there is no twisting.
And if there is twisting, then insert a thin lead tent, or a horsehair, until you feel the tent or hair against your finger;
and if you do not feel it, and it does not come from the opening of expulsion, wind or pus, as we have said: know that it does not penetrate. then hurry in treating it.
And when the fistula is penetrating to the bladder or to the urine duct, urine flows out, and cannot be healed by medicine.
If it is pierced to the hip joint, then the poison flows to the place. If there is no twisting and the pain is localized, it will often yield pus, and no medicine or ointment will be effective in stopping it.
And in these penetrating fistulas, there is no cure other than hard work, and the vanity of the foolish people who meddle with them.
In one that is not penetrating and is not old, there is hope for health through iron, as I have experienced, and it is that the sick person lies on their back in your hands;
and raise their legs up to their thighs, and have their thighs inclined towards their stomach; then put a tent of bronze, or lead if there is twisting, until you know where the tent reaches.
If the patient feels it around the foundation, then you must put your index finger there, then you will feel that the tent has pierced it;
and be uncovered where you feel between your finger the surface or flesh, then know that it is penetrating; if not, work not, as it cannot be cured.
However, some are said to be curable, but this happens rarely;
and the aid that is given is to heat the subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula, as it is said before; and place it, all hot, into the fistula, until it comes near the bottom; and do this two or three times, until you know that these diseased tissues are burned, which are like a bird's feather;
and then treat it with wet tents in butter, until that tissue comes off, then treat it with an ointment that heals the flesh and stitches it together.
If it is thus healed, it is good.
If this, otherwise, cannot be healed;
and if the tent goes in, and does not pierce to the finger that is at the foundation, and between your finger and the tent there is a thick covering of flesh or skin, and you see the fistula at that which followed the covering of the heart; if you cut the beginning of the fistula, and push the tent forward, and then cauterize afterward, until it comes to the head of the tent; and the tent will be delivered, and will fall;
then cleanse those displaced tissues that appear like a bird's feather, and leave nothing behind.
And if the blood overwhelms you, and flows between you and the work, cauterize it with fire or with sharp medicine.
For cauterization with fire combines two good things: that is to say, the burning of these added tissues, and the stopping of blood and the drying of the moisture;
then treat the moist tents with butter or crushed herbs, until the place gives off pus, and the burned tissue emerges in the pus;
then treat the wound with ointments that thicken and solidify the tissue, and these medicines are dry.
For when it is restored, it is healed and will not return.
And if a fistula goes down to the very bottom, and is far from the body, then put your finger into the bottom and investigate it.
If you feel the tent, and between it and the cloth or the surface or flesh, where it is close to piercing, there is only a path of trust and hope, through the administration of one of the three methods:
or you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it to the bottom, or if you can, put tents in it and treat it as before;
and do not go too deeply, lest you sever the tissue that holds the bottom, and expulsion occurs involuntarily. then treat it as we have said;
then treat it as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you remove that covering and cleanse it after it has been cut next to the foundation, whether by tent or by another appropriate instrument; then cleanse that bruised flesh that is in the wound, as much as you can; then strive to restore the wound and to keep the fistula on the part outside the foundation:
then strive to restore the wound and to keep the fistula on the part outside the foundation: this will be a lighter thing for the patient.
And sometimes fistulas are according to this manner: and it is when you put the tent in the fistula, and it is on the side of the foundation next to the skin above, take a tent pierced at the top according to this form: And he puts one thread twisted into two, and puts the tent with all the thread into the fistula until it is at the top.
If it is piercing into the margin of the foundation within, then pull the thread from that hole, just as you put your finger into the foundation;
and pull the top of the thread, and join the two ends together, and tighten one to the other, and leave it one or two days;
and restrain it sometimes, until the thread cuts the flesh that is between the two, and it falls away;
then treat the wound until it is healed and sound.
If the fistula does not pierce, then make it pierce in all the ways you can, if it is not too deep. For it is not necessary to make the incision so deep with the thread, and then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the spine's spatula, with which one cuts the fistula, is very sharp on one side and sharp; and on the other side not, so that one does not cut what one should not cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are according to two manners: or they are within the fundament, like grains of resin, and there are small and large ones, and they often bleed, and there is one or more of them, and they are under the fundament and at the head of the fundament;
but those that are under, have little moisture, and often bleed a little yellow water or a little blood, and have the color of the body;
and the treatment for those who have them within the fundament is that you instruct the patient to strain himself to go to the privy, so that the fundament emerges, and the veins appear; if you hurry, and hold it with tongs, or you hold it with your fingernail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the needles cannot hold them because of their moisture, then take them with a cloth, or cotton, or a piece of chamelot; and pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and powder over them some hot powders that are in place of cautery; or you cauterize them as it is said in the chapter on cautery, then treat them with other treatments until they are healed;
and if the fundament cannot come out, then inject the patient with a biting and harsh clyster to wash what is in the fundament, so that it may come out openly; If the patient is strong, and if the thread is firm from the fundament, the cure is easy;
If the patient is strong, and if the thread is firm from the fundament, the cure is easy; and it is that you take them with your nail or pliers, and cut them, then treat them as we have said, until they are healed, and that they dread the incision by iron. Thus it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner:
Thus it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner: Take a twisted thread and put it in a needle, then pull the thread over and pierce the needle on the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread under the needle, and let it be of ample size;
and tighten the thread firmly, then tie the thread, and remove the needle, and do likewise with all the others, and leave one for running off the excess blood;
then place over the foundation a damp cloth soaked in rose oil or in ointment, and put it on the foundation, and instruct the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they dry up, and when they are dried, then treat them with ointment and other remedies, until they are healed.
of the drying of the wound or foundation Many times there is drying of the wound in the intestines, and due to constraint of nature, and when the illness is old and medicine is of no avail. If it is necessary, you should scrape with a spatula or your fingernail the crust from above, which does not let it moisten; then treat it until it is sound as is proper;
and if it cannot heal, then repeat the scraping more forcefully than before, until it is very healthy and has a scab; then treat it until it is healthy.
how it trembles A formice is a small, hidden appearance around the body, and goes very deep;
and sometimes it finds the cold, and it is felt as if trembling, and it comes over the whole body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the cure is that you take a reed from a goose's feather, or a strong hawk's feather, and place that reed over the tremor, so that the circle surrounds the tremor completely. then turn your hand over the entire reed until you cut all around the tremor, and push it deep, and remove the tremor from its roots.
And if you wish, make one of copper or iron reed according to this form, and let it be subtle beneath and drawn above: not piercing, in order to hold it in the finger and press it.
And if you wish, cauterize the tremor, as it is described in the chapter on cautery.
Sometimes a clyster is made of silver or gold, or of melted or hammered copper;
and sometimes these instruments are made small or large, according to those for whom they are administered. Those that are administered in the treatment of children and those who are weak and in pain are small.
Those that are administered in the treatment of children and those who are weak and in pain are small. The shape of the small and large clyster is, from above, wide, where the belly is bound in this manner:
and there should be a separation where the belly is bound, as you see, and the clyster should be pierced inside;
and have two openings on one side, and one on the other;
and let the belly, where one puts the medicines, be of an animal's bladder or parchment, and be pierced all around with small holes, and let there be one inch of space between each hole, then put a strong thread of twisted thread into each hole in an X or in a spiral, and assemble the belly as a sheep's; and when the medicine is inside, bind it with a strong thread to the instrument in front, then clysterize;
and that is the form of the circle:
And let the medicine be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or similar thing, then insert it gently; then the minister squeezes it with both hands together, until it is all out, then remove the clyster, and the patient raises his legs to the wall, and if the medicine wishes to come out, then hold them up as much as he can; and if he sleeps soundly all night, it is a greater help.
And if you administer the clyster in a disease of loose bowels, and the medicine hurries to come out, then repeat it until it is healed.
And if the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, or an abscess, let the clyster be as subtle as for a child;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster whereby the skin is squeezed:
We have already said in the division of the treatment of wounds;
or we will tell you the treatments by hand and medicine, according to the completion.
I say that wounds are diverse according to what they are made of, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and of what they are made.
The things by which wounds are made are by the throwing of stones, and the cutting of swords and knives, or of lances or wood or arrows, or of similar things;
or which are made according to the places on the body, such as wounds that fall on the neck, or on the head, or the chest, or the belly, or the liver, and similar limbs;
and I will tell you the treatment for each wound, and will begin with simple wounds of the head, for the remembrance will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, take care if it is from a thrown stone or similar things, and the skin is nevertheless broken and the wound is large, and you doubt a rise of a hot abscess: if you immediately make it bleed from the cephalic vein itself if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be opposite the injured part;
and prevent the patient from overindulgence in wine and heavy foods.
And if he does not want to bleed, let his diet be light, and let him drink no wine, nor eat any meat;
and place on the wound, if a hot abscess arises there, cotton moistened in rose oil only, or in astringent wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, place on the fresh wound, if it is completely covered with blood, and if it is not exposed to the air, powder, which I will say a little later;
and if the burn has been exposed, place some ointments on it until it heals.
And if the wound is large, such as from a sword cut or similar, and the edges cannot be brought together with bandages, bring them together by stitching, as I will say concerning wounds of the belly, of the chest.
If the wound is exposed bone, and hanging, and only held by a little, cut it away; then treat the wound with medicine, and replace the tough flesh in place of leather, and instruct the patient to eat hearty foods, such as head, and cooked wheat, as well as poultry, and similar things.
And if you find rot in the skin, and it is not reaching the bone, cut away all the rot, and throw it away, then treat it.
and if there is an artery in the wound or vein, from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped by medicines, then seek the artery, and if you find it loose, tie it with a thread; and if this does not help at all, then cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the treatment is light. and that you put this powder on it so that the wound will heal faster.
And the method of the powder is: take incense one part; dragon's blood two parts; live chalk three parts, and powder it finely, and fill the wound, and compress it firmly, until it heals well and joins with all its blood;
and then bind it well, and leave it without unbinding, if it does not swell; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes one makes use of chalk alone, when one does not have incense or dragon's blood, but so that the burn does not change the wound.
And if the burn has changed the wound, especially if it is in the state of, one does not put this powder in it;
but puts on some digested ointments, or flour of barley made from water and honey, until it casts a scab; then cures it with other remedies until it is healed.
And if the broken bone comes with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with fine forceps;
and I will tell you afterward about the fractures of the head.
of the wound in the neck
If a wound occurs in the neck, and it is simple, there is no difference between it and those of the head; but if the nerve of the neck or the artery is severed.
If it is the nerve, there is no other remedy than to leave it to heal, and not put any constricting thing on it, because it harms the nerves and causes them to retract; and do not put anything cold on the wound, for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is also with the brain, which is the highest member;
but let the medicine be warm, such as warm water diluted with rose oil, and warmed water also diluted with rose oil, and other mineral stones in the same way, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, suture it and bind it with bandages, then let it heal until it is sound.
And if the wounds are deep and it is festered and full of pus, then pierce it in the lowest area;
and if the artery is cut, and bleeding ensues, then tie it off, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the windpipe in the throat is cut, or the heart, and the passage is protected, through which the food goes, then suture the heart to the windpipe of the throat and do not touch the throat, but return it to its natural shape; and then hold it (the wound) closed, and leave it for some days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, then search for it; and if there are pieces of bone, then remove all that you can, and those that you cannot remove, leave them until the wound has festered and the exit is freed and made smoother;
and if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle the powder that I have mentioned on it. And if there is bone in the wound and a fistula, treat it as I have described in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or a knife, and the wound is deep, observe if gases escape from the wound when the patient breathes. Then know that the wound is mortal.
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, then do not put powder on it at first, nor bandage it tightly for the blood to not linger deep, and return to the heart, and kill the patient. but put an attracting ointment on it, and bandage it twice a day;
and if you have no ointment, then put old cotton in the wound to absorb the moisture, and make the patient sleep over the wound for three or four, or more days. then there will be no spasm, nor tremor of the heart, nor tightening of the vein; and when you see the good dispositions, know that the wound is healed. Then cure it with bandages and other treatments, until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, and opens again, know that there is a fistula;
if you treat it as one should. And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and it is simple, or on the chest or back, treat it like one on the front; if it is large, with stitches;
and if it is small, with powder, and if it has pierced the bone, and broken pieces, look for the wound, and pull out the fragments if they are separated; and if they are not separated, let the wound fester, so extraction will be easier;
and the judgement for other wounds on other limbs is as we have said.
of the rupture of the belly
The rupture of the belly is large, medium, and small;
from the large wound sometimes the intestines, or the nerves of the intestines, jump out, causing their intrusion;
and the healing is more difficult, and sometimes a small wound is worse than a large one, because it is more difficult to put the intestines back in, if one does not put them back in immediately;
because the intestines swell immediately when they feel the cold, they are more difficult to put back, and therefore a moderate wound is worse, because it is more difficult to return the intestines to their place than in other wounds.
And know that the rupture of the belly is according to four manners:
the two common healings occur in the healing of the belly, and the healing of other wounds of the body, and two other specific healings are common to other wounds;
and nevertheless they are more specific to the healing of the belly, and I will explain each one and declare it.
I say that when the wound is small, and some part of the intestines protrudes, and it is difficult to put back, this is by one of the two methods: or because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen due to the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this manner: moistening a sponge or linen cloth in just lukewarm water, or you cook it in water with squinant, cypress, and spike, and warm the intestine until the swelling is removed;
and sometimes use astringent wines, and it is better than just water for reducing swelling.
And when you see the swelling subside, moisten the intestine with water in which cooked althea and mallows are, for by this the entrance is relieved of a little thing;
and if it cannot enter, then cut the wound slightly with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut;
and the first treatment is better than cutting, for no one should cut unless there is great necessity;
and this is the instrument for splitting it:
if it cuts into the curve and not beyond, and see here the shape: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine leaps out, then return it back to its natural position in its proper place, if you have the power, for this is of value.
When the wound is large, and it is in the part below the belly, then it is necessary that you make the sick person lie on their back, and put their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the part below the belly, then put the head and chest higher than the parts below, and likewise if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts, then direct your attention so that the wounded part is higher than the other;
and thus it is necessary to administer that which I say in wounds large and small.
In small wounds, put what is prepared, then have between your hands a compassionate minister who holds the entire rupture in his hand, and bring the lips together;
and that is the common manner of stitching, and that you should take a needle or several, according to the amount of the width of the wound, then leave from the head of the wound a space of one finger, and there place a needle where there is a good strong thread; and pierce the two sides of the skin with the two sides of the subcutaneous layer, which is beneath the skin inside, until you have pierced it from that side, and bring the two sides of the subcutaneous layer together;
then tighten a double thread around the needle from two sides, then bring the two sides of the wound together, and then leave one finger of space, and place another needle there;
then tie the thread as you did with the first needle, and do not cease to do this as needed with the needles, until all the wound is stitched;
and let the needles be medium, between subtle and thick, for subtle needles cut all the flesh, and the too thick ones cannot enter well: therefore they must be medium;
and it is not necessary to push the needles too far into the flesh and the skin, lest they cut and enlarge the wound before the stitching;
and then cut the points of the needles, so they do not injure the patient in their sleep, and put bandages or cloths on the points of the needles to hold them, and leave them until the wound is healed;
and this method of stitching with needles is more suitable for small wounds, for one or two needles are sufficient.
The second method is common, and is that you bring together the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the flesh together with a needle and a strong, medium thread;
and when you have pierced all four edges together, pull the needle back to the starting point, in the manner that one sews cloth;
and put a space between each stitch the thickness of a little finger;
This method is known to men, and I sewed a wound a man had on his belly, which was wounded by a knife, and the wound was more than one palm in size, and intestines were protruding about two palms in size, and the wound was in the middle of his belly.
I repositioned the intestine after it had been out for twenty-four hours, and the wound was closed within fifteen days, and I healed him, and he was healthy.
And the doctors had judged that he would die, and that was a miracle.
And I did not treat it with any ointment, for I was in a place where no such ointments or any other medicines were available. And I placed old cotton over the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until he was healed.
Now I will tell you two specific methods of stitching:
Take the needle and thread it from the outside part to the inside;
When it has pierced the heart of the right, place the head of the thread or the stitching where you threaded the needle, and have it pierce the other side from the inside to the outside;
And the understanding of this stitching is that you sew like the leatherworkers sew leather, and that you leave one side of the thread, and pick it up again on the other, until the stitching is entirely completed.
The second method of stitching, which Galen properly calls, is like some people do, who join the two parts naturally, and attach one end of the thread to the other end, in this manner:
Pierce a needle into the closest end of the wound, and pierce only that spot, and leave the two ends of the thread; Then turn the needle, and have it pierce from the outside to the inside, at the two ends of the thread;
Then pierce each of them from the outside to the inside, into two other ends of the wound on the other side;
And that is the most subtle and most common method of stitching.
Galen said this, and some testify, that one should sew the belly with two needles, or with a thread on each;
And one should insert one needle from one side, and the other from the other, in the manner of those who sew leather straps;
And know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the stitching is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
The judgment of the wound is like the judgment of other wounds:
And it is that when you find the wound fresh and full of blood, before the heat has changed it, you return the intestines to their place and stitch it up;
Then put on a powder of healing earth, and if the heat has changed it, put on any ointment that is present, until the wound heals; And tie the threads, and let the wound's edges and the skin grow together; Then treat the wound as the others, until it is healed;
And if you have no medicines, then as soon as it begins to heal, put on old cotton, and move it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need any more medicine in many cases when the wounds are simple;
And if you doubt that the wound might spread to the main limbs, then you should soak a light wool in tempered hot oil, or rose oil, and place it around the armpits and under the arms;
And if he feels pain or corruption in his bowels, which happens many times, then administer clysters of warmed dark wine, especially if the corruption has reached the intestines;
And pierce it inside, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small one.
The intestine called the "jejunum" cannot heal when wounded, and this is because of the abundance of veins in it, and because of the subtlety of the whole body, and the closeness of its nature to the nerves.
And if the diaphragm leaps from the wound, then return it to its place just as with the intestine, whilst it is fresh;
and if it is old and turned black or dark, you must bind the black area to prevent blood from flowing there, for there are veins and arteries there;
Then cut what is between the binding, and hang the two ends from below the wound, all the way down, to make the extraction easier when the diaphragm falls, and the wound heals.
of the rupture of the bowel
When the intestine is broken and the wound is small, it can be repaired in some people, for I saw a man who was wounded in the belly with a lance;
and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and it became chronic and developed a fistula, and there was expulsion of waste and gases;
I applied treatment as best I could, and I did not cease to refine it until it was healed, and the area was rejoined.
And when I saw it rejoined, I feared the patient might have pain in his belly; and he had no pain, but remained in better condition, and ate and drank;
and some experimenters said that when a small wound is in the intestine, it should be bound in this way: take a piece of linen with large heads, then bring together the edges of the wound, and when the linen has opened its mouth, place it over the two edges, so that it holds its mouth over them;
and then cut off the head, and this holds so that it cannot come undone, then put another piece of linen after it in the same manner as before, until the wound is completely covered; and stitch the wound.
This head will burn in the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and one can bind the intestine with a thin thread cut from the intestine of an animal, in this manner:
Take the end of this intestinal thread that is very thin, and then tie to the end of this thread a thin linen thread twisted, then put the thread in the needle, and stitch the intestine, and pull it into the rupture;
And this manner of stitching with linen is no stronger than according to the way of trust and hope;
And if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the large intestines, there is no device or skill, except for subtlety.
of fistula or that it be Know that any wound or abscess, when it becomes chronic, is universally called a "fistula", especially when it is deep-seated and pus-filled.
And a fistula, according to truth, is a hard, white, knotted swelling where no pain is felt, and is as deep-seated as the feather of a bird;
and sometimes it spurts clear pus, and other times thick pus; sometimes little, and other times quite a bit;
and I have already spoken of it in the division of wounds, that any wound which is not healed, and there is no flesh there, is no other way than by one of the eight causes: that is to say, by the smallness of the blood or the body; or because of its malice; or because there is hard flesh inside, and on the edges, which prevents flesh from growing; or there is too much pus; or the place is rotten, and the matter is of bad quality; or the medicine is not good in the cure; or because the corruption is a kind of pestilence; or because the property in the region is slow in digestion, and delays health, and swells by nature; or there are veins or bones:
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the cures of medicines in the division.
Now, it is necessary that I make you know the cure of a fistula which is made by the work of hands.
Know that a fistula occurs in all members of the body; for there are fistulas that come from large veins, and arteries, and nerves, or on the surface, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs, or to the spine of the back, or to any joint of the hands or feet; and some come to the property of the principal limb, and to similar places.
And all fistulas of this kind are difficult to cure, and there is only labor, and ignorance;
and if there is any fistula that does not come to the place I have said, and you are confident in the cure, and you want to know it, take a tin or iron tent, if the fistula is straight, look for it;
and if the fistula is crooked, seek it with a fine tent of lead, for lead bends easily around the twist.
and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot properly seek it with tents, then irrigate it through one of the openings, for the moisture will flow from one opening to another, and cleanse it.
then search it carefully to your ability, to know if there is bone or nerve, and if it extends deep, and ask the patient carefully about the pain they feel when you press your hand, and the place where they feel it;
and when you truly know the place where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or nerve, or artery or vein, or in any of the places I have told you, then cut it according to what I have said to you, and remove forcefully the foulness and the corrupted flesh that is within;
and then treat it until it is healed, and if the fistula is truly deep in the right place, you must cut deep as much as you can, then put moistened tents in sharp medicine, and place them down to the head of the fistula, so that the medicine corrodes the excess that remains at the bottom;
and then put ointments that promote healthy flesh, until they are healed;
and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, then cut it.
If a vein or nerve does not bother you or the principal limbs, as we have said;
and if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, then clean it until the corruption is entirely removed, then treat it with things that promote flesh until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, and returns to a boil as before, know that you have not gone to the bottom of the matter:
if you uncover and seek until you are at the bottom, and remove all corruption, then restore the place;
and if it is thus healed, it is good. If not, know that the corruption is too deep, that you cannot reach it; if there is no other remedy than to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can pull it with tongs, then pull it with a suitable instrument for that, and if there are many bones, pull them all out, and leave not a single one;
and if the moisture resists you, and there is no error or fear, then cut through the moisture and flesh, and free the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, put something on the wound that will cause rot, and leave it until the area around the bones is rotten, and then the bones will be more easily extracted.
And if it is a large bone, such as of the leg or thigh, then restrain the corruption only until the blackness is entirely removed, then restore the wound;
and if there is a large part of the corrupt bone, and it reaches down to the marrow of the bone; then it must be scraped and cut completely down to the corruption, and then cured until it is healed;
and I will tell you about a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take an example and help in your work.
He was a young man around 30 years old, who had a pain in his leg from a cause that came within the body, until the matter reached the leg, and it became swollen with a large abscess, and there was no cause to delay opening it;
but the physicians in their foolishness worked so hard that the abscess opened, and much matter flowed out, and it became a fistula, and many openings came that all discharged pus and moisture from the body;
and many physicians applied treatments for two years, and there was no wise man in the art of medicine, until I was called, and I saw his leg and the remedies with which he was being treated, and what flowed through the openings in large amounts; and the young man's body became red, and had a yellowish color.
I placed a tent in one of these openings, and then searched all the openings, and found that one came up against the other from all parts of the leg.
I hurried, then, and cut into one of the openings until I uncovered part of the bone, and found it corrupted and pierced, and the corruption extended down to the bone itself;
I cleaned away what appeared to me of the corrupted bone, and believed that there was no other corruption, other than what I removed;
and began to restore the wound with healing medicines for a long time, and it could not heal;
and then began again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continuing into the bone, and cleaned it, and then removed it, and I tried to close the place; but I could not do so until I cut around a palm's breadth of the bone, and the wound was entirely open, then I restored it with medicines; and it healed and closed quickly, and it was no longer necessary to restart the work except for the patient's weakness, who could not endure, and for the fear of death that I had of him. For due to the blood evacuation, he often coughed, but he was completely healed, and a hard flesh grew in the place of the bone, and it was well-disposed and caused no harm or hindrance whatsoever, neither in the air nor to come.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, it should be treated in this way: Take a bandage, and tie it to the protruding end of the bone, and instruct someone to extend it upwards; and put another bandage of thicker wool over the first bandage, and bind it over the flesh that is above the bone, and extend the head so that you pull the corrupted flesh away, and expose the skin above the place where you wish to work, so that the bandage does not hurt the flesh;
and place a piece of wood or a board under the bone to help cut away the corrupted flesh;
and you should continue this way as long as you can see and feel the corruption, and do this repeatedly.
And if the bone is corrupted, and does not show, and the corruption is within or in a part of it, then expose all the flesh;
then put a piece of wood underneath, and then bandage from one side to the other of the corruption, and let the bandage be the length of the corruption, as we have said;
and if the corruption is in the joint, then cut the corrupted joint, and bandage the bone where it contains on the other side;
and if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, there is no other remedy than to cut;
and if the corruption is in the finger of the hand, or the finger of the foot, that is a very strong thing, but nonetheless you must inquire about this corrosion, how it appears to you; and cleanse it in all the ways you can, but let the veins or nerves not oppose you;
and know that the instruments and blades for cutting these bones are many, according to the arrangement of the bones and their appearance, and their thickness and their thinness, and their size and their smallness, and their hardness; and therefore, it is necessary to prepare a suitable instrument for each type of work;
and know that the work itself will show you the instrument you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the evidence of the types of illnesses; So consider the instrument you need according to what is appropriate.
The shoulder could dislocate either due to internal causes or because of fire;
and when you have treated that corrosion with medicinal cures, and they are of no benefit, then it is necessary to cut that limb down to the place where the corrosion reaches, so that the patient escapes death, or the greater harm, which is the loss of the limb.
and the sign is that the limb turns black, so that it seems to be burned by fire, and after the blackness, the corrosion can spread from limb to limb, and take hold of the whole body.
If you are hasty to cut, and if it is caused by the sting of certain venomous creatures, like sea scorpions and vipers and similar ones, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, cut it, and do not give it time to reach the hand.
And if it reaches the hand, cut it at the joint, so that the corrosion does not reach the arm.
And if it reaches the arm, cut it at the elbow.
And if it passes the elbow, it is death, and no strong treatment is of any use beyond the amount of its power.
And in exactly the same way do when the corrosion comes to the foot. If it comes to the first joint, cut it after the other joint.
And if it comes to the foot, cut off the entire foot. And if it ascends the leg, cut at the knee joint.
And if it comes above the knee, there is no other remedy than to leave the sick person to die.
And the manner of cutting or severing the limb is that you bind it above and below, and one minister extends one of the bandages downward, and another minister the other bandage upward, and you separate the flesh between the two bandages to a space of one span wide, so that the bone is uncovered;
Then cut or sever it, and place a linen strip on each side, so that the severed part does not touch the healthy area, and bring no further injury or abscess to the sick person.
And if bleeding occurs when you operate, cauterize the area quickly, or apply some constricting powders;
then return to your treatment until it is complete, then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you that it happened to a man on his foot:
he had a blackening that resembled a burn from fire, and this corrosion first appeared on his toe of his foot, until it affected his entire foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he quickly cut off his foot, and was healed;
and a long time later, the corrosion returned to the toe of his hand, and he came to me, and I applied restorative things after cleansing the body, and the corrosion could not cease;
and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I did not, because I had hope of repelling the matter; and I also feared that if I cut off his hand, he might die, for the man's strength was weak;
and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and hastened to cut off his hand, and was healed;
and I have recorded this only so that others might do likewise, if they have need.
Sometimes an abscess forms in a fleshy area, and lingers so long that it gathers a large amount of pus; and then it bursts and the pus escapes, and the place remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin on top is as thin as delicate drapes, and does not reach down to the bone, nor to the nerve, and such an ailment is called "proud flesh," and not "fistula";
but if it extends so far that it reaches the bone deep within, it is called "fistula";
and the skin is such that you must cut that skin all around, especially when it is thin, like a drape; and it does not heal due to its corruption.
And if you have hope that the skin will heal, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, treat it with an enema in this way:
Look if the swelling is large, and the pus that comes from it has a foul odor, then irrigate it with an Egyptian medicine made thus: Take honey, oil, and litharge, equally, and put it in a vessel over the fire, until the medicine turns red and becomes as thick as honey;
and then take of this according to your need, and mix it in water and honey, and irrigate the swelling, and compress the opening; and leave the medicine in for two hours, then remove it by pressing;
do this many times, until the swelling is healed, and the foul odor is removed;
and sometimes it is irrigated with water from ashes, when this medicine is not available, and you should take ashes from a vine trunk, and pour water over it, then filter it, and irrigate with it until you know that the swelling is thoroughly cleansed;
and if the patient cannot tolerate it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the water of ashes, then irrigate with water and honey, or if there is a little bit of litharge crushed in it; or you irrigate it with honey and mixed wine, as honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and wine dries up the swelling;
and when you have done this, and you have confirmed that the swelling is thoroughly cleansed, irrigate it with that which causes flesh to grow there, and you should take diafinit plaster, and make it with rose oil and wine;
or you irrigate it with some medicines and ointments, of which I have described the properties in the treatment of ointments;
and if the opening of the swelling is small, and the nozzle of the enema cannot enter, then enlarge it slightly with an iron tool, and place a tent of Egyptian ointment, or basil ointment, until it is enlarged;
and if the wound is too wide, stitch it up, leaving only the space where the enema can enter; and if the opening that discharges pus is on top, cut it or in a lower spot where it is.
and if you cannot cut the swelling from below as you wish, prepare it in such a way that the pus runs to the lowest place where it is, for when the pus is deep, it does not allow flesh to grow there, and if you cannot cut the swelling from below as you wish, prepare it in such a manner: that the pus runs easily downwards, and leave none of the pus;
that the pus runs easily downwards, and leave none of the pus; and take consolidating medicines to place on the swelling, and spread a linen cloth over the entire swelling; then cut as much as necessary around the opening of the swelling a little wider than the first, then spread a gentle ointment on another cloth according to the size of the opening, and place it over the opening of the swelling to ease the pus, and do not remove the large cloth except after many days, once.
and that which is over the opening of the swelling, remove often to remove the pus, and know whether that which comes from the pus is venom or little or enough, or digested or indigested;
and be watchful if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine is thus spread and you see the nature leaping over the opening of the swelling, then know that the swelling is already healing, and health is approaching;
and then unbind it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you unbind the wound, change the cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if subtle venom flows after a long time, do not despair of health, for health is approaching.
For there are men whose flesh takes a long time to heal in their wounds, and others whose wounds do the opposite.
And if indigested pus spurts from the swelling after many days, know that the swelling will not heal.
And if the swelling is slow to heal, and is prolonged, add drying medicines that are moist in substance and dry in virtue, as defined ointments, for there is a large part of vitriol in them, and that is the final medicine.
Take ointment *diaphinit*, and make it with rose oil, and sprinkle it with equal parts old wine.
Then mix it and apply it.
And this same thing works better when it is cooked in a thickened form, when *diaphinit* ointment is not available, or you take myrrh, aloes, and frankincense, grind it, and powder it over honey while it is on the fire.
And then apply it in strips, and spread it over the swelling, and sometimes an experienced herbalist administers long, celestially-rooted lilies, which is like the flour of vetch and centaury. And use it as simple or compound remedies. Grind them, and make powder, and place it over the honey I mentioned, and use it.
And if the cure is prolonged, and is not cured by this treatment, then know that the corruption is deep, and has made an impression on the bone, or the hard tissues, or the ligaments. If the cure for the fistula, as we said before.
Panaricium is an abscess that arises beneath the nail of the finger or toe, or perhaps arises in other fingers.
And when it grows older, and one does not take care of it, a foul abscess comes, and it runs and throws pus until it runs along the root of the nail, and perhaps it runs along the entire nail.
And the corruption reaches the bone, so that a putrid pain arises, and the fingertip is swollen, and the color is purple.
When you treat it as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not profit at all, you must cut away all the excess that remains of the nail with a sharp knife, and then cauterize the wound afterwards. Cauterization is very helpful if the bone is healthy and the nail is sound.
And if the nail presses on the flesh, and begins to prick and wound it, you must place a piece of wood under the nail that is pricking the flesh, and raise it, and carefully and gently cut the flesh, and put burning and corrosive medicines on the remaining flesh to remove everything. Then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corruption is in the bone, you must cut it open and remove the matter, for as long as the corrupted bone is there, it cannot heal.
And if you see the finger corrupting, you must cut it open in the manner previously described, then treat it until it is healed.
And if it is struck and pushed, and it feels great pain, you must first treat the wound.
Then cut the nail of the spur-toe with a sharp blade by cutting across it, and be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for the patient would feel great pain.
And if it happens, apply something to soothe it.
The swollen finger that arises in some men's hands by chance is entirely fleshy, and by chance there are some where there are bones, and sometimes there is a nail, and some of them arise at the root of the joint, or the origin is in some of the fingers.
The one that arises in any part of the finger does not change, and the one that arises at the joint of the finger, by chance changes.
The size of the one that is fleshy is so slight, in such a manner: Cut it at its root with a wide scalpel.
The one that arises in the root of the joint is difficult to cure: So hold it from cutting.
In that which arises at or toward the back, you must first cut the flesh roundly down to the bone, then cut the bone with a suitable knife, then cure it until it is healthy.
The swelling that comes to the fingers together comes from birth, or from a wound's healing, or from burning with fire, or similar things.
You must cut that swelling so that the fingers return to their natural shapes; then place between two bandages or cloths moistened in rose oil, so they do not rejoin; or you place between two pieces of thin lead, until the place is healed, as is proper.
If swelling comes to any of those fingers with the palm, cut that swelling as is proper.
Veins are large veins wrapped full of melancholy superfluities, that come to many members of the body;
and more happens in the legs of those who walk and work and carry, than in others.
Therefore, you should give him a purge of bile, and then a treatment with basil.
The treatment with iron is according to two manners: one is that they are cut, and black blood is drawn; and the other manner is that you tie the vein, and draw all the blood strongly.
The incision is according to this manner: first raise the leg with very hot water, so that the thick blood is thinned, then press the leg of the ill person from above the thigh down to the part below the knee;
then cut the vein in one place, or two or three, with a wide incision, then raise and strongly draw the black blood into your hand, from one end to the other, as much blood as the patient's strength can tolerate;
and then bandage it, and instruct him to eat foods that produce black bile;
and repeat the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are full, and harms the patient.
The raising of it is according to this manner: raise the patient's leg, if there is much hair, then place it in the bath, and heat the leg with hot water until it turns red, and the veins swell;
and if you do not have a bath, heat it over the fire, and then cut along the vein from the top of the knee, or in the part below the ankle;
then scrape the skin with a knife, and scrape the vein from each side, until it appears when felt;
and it is seen red and black, and when it enters the skin it appears also like a white cord;
then push it back underneath, until it is lifted from the skin, and then scrape it lightly with a knife, then cut it in another place above three fingers;
then scrape the skin over the vein until it appears, then lift it with the blade, as you did, and scrape it with another knife, as you did before;
then cut another incision, or several if you need them, then lift it, and cut it at the toe of the foot, then pull it and lift it down to the second incision;
then pull it from incision to incision, until it is all out, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull and lift it, then put a strong double-threaded needle into it and bind and pull it, and put a blade underneath, and turn your hand back and forth until it comes out; and be careful that it does not cut, for if it cuts, it cannot be pulled or lifted, and harm comes to the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, place moistened wool on the wound site in wine and rose oil; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted, twisted, and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must split it twistingly, but do not cut it; and pull it as we have said before.
The shape of the iron with which one cuts the vein is curved, and does not cut straight, so that it does not sever the vein;
and is of a large curvature, for if it were subtle, it would cut the vein, but let it be large as we have said, and this is the shape:
This vein is intertwined in legs, in warm parts where no herbs or trees grow, and in land where there is no moisture;
and perhaps arises elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens from the rot that comes under the skin, as it comes within the body of serpents and worms, intertwined between skin and flesh.
And if the signs of the beginning of this vein are that a very great inflammation comes to the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to emerge, just like a root of a plant.
When the head appears, you should wrap around a piece of lead of one and a half to two ounces, and a cloth, and let the lead hang on the leg, and every time it emerges from the wound, wrap it around the lead, and the cloth.
and if it is too long, then cut off a part, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root until it is all out; for if you cut it, it will return into the flesh, and cause an abscess and rot at the place, and a bad illness;
because of which thing it is necessary that it be treated little by little until the end, and nothing remains in the body;
and sometimes this vein, when it is treated, is five palms long or ten, and a man came to me, from whom it emerged ten palms long, and when you cut it, it makes one incision or opening, and pierces it to the bottom, so that all of it comes out;
and let the matter within be emptied, and apply healing medicines to the place to prevent any rot, then treat it as you would an abscess.
And sometimes this vein has many branches, especially when it opens near the joint of the foot, or in the foot, and many openings appear from which blood spurts out.
Then treat it as we have said before.
worms that grow between skin and flesh This illness is called "bull's disease" in our land, because it often afflicts oxen, and it is a small worm that arises between skin and flesh, and travels throughout the body, ascending and descending, and one feels it well by the alteration of limb to limb, until it eats through the skin where it goes, and causes sores.
and it is engendered by the corruption of certain humours, just as worms and serpents and leeches and ascarids come in the belly;
and one doubts its malice, for when it travels through the body, and it ascends to the head, and it comes to the eye, it might enter, and destroy the eye; and this happens many times.
When you wish to cure it and draw it out, one can only do so when it is going:
so it is necessary that you bind the place above and below with a strong bandage tightly, then cut above and draw it out forcefully, and if the worm is deep within the flesh, and you cannot find it, then cauterize it with fire above, until it dies;
and the greatest harm it causes is that it corrodes the eye, as we have said;
and if you see it coming or near the eye, press down on the eyebrow firmly below it, then cut above, and draw it out forcefully;
and the patient must use cleansing remedies and dissolving medicines for the putrid bad humors, and abstain from foods that cause putrefaction.
of the pain that comes from windiness This illness is called "vakirir" in our land, and is a pain that comes to certain limbs, and can move from limb to limb;
and I saw those things that I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of her arm;
and soon afterward, I saw it rise like a worm to the shoulder, more quickly than anything else, like quick silver when it runs from one place to another;
the pain departed from that place, and lodged in the shoulder, and then a short time later ran through the whole body, until it came to the other arm;
then she told me that it would run around the body repeatedly, just as I saw it.
I was greatly surprised how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never before seen this illness in this manner. However, I had seen many who had felt pain move from one place to another, but I had not seen it like this, as I saw it in the woman;
and I thought it was because the woman had a thin body, and exposed veins, and therefore that constriction of wind appeared;
and it does not appear according to this reasoning in those who are plump, and who have moist bodies and full veins.
And when you wish to cure this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears to you as we have said, then quickly apply leeches above and below, and then cut above so that the constricted wind escapes from the place. and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your eyes, then cure it with things that expel wind, such as foul-smelling pills, and Serapion's pills, and similar others.
Arrows are diverse, according to their appearances and according to the places of the body where they strike.
The diversity of them is such that there are some with large points, and small, and barbed, and soldered; and some with two angles, and some with tongues, and some with pieces;
and the one that strikes any limb strikes in two ways: or in a principal limb, like the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar limbs. When it falls then in any place of these limbs, and the signs of death, which I will tell you afterwards, appear: if it is necessary that you avoid the extraction of this arrow, for death comes afterwards in many conditions; and when these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow is not deeply embedded, then pull it out and treat the wound.
And the signs of the brain when the arrow strikes it and pierces the bone, and the surface matter that is on the brain is torn, are: when there is blindness and dizziness and paleness and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of thought, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps there is a flow of blood from the nostrils, or from the ears; and perhaps he loses speech and voice; and from the wound comes white moisture resembling pus, and it also comes out like burnt flesh;
and if these signs appear to you, then you must refrain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it is not embedded.
The sign of an arrow that lodges in the heart is that it is near the left breast, and feels as if it were stuck in a hard thing, and not empty; and perhaps the arrow moves like pus, and black blood flows, and coldness and cold sweat come, and fainting occurs: know then without doubt that death is coming.
And the sign of an arrow that hits the lungs is that frothy blood spurts from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and gasps loudly and seeks cold air.
And if the arrow strikes the chest wall, it is beside the small ribs; and causes great pain and gasping; and all the shoulder members move.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, perhaps some undigested food spurts from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the abdomen, and some straw jumps out through the broken intestines, there is no hope for treatment, nor for extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and the urine spurts out and flows away, and the patient feels great pain: know that the wound is mortal.
The other limbs, such as the arm and neck and throat and shoulder and shoulder joint and spine of the back and thigh and leg and similar members, are safe according to various conditions. When the arrow is in the nerve or artery, and it is not poisonous, as I will tell you what happened to me, so that you may do likewise.
It happened to a man that an arrow struck him in the tear duct at the root of his nose: I tried it, and pulled it out from the other side under the fat of the ear, and he was healed without difficulty.
And I pulled out an arrow that struck him in the fat of the eye under the brow, and the arrow was bent, and I could only grasp the tip towards the shaft, and the arrow was large, from a Turkish bow, entirely light, without feathers.
The man was healed, and no bad accident befell him.
And I pulled an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arab, with feathers.
I cleaned the beard, and skillfully extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I pulled an arrow from a man, that had struck him in the belly, and I thought he would die;
and after thirty days had passed, his condition did not change at all; I cut around the arrow, and extracted it, and it was removed, and there was no bad outcome.
And I saw a man whose arrow had struck his back, and the wound was closed over;
and the arrow remained inside him, and did not change his natural disposition, nor did he find any harm in any of his natural actions.
And I saw another man, whom an arrow struck in his face, and the wound was closed over; and remained thus without suffering great pain;
and many other similar cases.
And an arrow was drawn from a man of the king's princes, which had struck him in the middle of his nose, and was slightly leaning to the right side; and the arrow was completely embedded.
I was called to treat it after it had been lodged for three days. I found the wound very narrow.
I probed it with a very thin tent, and didn't feel it at all; and he felt a prickling and pain beneath his right ear.
I thought it was from the arrowhead. I put on a drawing and digestive plaster there, so that the place wouldn't swell; and the place of the arrowhead appeared to me.
and the place of the arrowhead appeared to me. I put the plaster on again and sewed the wound up again, and the patient remained like that for a long time, until he felt the arrowhead one day inside his nose;
and he told me so. I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound repeatedly, until it was open, and I probed it, and felt the head of the arrowhead beginning to move from its place;
then I added more of that sharp medicine to the opening of the wound, until the head of the arrowhead became clearly visible;
and the wound remained open for about four months, and then the wound widened so much that I put pincers in it, and moved it from side to side, and it could not come out;
then I continued to devise and invent methods using tools, until I found the proper pincers, according to what their design would be at the end of this chapter, so that I could pull it out, and healed the wound.
And the doctors judged that the cartilage of the nose could not be restored: I restored it then, and the wound was closed, and the patient was completely healed.
Or I have told you the quality of extracting some arrows, so that you may apply your treatment to what I have not said, for the book cannot encompass everything;
but the wise masters, comparing a great deal of knowledge, and considering what is present and lacking, find new work, and new instruments, for the treatment of the strange things that happen in this art.
I say that arrows do not leave the limbs where they are stuck except in two ways: or through the place where they enter, or on the other side;
and the one that jumps out through the place where it enters, is an arrow that enters into fleshy places, and sometimes it jumps out right away.
And if it does not jump out right away, leave it until the flesh is rotten around it, and the exit is eased;
and also if it is stuck in the bone, and it cannot come out, leave it like that for several days, and move it every day;
and then it jumps out, and if it does not jump out, then pierce around it with a very thin drill, until the place around it is widened, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is lodged inside the body, and cannot be seen, then search throughout the entire body for it; and if you feel it, then pull it out with a suitable instrument;
and if you cannot because of the tightness of the wound, and the depth of the arrow, and there are no bones, nerves, or veins, then enlarge the wound until it is large;
and pull out the arrow if you can, and if there are ears on the arrow by which it is held, then remove the flesh that is caught on either side as much as you can, and then break or bend the ears of the arrow until you can pull it out;
and be careful not to break the arrow, lest you pull it out more painfully.
And if you cannot at once, then leave it until the surrounding area is rotten, and then pull it out, for the extraction will be easier. And if the flow of blood makes you hesitant, then apply what we have said about the treatment in its chapter;
and beware of cutting the nerve and vein, and devise how you can best pull the arrow out without danger, whether quickly or slowly, or firmly or gently;
and place the patient in the position he was in when the arrow struck him, for this is the greatest aid there is; and if you cannot, then place him according to the signs that show you.
The arrow that comes from another part, or where something of it is visible, or the skin is swollen in such a way that it can be seen or felt distinctly:
then cut around it, until the pliers can grasp it, and then pull it out: if it jumps out now.
And if it is held in the bone, then turn your hand round and round, until it enters the bone, and widens the bone, then pull it out.
And if it cannot come out, then leave it for a while, and then resume the extraction until it comes out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is in it, then put it into the whole shaft;
and if the shaft has fallen, and you wish to administer a thrust, then administer a pointed instrument, so that the arrowhead enters the point of the instrument;
and then thrust firmly, and if the arrow is pointed, then thrust an instrument with a pointed end into it, to ease the extraction.
And if the arrow is embedded, then you must cut all the flesh around where the poison is, if you can, then treat the wound as is proper.
And if the arrow falls on the foot or the belly or the bladder or the side, and it is close, and you can cut above it, then cut above it;
and be careful not to cut the vein and the nerve, and then extract it, and then stitch the wound, if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the pliers with which arrows are drawn is similar to a bird's beak, and see here the shape:
And there are many types of them: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the arrowhead is also like the feather of a bird, to fit onto the point of the arrow, as here is the shape:
Of the veins from which one bleeds are thirty-one, of which there are sixteen in the head, that is to say: Two arteries that are behind the ears, which are called the two "herbs"; and the two arteries that are in the two visible temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspirations"; and the vein that is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the top of the nose; and the two veins that are in the neck; and the two veins that are in the lips above the mouth, and these are the veins that are called "augeherich"; and two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins from which one commonly draws blood are five in each arm:
One is the cephalic, and is on the left side, and the common people call it "vein of the head"; and the middle one is called "faste," and is composed of the cephalic and the basilic, and the common people call it "vein of the heart"; and the basilic is on the right side, and the common people call it "vein of the belly," and is above the bone, and is the one from which one draws blood, which is clearly visible above the wrist.
And the salvatelle is the vein that is between the auricular and the annular, and it has two branches;
and in the leg and the foot there are three veins: one is under the bend of the wrist on the left side, and the second is the saphenous vein that is at the ankle on the right side; and the vein called "ness," which is at the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg are three veins beneath those.
The bleeding of veins that are behind the ears helps with old colds and migraines;
and the quality of the bleeding, as I tell you, is that you raise the head of the patient and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then the patient tightens their neck with a vise, so that the two veins appear behind the ears in two places depending from the head: then take them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, then bleed from there;
then take the lancet and place it under the vein down to the bone, then lift your hand along the entire vein upwards, and cut through both the skin and the vein with two cuts, and make the blood flow as much as you want;
then restrain and bind it, until it is healed;
and I have already said about incision and cautery in the first book.
Bleeding from the two arteries that are in the two temples is good for chronic migraines, and persistent eye strain, and for sharp eye pain.
and the qualities of bleeding are as I said: and the patient should tighten their neck, until the two veins appear clearly; and feel the pulse under your finger, and then bleed from there.
Then lift the heart above the vein to your index finger, and insert the lancet underneath, and lift the vein upwards, and cut it, as you did in the other two veins, and make the blood flow according to your needs;
Then release the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, then place some cotton on it; and then bind it tightly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have already spoken of their cuts and their extractions, at the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the vein of the forehead is as effective as bleeding from the cephalic vein for illnesses of the face, for headaches, and for inflammation;
and the method is that the patient tightens his neck by twisting, until the vein appears; then take the instrument called "fosseur," of which this is the form:
And place the point on the vein, and press upon it with your hand, or something else, and allow blood to flow out according to the quantity you desire; then loosen the patient's neck, and tie the vein until it is healed, and sometimes the work is done with a wide flame.
However, the flame should not be too sharp; and hold it sideways, for the bone is nearby, and perhaps the flame will break when it is thin.
The cautery of the two veins that are in the two tear ducts helps the eyes, and the eyebrow, and the redness, and the inflammation in the eye, and the ailments of the face;
and the quality of their cautery is that the patient tightens their neck by twisting with some bandage, as before;
then cauterize, and let the cautery be sideways, a little long and a little wide, for there is no flesh there. And if the flame is thin, perhaps it will break;
then let the blood run, as much as you need, and then put a bandage on top of cotton, and bandage it well.
Cautery from the vein of the nose is good for colds, and for sudden madness, and for facial illnesses, like migraines and redness that comes to the face, especially when it is old;
and the technique for the cautery is that the patient should tighten their neck, then hold their nose with your left hand, and take a thin long flame, and place it in the space between the two nostrils, because the vein is not clearly visible there, and the blood will begin to run now;
and do not go too deep, and let the blood run according to your need, then bandage it for a night, because it is very quickly restored;
Cauterization of the two temples helps with constriction of the throat, and with the beginnings of a fever, and with many illnesses, and with impetigo, and with sores, and with herpes, and with boils;
And the technique of the cauterization is that the patient should tighten their neck from both sides, as we have said;
And let the master be standing over the patient's head, and the patient sit on a chair, then cauterize the vein a little widely along, then draw the blood moderately, or as much as is necessary;
Then do the same to the other vein, then loosen the ligature, and constrict both veins moderately, so that the patient does not choke; and leave it until morning, so that the wound is healed.
of the cauterization of the lips Cauterization of the veins on the lips helps with boils in the mouth, and with the corruption of the gums, and sores on the lips, and of the nose and around it.
And the procedure for cauterization is to have the patient sit before you, and restrain their neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look at the two veins, one on the right lip and the other on the left, and they are known by the fact that they are black, and by the fact that around them are fine black veins:
Then cut one and the other, and if you do not recognize them, and are uncertain, then cut the largest on each side, and likewise do with the two veins that are above and below, for it is the same method.
Of the cauterization under the tongue The cauterization of the veins under the tongue is helpful after the cauterization of the cephalic vein, and is for the constriction of the throat, and for illnesses of the eye, and for illnesses of the mouth;
and the quality of the cauterization is that the patient sits between your hands in front of the sun, and lifts up their tongue, and looks underneath on each side for a black vein:
Then cauterize one and the other, and do not go too deep, for beneath are the arteries.
The veins of the chest, which are commonly cauterized, are cauterized according to two methods:
or by pricking with a broad, flat flame, or a subtle olive-shaped one, like sharp knives, and is called "anesil"; and are broad or subtle according to the breadth and narrowness of the veins. The shape of the flat flame is very renowned, and is broad as you see:
And it is needed to open the veins filled with thick, visible blood, and those containing thick and troubled blood; And this is the shape of the olive-shaped flame:
and is more subtle and pointed, and is for bleeding veins that have subtle, yellow blood.
Bleeding from the basilica vein, which is one of these veins, helps ailments that are under the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the stomach;
and it is necessary for the leacher that he bleed wisely, and that he avoid the artery that is underneath. And if he cuts the artery, and a flow of blood comes, then it must be stanched, as I have said; And the lancet should not be piercing, but cutting, like a sickle.
And if the basilica vein is not clearly visible, then you must hold it and change to another one; or you want any vein of it, or you bleed in its place the vein in the middle of the arm: it appears clearly; and the cup to the lancet, like we have said.
And if you wish to know the location of the bleeding, then you must first hold the arm, touch the spot until you know the pulse; then mark the spot with a brand, and then bind the arm, and cut the vein with the lancet; and be careful that you do not strike the artery when you see the spot inflamed, for it is of the artery: Then wipe it.
And if you see it gush upwards like a child's urine, and the blood is red and thin, know that it is blood from the artery: Hurry then, and place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger if the blood stops, for it often happens; Then tie the arm, and leave it thus, and let the patient not move it;
and let it be in fear, and do not let him move it until it is healed.
And if the blood does not stop, and it overcomes you, and the medicine is not present, then cut the artery if it appears, for the head will recede; and stop the blood.
And take a fig-tree bark, and split it, and take one of the halves and bind well on it until the next day;
if the blood stops, it is good; if not, treat it, as we have said, with the powders that stop blood;
and the stopping of blood is not at all difficult in many cases due to the small size of the wound, and the strength of the arm's bandage.
The vein's bleeding in the middle helps to draw blood from the head above and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilica and cephalic veins, as we have said;
and it is necessary for the surgeon to be careful of the nerve beneath, and if it pierces too deeply, and it finds the nerve, it swells and the patient's condition becomes severe, and perhaps it cannot heal;
and this nerve often appears, and if it does not appear in some people due to its subtlety, then you must cut it with a lancet; and dry the nerve to your ability.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, then cut it lengthwise.
The surgeon from the cephalic vein assists, because it draws blood from the head and assists the eyes;
and it is necessary to bleed by piercing the olive vein or the myrtle vein, because it is the safest of all veins, because it has neither nerve nor artery beneath it. However, one must seek the easiest place, and do no harm if one fails the first time, and one starts again; and perhaps the place swells in some men when one fails the first time, but it does no harm.
The quality of the bleeding is according to your thought.
The first thing you should know about bleeding is that it is administered only to preserve health and to avoid future illnesses;
and let the bleeding be done in one of the three veins that are on the elbow: that is to say, cephalic, basilic, and median. and one should bleed at the beginning of spring fasting, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of fullness appear;
and one should bleed on the first or third day, after two or three hours of the day.
The bleeding that is administered to the sick has no set time, but whenever necessary by day or by night, at all hours and times;
and it is not appropriate to bleed children until fourteen years old, nor women carrying a child except from the fourth to the seventh month. And the old who have passed sixty years should not be bled.
And when someone wishes to be bled, in whatever manner, it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines with a gentle clyster, if they have retained much waste, so that the veins do not draw impurities from the intestines which harm the principal limbs;
and one should not bleed those who are overly full of food, nor those who are drunk, as long as they are unwell, nor those who are hydrops.
and one should abstain from bleeding after a colic attack, and vomiting, and bowel discharge, and excessive exertion in women, and labor, and wakefulness and fasting, and anything that weakens the whole person, whether from the spirit or the body;
then refine the humors, if the blood is thick, through foods and drinks and medicines, if you have the power to do so;
then enter a bath, if nothing prevents it, to refine the blood, and bleed from the vein in the armpit around the third part, as we have said;
and avoid work, and hardship, and lust, and similar things that day;
and be calm and joyful, and let the leacher be higher than the person being bled, and rub the arm two or three times, then tighten the bandage moderately, for when it is too tight or loose, the blood cannot flow;
and then rub the area with your hands until the veins swell and are felt;
then the leacher moistens the flame with a little old oil, then places his left hand's finger over the vein below the spot where he wants to bleed, so that the vein does not burst and fail when struck.
For there are veins that flee like ropes when bled, and there are some that are full of wind, so that when the flame is applied, it recoils from the flame, and the vein cannot be opened, and so it is with these. And if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the leacher must be attentive to these things.
And if the vein opens the first time, that is good. If not, he starts again a little below that spot, or above it quickly, if the spot is not swollen.
And if the spot is swollen, and the sick person is frightened, let it be a day or two, and do not tie the arm. Perhaps there will be a hot abscess.
Nor enter the bath, then restart the bleeding if it pleases him.
And if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly, and you fear that it will not issue as much blood as you wish, then staunch the wound itself with the entire flame directly.
And work a little hastily, before the spot is swollen. For this happens many times, when the wound is small.
If you see the spot swollen, do not restart the bleeding, and put a little oil-based poultice on it, for it alleviates the blood's movement, and the poultice is milder in this area than oil.
And thus apply the oil-based poultice to each incision you make in the veins, to stop the flow of blood;
And this same thing makes the wound dry and heals it, when it is applied to the area. The blood thins and disperses when it is too thick.
And if a large abscess appears, which happens many times, especially when the incision of the vein is small, then hurry and apply a sponge soaked in hot water and salt to the area, and hold it for an hour.
And you should do this after the blood has flowed from the vein, and if a black or green discoloration remains in the area after a few days, it does no harm. And if you wish, apply something of aloe or myrrh mixed with the juice of calamint, mint, or similar.
And many times, abscesses and appearances occur during the treatment of a basilisk bite.
Then place your hand over it, and if you find the area soft to the touch of your hand, that appearance is bad. Then desist from applying any of the things we have mentioned, for perhaps it is a cut of the artery.
But make a dry poultice to harden the area, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And draw out the blood, according to its quantity, its virtue, and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is dark, let it flow out until it is red; and if you see it thick, let it flow out until it is thinned; and if it is too hot, let it cool down.
And it is fitting for someone who is strong and full, and needs bloodletting, that a larger wound be made, and the incisions be wide.
and for someone who is weak, do the opposite, and they should be bled little and often, and should be bled by cutting across, not by pricking;
and this manner of bleeding is safe from the running of blood and the cutting of nerves, and is better than bleeding from the long or the wide.
And to someone whose body weakens during bleeding, it is necessary to give bread soaked in pomegranate juice; If they are heated, draw blood three or four times. And if they are of a cold disposition, they should eat bread soaked in syrup of mulberries, or in syrup of aromatic honey with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a well-scented syrup, before the bleeding.
And if they faint during the bleeding, after the outflow of much blood, it is necessary that they drink broth of meat and subtle fragrant syrup, and use the other things that we have mentioned in the division or chapter on syncope, for the evacuation of the vein.
And if he wishes to ventilate his arm and bleed again, it is necessary, when he is weakened by extensive bleeding, that he bleed little by little, according to the quantity of his continued strength.
And whoever wishes to ventilate their arm after the first bleeding, and they have a strong body, should bleed seven hours after the first bleeding, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wants to bleed from another part, should bleed on the second or third day.
For there is much blood within the body that is now heated, and causes fever; so a large quantity must be drawn, and the opening widened so that it bleeds profusely; since you observe all the conditions of bleeding, and place your hand on their pulse when they bleed, so that death does not come instead of profuse bleeding, and this happens many times when the bleeder is negligent;
and it is not appropriate when you wish to untie the arm, and make blood issue the second time, and the opening is closed, that you press strongly upon it; nor if it is bent, that he stretch the arm quickly, for this would be bad;
but let it bleed a second time; or you prick it with the point of the flame, so that the blood that is congealed at the opening of the vein issues forth, and put a little of oil softened in water, and press gently.
And if the vein is swollen, let it be and do not constrict it, until the abscess is soothed.
And if it is necessary to draw blood a second time, let it bleed in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the middle of the arm is lanced in the place of the vein of the head, because it is more compounded.
And the method of bleeding is that the patient puts his hand in warm water, until the skin is red;
then it is tied moderately, so that the vein appears clearly, then lance it through the middle, not from the side nor lengthwise;
and the opening should be wide, and be bled close to the joint of the hand, and if no blood comes out, put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood flow into the water, until you have enough;
and if it is summer, do not put the hand back in warm water, for it is put more in winter than in summer;
and the bleeding from this vein is safer than any other vein, because there is neither artery nor nerve.
Bleeding from the ulnar side of the right hand is good for all liver ailments, and this is the method:
Hold the hand, and put it in hot water, until the vein is swollen, so that it can be seen; and if the bleeding is across, and if you cut it completely through, it will not hurt;
and do not go too deep, for the nerves are underneath, bare of flesh, and then return the hand to hot water if the blood is frozen in the wound, and cannot come out.
And when you have drawn blood as much as necessary, put oil and wool on the vein to quickly seal it, and do this with each vein.
The bleeding from the left hand is good for the disease of mice, and do everything just as I told you for the right hand.
Bleeding from the sophen vein is good for all illnesses below the body, like ailments of the stomach, and retention of flowers, and illnesses of the kidneys, and thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the quality of this bleeding is that the patient puts their foot in hot water, and rubs the vein until it bursts, and ties above the joint of the foot; and the vein is at the ankle, and above the foot there are many kidneys;
Then bleed it in the larger kidney, or at the ankle, whichever is better.
And if you bleed above the foot, be careful of the nerves underneath, and bleed across it, just as in cutting;
And let the flame be gentle.
And if the blood cannot come out, then put the foot in water, and let the vein empty well.
And if the lancing fails the first time, then try again a little higher, for the place is inflamed;
And do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and do the same for the sole of the other foot.
The site of the sciatic vein is at the ankle joint, and its lancing is helpful for hip pain, when it is due to hot blood.
And the method of its lancing is that the patient enters the bath, and tightens four fingers over the ankle while twisting, for otherwise the vein is not apparent;
And if it appears, lance it in all the ways you can, and across it; And it is better that you cut it, for the place is safe, and it is very responsive to hands.
And it is better that you cut it, for the place is safe, and it is very responsive to hands. And if you do not find it, lance any visible vein on the back of the foot, towards the little toe, and be careful of the nerves;
And allow as much blood to flow as you wish, and then loosen the bandage, and put on cotton and tighten it; It is now healed.
Cupping is made of horns, or bronze, or glass;
and cupping is done in two ways: either by striking and drawing blood, or without striking.
And this cupping that is without striking is in two ways: either with fire, or without fire;
and cupping that is done by striking and drawing blood is done in fourteen places on the body, of which one is the top of the head; and another is in the middle of the neck; and two others in the two sides of the neck; and the cupping beneath the chin; and the cupping from the two shoulders; and the cupping above the hips; and the cupping between the two arms; and the cupping from the two legs; and the cupping from the two ankles;
and the cupping does not draw much blood, except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and for this reason it does not weaken the person, as is done with bleeding from a vein; and it should not be administered, neither with nor without fire, in any illness arising from fullness, until the entire body is emptied.
And if by necessity of illnesses cupping is needed, or for habit, we administer it every hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in between and at every time;
for there are some who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are some who find fullness and redness in their face, and in their head, and in their neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and some who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and cough up blood; and there are some who dream, and see by night blood and wounds and death and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is in the middle of the month, we order cupping after three hours of the day.
The leech from the temple helps the heaviness of the head… which comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary that this be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of the leeching of the cephalic vein, and it is not appropriate for those of cold complexion to use it, or those who have a cold, for it does them much harm;
and therefore, old people should not use it, nor those who have cold illnesses in their head.
And those who often leech themselves become forgetful, and therefore the cupping should be placed a little lower due to the fear of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the neck is in place of leeching of the head and basilic vein, and therefore it is good for tightening of the chest, and for fissures of the windpipe, and for all, and for repletion.
And it should be applied gently, for if it holds too firmly, it induces forgetfulness in the stomach and heart.
Cupping on the second ribs of the neck is good for pains of the head, ophthalmia and migraine, and for strangulation, and for tooth root pain, and is in place of leeching the basilic vein.
And you should instruct the patient to press his hand while applying it, so that he does not cut the artery and there is no bleeding.
Cupping under the chin is good for mouth diseases and gum corruption, and similar mouth ailments. And it is in place of leeching the two lips.
Cupping of the shoulders is good for illnesses caused by heat and fullness.
Cupping of the elbows is as effective as drawing blood from the three large veins of the arm, because it draws blood from these major veins.
And instruct the master not to strike too hard or deep, for the area is bare of flesh, and is near nerves and arteries.
Cupping on the buttocks is good for hemorrhoids of the fundament and for illnesses beneath, and the cupping should be large and made of bronze, as it needs to draw well. And perhaps, if it were thin, it would break. and would cause large wounds.
Cupping on the legs bleeds openly, for they draw blood from the whole body, and are good for old pains in the kidneys, and bladder, and urethra, and remove the obstructions.
And they are in place of the two shins, and the two ankles, and yet they weaken the body after long use, and cause a pallor in many conditions.
The method of applying a cupping glass is to first place it empty, and apply gentle suction, and place it quickly, and move it evenly, and do not stop until you see the area reddened and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears.
Then remove it, and replace the cups, and take note of the body's condition, for some have tender flesh, and clear pores: So it is necessary to strike only once, and it is necessary to make wide wounds, and a little deep. and suck gently.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to strike twice: the first time to make the path of the thick blood thinner.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to strike a third time;
and when we want to draw little by little from the blood, it is enough for us only once. And if we want a lot of blood, we should repeat often;
And if the blood is thick, strike deep, and the consequence is that the heart might be pierced suddenly, and it is necessary for those with thick, hard skin, and narrow pores, that you anoint the places of the cupping glasses with an aperitif and dissolving oil: whether it is of violet oil, or of sweet almond oil, or of pumpkin seed oil;
and if it is in winter, of cress oil, or of lily oil, or of chamomile oil, or other similar ones.
And if the superfluities are thick and cold, take amarantin oil, or balsam oil, or anise oil, and similar ones.
And if the one who is being treated has tender skin and large pores, one should not put any oil on it, but it should be washed after the cupping with rose water, or cold water, or morel water, or pumpkin water, or porcelain water, or other similar things.
And those who have much moisture, should be bathed with basil, or myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have thick superfluities should be bathed in old wine, or sage water, or a decoction of anise or chamomile, or other similar things;
and one should not bleed with a cupping before the bath or in the bath, but after the bath one or two hours.
and do not sleep after the cupping, and it is necessary that he cleanse himself, when he is to be cupped and when he has been cupped.
And beware if the one being bled is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; If so, he should take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces, and similar things; and eat little, and the flesh of a hare, and moist foods.
and eat little, and the flesh of a hare, and moist foods. And he who has a cold complexion, should take syrup of honey, and odoriferous wine of medium age, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat little, and small birds and pigeons;
and the day he is going to be bled, he should drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give some men sometimes treacle or nutmeg before or after the bleeding, to strengthen the main limbs; and the blood should be thinned, but those who are hot should not drink it.
The cupping that is applied without striking are those applied to the liver, and the spleen, and gout, and to the belly and the groin and kidneys and hip, because those limbs do not tolerate striking on them, and it is not done otherwise than to attract blood from limb to limb, as we apply to the breasts when the nipple is bleeding;
to remove the viscosity that is in the limb, as we apply cupping to the belly and groin to reduce the limb;
and it removes the pain, when there is obstruction or stone, so it removes by its attractive virtue perhaps the obstruction, or dislodges the stone from its place;
and thus does it when applied to the liver and the spleen when there is retained wind, and these cupping glasses are administered empty only to suck; and sometimes they are administered with fire, and sometimes filled with warm water, as in diseases of the pleurisy, and in this way one fills the cupping glass with hot water alone, or water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
The form of the cupping glass administered with fire is thus:
And have two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and have in the side around the middle one small hole, as to put a needle, and be of bronze, soft in front so that it does not wound the patient when placing it on the limb;
and have in the middle a crossbar of bronze or iron, to put a lighted candle in, and in them be great and small according to the diseases and the age of those who take them;
for the cupping glasses of children are different from those of the old, and of the lean than of the fat.
And one must thus place this cupping glass on the limb:
light the wax candle or the lining, and put it in the middle of the cupping glass through the rod that is in the middle of the cupping glass, so that the light is at the bottom of the cupping glass so that it does not burn the patient;
and then put it on the limb, and your fingers be on the opening that we have mentioned, so that when one wants, the vapor will go out, and one removes the cupping glass;
and one takes the lining as before, and repeats it often, if you need to.
In the cupping glass therefore, which is used in the treatment of pleurisy, acute, there is no rod nor opening, and is only applied when it is full of water, and is placed on the limb only.
and this is the form:
Leeches are only applied to limbs where cupping cannot be used because of their smallness, such as lips and gums, and similar places; and in places bare of flesh, such as the groin or nose, and others similar;
and the quality of their use is that when you find leeches that are in clear, sweet water without injury, then take them;
and place them in clean, fresh water, until they are satiated and have nothing in their bellies; and then be bled from a vein and cupped, then rub the limb until it is red, and put the leeches on;
and when they are full and fall off, if it is a place where one can apply a cupping glass, then apply it, for this is very helpful.
If not, then wash the area with water, thoroughly, and then dry it;
and if the place heals too slowly after the leeches, then wet a linen cloth in cool water and apply it, until the wound is healed;
and if the wound is festering, then apply crushed vitriol, or gall, and similar things, until it is healed;
or you put half-peeled beans on the area, and leave them until they become hot on the area, and it will now heal;
and if you need more, then take more leeches.
And if the leeches will not take hold, then rub the area with fresh blood, or insert a needle so that blood comes out, and then apply the leeches; and as soon as they sense the blood, they will attach;
And when you want them to drop off, then sprinkle a bit of ground aloes and salt, or ashes, and they will fall off now.
Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and is for the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that foolish men reject this chapter, because they have never seen any of the ancient books, nor have they read any letters in them.
And for this reason, knowledge is estranged in our land, for I have never found any good in it.
And I know nothing, except through the knowledge of ancient books, in which I have studied so much that I have mastered the science, and through experimentation and by the habit of my life;
And I have described in this chapter what is contained within it, and have summarized it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are used, just as I did in these two preceding chapters.
Therefore, it is necessary that we say in the prologue of this book the summaries of the words and the chapters where the wise man places his understanding, and dwells upon the truth, so that those who are experienced may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a fracture or dislocation or twisting or crushing occurs to someone, you must quickly bleed the patient on both sides, if anything does not allow you to do so entirely, such as weakness of the body, or children, or old people; or if the time is not very hot, or too cold;
and eat cold meats, that is to say, cold game, and the flesh of birds and young deer, and drink no wine, and do not eat any fatty meats, and do not fill yourself too much with foods that fill the veins with blood, so that you do not fear a hot abscess, or the spreading of matter in the limb;
so that the patient returns to his former manner of living.
And when the broken bone begins to recover, it is necessary that the patient be nourished with foods that promote growth, or that have viscosity, such as boiled wheat in water, and rice, and porridge, and calves' feet, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment the fracture heals more quickly.
And know that broken bones of the old and decrepit cannot heal or knit properly according to their nature because of the dryness of the limbs, nor those that are too tender, such as the bones of young children;
but there is no cure, restore the broken bone with thick ligaments that bind and join the limb together, so that it is as strong as it was before; and do not completely stop the work, and therefore it is necessary to nourish him with hearty foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For a fracture of the head is different from a fracture of the arm, or of the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures. For there are fractures that go across, and others in a slanted fashion, like the cut of a writing quill.
For there are fractures that go across, and others in a slanted fashion, like the cut of a writing quill. And there are fractures with a wound, and fractures with only a small crack.
And each type has its own device, and its own proper instrument in restoration, according to what the memory brings to its place;
and the fracture of the bone is recognized by the fact that the place is twisted, and it shows clearly by deflection, and sounds when pressed by the hand;
and when there is no twisting or sound on touching, and the patient does not feel great pain, there is no fracture.
but there may well be twisting, or a crack, or a small fracture. Therefore, you should not move it by hand, but apply the medicines that come later, and then gently restrain it.
And know that a fracture that goes outwards, and the two parts are separated, they must be put back in line equally, lest a hot abscess come.
And if a hot abscess comes, leave it for a day or so, until the abscess is calmed.
Then align it gently and wisely as you can, and know that the restoration of one is easier than the restoration of that where there are pieces.
Then restrain it, as is appropriate later.
And if in the bone there are broken pieces, stretch it from two sides, if it is a hand or a foot, or with your hand if it is a small limb, or with two strings, or with one string and your hand;
and place the limb according to its natural form, so that when the broken parts of the limb are separated, you reunite all the additions in their places as best you can, and be careful that your work does not cause the patient injury or pain;
and carefully join the two ends of the bones according to the best forms.
And feel it well with your hand if it seems to you that it is not quite right:
if you straighten it beautifully, and do not bind it too tightly, nor press it as those do who, through their work, cause a hot abscess and contraction in the limb, as we have often seen.
And when the limb is in place, instruct the patient well so that he does not move it, neither when awake nor when asleep, nor turning over, nor in any other way; and carefully watch that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels no pain, it is not quite in place, and it must be put in such a state that it feels no pain;
and carefully watch that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels no pain, it is not quite in place, and it must be put in such a state that it feels no pain; and watch that it is placed straight, so that no twisting comes when it is restored;
and the quality of the fractured limb is according to what I have told you.
Know that fractured limbs are diverse in size and shape.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and similar ones: so it is necessary to wrap with soft and subtle linen cloths; and those that are large, such as thighs and legs:
so it is necessary to wrap with a wide and hard bandage, for the wide bandages embrace the entire large limb and constrain it equally on all sides, so that there is no injury;
then bind around light padding, three or four turns according to the limb, and tighten your hand a little on the entire bandage, then go above the fracture and tighten less, so that the fracture is then slightly separated;
and soften the bandage little by little, until you take a large portion of the healthy area, then take another bandage and turn around again over the fractured area;
then return to the part below the fracture, and tighten moderately, neither too tight nor too loose, as we have said in the first bandage above;
then place linen or cloth padding between the bandages, until it is all even, then bind everything over the bandage, and then place your supports well made on top, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or an abscess, place a soothing, hot abscess-reducing thing on top, and leave it thus for a few days;
then tighten the supports, and they should be half the width of a well-cut cane, or of wood from which planks are made, or of palm fronds, and should be according to this figure:
but it is necessary that the support placed over the fracture be a little larger and wider than the others;
and be also as long as is appropriate to the limb's size or largeness; then tighten the supports as you did for the first bandage, then tie a bandage over them, just as in the first bandage over the fracture; tighter on top, gradually less so;
and the bandages should be of medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin, and made of soft linen;
for if the bandages are thick, like the foolish works of those who bandage with twisted linen cords, and this is a great error, because the bandage cannot be even if it is too thin, and it is not appropriate that there is less than a finger's width between each support.
And if the patient is injured by the edges of the supports after tightening in healthy places, put linen or wool wadding under them so that he is not wounded.
When the wound is with a fracture, and the bone is broken, I will describe the treatment later.
And know that it is not appropriate to bind all fractured limbs on the first day. For when the limb is large, you should not put bandages on it too tightly until after five or seven days, or longer, depending on the danger of a hot swelling occurring.
And here is the manner of ancient plasters for restoring fractures, dislocations, and twisting injuries:
and take flour that is held by the mill walls, and mix it with plenty of eggs, and apply this mixture, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it, and this is the common way of plaster for restoring a broken bone in many situations, especially for women and young children, since it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another manner of plaster for restoring fractures, dislocations, and twisting injuries: take three parts of abareis, ladani, enule, and asafetida, and gum arabic and mugat, each a tenth part. myrrh and aloes, each five tenths. alechil nine tenths. and make it into powder, and mix it with the white of an egg. if the man's complexion is hot, then use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and quickly restores broken bones, and is valuable to many men.
Another type of plaster that is good for twisting. take mugwort and viper's-bugloss, each ten ounces. myrrh and aloes, each nine ounces. gum acacia six ounces. Armenian bole ten ounces, and grind well, and cook with vinegar or abundance of egg, and administer.
Another method of plaster for joints and for bones separated from their places, and alleviates the pain that arises, and the bone's wear and tear, and the fracture: Take new wool, and soak it in oil and cooked oil, and put it on the place.
These plasters do not restore, but they are good for soothing a hot abscess, and properly remove the pains.
Another method of plaster that restores broken bones: Take dried fig leaves and leaves of the earth-wort, and grind them together, and make a plaster.
Another type of plaster for the restoration of a broken bone and for lessening the remaining abscess. Take root of marshmallow, chamomile, violet flowers, and chickpea flour, each one part;
and grind, and bind with wine, and if the limb is inflamed, bind it with moist coriander water or water, and apply it.
Another type of plaster, stronger than the first, when a hard abscess comes to the restoration of the limb. Take roots of marshmallow, flaxseed, baluster, melilot, and comfrey, and violet and chamomile flowers, of each a part; and grind, and bind with salt water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb and its rest.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not put on a broken limb to restore strength except a cerote made of wax and oil, and nothing else, and says that it should be neither too soft nor too hard.
And Galen seems to say that one should put on the broken limb, for restoration, slightly warm dry things, such as myrrh and aloes and frankincense and similar things, as we have said.
Another type of plaster that is good for injury and pain: Take mugwort and chopped human hair, or bird feathers, and marsh-mallow, and similarly, and grind them, and make a plaster and bind it.
And then unbind it a little later, and watch that the patient feels no pain, and that the bone hasn't moved from its place; if not, unbind it not for many days. And if pain comes to the place, or itching, lack of rest or swelling, then hurry, and unbind it, and remove the plaster now;
and take a light cloth, and a damp sea sponge, and dip it in water, and apply it to the place, until the itching ceases, and the pain is calmed; then leave the limb to rest for an hour, then put on dry wool, soaked in water or rose oil, and bind it up for a night, until you are certain of a hot abscess;
and ease the inflammation of the limb, and let the pain be removed, then resume the gentle binding, and a little plaster, and do not bind it as tightly as before; and gently heal until it is healthy.
And if you see that a hot abscess, redness, pain, and swelling have all been removed, and you need plaster and bandages, then start again, just as you did at first.
And if nothing of what we have said comes to the limb, do not unbind it until after three or four or five or seven days. and sometimes leave it for twenty days, according to what one sees, until the fracture heals and the flesh comes together again;
then restrain it more than before, and increase its nourishment, as I said before;
and if you see the place drying more than is necessary, know that nourishment cannot come there; apply then warm water frequently, every third day, and loosen the bandage a little.
By this method, nourishment will quickly reach the limb, and quickly correct what foolish surgeons do, who treat the twisted limb incorrectly.
That is bad practice, and such work is dangerous, and I see nothing else but to leave it alone and treat it properly.
Many types of fractures exist, and diverse are their forms, and their causes are distinct;
For there are fractures caused by sword blows, and the blow breaks all the bone down to the underlying surface, as a hache or a staff does; And for this reason, this type of fracture is called "hacheure".
Or if the sword cuts the bone from above, piercing it, this type of fracture is called "absolute";
And the wounds from these two fractures are large or small.
And if there is a penetrating blow, or a fissure or a blow from a stone, or from falling on a stone, or other similar things.
And if there is a piercing fracture, which approaches the membrane beneath the bone, or it is on the bone, and this wound is either large or small.
And if there is a wound that is embedded in the bone as thin as a hair, and the fissure is small, and for this reason, this fracture is called "capillary";
and if the wound is made either by hitting with a stone, or by falling, or by similar things, and causes a piece of bone to sink, and the place is fractured just as blacksmiths fracture pots when they strike them. if between the stones within.
And this happens more to those who have moist bones, such as a child's head;
and in all these kinds of fractures, small pieces are separated, just like splinters; and I will speak on its place.
And we recognize all kinds of fractures by pulling on them, and by examination with probes, and by the corrupt flesh that is on them.
The similar capillary is known by this: when the bone is uncovered, and one rubs on it, the fracture is shown to be black.
In the treatment of the fracture, pay attention to the patient's symptoms, and if you see any bad symptoms, such as vomiting of bile, loss of consciousness, swelling, pain, acute fever, and the eyes bulging and turning red, and other similar symptoms in various conditions, it cannot be healed without a doubt.
And if you do not see frightening symptoms, and you hope for recovery, then begin the treatment.
And when the wounded person comes to you first, and it is in winter, you must remove the bone before the fourteenth day, if you can.
And if it is in summer, hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the tissue under the bone is corrupted, and the symptoms we have mentioned appear.
And if the fracture of the bone reaches the tissue covering the brain, you must split the fractured part like this:
and you should take the head of the wounded patient, and expose the bone in every way you can, and over the wound's shape as gently as possible, and if an outflow of blood occurs when uncovering the bone, or a hot abscess, help with what is needed, and you should fill the space with cloths soaked in rose oil; and keep the wound at rest until the hot abscess is calmed, and be sure of the flow of blood; then begin to remove the bone, and this is done according to two methods of work:
one method is that you cut a narrow incision in front, and this is the form:
And then a second incision, larger than the first, is made.
And the second method is that you have many different incisions, some narrow and others wide, and they are pointed, and are made with an iron instrument;
and work lightly, so that you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is strong and hard, you must pierce around it first, before you administer incisions with drills, not so deep that they pierce the bone of the skull, and there should be a margin or ring over the point, so that it does not pass beyond the bone;
and you need several, so that each one fits into its space in the thickness of the bone, so that you have drills for all bones;
and this is the form of the three kinds of drills:
The quality for piercing around a fractured bone is that you place a drill on the bone, and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced;
then reposition the drill slightly afterward, and do this all around, then cut with the chisels the space of the bone that is between the holes, and do this more subtly than you can, and lightly, as we have said, until you pull the bone out with your hand, or with any of the instruments you have, like pliers, tweezers;
and be careful not to touch the brain or the surface.
And when you have pierced and extracted the bone, it is necessary to remove the remaining bone fragments with any other instrument similar to a chisel, but it must be thinner and more subtle than the other chisel;
and if any small bones or scales remain, remove them gently with one of the instruments; then treat the wound with poultices and ointments as we have said.
And another method of work is that which Galen describes, which is safer; and it is very strong, and that is his word. It is necessary first that you uncover a portion of the bone, where the fracture is apparent, so that once you have uncovered that part, you will place under the head of this incisor, a lens-shaped object, of which this is the form:
And do not cut it from one side only, and the part is sharp on two sides, so that the cutting edge is towards the bone;
then strike gently with a small mallet on top, so that you cut the bone slightly all around, and be careful of the cloth that is underneath;
if it adheres to the bone, then loosen it gently, for it is removed well without harm, and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not pierce through the cloth, and the bone is only cut on top, and there are small pieces, then it is necessary to remove that roughness, and to remove the scales with a fine scraper, of which you should have various sizes, in order to apply the most suitable one to each place, according to the work and the shape of the fracture.
Use larger scrapers first, then finer ones afterward, and do not cease this until it is well done.
In each of the other cuts and subtle fractures, you must apply the cause according to its alignment;
and this is something that is not readily understood by those who have devoted study to this art.
And if the surface is exposed, then you must take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and soak it in rose oil, and place it over the wound; then take another cloth, doubled in two or three, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do this as gently as possible, so you do not press on the surface, then apply another bandage over it, and do not bind it too tightly, just enough to hold the wound;
and leave it like this for one or two days, until the hot abscess has subsided, then remove it, and apply medicines such as lily roots, and vetch flour, and incense powder, and aristolochia, and similar things;
and of these things make powder, and put on the wound, and apply medicines continuously without causing pain;
and watch that the wound is always clean, that you do not leave ointment on it, nor allow any pus to accumulate, for when pus gathers on the membrane of the brain, it will rot and cause great harm to the patient;
for when you put a biting substance on the surface, it will sting from above. Therefore, beware, if any bad accident comes to the patient, as we have said, it is undoubtedly dangerous.
And if the blackness arises only from the medicine placed upon it, that such a virtue exists, then you must take one part of honey, and three parts of rose oil, and mix them into a paste, and put it upon the surface; then treat it by the appropriate methods of treatment, until it is healed.
Know that sometimes both parts of the nose are broken above, or just one, for there are two bones.
and the one below is cartilaginous, and does not break, only bending or twisting, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, you must place your index finger in the nostril opening, and place the broken piece of the nose against your index finger, and the thumb on the opposite side, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and watch that the patient does not feel pain from your work.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach the place, you must place it aligned with the top of a small stick or thin rod.
And if the fracture is of two parts, do likewise again, and hasten to restore it on the first day if you can;
if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the hot abscess has subsided, then apply strips of linen cloth to the top of the nose if the fracture is in one part.
Or you put one on the other side if the fracture is there; and let the strips be so thick that they fill the openings of the nose.
And some healers say that one should soak the strips in butter and change them every day. It does not seem to me that this is good, but they should be soaked in a mixture of egg white and mill powder; then leave the strip until the bone is strong and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes goose feathers are placed in the nose in place of strips, and a soft cloth is wrapped around them, and the fracture is held, and the patient breathes through it; or do whatever you want.
And if boils appear in the nose while you are working on it, apply a plaster or cotton soaked in rose oil, or a little bit of diachylon.
And if no boils appear, apply a plaster from dried chickpea flour and incense powder, mixed with a little egg white, then place light bandages on it, and do not bind the nose.
and if the nose fracture is small, and it is broken into small pieces, remove it with appropriate instruments, then close the fracture, and treat with healing things containing animal fat, and soldering, like plasters and ointments suitable for it;
and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with bandages, and place lead strips on it until it is healed.
When the jaw is fractured from below, and there is no open wound, and the fracture is only on the surface, and it is not broken in two, except for bumps inside, it is easily recognized.
It is necessary, if the fracture is on the right side, that you place your index finger in the patient's mouth; and if the fracture is in the left jaw, place your right index finger, and gently push the fracture inwards, and align it with the other hand on the outside, and make it even.
And if the jaw fracture is separated into two, it is necessary that you apply traction to both sides, until they are equal.
And if there is movement of the teeth, or breakage, bind them with a gold, silver, or silk thread, then place a bandage over the fractured jaw, and put on a double cloth; and place a large, well-made plaster, or a piece of equal leather, long and wide according to the jaw, and bind it tightly as you can, and instruct the patient to rest, and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape changes, unbind it on the third day, and then restore to its proper state what has been altered. and place a poultice on top, of mill powder mixed with abundant egg or chickpea flour, after you have removed the bandage.
and place light wool over the poultice, and if the poultice dries and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until he is healed. Many times he is healed in three weeks.
And if a hot abscess arises, administer what we have said many times.
And if there is a break and a wound together, see if any piece of the bone has been removed; if subtly by means of suitable instruments.
And if the wound is narrow, widen it with fire according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remains, stitch the wound if it is wide, and put suitable plasters over it to generate flesh, until it is healed.
The forceps break many times in front, towards the shoulder, and the breakage is in three ways:
where it is broken and separated into two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore;
where there is a break with a wound.
And the work is like this when the breakage is without a wound, that you have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder that feels the broken forceps; and the other extends the neck towards the part;
then place the break with your fingers, so that the shape is as it should be, and there is neither appearance nor completion.
And if you need to extend further, place a round sphere of cloth, or wool, under the patient's shoulder, and make it as large as you need. and extend and lift the forceps, and hold the sphere in your hand, so that you place the break evenly, as is proper.
And if you cannot pull the head of the forceps outward, because it is deep inside, it is necessary that the patient lie often on his back, and put a medium pillow under the shoulder, and the attendant push the shoulder down, until the bone of the forceps is lifted.
And then straighten the break with your fingers, and if you find it broken, you must split it open.
and pull the pieces gently, and if the bone cannot join despite any effort, then cut it with one of the incisors you have. but that you place this instrument under the forceps, to protect the surface.
and it resembles a spoon, and is not sharp, and should be as wide as necessary, according to the size of the bone and the power of the work;
and it has two ends, as you see, and one is wide and the other narrow, as is the gap of the wound you made when you pulled the bones apart;
and when you are sure of a hot abscess, then cauterize the wound; and if the gap is small, or you doubt a hot abscess, then fill the wound with strips and tents, according to its size.
And if a hot abscess comes, soak the strips in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and place them over it.
The splinting of the bone, when it is without wounds and without cuts, is that you place on the bone a plaster of mill powder and egg white, and place light bandages over it, and put a sphere under the splint, if you need it; Then take a very wide bandage, one palm wide, then put a double strip over the bandages and the plaster; Then take a thin splint, three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around that bandage, so that the end of the bandage hangs down; and place the splint over the fracture, and turn the bandage over the collar, and under the healthy armpit, and under the diseased armpit; and reposition it from each part, and when you see that the bandage holds the fracture in place, and you clearly see that the splint does not move from the broken bone, then watch it every day, and when the bandage loosens, then tighten it;
and have the patient lie on their back, and place a small pillow under the armpit when they sleep, to raise the shoulder; so it will ease the fracture from the force by raising the shoulder, or you tie the arm to the neck, and do not untie it until twenty days if no bad accidents come about;
then reapply the plaster, if you see that it needs it, and tighten and leave it thus until it is restored;
and it is restored in at most twenty-eight days, and in fewer days for some people.
of the fracture of the shoulder
Sometimes the shoulder breaks in a wide place or in the middle, and one only knows it is broken by touching it.
if you adjust it according to the shape of the break, and return it to its natural shape, in all the ways you can.
then put on the spot flour from the mill with abundant egg, and light bandages, and put a double cloth over it. then put over a wide and thin splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if under the splint there is hair in any part of the shoulder, fill that hair with linen bandages, so that the splint is even.
and then bind it with a large, firm bandage, so that the splint does not move from its place, and check the binding every day.
and every time it softens, bind it, and make the splint even if it is off its place, and let the patient lie on his side.
and the shoulder is restored in 20 or 25 days.
And when this number is completed, then unbind it, and be sure, for it is not bone which easily puts itself out of place.
And if a piece of bone is thrust forward, and slightly under the skin, then cut open, and remove it, and do what we said in the treatment of a broken arm to appease a hot abscess.
of the fracture of the arm
The bone is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens little. but it often breaks on the outside.
And when it is broken in the middle, it bends downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and lack of breath, and sickness, and perhaps vomits blood, and the brain appears in the broken bone, and one senses it well.
And the restoration is that the patient lies often on his back, and one puts a cushion between the shoulders, then presses the shoulders, and brings together the ribs of the two sides with your hands, and carefully tries to put it equal in all the ways that you can, until the shape of the bone is as it should be;
then put plasters and wadding on top of a thin layer of salt or other light wood, and wrap it in a cloth, and bind it over the broken bone so that it does not move; and turn the bandage around the back, and tighten it properly, and check the bandage every hour, and if it loosens, tighten it;
and if it needs loosening, because of corrosion or itching that comes to the place, or pain or abscess, then hurry, and loosen it, and remove the plaster, and treat whatever has come there with the appropriate remedies;
then replace the plaster, and tighten it until it is healed.
of the breaking of the ribs
Know that the breaking of the ribs usually occurs only in thick places near the back, and in the chest, and only breaks because they are brittle; and one feels it well by examining the sides.
And the restoration is to put the broken parts in alignment as is necessary. And then put on the plaster, and bind it tightly with a bandage, if you need it.
And if the broken ribs are leaning inwards, the patient feels great pain and stabbing, like from a thorn, because the bone pierces the tissue; and gasps for breath, and coughs and vomits a great amount of blood, and it is a serious illness, and the ancients have expended great effort on it.
And some say that it is necessary to administer foods that bloat the belly, in order to push the fracture outwards.
We do not do this, lest a hot abscess should come about, if it has not already. And if one has come about, treat it.
And some of you say that cupping is applied to the area, to draw out strongly, and that seems reasonable. However, there is doubt that cupping will not draw the superfluities to the area due to the disposition of weakness.
And some of you say that the area should be covered with wool soaked in warm oil, and tents are placed between the ribs to evenly stretch the skin around, then treated with the treatment for pleurisy, food, and medicine.
And if the patient feels great pain that he cannot bear because the bone pierces the flesh, and the patient is in doubt, then it is necessary to cut open the area of the broken rib, and it is necessary to place instruments underneath to protect the surface.
and then one must cut the bone, and draw it slightly, and then stitch the two edges of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess comes, put damp cloths in rose-colored oil, and place it on the area.
and treat the area as is appropriate for an abscess, and let the patient lie often on the side where it is, until it is healed.
and also to the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if they will be healed or not, then watch carefully if you see their hands softened and swollen and dead, and they cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, they do not feel it.
Know that it is mortal in many conditions, and if they move and feel well when they are squeezed and pricked, know that the joint of the bone is safe, and that the patient will be cured, if a cure is applied.
And if similar things happen to the spine of the back, and you want to know if they will be healed or not, then watch if the feet are softened, and if the accidents are there as in the hands, and on the back there is belching and expulsion without volition;
and when one has turned them on their stomach, there is expulsion without volition. And when they are turned on their back and they want to sit up, they cannot. Know that it is mortal: then do not labor in their cure.
And if these accidents do not come upon them, then the matter is less severe.
And the cure is that if there is a hot abscess, you apply rose oil or egg oil to it until it is calmed;
then apply a comforting and drying plaster, and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and do not sleep on that part where he feels the pain, until he is healed.
And if any bone is separated, it is necessary to cut over the heart; and remove the bone, then bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with a stitch, then treat it with a strengthening ointment, until it is healed;
and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "head of the knuckle," then place your left hand's fingertip on it, and position it as best as you can against your other hand, then apply the plaster and bandage, if you need it;
then hold it tight, and if there are any separated bones, cut through them, and remove them, and treat the wound until it is healed.
of the fracture of the hip bone
Sometimes it happens that the hip bone is broken, and if it happens, there is not much but a slight weakening at the head; and it splits lengthwise, and bends inward, and causes the patient pain at the site, and a sharp piercing sensation, and swells where it is broken.
And the restoration is that you extend your hand above, so that you are over the fracture; and know what the fracture is and its form;
and if the fracture is only at the head, then set that fracture equal, so that it is in a natural shape.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it bends inward, then have the patient lie on their stomach, so that the restoration of that fracture may be prepared for you. And when you have set it equal, then put on the plaster, then put on a splint of wood or of leather, and bind the fracture so that it does not move;
and fill the space beneath the ribs, so that the limb is even. And instruct the patient to sleep on their healthy side, or on their back.
And if a hot abscess arises, do not touch it until the hot abscess is calmed, and apply what we have previously stated; and then return to the restoration, and bind it as is appropriate, if there is no bad complication;
of the breaking of the shoulder
The shoulder is that which is between the rib and the head of the shoulder, and if it is broken, it should be restored according to one of the two methods:
one of which is that you take a piece of plain wood of medium thickness, according to this form:
And tie two pieces of wood to the two heads, and lift them up, and let the patient sit on a chair;
then place his broken arm on the wood, so that it reaches the armpit, and place a curved piece of wood in the middle, then lift it with some heavy object or let the attendant stretch it downwards;
then let the attendant place the fracture even with his hands together, so that the fracture returns as it should.
And another method is that one supports the patient on his back, and ties the hand to his neck, then instructs two attendants to one hold that which is above the fracture with their hands, and the other hold underneath with the entire length, and each should stretch to their side.
And if you want the extraction to be stronger, then tighten one band underneath the fracture, and above the fracture, and let each of the attendants stretch to their side.
And if the fracture is near the shoulder head, then it is necessary that you place one band underneath the armpit, and another towards the rib, underneath the fracture;
and also if the fracture is towards the rib, then it is necessary to put one band lightly, without effort, so that the fracture is even on the spot, and on the rib;
then set the fracture even, as is proper, and bind it, if no suppurating sores appear.
And if suppurating sores appear, then do not bind it for seven days, and place soaked wool in oil and rose oil, until the suppurating sores are calmed;
then bind it, and the manner of binding it is that you place the plaster on the fracture, then assemble the arm on the shoulder, and place your hand on the shoulder or on the breast;
and place the cloth, and bind on the shoulder, and on the arm, so that the arm is in the position of the stars, if nothing prevents it, or if the bone is not displaced.
And if you doubt that the bone will move, then use splints, and place on the fracture a splint wider and stronger than the others, and have one finger's width between each splint, and each splint should be so large that it extends three fingers' width beyond the fracture on each side;
then bind over the splints, as I have said at the beginning of the chapter on the fracture, more strongly and less loosely.
And if you see the placement of the splints and the binding, as we have said, at the time you are restoring the broken limb, and you suspect a hot abscess, then leave it unbound until the seventh day, as we have said;
then check the bandage every three days, to see that no itching or swelling comes to the area, or that the nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight. If it is aligned, as we have said.
And if no such accident occurs, then do not loosen it until after three days or more, and let the patient sleep on their back, with their hands on their stomach;
and place a cushion full of wool under the shoulder, and check each hour of the day or night that the shape of the broken limb does not move, or that the bandages are not softened;
if it is aligned by the power of medicine, and give him the food that we have previously mentioned, in such a way that the food is at first subtle; and when he begins to recover, let it be thick.
And it is customary that the shoulder and the leg should be recovered within forty days in total; and then it should be unbound and administered baths and medicated ointments to align the area.
And if the constriction is severe and swollen, it remains unbound for ten days or two months.
of the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "forearm bones," of which one is smaller, and is the one that joins the wrist.
and the other is large, and is the one beneath, next to the small finger;
perhaps the large forearm bone is broken alone, or the small one, and perhaps both together.
When the small forearm bone is broken, the repair is easy, and the healing.
and when the large one is broken, the healing is bad, and more difficult than when they are both broken together.
If it is the small forearm bone that is broken alone, it must be slightly stretched and put straight.
And if it is the large forearm bone, it must be tightened more strongly;
and stretch it on a cushion, and hold the thumb higher than the other fingers, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and let the patient lie crossed over himself, and the cushion in front of him higher, so the patient does not suffer any hardship;
Then the assistants should stretch his arm to the part below his hand, or to the elbow, and another assistant to the other above.
And then the physician should put it straight, according to its best form.
And if in the fracture it is broken into pieces, then place each in its place, and if there is any detached piece that pricks the heart, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut through it and remove it, as we have said before.
And if with the fracture there is a wound, I have spoken of it in a separate chapter. So take the treatment.
And if in the beginning of the restoration, hot abscesses arise, then apply a poultice of a plaster made of rose oil and white wax, which should not be either too hard or too soft; and bind the poultice gently, until the hot abscesses subside.
And then remove the plaster, and put on a plaster of powdered mill-stone with abundance of egg, then place the splints, and the splint for the fracture should be stronger, and a little wider than the others;
and know that there should be six splints, or more, in various positions: whether the fracture is in one bone, or two;
and bind more tightly over the fracture than elsewhere, and gradually less as you move away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter; and the bandages over the fracture should be soft and moist, and not hard or harsh;
and the bandages over the fracture should be soft and moist, and not hard or harsh; and the thread with which it is bound should be linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And check the limb and the bandage after a few days. And if any bad accident comes to the limb, such as itching that comes to the limb, then you should wash the limb with hot water until the itching is calmed;
and leave the limb not tightly bound.
And then recommence the binding, and if the bandage is softened and the bone separated, or similar things, then straighten it.
And be careful if nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight, then you must loosen it a little, and leave it like that for a few days until the nourishment flows, and then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have said happens to the patient, then do not loosen it for up to twenty days.
or, if he is in that situation, then hang his hands on his neck, and let his shoulders be even, and guard against movement and touching, and sleep on his back;
and know that this fracture is restored in 30 or 35 days, and perhaps in 20 days, according to the compositions and complexions of the virtues.
of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and the bases of the fingers, there are few fractures, and there is often only bending.
And when the palm of the hand is broken or bent, the patient should sit cross-legged, and sit straight ahead of him equally;
then place his hand on a flat surface, and the minister should extend the broken bones and align them properly, until they are well joined;
and apply the plaster and bandages, if no abscess forms, then place a splint according to the size of the area; and be wrapped in a linen bandage.
And if the fracture is inside the area around the sole of the foot, make a ball of cloth, and instruct the patient to press it against the fractured foot; and then tie it with a long bandage, and the splint should be of soft leather, as large as the palm of the hand, and bind it as necessary.
And if the fracture is on the outside, you must place a splint on top, and another one underneath on the sole, so that the hand is open and straight, then bandage the whole hand, and secure the bandage between the fingers.
And if the fracture is in any of the bones of the fingers, if it is the knuckle, align it as needed; and bind it with the palm, and if you wish, place a small straight splint to raise the fracture, and do not move it;
and if the fracture is in other fingers, such as the index or one of the others, align it, and bind it with the healthy finger next to it; or you bind them all together in a straight line, however it may be, or you place a splint on it, as you would on the knuckle;
and take care in the restoration and disposition of hot abscesses, and help those who come to it, as I have said.
The bone of the thigh is often broken, and this is clearly seen when it turns forward and backward;
and the restoration is done by binding one bandage above the fracture, and another below. And the patient lies on their face, then each attendant extends their bandage equally to their side;
and this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
And if the fracture is close to the root of the thigh, one bandage should be towards the groin, and the other below the fracture.
And also if it is close to the knee, then the bandage should be next to the knee, and the extension should be downwards;
then the surgeon should align the bone using both hands, so that it is according to its natural shape, and then apply the plaster, and bandage it, if an abscess does not appear.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it calm down, then return to your work and your treatment; The cure is done in such a manner.
You should wrap over the fracture one hard bandage doubled in two or three, and the excess remains, then turn the leg so that the heel comes to the root of the thigh, and place a long thread between the thigh and the leg, below the knee, and the thread's ends come from above;
then turn the bandage over the leg and the thigh, then place splints over the fracture, and place a splint over the leg bone;
then fill the empty space between the leg and the thigh with soft cloths to make the tightening equal, then begin to tightly bind three or four turns over the fracture; and the higher you go on the fracture, the less you tighten it;
then tie the two ends of the thread you placed between the leg and the thigh, and tie three splints that are on top, then go back to the bottom of the thread's end, until you reach the foot;
and tighten it so that it does not move from its place, then leave it like that, until there comes neither abscess nor swelling nor any other such thing. And if it happens, untie it and correct what comes, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of the bone that prick, it must be removed, if one can; and if one cannot, one must split the place, and draw out force; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken so that splints are placed in it, as in the shoulder and in the arm;
However, in such a restoration, the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in 10 days, or a little less or a little more, according to the diversities of complexions.
Know that in the joint of the knee there is little breaking, but it bends many times.
And if it breaks, it is never a fissure, or a hole, and it happens to all wounds, and without wounds, and this is well understood.
And the restoration is done by putting the broken parts together as much as possible, until they are assembled.
Then apply a plaster, and put a round bandage on it, if you need it, and bind it as necessary, then observe all the treatments that we have described for other fractures, such as a hot abscess and similar conditions; Apply to each injury what is appropriate until it is healed.
of the fracture of the leg
Know that the leg has two bones, one of which is rightly called "tibia", and the other is called "fibula";
and every fracture happens as it does to the arm, and for this reason the restoration is similar to that of the arm, and the treatment is the same. And if the two bones are broken together, the leg turns in all directions.
And if the small bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the large bone is broken, one feels great pain, and one sees it clearly. and it turns underneath.
Then administer extension, and put it straight, and bind the splints evenly.
However, if the fracture is severe, and there are multiple pieces, the extension should be gentler and lighter. and adjust according to your skill.
And when you have completed all your work, take two lengths of wooden splints that support the leg on either side, and are the length of the leg from the knee down.
Then wrap the leg with two bandages above and below, and bind it in the middle as well.  With this binding, the leg will not deviate to the right or left, and thus it is well done.
And some use a splint the length of the leg, made of wood, and place the leg on it to prevent movement.  This is properly done in cases of fracture or where there is a wound.
And move the leg each day to see if there is a hot abscess or other mishap. If cure it until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the bones of the foot.
At the ankle there is no fracture, but sometimes there is a fracture in the bones of the foot and toes, and there is only a crack in many positions.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overlapping, then place the patient's foot on the ground, as if they were about to walk, and then place your foot on theirs, where the bones are raised, and press it until they return to their places.
Then apply the plaster and bandages, and place a small board two spans wide under the sole of the foot, then bind it to the foot firmly, having wrapped it in cloths and other things you need.
And when three or four days have passed, unbind the bandage, for you will find the bones aligned, whether fractured or dislocated.
And if any of the toes are fractured, reset them, as we have described for the toes of the hand. Then place a splint along the length of the fractured toe, and slightly wider, then place the board I mentioned under the foot, and bind it firmly.
And if there are two or three, or more, fractured toes, then place a splint on each toe according to its size, wrapped in one linen cloth, and bind the board under the foot. And let it rest on the top of the board to protect the sole of the foot, so that it holds it securely.
And you must not forget the other things I have said about other fractures, which we have already discussed. And treat each injury as it should be treated.
of the fracture of the bone of the finger.
When a woman's bone is fractured, make her sit in a reclined position, then lean her back, and hold her from behind.
Then the attendant should fill the patient's natural cavity with cotton, and put in as much as will fit.
Then raise the woman, and raise her back gradually, and then the cotton will move, until it comes to the opening of the natural cavity, and the bone returns with the cotton.
And when she wishes to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, replace it, and do this for seven days or so. Thus the fracture will be restored, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, tie a string to its opening, and place the entire bladder in the natural cavity; Then blow into the string forcefully, until the bladder is inflated inside. The natural cavity will restore the fracture;
Then fill it with cotton, and leave it thus for some days, until it is healed.
And when the bone of a man's or a woman's finger is broken, restore it as we have described for the bone of the hip.
And these fractures close at hand are not hidden from the one who studies and uses it, and understands my book.
For the fracture signifies in several dispositions the right way of restoration: Understand it then.
In the finger, when it is broken, take a goose's throat and put the finger into it; then wrap cloths around it, and leave it three days or longer, and it will be healed quickly.
of fracture with wound
It is necessary for someone with a fracture and a wound, especially if it is large, like the bone of the thigh or the shoulder or similar, that it be healed immediately, so that the treatments we have mentioned prove it.
And if the wound heals, then cauterize it with vitriol, if you have nothing else, then resume restoring the fracture at the same time, or that day, if no hot abscess arises.
And if a hot abscess arises, then leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, for you would cause a bad accident.
And if the broken bone is apparent on the exposed flesh, then it is necessary for you to carefully place it in position with small extensions.
And if the extension is not suitable for aligning it with your hands, then reposition it with this instrument, which is made of iron, measuring seven or eight inches in length, and its width is according to the size of the wound. and for this, the surgeon needs three or four, according to what is needed for each fracture treatment.
and let them be round and somewhat thick, so they do not bend when pressing on the limb during your work, and be sharp in the front, and thick from the middle forward, like this:
And it is called a "palanche," so that the curved part must be placed over the head of the visible bone; and push it at once, until it returns, and let them be aligned against each other. And if the fracture is subtle, and the instrument cannot properly grasp the bone, you must cut the head of the bone, so that the instrument has power over it.
And if you cannot return the bone, as we have said, then cut it with a suitable instrument, either a cutting or a saw, to your ability;
then remove that which remains in the bone of harshness and small fragments.
And when the bone is returned, and the patient feels great pain afterwards, know that it is not in its natural place.
So do so until it is in its place, then soak a cloth in dark astringent wine, and properly if it is in the state; and do not put a plaster or anything else oily on the wound, lest it cause rot and corruption;
then administer splints once you have restored the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut away the covering completely around it, according to the size of the wound, and be very careful that the wound is not constricted by the splints;
and many times foolish healers have done this, and have brought upon the patient either death or corruption at times; and the constriction should be softer and gentler than other fractures.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that evil accidents may come about, as we have said, and you find pain in the place, then you should not put splints on it; but wrap around it, instead of splints, hard cloths, and bind them.
And when you see after one or two days pus forming on the wound, then remove what you have put on it entirely, and apply a healing ointment for wounds, such as a four-drug ointment and similar ones.
And you should unbind the limb twice a day, morning and evening, until it is healed and sound.
And the limb should be arranged so that the pus runs down easily.
And if many days pass, and it cannot heal but keeps forming pus again, know that there are small pieces of bone, so you must probe the wound with a tent, and remove all those detached pieces that cause the pain.
And if a fistula appears in the place, or another kind of corruption, then you must treat it according to what he says in his chapter before this one.
And when the bone is broken and exposed on the limb, such as the bone of the thigh or the shoulder, and others like these large limbs, do not pull it out, for often death results from it, but leave it until it rots.
Perhaps it will fall out after twenty or thirty days, then treat the wound, if you can.
and if you cannot, leave it.
We often have many bruises after the breaking of the bone, especially when it is near the joint, and a pitiful thing to see is the shape of the limb; and perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Therefore, take care if the wound is fresh: if the administrator gives astringent medicines, such as aloes, frankincense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, acacia, and similar others, so that you take any of these things, or all together, and mix them with astringent wine or with abundant egg white or with vinegar; and place them on the wound in bandages, and bind it tightly, and do not loosen it for many days;
and place them on the wound in bandages, and bind it tightly, and do not loosen it for many days; and then remove it, and begin another, until the swelling is gone;
or you bind over a piece of well-made lead; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings from the limbs;
and if the swelling has hardened like stone, and it needs to be removed, then cut over it, and remove the excess that appears; or you scrape it with a razor until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
of the limb that is weak after the healing
When the broken bone is restored, and the limb remains weak and frail afterward, this happens for many reasons: one of which is because it was bound too tightly, and not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or because of the multitude of ointments; or because of too much movement, and not at the right time; or because there is little blood in his body, and therefore he is weak.
And the treatment is that you must feed the patient, and make the body soft, until the blood is multiplied within him; and give him baths, and give him joy and ease;
then place pitch on the limb, so that the pitch attracts great nourishment, and often sprinkle it with warm water, so that the nourishment flows to the limb; and returns to its natural form.
of a limb twisted after healing When the limb is twisted after restoration, and the broken bone is exposed, and the limb's shape is ugly, nevertheless it does not lose its natural function:
so do not believe the fools who say that one should break the limb anew, and many foolish people have done this in our land;
and this practice is condemned, and great harm comes from it, and perhaps death;
However, if the knots and contortions are fresh, then they should be bathed with hot water, or softening herbs should be boiled, such as mallow leaves, and roots, and melilot, and similar things;
and make a softening poultice, such as well-made diachylon, and take the mucilage of mallow, and mix it with goose fat or sesame oil, and make a poultice on top;
or take ripe figs, and crush them with fine flax, and similar medicines that loosen the adhesion.
And sometimes the knot is removed by rubbing continuously and for a long time with moist hands. And movement should be given to the limb every hour.
And if the distortion is old and hardened, like stone, and it needs to be removed with iron, then it should be cut to the bone, with a sharp, light incision. and apply compresses and care in the treatment.
Dislocation occurs when a joint moves out of its place, so that it cannot move, and the limb is misaligned, and the patient feels great pain and great injury.
When dislocation occurs to someone, it must be immediately returned without delay.
For if one delays, the area swells, and perhaps one resets it with difficulty to its place.
Therefore, one should not move it when it is swollen. Many times it causes spams and other pains.
However, when this happens, let the patient be bled, then leave it until the abscesses subside.
Then apply warm water and oil to the limb, then gently reset it, and treat each limb as it will return to its place.
And I have ordered the chapters on dislocations from the head to the feet.
Sometimes the jawbones are dislocated, and the dislocation of both is according to two manners: or they are slightly separated from their places, and slightly softened; or they are completely dislocated, and hang towards the chest, and saliva drips from the mouth so that he cannot contain it, nor close his mouth, and wraps his tongue with the speech.
When the dislocation is small, it returns by several methods.
And if it is complete and accomplished, you must reset it quickly, and delay not at all;
and in such a way that the minister holds the patient's head, and places the tips of his fingers in the root of the mandible dislocation inside the mouth, if the dislocation is from two sides; and the other finger of the hand should be used to put it into the same position.
and instruct the patient to relax his jaw and move it in all directions. And the minister places it into position, until it returns to its place.
And if resetting is difficult, especially if the two mandibles are together, soften them with hot water and oil, until they reset gently.
Do not delay in resetting, as we have said.
And when they are correctly reset, and the patient's mouth closes well without difficulty, place wet cloths on a poultice made of rose oil and wax, then bind it gently with soft bandages.
and let the patient sleep on their back, and their head be placed between two cushions, so that they do not move it to the right or left, nor make any effort to hurt themselves, but eat light foods until the pain is gone and the jaws are healed;
and then let them eat whatever they want gently, and do not try to open their mouth for eating and drinking until the jaw is well healed and sound.
And if the two jaws cannot be put back in place at once, and are not returned to their position, fevers and customary aches result, and perhaps looseness of the bowels, and perhaps vomiting of clear phlegm.
And when you see this, then know that it is destruction. and many times the one who suffers this dies within four days.
The fork cannot dislocate from the inside of the rib cage and the breast, and it is sometimes dislocated by the back, and this is clearly felt.
And the restoration is that the patient often lies on their back and extends their arms; and then press the area firmly with your palm, and it will return;
then place the plaster and bandage on it, and bind it tight;
and the shoulder near the ribs cannot dislocate; if not, and if it dislocates at any time, reset it to its place, as we have said;
then place the plaster and bandage on it, and bind it tight, and instruct the patient to rest until he is healed;
and likewise the shoulder is reset when it is pulled from its place.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is not dislocated except in three ways:
one of which is that it is dislocated towards the armpit below; and the second is towards the breast; and perhaps dislocated towards the upper part, and this happens rarely;
and it does not dislocate behind because of the shoulder, and it does not dislocate inside because of the nerves;
and many times dislocates below towards the armpit, especially in those with little flesh, for in these it jumps quickly;
in those who have sufficient flesh, it jumps with difficulty, and returns with difficulty.
And perhaps some men experience a blow or a fracture, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and they think it is dislocated because of this.
Therefore, you must test it, until you are certain. And then begin the treatment.
And dislocation is recognized when it is downwards towards the armpit, and a difference is seen between the diseased and healthy shoulder, and you will find a clear difference between them. and you will find a hollow at the head of the shoulder, and under the armpit, when touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were a bone. and the patient cannot bring their hand to their side, nor move it in any way.
And also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you find it clearly when touching it.
And this type of dislocation is only to be reset, when it is new, or if the child is ill.
And the method is that the healer raises the patient's hand upward, then places their palms under the armpit, and raises the joint forcefully upward to its place. And the healer raises the hand, and extends it upwards, then places it underneath. So it will come quickly.
And if it does not come as we have said in a few days afterward, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in hot water; and the healer apply a softening and soothing lotion, such as a decoction of mallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and administer it;
then the patient should be laid on their back, and a thick piece of wool, neither too soft nor too hard, should be placed under the armpit, then the patient's heel should be placed on the wool, and the shoulder head should be lifted firmly, and the patient's hand should be pulled;
and another person should hold the patient's head so it does not move down; that shoulder will return right now, and if you wish to see it reset in this way:
and it is that you should have a man present who is taller than the patient; and let him be straight, facing the side, and put his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lift the armpit upwards, so that the patient hangs in the air; and another attendant pulls the patient's arm downward towards the stomach. And if the patient is too light, let him hang something heavy with him, and the dislocation will return now.
And it is reset also in another manner:
and a long piece of wood is stuck in the ground, on which the head rests as straight as a staff, and it is neither too thick nor too thin; then it is placed under the patient, but let him have soft cloths above, and the patient is lying along the length of the wood;
then his hand is extended downwards on the other side forcefully, and the joint will return to its place quickly;
and if it does not want to return despite all these things we have said, then do this treatment: take a piece of wood two arms long and four fingers wide, which has a straight head for entering deep under the armpit, according to this shape:
then tie soft cloths over the head of the wood, so that the wood does not hurt the patient, then put it under the patient's armpit;
and extend his arm along the wood, and tie the shoulder to the wood, and the arm to the head of the hand, then put the arm on a rung of a ladder of the appropriate width, and let the hand be extended downwards, and let the body hang on the other side: The joint returns now.
And when it is back in place, however it may be, you must place a layer of wool beneath the armpit, then apply a prepared plaster of mill powder, with incense and egg white, over the entire shoulder and around it, then secure it under the armpit properly, and wrap the bandage over the plaster, and brace the arm to his neck, and let the hands remain thus.
And he should eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal sooner;
and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and it is not softened, it is healed.
And if the joint is displaced from its place due to moisture that has come upon it, or for another reason, you must apply cauteries to three openings, as it is written previously in the chapter on cauteries.
And if you do all this, and it dislocates after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and cannot lift its arm upwards, then know that the nerve at the head of the shoulder is cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocations towards the breast, or behind, are caused by an impact, and the stretching of the arms, and another remedy is given.
and treat until they are healed.
And if after healing there is stiffness in the limb, and delay in movement, then the patient should use baths many times, until that stiffness is relieved, and returns to its original nature.
of the dislocation of the ribs
Know that the joint of the ribs is dislocated in points, and returns in points.
and if it is dislocated from all sides, and especially in front and behind, and the dislocation is not reduced, because it can be clearly seen and felt. and dislocated according to each shape. And when you join the diseased rib with the healthy one, you can see it clearly. Because the joint is dislocated, and the arm cannot bend, nor can the shoulder touch at all.
And it is necessary to reset it before suppurating boils come, because if suppurating boils came, it would be difficult to reset it.
and perhaps it cannot be entirely reset, especially when it is at the back; it is worse than other dislocations, and causes greater pain, and perhaps death comes.
And the restoration, when it is such that it can be reset, is that you extend his hand with your two hands; and his arms be spread, and the hand of the mirror according to the edge around, above and below, and put the joint to his shoulders together, or at the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in front, it returns when he doubles his hand to his hand, and pushes the root of the palm towards the edge that is dislocated.
And if it does not want to return to its place, then administer strong extension;
and it is that two ministers extend the arm, and hold it with two ministers, so that it does not move during the extension;
then turn the arm in each direction, after you have wrapped a long and wide double cloth;
and when the man places the joint in his hand, then anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint firmly until it returns;
and when it is in place, then put a dry plaster with a bit of egg on it, and bind it firmly, and hang the arm on the patient's neck, and leave it for a few days, then unbind it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, then untie the bandage and leave it.
and if you see that the joint is not well aligned, then reapply the plaster and bandage, and leave it like that for several days, until it is firmly in place; then unbind it.
And if he feels pain after the joint is reset, and it moves, then bathe and rub it gently, and press until it is relieved; or you place a layer of fat sheep's wool on the joint, then leave it for a day and a night, then remove it, and put it in a bath; and when it sweats, gently rub the joint, then put the wool back on, and then put it back in the bath; and thus do it two or three times, until it is healed;
and if you wish, put moist warm cow's hay with butter on it, and bind it on;
it will return to its proper position.
the dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and its return is easier than other joints. However, it must be brought back to its place quickly, at the very moment it is dislocated, before the place swells or a hot abscess forms there.
And the repositioning is done by placing the affected hand on a table, and the attendant extends the hand, and the attendant places it straight, so that he puts his palm over the appearance of the joint, and pushes until it returns.
However, you must observe if it is properly in place; then let the patient place the back of their hand on a table during the extension and repositioning. And if the dislocation is in the back of the hand, let the patient place the back of their hand on the table, and the attendant place their hand over the apparent area of the joint.
If it returns now, it is well. If not, apply soothing poultices to the inflamed abscesses, and leave it thus without recommencing.
And if he cannot bear it, and you cannot put it back in place after several days, let the joint remain twisted.
and it does not harm the patient any further than that the hand is softened and cannot grasp anything at all: then know that the nerve or the artery is severed.
there is no other remedy than to cauterize near the affected area, and perhaps nothing else will work.
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster we have described, then bind it and leave it for five days, then unbind it and leave it thus.
And if it cannot be moved well, and there is any stiffness, soak it in warm water and rub it until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated on each side, sometimes on the back of the palm or on the belly (palm).
Then straighten the finger, and push the dislocation back into place with your fingers until it returns, then support the top of the finger and bend it towards the part where it is disjointed;
and leave it for two days, and then put it straight that day;
and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it by day, and move it, and rebind it at night;
and do this often, until it is straight, and likewise do, if it is dislocated on the palm of the hand, and do as you have done previously, until it is healed;
and likewise do, when it is dislocated on the other side.
Regarding dislocation of the shin from the back
When the shin from the back or the neck is dislocated, or if there are multiple dislocations, there is no cure, for death quickly comes upon the patient.
And the signs are that the excretions leak without will, and cannot be held, and often certain limbs are weakened, or both thighs or both arms or one.
And many times the shin moves in four directions;
the one that moves to the back is called "gilbositez":
the cure is that you must wait if the gilbositez has come from childhood: if there is no cure nor healing of the whole.
And that which comes from falling or from blows or similar things, the ancient ways of cures were said in great words, or there is not always great profit in them;
but I have shortened it according to my intention, and have formed instruments in various ways.
I say that in the gilbositez that comes to the breast beforehand, there is no device nor health;
and also that which comes directly on the two sides, and one cannot cure anything other than that which comes properly to the back, as I say;
and that the patient be stretched out on his face in one even place, and have restraint beneath him, so that he does not injure himself;
then place one piece of burning wood at the head in the ground firmly, and another at the feet, and tie a bandage under the patient's armpits, and another at the hips, and knees, and ankles;
and two ministers should hold the bandages, one at the head and the other at the feet, between the two pieces of burning wood;
and let them be firmly held, the burning wood as we have said, and the mire put his palms upon the spine firmly, until it returns to its place.
And if it does not return with this treatment, take a board three arms long, and place it beneath the wall, and let the patient lie on his side, and place the head of the board beneath the wall, then put the middle of the board on the spine; and let the mire place his feet on the other end of the board, and press firmly, until it returns to its place;
and if you wish, do it with the turning device that turns with the hand. And you must place two pieces of burning wood at the head of the sick person, one arm's length apart, and two more towards the feet, and have a palm's width of space between each piece of wood, above and below;
and have one hole in each piece of wood, through which the turning device runs, and let the pieces of wood be firmly in the ground, so that they do not move;
and between each pair of two pieces of wood, have one turning piece of wood, on which the ropes turn, and have two small pieces of wood of one palm's length, for turning the turning device;
and then tie the rope that is among the pulleys to the turning device towards the head, and the other rope towards the feet to the other turning device, and each of the ministers turns their turning device to the entire rope, and the master sets the spine straight as we have said.
And when it is straight, then apply a desiccant plaster with abundant egg, and then the bandages, and then a piece of wood of three fingers length, which covers the place of the lump and the part of the spine itself, then tie it with a bandage, as we have said, and the patient uses subtle nourishment until he is healed;
and if anything comes in the end of the healing, it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the piece of wood that we have mentioned before; and sometimes a lead piece is administered, and sometimes an appearance comes in the back spine of the back, and it is thought to be a dislocation; and it is the bone that appears, therefore one should not have any presumption: perhaps it would bring death.
Know that at the joints of the hip and the joints of the shoulder, only dislocations occur, and not in the way that occurs at other joints;
and the hip joint is dislocated according to four parts: inward and outward, and forward and backward;
and more inward elsewhere, and slightly dislocated forward and backward.
And the knowledge of its inward dislocation is that when one joins the sick leg with the healthy one, it is longer, and the sick person's knee appears more prominent than the healthy one, and the sick person cannot bend their knee to the fire; and the place next to it is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh comes there.
And the sign of that which comes to the outward, is that these accidents are contrary to those before.
And the signs of that which happens in front are that they extend their leg well according to its completion; however, do not bend the knee without pain, and if one wants to make it go, it cannot go forward, and retains its urine, and the groin swells, and when it goes, it passes over the heel.
And the signs of that which happens behind are that they cannot spread their knee, nor bend it, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is in the place under the ribs.
The treatment of this type of dislocation is that you observe if the dislocation is old, and it remains in its position, then there is no cure; and there should be no presumption.
And in the one whose dislocation is recent, and it is one of the four kinds of dislocation, hurry to turn the joint, and stretch it in and out, and move it to the right and left; Perhaps it will return, and no other cure is needed.
And if it does not return in this manner, you must prepare a strong assistant, and stretch the leg firmly with two hands, or with a bandage tied above the knee; and another assistant extends his hand above in such a way that he places his hands under his armpits, then tightens it with a soft bandage over the thigh; and another holds the end of the bandage;
and they pull upwards and downwards all at once, so that the patient is lifted from the ground at once, and remains hanging.
This manner of extension is common to four similar cases, and if the dislocation has returned, as we have said, it is good.
If not, then treatment must be applied to its likeness.
When the dislocation is inward, you should have the patient lie on their healthy side, then place the bandage on the root of the thigh, and the area beneath the armpit, then extend the bandage upwards towards the armpit, and towards the shoulder;
then take another assistant, and embrace the thick part of the diseased thigh, and extend it strongly outward: it will return to its place now;
and this type of dislocation is less severe than the others.
And if you cannot close it in this way as we have said, you must bind the patient's two feet together with a strong soft bandage around the two heels and the two knees, and the diseased leg should be extended two fingers more than the other;
then be hung by the head from a post, and be two arms length above the ground;
then instruct one attendant to grasp the head of the thigh, and let another attendant hang with the patient, who firmly grasps the thigh, for the joint will return quickly now.
And when the dislocation is to the front, let the patient lie, as we have said for those who have gibbosity, and bind a bandage around the diseased leg properly, and around the foot as well;
then place two firebrands, one at the head and one at the feet, then place a firebrand between the patient's thighs in the middle; and have moistened cloths spread around, so as not to burn the patient, then let each attendant stretch toward him, and the one in the middle place the dislocation equal to his hand.
If it returns, it is good.
If not, place on a table, and press it as we have said for gibbosity, and let the patient lie on the healthy side.
And when the dislocation is in front, it is necessary to extend the ill limb hastily, and according to what I have said; and let the attendant place his effort on the ill hip, then press with the other hand, and extend it downward towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is behind, it is not necessary to extend the patient downward, nor to raise him from the ground, but it is necessary that he be as if the hip were dislocated behind, as we have said regarding the lying position on both hips; and let him be on his face, and the ligature extended as we have said before, and one must press on the joint against the table; and it will be in place when the patient extends his legs, and they are equal; then join the thighs, and apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, so that the hip does not move; and rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and put the plaster on;
and if you see that they are equal, bind it as before, and leave it for three days;
then unbind it, and let it move gently, until the limb is strengthened.
of the dislocation of the knee
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inward and outward, and backward;
and does not dislocate forward.
And the signs are that you instruct the patient to bend their leg at the thigh, and if it does not fit at the thigh, know that it is dislocated;
And the restoration for all is that you have the patient sit upright, and extend their leg if they can, and place your back against their face, and place their foot on your feet;
then take their knee in your palms, and draw between your fingers, then bend the two sides of the knee tightly; and another attendant extends their foot, so that the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that they fit their leg at the thigh lightly;
and apply the plaster, and have the leg fit at the thigh, and bind them together tightly for three or four days, then unbind;
and the patient does not work to walk, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not properly set, the attendant applies strong extension, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the heel
The heel is sometimes moved, and sometimes completely dislocated, both inwardly and outwardly.
And the sign is that the ankle is swollen, and thrust forward towards the part where it is dislocated:
The reduction is gentle, and one should gently extend it with one's hands when it is only moved.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must have the patient sit upright, and have two assistants hold the leg firmly above the ankle;
then pull the foot towards your right hand, and then to the left hand twice, then extend it upwards, and put the foot nicely upwards;
and do this twice, as we have said, by pushing and pulling the foot;
if it returns, that is good;
if not, then recommence the work, for it returns;
and if it cannot return thus, then make the sick person lie on their back on the ground, and firmly place a staff in the ground between their thighs, and tie cloths around it so it does not injure the sick person;
then let the assistants hold the thigh, and other assistants extend the foot to their hands or a rope, which they tie above the top of the foot; then let each assistant extend equally, and the staff be between the sick person's thighs to restrain the sick person when they are being stretched;
then let the doctor place the dislocation in their hands, and another assistant hold the healthy leg below, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, then put the plaster and bandages on, and bind it tightly, and tie the foot to the leg, and watch the nerves that are above the ankle behind, that the bandages are not too tight;
then leave it for two or three days, and if the bandage softens, tighten it;
then untie it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days; and if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if hot abscesses come, you must soothe them, as we have said elsewhere, until they are healed.
of the fingers When the fingers are dislocated, they should be gently straightened without force, and this is an easy thing.
And if the dislocation is in any part of the back of the foot, you must make the patient sit on a flat surface or a table, completely upright, and place your foot on the exposed joints, then press firmly with your foot until it returns.
and when it is aligned, and nothing is apparent, place a table with two supports under the sole of the foot, then hold it firmly, and leave it for three days, then release it. and keep it resting until it is healed.
of wound and dislocation together
When a wound comes with the dislocation, and one wants to restore it, many times the patient dies:
So do not be presumptuous in the treatment, if you are not skilled in the art and have not used it for a long time, and if you are not compassionate and merciful and patient, and not rash;
and use soothing things at the beginning for hot abscesses, and leave the patient in God's hand if you see no hope of health; and when you see hope, then reset the limb to its place, before the hot abscesses get there;
and when the limb is in place, administer soothing things for hot abscesses, and treat the wound, as is necessary, with drying ointments;
and if with the dislocation there is a fracture, and small bones separated, then put them together, and do what we have said in simple illnesses;
and guard yourself from entering a path of fear, according to what I have said, for this will be a test from your Creator, and for the safety of your soul and body.
