The treatment of tremors/shaking/shivering
When someone trembles from nerve coldness, or quartan fever or other, you should make four cauteries on the spine of the back, one cautery between each vertebra;
and one cautery on the feet, and one on the stomach with an olive-shaped cautery;
this will stop the trembling, and hasten the recovery from the cold illness.
