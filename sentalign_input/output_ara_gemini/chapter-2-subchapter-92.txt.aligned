Chapter ninety-two on the incision on the worms generated under the smallpox called the disease of cattle	CHAPTER NINETY-TWO. On incision for the worm arising beneath the skin, called 'the cattle disease'.	0.7985563
This disease is called in some of our countries the disease of cattle because it often happens to cattle.	This complaint is called by us in some regions 'the cattle disease' since it frequently happens to cattle.	0.87590635
It is a single small worm that is generated between the skin and the flesh and creeps in the whole body, ascending and descending, becoming apparent to the sense when it creeps from one organ to another until it pierces a place in the skin and comes out.	It is in fact a small solitary worm generated between the skin and the flesh, that creeps all over the body, both up and down; it can be felt as it creeps from one part to another until it breaks out at a place where it can break through the skin, and out it comes.	0.89496523
And its formation is from the putrefaction of some of the humors, as happens to worms, snakes, and حب القرع (probably a type of skin eruption or growth) in the belly.	It arises from the putrefaction of certain humours as do worms, round-worms and gourd-worms in the abdomen.	0.5659691
And what is expected of its harm is that if it creeps in the body and rises to the head and reaches the eye, it may open it and come out, thus destroying the eye, and this happens often.	Part of the harm that may be expected of it is that when it creeps about the body and goes up to the head and reaches the eye it may make an opening in the eye and come out and destroy the eye; this frequently happens.	0.8639691
So, if you want to treat it and remove it, it can only be done when it creeps and appears to the sense, so you should tie what is above it and below it with a good tight bandage, then cut over it and remove it.	If you wish to treat this and extract it, it must be done while it is creeping about and can be felt. You must tie a tight tourniquet above and below it, then cut down upon it and extract it.	0.7743968
If it sinks into the flesh and you do not find it, then apply cauterization with fire to the place until you burn it.	But if it burrows into the tissues and you cannot locate it, then apply the actual cautery to the place until you have burnt the worm.	0.78342265
And the greatest thing that is expected is its corruption of the eye, as we have said, so if you see that it has gone to the head near the eye, then tie tightly under it on the forehead, then cut over it and take it out.	The greatest damage to be feared from it is damage to the eye, as we have said. So if you see that it has entered the head and is near the eye, then bind a strong bandage over the forehead beneath it, then cut down upon it and draw it out.	0.85889375
And it is necessary that the sick person take care to purify his body with medicines that purge the putrid, bad humors and be cautious of foods that generate putrefaction.	It is important also for the patient to take care to cleanse his body with laxative medicines from all corrupt and evil humours. He should also avoid all foods giving rise to putrefaction.	0.7968692
