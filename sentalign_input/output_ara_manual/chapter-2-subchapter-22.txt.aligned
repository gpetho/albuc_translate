On the Treatment of Pterygium.	On the treatment of hypopyon.	0.6706316
This condition, which is called pterygium, is a growth that gathers in the eye, resembling but not actually, flowing water.  The way to operate is to sit the patient upright on a chair, then take his head in your two hands.	This disease which is called 'hypopyon' is a collection of pus in the eye which resembles cataract but is not so. The method of operating in this disease is to make the patient sit upright on a chair before you.	0.6656638
And move it until you see the growth descend in the eye, then it becomes fixed and does not move, and the light breaks through and the patient sees things as he used to. If it does not descend, we know that it is fluid. If the descent of the growth cannot be achieved by what we have describedâ€¦	Take his head on either side with your hands and shake it about till you can see the pus come down; then it will be fixed and not move; and the light will pass and the patient will see things as he was before. But if it does not come down, we know it is cataract.	0.7480601
Otherwise, sit the patient before you, then take a thin scalpel and make a small incision above the cornea at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the limbus until the material comes out.	But if the pus is not ready to be brought down by this method, then seat the patient in front of you; then take a fine scalpel and cut a little above the corneal tunic near the coronal junction of conjunctiva and cornea, till the pus comes out.	0.75381637
Once it comes out, instill into the eye hot water mixed with honey, or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled. Then treat with other medications until healed.	When it comes out, instil warm water mixed with honey, or water boiled with fenugreek and honey. Then treat as usual till healed.	0.8625062
