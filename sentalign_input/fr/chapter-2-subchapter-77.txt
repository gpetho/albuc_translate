On repositioning the uterus
Here is the form of the press, with which books are moved; it has two turners at the two ends of the two bindings.
However, the horns should be more delicate than the restrictor and made of ebony or boxwood;
and the mouth of the wood should be a finger wide, and the edges of the boards a finger, and one and a half palms long;
and in the middle of the two bindings, there should be two adjustments of the same wood, fixed in both, half a palm long or a little more;
and these two adjustments are inserted into the mouth of the uterus to open it when the two horns are turned.
Another form, similar but more delicate and lighter, is made of ebony or boxwood, similar to tongs;
and has at the two ends two adjustments, as you see, a palm long and two fingers wide;
and when you want to open the uterus with the instrument, make the woman sit on a bed, with her feet hanging and her legs open,
then insert the two adjustments joined together into the uterus, and hold the head of the instrument underneath between her thighs;
then operate the instrument with your hand, as you have done with the tongs, according to the amount you want to open the mouth of the uterus, until the midwife does what she wants.
These instruments are all topped, and their forms are multiplied; and when the doctor has prepared them, the work is faster, and higher for men due to their size.
Do not despise the instrument without having prepared it, for its necessity is undeniable.
