Chapter Ninety-Two.
On the incision for worms generated under the skin, and it is called the disease of cattle.
This disease is called in some of our countries the disease of cattle because it often happens to cattle, and it is a single small worm that is generated between the skin and the flesh and creeps throughout the whole body, ascending and descending.
It is perceptible to the senses when it creeps from one organ to another until it pierces wherever it pierces a place in the skin and emerges.  Its formation is from the putrefaction of some humors, as happens with worms and snakes and pumpkin seeds in the abdomen.
The harm expected from it is that if it creeps in the body and rises to the head and reaches the eye, it may perhaps open it and come out, thus destroying the eye, and this happens often. So if you want to treat it and remove it, this is only possible when it creeps and its appearance is perceptible to the senses.
It is necessary that you tightly bind above it and below it with a good, tight ligature, then incise upon it and take it out. If it sinks into the flesh and you do not find it, then apply cautery with fire to the place until you burn it.  The greatest harm expected from it is the destruction of the eye, as we have said.
If you see that it has gone into the head near the eye, then bind tightly below it on the forehead, then incise upon it and take it out.  It is necessary that the patient attends to purifying his body with medications that purge putrid, bad humors and be careful of foods that generate putrefaction.
