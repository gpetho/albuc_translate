of the cautery for pleurisy	On cauterization for pleurisy.	0.64999026
And some ancients said that some use an iron cautery resembling a razor, and heat it and place it between the ribs until it reaches the abscess; the pain jumps out, as we have said in the abscess of the liver. But in this work, there is a fear that the patient may die immediately, or a fistula may form that cannot be healed.	Now one of the Ancients mentioned that there were some people who used an iron cautery shaped like a probe, and introduced it red hot into the intercostal space until it reached the abscess itself and evacuated the pus, as we have mentioned under tumour of the liver. But in this perforation with the cautery there is a danger either that the patient may die on the spot or that an incurable fistula may arise at the place.	0.8514105
