Chapter seventeen on the fracture of the bones of the leg and fingers.
As for the heel, it does not suffer a fracture at all.
As for the bones of the leg, they may suffer a fracture, and the toes also rarely suffer a fracture, but rather they suffer a bruise in most cases.
If the bones of the leg suffer a fracture and you see that those bones have overlapped, let the patient place his foot on the ground upright like a walker, then you stand and place your foot on the raised part of those bones, then step on it and straighten it until it returns to its place.
Then carry the bandage and the splint from above and place under the sole of the foot a small board that has two flat ends.
Then tighten the foot tightly after wrapping it with rags and all that you need.
When three or four days have passed for him, release the bandage, for you will find the bones straightened, whether they were broken or dislocated, so the procedure is as you see.
But if some of the toes are broken, set them and straighten them according to what I described to you in setting the fingers of the hand.
Then make for the broken toe a splint along the length of the toe, and let it be slightly wider than it.
Then place under the foot this board that I described to you and tighten it tightly.
If the broken bones are two or three or more, then put on each toe a splint of its size inserted in a soft cloth and tighten the board at the bottom of the foot, and let each end of the board rest outside the sole of the foot to secure it well.
And you should not forget to observe all that we have mentioned to you in the rest of the fracture, of the symptoms that we have mentioned, and treat each symptom with what is appropriate.
