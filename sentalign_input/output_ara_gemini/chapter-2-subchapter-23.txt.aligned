We have mentioned the types of water in the classification and which one is suitable for the cupping glass, with detailed and explained words, so you take it from there correctly.	We have already mentioned in the appropriate section the varieties of cataract and those in which depression is useful, in full detail; so you may take it accurately from there.	0.72339153
Then, you should sit the patient between your hands, squared facing the light near the sun, and tie his healthy eye, tightening it well.	You should cause the patient to sit down cross-legged before you, facing the light in full sun, and firmly bind up his sound eye.	0.77893907
Then you lift his eyelid with your left hand if the eye that has the water is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.	Then lift up his eyelid with your left hand, if it be the left eye in which the humour is; or with the right hand if it be the right eye.	0.86435485
Then you place the tip of the cupping glass near the iris, with the thickness of a probe, in the white of the eye itself, from the side of the smaller canthus, then you push the cupping glass with force while rotating it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel with the cupping glass that it has reached something empty.	Then put the tip of the needle near the corona, about the thickness of a probe away, onto the white of the eye itself, on the side of the lesser canthus. Then thrust the needle firmly in, at the same time rotating it with your hand, until it penetrates the white of the eye, and you feel that the needle has reached something empty.	0.8977455
And it should be that the extent of the cupping glass's going into the depth is equal to the distance that is from the pupil to the end of the blackness, which is the iris of the eye, for you see the copper in the eye of the observer himself, due to the clarity of the cornea.	The depth the needle goes in should measure as the distance from the pupil to the edge of the iris, which is the corona of the eye; you will see the metal in the pupil itself because of the transparency of the corneal tunic.	0.7927245
Then you move the cupping glass upwards to the place where the water is, then you press it downwards repeatedly. If the water descends immediately, then the patient will see whatever his sight opens upon immediately, with the cupping glass in his eye. Then he rests a little. If the water rises, then lower it again without removing the cupping glass.	Then put the needle up to the place containing the humour; then press the point downwards time after time. If the humour comes down at once, the patient will at once see whatever his vision is opened upon while the needle is still in his eye. Then let him rest a little while; and if the humour goes back up again depress it a second time without taking the needle out.	0.8454941
And when it settles and doesn't rise, remove the cupping glass gently while twisting it with your hand little by little.	When it stays down firmly and does not come back again, gently draw the needle out, twisting it ever so slowly with your hand.	0.73116547
Then you dissolve in water a bit of pure Andarani salt and wash the eye with it from the inside, then you place on the outside of the whole eye lint or wool moistened with rose oil and egg white, and you tie the healthy eye with it.	Then dissolve a little pure rock-salt in water and wash the eyeball with the solution; then apply all over the outer aspect of the eye carded linen or wool moistened with oil of roses and egg-white, and bandage it up together with the sound eye.	0.825082
As for us and the people of our time, we put on it ground cumin with egg white.	Now we and our contemporaries apply pounded cumin with the egg-white.	0.77363217
If the cupping glass does not respond to you for entering the eye due to its hardness, because among people there are those whose eyes are very hard, then you should take the lancet that is called the 'barid,' which is this image:	But if the couching needle does not serve, failing to enter the eye on account of its hardness (for there are some whose eyes are hard indeed), you should take the scalpel called al-baridl figured thus.	0.6731284
So you pierce only the conjunctiva itself, and do not go deep in the piercing.	With this make a perforation in the conjunctiva only, not piercing any further; for that is only to make a little entrance for the needle.	0.72249967
It is only that you tap a fine spot for the lancet, then insert the lancet as we mentioned.	And then thrust in the needle as we said before.	0.5186917
And when your work is complete, prepare for the patient a firm bed in which he sleeps on his back in a dark room, and he refrains from all movements and from coughing, and you make his food what softens his nature, and he does not move his head right or left at all, and the bandage remains as it is until the third day, then you loosen it in that dark room, and test his vision, and show him things, then you return the bandage until the seventh day.	At the end of your operation, prepare a solidly-built bed on which the patient may lie on his back, in a dark room; and keep him from all movement or coughing. And prescribe such a diet for him as will relax his system; neither let him move his head to right or to left. Let the bandage remain in the same position till the third day. Then loosen it in the same dark room and make trial of his sight, putting before him objects to be seen; then replace the bandage till the seventh day.	0.9079729
And it is not appropriate that you do that at the time of treatment or after the lancing immediately, but it is appropriate that you avoid that before the water rises quickly with intense looking.	You should not do this at the time of treatment nor immediately after the perforation by the needle; but on the contrary you should avoid it, for intensive use of the eye causes a rapid ascent of the humour.	0.7393875
If a hot swelling appears, it is appropriate to unbind the eye before the seventh day and correct that with what calms the swelling, so that when it subsides, then you release his vision and place a veil over his face, training his vision from under it for days while he is in that dark room, then he leaves the room gradually and manages his affairs.	But if an abscess occur you should unbandage the eye before the seventh day and restore it to health by those methods that allay swelling. When it has subsided, allow him free sight, putting over his face a dark veil beneath which his vision may be exercised for a few days while he is still in the dark room. Then let him come out of the room gradually and take up the exercise of his business.	0.8198844
And know that in lancing, the learner cannot do without observation several times, then he proceeds to the work.	But you should know that in the case of a depression of a cataract the student cannot manage without having seen that operation performed several times; then he may perform it himself.	0.63958883
And it has reached me from some of the Iraqis that he mentioned that a perforated lancet is made in Iraq that sucks the water with it, and I have not seen anyone in our country do that, nor have I read it in a book of the early books, and it is possible that this is a recent innovation.	I have heard that a certain Iraqi has said that in Iraq he makes a hollow needle by which the humour is sucked out. In our land I have never seen anyone do it in this fashion, nor have I read of it described in any of the books of the Ancients; perhaps it is newly invented.	0.8250349
And this is a picture of types of lancets for those who are ignorant of them to understand:	Here are the figures of some kinds of needle for the information of those who do not know them.	0.568099
It is made specifically of copper. And its tip is of this exact thinness, triangular and sharp.	They are mostly made of brass; and their extremities should be of this very fineness, triangular at the tip and sharp.	0.75230396
