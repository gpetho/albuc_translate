The clavicle often breaks anteriorly, towards the shoulder, and the fracture occurs in three ways: either it is broken and separated in two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore; or there is a fracture with a wound.	The collar-bone is very often broken from the end of the humerus anteriorly, and the fracture of it may be in one of three ways. It may be broken and separated into two without splintering; this is the easiest to repair. Or else splintering occurs, which is most difficult to repair. Or it is a compound fracture.	0.7941472
And the procedure is, when the fracture is without a wound, that you have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder blade near the broken clavicle; and the other stretches the neck towards the side; then align the fracture with your fingers, so that the shape is as it should be, and there is neither a bump nor a depression.	When it is a simple fracture the operation involves having two assistants present; one of them to hold steady the arm adjacent to the fractured clavicle, and the other to stretch the neck in the opposite direction. Then level the fracture with your fingers until it is reduced to its proper form and there is neither prominence nor concavity.	0.88826764
And if you need to stretch more, place a round bolster of cloth, or wool, under the patient's shoulder, and let it be thick according to your need; and stretch and lift the clavicle, and press the bolster with your hand, so that you align the fracture as it should be.	If there is need of still greater extension, place in the armpit of the patient a ball of cloth or wool made to a suitable size; and stretch and lift up the clavicle and squeeze the roll with your hand until the fracture is set in the proper way.	0.87359214
And if you cannot pull the end of the clavicle outwards, because it goes inwards deeply, then the patient should lie frequently on his back, and put a medium-sized pillow under his shoulder, and let the assistant push the shoulder downwards, until the bone of the clavicle is raised.	If you are unable to draw the extremity of the clavicle outwards on account of its being depressed, the patient will have to lie on his back and there must be put under his shoulder a medium-sized bolster. The assistant is to press the shoulder down until the depressed collar bone is elevated, and then you can set the fracture and even it out with your fingers.	0.8363047
And then straighten the fracture with your fingers, and if you find it shattered, then you must make an incision over it; and pull out the pieces gently, and if the bone cannot join because of any protrusion, then cut it with one of the incisors that you have; but make sure you place this instrument under the clavicle, to protect the periosteum.	If you feel a splinter separated from the clavicle and movable, you must cut down upon the splinter and gently remove it. If the splinter sticks to the bone, you must contrive to cut it with one of the chisels you have prepared for that, having first put beneath the clavicle the instrument to protect the membrane; an instrument made of wood or iron, of which this is the figure.	0.75067663
And if hot abscesses develop there, soak a cloth in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and apply it.	If an abscess occur, soak the dressing with oil of roses and vinegar or wine and apply.	0.8123867
