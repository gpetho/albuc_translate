When kidney pain comes from cold, and from great flatulence, and there is no desire for a woman, then you must make cauteries on the kidneys on one side and the other with the key-shaped cautery that we have mentioned before;	When pain strikes the kidneys from chill or heavy vapour, and the patient's sexual vigour is impaired thereby, you should burn him right over the kidneys, once on each kidney, with the claviform cautery mentioned before.	0.65372825
and if we cauterize it in the middle, it will have three cauteries in a line, and they will do more good.	I have often burnt him with a third cauterization on the flat of the back, making three cauterizations in a line, which is most effective.	0.51353276
