Chapter eighty-five on wounds of the abdomen, protrusion of the intestines, and their suturing.	CHAPTER EIGHTY-FIVE. On wounds of the abdomen, and protrusion of the intestine; and on suturing them.	0.8775609
The hernia that occurs in the abdomen can be large, small, or medium. From a large one, an intestine or several intestines may protrude, making their insertion and suturing more difficult and laborious.	The tear that occurs in the abdomen may be great or small or it may be middle-sized. From a large tear one or more segments of gut may protrude. The reduction of this and the suture of the wound is an exceedingly hard and difficult matter.	0.82562006
The small hernia can also be difficult in another way, so its reduction is necessarily more difficult, and if the intestine is not immediately returned to its place, it swells and thickens, making its insertion difficult. For this reason, the medium hernia is the best, because the reduction of the intestine is not as difficult as in these two types.	Small openings may also be difficult in another way, for they are bound to be harder to reduce, and if you do not hurry to return the gut to its place at once it will swell up and enlarge, thus rendering reduction difficult. So the best tear is the medium-sized, for in this case the reduction of the intestine will not be as difficult as in the two other cases.	0.85853684
Know that the suturing of the abdomen is of four types: two common sutures are suitable for suturing the abdomen and for suturing all other wounds of the body, and the other two are specific sutures that apply to all other wounds, except that they are more specific to suturing the abdomen, and I will describe them to you one by one with explanation and clarification.	Then you should know that suturing the abdomen may be carried out in four ways. Two of them are general; suitable both for suture of the abdomen and for other wounds of the body. The other two sutures are special; they may be used for other wounds, but are more suitable for abdominal wounds. I shall describe each one to you separately, with comments and explanation.	0.89933157
When you see that the swelling has subsided, wet the intestine with water in which marsh mallow or hollyhock has been cooked, for this will facilitate its entry with the easiest effort.	When you see that the swelling has come down, bathe the gut with water in which have been infused althea and mallows; for with this the reduction of the bowel becomes easy, using the lightest effort.	0.7910595
If its return is difficult after this treatment, then make a small incision in the hernia with the instrument used to incise fistulas. The first treatment, if possible, is better than the incision, and one is only compelled to make the incision after necessity and the failure of other means.	But if after this treatment the reduction is still difficult, open up the wound a little with the instrument for opening up haemorrhoids. The first method, if possible, is better than incision, but one may be compelled to incise when other means have failed.	0.71232074
This is a picture of the instrument:	This is the form of the instrument.	0.6390418
Its one curved side is limited, its other side is unlimited, and the thin end is not as thin as a scalpel but rather slightly blunt, and it is a tool that resembles a small probe, as you see.	The curved side should be sharpened, but not the other; the slender extremity should not be as slender as a scalpel, but rather blunt; it is an instrument like a small polo-stick, as you see.	0.7718073
So, if the wound widens and the intestine enters, it should be returned to its natural shape and proper place if you are able to do so, for that is best.	When the wound is opened up a little with the instrument and the bowel is reduced, it is important to return it to its natural shape and proper position, if you can, for that is better.	0.740654
However, if the rupture is wide and is in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on his back and place his legs higher than his head.	When the wound is large and in the lower abdomen the patient should lie on his back and have his legs higher than his head; but if it be in the upper abdomen his head and chest should be placed higher than his lower parts.	0.7789579
And if it is in the upper abdomen, he should place his head and chest higher than his lower body, and likewise, if the rupture is in one of the two sides of the abdomen, always make your intention and purpose to have the side where the surgery is higher than the other side.	And in the same way if the opening be on one side of the abdomen you should always make it your object to put the wounded side higher than the other.	0.71266407
And thus, it should be used in major surgeries and in medium surgeries.	So must you proceed in large or middling wounds.	0.6800693
But in small surgeries, you place it according to what is possible for you.	But in small wounds put the patient in a position convenient to yourself.	0.7185582
Then you bring before you a gentle servant who holds the entire rupture with his hands and brings its edges together, then reveals it to the one in charge of stitching bit by bit.	Then have an assistant under your direction to enclose within his hands the whole of the wound and bring the edges together, and then uncover it bit by bit for the one who is putting in the stitches.	0.7667717
And this is the description of the single common stitch, which is that you take a needle or several needles according to the size of the wound, then leave from the edge of the rupture a space the thickness of the little finger, and insert a single needle without threading it into the edges of the skin along with the edges of the peritoneum that is under the skin from the inside until you pass it through from that side, having brought together the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum, making four layers.	Now this is the description of one general suture, namely: one or more needles are taken, depending on the size of the wound; then, leaving about the width of the little finger from the end of the opening, pass an unthreaded needle from within through both edges of the skin together with both edges of the peritoneum which lies beneath the skin, piercing from one side to the other; thus you will have brought together both skin edges and both peritoneal edges, making four layers.	0.8801081
Then you tighten with a doubled thread around the needle several times from both sides until the edges of the wound are brought together tightly.	Then wind a double thread several times round the needle, and tighten up from both sides so as to bring the two edges of the wound perfectly together.	0.8743839
Then you also leave a space the thickness of a finger and insert another needle, then attach it to the thread as you did with the first needle, and continue doing this with the needles you need until you finish stitching the entire wound.	Then again leave about a finger's breadth and put in another needle and fasten it with thread as you did in the first instance; and go on doing this with as many needles as you need until you have finished mending the whole wound.	0.9063071
And let the needles be medium between thick and thin, because very thin needles quickly cut the flesh, and thick ones are also difficult to insert into the skin, therefore, they should be medium in thinness and thickness.	The needles should be of medium fineness; for the very fine needles soon cut into the flesh; while thick needles, on the other hand, are difficult to pass through the skin; so they should be medium between fineness and thickness.	0.85623926
And it is not appropriate to insert the needle into the edge of the skin too close, lest the flesh quickly tear and the wound open before it heals, nor should you stitch too far apart, lest the wound be prevented from healing.	You should not introduce the needle too near the edge of the skin lest the tissues be soon cut through and the wound gape before it has joined. Nor should there be too great an interval between the stitches, lest the wound be prevented from scarring up.	0.85301846
Then you cut the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the patient while he sleeps, and you make for him supports from pieces of linen on all sides, which hold the ends of the needles, and you leave them until you know that the wound has healed.	Then cut off the ends of the needles lest they hurt the patient during sleep; and make for him pads of linen scraps to cover the needle ends on both sides; and let them be until you know the wound is healed up.	0.89094794
This type of stitching with needles is thus more suitable in small surgeries, because it may be sufficient to stitch them with one needle or two or so.	This method of suture with needles is most suitable in small wounds, for one or two needles or thereabouts will probably be enough for such.	0.8667562
As for the description of the second common stitch, it is that you gather with the stitching the four edges, I mean the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the peritoneum, at once with a needle containing a twisted thread, moderate in thinness and thickness.	Now the second kind of general suture is to bring together all four edges, the two skin edges and the two peritoneal edges, at one and the same time, with a needle furnished with a twisted thread of medium thickness.	0.7601242
Then, when you have passed the needle through these four edges, you return the needle from the side from which you began, so that the thread lies intertwined from the top of the wound, so that the stitching is like the stitching of the small sacks with which goods are tied, and you make between each stitch and stitch a distance the thickness of the little finger, and this stitching is known by all people.	Then when the needle has pierced these four edges bring it back precisely to where you began, so that the thread may lie knitted over the wound to make a stitch in the manner of sewing up the bags in which goods are packed. The distance between stitches should be a little finger's breadth. Everybody is familiar with this stitch.	0.8719102
And it is surprising that I did not treat him with an ointment, because I was in a place where there was nothing of the medicines, so I would put worn cotton on the wound twice a day and I would wash it with honey water until it healed.	The remarkable thing is that I did not treat him with any ointment, for I was in a place where there was no sort of medicine; so twice a day I applied teased-out cotton wool to the wound, and carefully washed it with honey-water until he was healed.	0.90737593
The summary of the description of this stitching is that you stitch like furriers stitch furs, by stitching the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin, and leaving it once from the other side until you finish.	In short, this way of suturing is to sew with the stitch used by furriers in sewing skins; thus you stitch the peritoneum once one way with the skin edge and leave it once the other way, until you have done.	0.83747286
As for the second type of special stitching that Galen also mentioned, these are his words verbatim, which is that you stitch it like some of the healers stitch it, by bringing together each part to its similar counterpart naturally, so they join the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge and the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge, and that is as I describe to you.	Now the manner of the second type of special stitch which Galen mentioned is this (these are his own words): that you suture it in the same way as many practitioners. That is, they suture each part to the part that corresponds naturally to it; so they join one peritoneal margin to the other and one skin margin to the other, in the manner I shall describe.	0.84867847
It is appropriate that you insert the needle into the edge of the peritoneum closest to you from the outside and pass it through to the inside in it alone and leave the two edges of the peritoneum, then return the needle and pass it from outside to inside in both edges of the peritoneum, then return it again and pass it from inside to outside in the other edge of the peritoneum that is on the opposite side.	You should put the needle from without inwards, in that edge of the abdominal wall that is nearest to you, and make it pass inward through that alone, leaving out the peritoneal edges; then turn the needle round and run it from without inwards through both peritoneal edges. Then turn it round again and make it pierce, from within outwards, the other edge of the abdominal wall, on the opposite side.	0.85390604
And this type of stitching is better than the easy common stitching, which is the stitching that was mentioned previously.	This type of suture is better than the easy general suture that has been mentioned.	0.8269789
These are Galen's words verbatim.	These are Galen's very words.	0.92732185
And some have said that stitching the abdomen may be straightened with two needles, which is that you insert a single thread in them, and you begin by inserting the needle from your side and passing it through to the other side, and you insert the other needle from the opposite side, so you pass it through from your side, like the stitching of bishops, alike.	Some have said that the suture of the abdomen may be performed with two needles, thus: you thread one thread into both and begin by introducing the needle into that part near you and carrying it through to the other side. Then you insert the other needle on the far side and bring it through to the near side, after the manner of the shoemaker's stitch.	0.84217477
And know that if the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, its stitching is more difficult than other places of the abdomen.	You must understand that when the fissure is in the middle of the abdomen the sewing of it is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen.	0.8538803
As for the treatment of the wound, its rule in its treatment is the rule of all other surgeries, which is that if you find the wound fresh with its blood before the air changes it, and you have returned the intestine and stitched it and tightened it, then apply to it the healing powders. But if the air has changed the wound, then apply to it some of the ointments that you have prepared until it suppurates and the threads fall out and the peritoneum heals, then treat it as you treat all other surgeries until it heals.	But the medical treatment of the wound comes under just the same heading as that of other wounds. When you find a wound with its blood quite fresh, before the atmosphere has altered it, and you have reduced the intestine and have sewn it up and closed it firmly, apply to it powder to encourage fresh growth. But if the air has altered it, then apply to it some of the available ointments until it suppurates and the threads come away and the peritoneum and abdominal wall heal; then dress it as you would any other wound, until it is better.	0.88365746
But if you do not have medicines, apply worn cotton to it from the time it begins to suppurate and change it twice a day, as I have informed you, until it heals, for you will not need another treatment in most cases if the surgeries are simple.	If you have no medicaments to hand, apply cotton wool as soon as suppuration begins, and change it twice daily, as I have taught you, until it heals. You will need no other treatment in the majority of cases when the wounds are simple.	0.86663383
If you fear that the major organs will share in the pain of the wound, it is appropriate that you dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or in rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and the armpit.	But if you fear that the important organs may share the hurt of the wound, then you should dip some soft wool in moderately warm olive-oil or oil of roses and bind it round the various sites between the groin and the axillae.	0.8748416
If he feels pain or putrefaction in his intestines, which often occurs, then inject him with a lukewarm black astringent syrup, especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and has become a wound penetrating its cavity.	If pain or gangrene be felt in the bowels—and that frequently happens—then clyster him with tepid astringent black wine, particularly if the gangrene has already set in in the bowel and has become a wound penetrating to the abdominal cavity.	0.8381239
And know that whatever of the intestines is thick is easier to heal, and whatever of them is thin is more difficult to heal.	You should know that if the injured bowel be the large intestine it will heal the more easily, while if it be the small its healing is more difficult.	0.7231165
As for the intestine known as the jejunum, it does not accept healing from any surgery that occurs in it at all, because of the abundance of veins in it and their size, and the thinness of its substance and its proximity to the nature of the nerve.	But the part of the bowel called the jejunum is not likely to recover from an injury to it at all; and that is due to the number and size of arteries in it and to the thinness of its structure and to its nearly approaching a nerve in its character.	0.8086417
But if what protruded from the wound is the omentum, and you find it fresh, then return it just as you returned the intestine.	If what protrudes from the wound be omentum, and you find it freshly protruding, then reduce it as you do intestine.	0.79844695
But if some time has passed and it has become green or black, it is appropriate that you tie it with a thread above the place where it has blackened, lest bleeding occur, for there are veins and arteries in the omentum.	But if some time has lapsed and it has turned green or black, you should ligate it above the site where it has gone black lest there be a haemorrhage; for the omentum contains veins and arteries.	0.9383038
Then you cut what is below that ligature and make the ends of the thread hanging from below the surgery, outside of it, so that it is easy for you to pull it and remove it when the omentum falls off and the wound suppurates.	Then cut off what is below the ligature and leave the ends of the thread hanging out from the lower part of the wound, so that it will be easy for you to draw upon it and extract it as the omentum falls away and the wound suppurates.	0.9281358
Mention of the wound that occurs in the intestine.	A note on the wound occurring in the intestine.	0.90391284
But if a small rupture occurs in the intestine, it may be repaired in some people, because I saw a man who had been wounded in his abdomen by a spear thrust, and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and the wound became chronic and became a fistula from which feces and wind came out, so I began to treat him although I did not hope for his recovery, but I continued to treat him gently until he recovered and the place healed.	When a break occurs in the intestine and it is a small one, it is possible, in some men, that it may mend. For I myself saw a man who had been wounded by a spear-thrust in the abdomen. The wound was to the right of the stomach, and, being chronic, became a fistula whence issued faeces and flatus. I set about treating him, though I had no hope of his recovery, and I continued to attend him, and eventually he recovered and the place healed over.	0.8893714
When I saw that the place had healed, I feared that something bad would happen to the patient in his abdomen, but nothing bad happened to him at all, and he remained in the best of his conditions, healthy, eating, drinking, having intercourse, entering the bath, and exercising in his service.	And when I saw that the place had healed over I was afraid for the patient lest some harm should occur in the abdominal cavity; but absolutely no harm arose from it, and he remained perfectly well and healthy, eating and drinking and engaging in coitus and going to the bath and carrying out the duties of his office.	0.86717904
And some of the experienced have mentioned that whenever a small wound occurs in the intestine, it should be stitched in this manner, which is that large-headed ants are taken, then the edges of the wound are brought together, then an ant with its mouth open is placed on the edges of the wound, and when it grips it and tightens its mouth, its head is cut off, for it will stick and not come undone.	Some men of experience have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, it should be sutured in this manner, namely: ants with large heads are taken; then the edges of the wound are brought together and one of these ants is applied by its open jaws to the two edges of the wound, and when it seizes it and closes its jaws then the head is cut off, and it will stick and will not loosen.	0.88356423
Then another ant is placed near the first, and you continue doing this with several ants according to the size of the wound, then you return it and stitch the wound, for those heads will remain stuck in the intestine until the intestine heals and recovers, and no harm will occur to the patient at all.	Then another ant is applied near the first; and you proceed after this manner with a number of ants according to the size of the wound. Then reduce the intestine and sew up the wound; for the heads will remain sticking to the intestine until it is healed up; and no harm will come to the patient.	0.9115995
It may also be possible to stitch the intestine with the thin thread that is pulled from the intestine of the animal attached to it after it is inserted into a needle, which is that the end of this thread is taken from the intestine and pulled gently, then a thin twisted linen thread is tied to its end, then that thread is inserted into the needle with the intestine's thread in it, and the intestine is stitched with it, then returned to the cavity.	The intestine may also be sewn up with the fine suture which is extracted from an animal's gut and sticks to it after being threaded in a needle. The method is that the end is taken of this suture made of gut, well scraped; and to this end is fixed a fine linen thread, twisted, and then that thread is passed through the needle affixed to the suture of animal's gut, with which the intestine is sewn and then replaced in the abdominal cavity.	0.89638454
And this type of stitching with ants and intestine is only by way of hope and expectation.	These kinds of suture, with the ants and with the gut, are by way of a remote hope.	0.6534066
But if the rupture is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, there is no remedy for it and no healing from it at all.	But if the opening be great and wide, and especially if it be in one of the small intestines, there is no technique to deal with it, nor any cure.	0.8871784
