Oh children, I fulfill this treatise for you, which is the last part of the science of medicine. For its completion and because it is written by him, and due to its explanations and declarations, in my opinion, I complete that which I owe to you in this work, which is a segment of action on me, or surgery.
For the operation on oneself is confined in our region and in our times to being private, where there is great risk to the science of it, and its traces remain. There would be no knowledge of it except for a few small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which correct many errors and misconceptions about it, since they are closed to understanding and extend the difficulty of doing it and the art itself.
And it seems to me that I should revive this order of the treatise according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and for it to come with the forms of the tools of cauterization and other instruments of work such as an addition to the declaration, and for its preparation, which is necessary.
The reason why it's hard to find a good surgeon on his own hand in our time is that the art of medicine is extensive. It requires being familiar with anatomy, as described by Galen, understanding the joints and their connection and separation; knowledge about bones, nerves, and muscles, including their number and how they are connected; and familiarity with pulsating and stationary veins, and where they exit from.
And that's why it was said by Hippocrates that in his name is the motion, but more so in his work and especially in the art of the hand.
We have already mentioned this in the introduction of this treatise; whoever does not know what we have said about anatomy will fall into error which could lead to the death of men, as I have seen too many cases like that. Some are formed in this science and abandon it for another science and its experiments.
I have seen a skilled doctor who accidentally caused a scrophulous abscess in the neck of a woman. He incised some arteries of the neck, resulting in great bleeding that led to her death among his patients.
And I have seen another doctor who was almost to execute an operation on a man who had become emaciated in his condition. The tumor was large and spread to him, and he removed the tumor with a piece of bladder tissue. As a result, that man died on the third day.
And I already attempted to remove it, and saw that due to the size of the tumor and the position of the patient underneath him, he would die.
And I have seen another doctor who received payment from the Duke of our land for surgery, and operated on a black soldier whose leg was broken; in his lack of knowledge, he removed the fracture, covering the wound with bandages and stitches of strong thread, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And he then began to heal according to his wishes, he then bandaged, and after some days of rest as I instructed you to remove the bandage; and this happens when the leg and foot are infected with pus, it leads to loss.
And I had already been asked by him, and prepared to remove the bandage, resulting in peace and alleviation of his pains.
However, the corruption was confirmed in the member, so I could not stop it, and it did not cease to spread the corruption within the body of the patient.
And I have seen another doctor who perforated an abscess and became inflamed several days later, causing great suffering to his lord.
This is because the cancerous cauterization is pure of melancholic humor, so it doesn't spread to every part, but only affects a member that suffers from being exposed to everything.
And for this reason, children, it is necessary for you that the operation on oneself be divided into two aspects: one is the operation associated with health, and the other is work in which there are great dangers.
And I have already discussed this in all parts of this treatise where there are operations involving error and fear; so it is necessary for you to observe this and refrain from that, so that the pages do not slander or accuse you unjustly.
And therefore take your weapons for the duty and protection of God, and your patients for their happiness and strength.
And use the best way by God's grace for health and peaceful succession, and leave your terrible diseases with difficult treatment, and keep your weapons of what makes you afraid, so that your rest is in your faith and your name does not abandon you: as more remain in your glory, better in this world and lastly to your sanctity.
Galen has already stated in some of his writings: "Don't treat dangerous diseases with bad doctors, for it's better not to have a name than to have a bad doctor."
And I have completed this treatise according to three chapters.
The treatise begins its division and starts with the first part of the first section. The first chapter ordered for operations within the feet, concerning the forms of instruments and tools of cautery, as well as what is necessary in the execution.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, concerning drying and puncturing, as well as blisters, and arrow extracts, and the resemblance to those, all detailed and organized according to the forms of instruments.
The third chapter, concerning restoration and dislocation, as well as treatment of twist and its resemblance to them; chapter ordered for operations within the feet, and concerning the forms of instruments.
Let me tell you about the quality of the parts to be treated with cautery and their nodules, and at which stage it is prohibited to use cautery.
Therefore, it is said that the discussion about the quality of cautery's part and its nodules is long and tedious, subtle in science, and secretly concealed; much wisdom has already been spoken on this topic by many scholars, and they are in disagreement, so I'm afraid of lengthening this exposition.
And it is said that cautery affects the whole body universally in any matter or mixture of matters, except for two conditions, which are tail joints.
In the tail and head areas where there is dry matter, it will desiccate; some argue that cautery is beneficial for those conditions, while others claim the opposite, stating that cautery is not suitable in maladies which are due to quality and dryness, since fire itself embodies quality and dryness, making it inappropriate for tail and head ailments where dryness should be cured by moisture.
And one who says the opposite argues that with cautery, joints are affected in all head and tail diseases that occur in human bodies. When you compare the body of a person to the state of moisture in its parts to the nature of fire, you find that the body is burned.
And I say according to the argument of that person, whom I have experimented with for several times and discovered through experience.
However, I do not delve into the topic that has already been extensively discussed and practiced in the chapter of cautery exercises, nor have I explored the variety of human bodies or the disposition of illnesses within them, as well as their causes, incidents, and duration periods.
And when it comes to other body parts, there should be no fear for you, especially in damp and wet diseases, which are already familiar to all doctors, they are not divided on this topic. Moreover, regarding the use of cautery in joints, they agree that it is not appropriate in those conditions.
And know, children, that the secret of treatment by cautery with fire and its goodness is about medicaments that burn; because fire itself is simple, its action affects only the member being treated and does not spread to other members except for slight harm.
The action of burning medicines reaches that part in the members to which they are applied, and it strongly encourages difficult healing in the diseased member and greatly hinders it.
And fire, due to its simplicity and the goodness of its substance, does nothing other than spread excessively. We have come to know this through experiments and years of service studying the art in accordance with the truth about the causes; thus, I justify myself for the length of my discourse. If it were not that such knowledge is not found freely accessible to you as a secret concealed by fire, along with the quality of its operation in human bodies and how it expels diseases through this operation, demonstrating a philosophical argument which would sharpen your understanding, I would have refrained from this exposition.
And know, children, that they disagree about the time when it is best to perform cautery and prefer to do so in early spring.
And I say that cautery is convenient at any time, because the harm due to accidental incidents is drowned in the swelling caused by the application of cautery, especially if it's for pain or necessary pains that are severe and cause bleeding; these do not tolerate delay as feared from those causing mischief, which is greater than slight harm entering through the seasons.
And don't let these thoughts concern you, or, children, what they underestimate is only the common people and the village doctors; it's that for the disease treated with cautery, not all times are suitable for recovery, so they take this as a consequence.
And the reason is not just because they are concerned about this; for cautery is nothing but a form of medicine that alters the body and dries out moist conditions which cause pain.
However, excessive cautery exceeds medicine due to the value and effectiveness of its operation and the grandeur of its lord.
It is possible that the disease might return at some point in time, depending on the nature of the body and the location of the disease, its effectiveness, as well as what accumulates within the body from superfluities, and what is consumed by it along with similar causes; unless the disease to which cautery has been applied is a subtle disease involving few superfluities and moist conditions, such as dental cautery for pain and its similarities; then, it's possible that the same pain might not return in the body, but this happens when done in small quantities.
A common medical term is that cautery is the ultimate treatment method in medicine, which is an expert's discourse, not something I comprehend in it, since they believe it isn't a cure that enhances through medicine or any other cause leading to cautery.
The reason is opposite to that; and I understand that cautery is the ultimate treatment method in medicine only when treatments are administered for various illnesses, and those medicines don't cure, rather at the end of the cause they administer cautery, enhancing it towards that. And from this one should know that cautery is the ultimate treatment method in medicine, not according to my understanding which understands common knowledge and many doctors.
And they would say that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they didn't say this simply because of the equality of gold and its inferiority to its substance.
And they would say that the place for cautery doesn't make a scar, as this isn't absolutely true, which I have already experimented and found that it doesn't do this in any body except these others; cautery with iron is good and better than with iron as they said. However, when you do cautery with fire using gold, you haven't been told about it, for its heat depends on the quantity you want according to the intensity of the gold, and what is prepared to receive friction; and if you adjust the fire over it, the gold melts in the fire, and in case in the fire a few sheets are formed so that the artisan can work with that.
And because of this, when doing cautery with iron you should do it more lightly and more precisely according to the nature of the operation.
And I have already organized this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have arranged those of the section within the feet for whoever asks what they want from it.
The first chapter.
This cautery allows the humidity and coldness to cause an unfortunate event of which there are two causes, one being the source of soda and muscle ache, called running, from the head towards the limbs and ear canals, as well as restlessness and tooth pain and throat ache, and universally for all illness caused by coldness, such as paralysis, soda, apoplexy, and resembling those illnesses.
The method of this cautery is as follows, which we first command the patient to be given liberating medicine to the head for three or four nights, according to what suits the patient and their age and their custom.
And then instruct the patient to shave their head with a razor, and then have them sit on a lowered chair and place their head on their own seat.
And then place the palm of your hand near to where his nose touches between his eyebrows. However, when the midpoint where you pointed has been reached, apply the cautery olive to that spot, and heat it according to this form:
And then place that over the heated spot as indicated, in such a way that your hand is slightly constrained as it descends, and you rotate that.
And then lift your hand gently and look at the spot, and if you see that some amount of the head is already exposed, like the size of a pea, then raise your hand. If not, turn your hand on that iron or another one, if it's cooled down, showing you what I've told you to do.
And then take a little salt and dissolve it on the spot and let that rest for three days.
And then place over your burned wrist in the bowl, letting it rest until the crust caused by fire is destroyed. And after that, treat the spot with an ointment from tetrapharmakon until it heals.
And they would say that when the wound from a Roman has opened up, it heals better and more quickly, for which reason it is better and more rejuvenating.
And they would say that the cavity is cauterized inside the ear, and that the cautery should be kept inside until a portion of the specificity of the ear becomes hardened.
And then let that part of the ear that is stuck to it heal.
And they would say that when the cautery reaches the back end, it should push into the ear strongly until the ear falls outwards, and this is the form of applying olive-based cautery: And they consider that from that spot, the vapors of the head escape.
And if the wound is left open for a long time, then it should be treated until it becomes consolidated.
I have not seen these two kinds of cautery in detail, but rather in some people according to fear; then let that be left undone, you must know that it's better for health whenever possible; when the head is exposed by solution of continuity like we've testified in other body parts and especially when the head of the patient has a cool nature.
And the first kind of cautery is more saving and you should use it better; from that one, do that work well for health.
Second chapter.
On the topic of the head cautery.
When chronic and prolonged head pain occurs in the patient, and it is extended throughout their body, using head massages, ear treatments, capillary purges, bandages, gloves, lice combing, and scalp massage are advisable. Especially if a cautery has already been used with another type of cautery that counteracts the effects of those causes, then consider whether the patient's head is strong in nature; and if it isn't excessively heated or exposed to great friction, this cautery will be different than others; he leaves one less for you. And apply the cautery on the top of their head with an internal cautery where the scalp is divided. Incise the scalp and expose the quantity we counted, then apply the cautery with an internal cautery behind the head in the area that is called a vein - it's the spot where suction is taken. And lift your hand in such a way, do not expose the hole, because otherwise the patient experiences different intense pain when compared to other head cauteries.
And I instruct you about this cautery in its place, that it has been said that this type of cautery is more subtle than the one used for head and occipital areas; this is how it works.
Final chapter.
On the treatment of new migraines with cautery.
When pain occurs in the head region or is confined within it, it should be treated with medicinal preparations that lighten the head, and then administered with other treatments, which I have mentioned in the treatments of diseases; if nothing relieves the pain, then the cautery treatment consists of two methods: one using an acute burning medicine, or using iron.
The method of using a burning medicine for cautery involves taking one dollop of alcohol, and then applying it while pinching the extremities from both ears. And apply the area of pain on the temple with a sharp knife, making sure to incise where there is already a spot exposed by the scalp, ensuring that it remains hidden.
And then apply strength on top of it by stopping descented compression, and let that area be free for the space of three hours; and afterwards clean off the alcohol, and let the wound heal over two or three days, and place your palm under water where the location feels warm.
And then treat that with ointment once it is healed.
And if you see this, do as I have written about certain burning medicines in my detailed treatise on burning medicines.
The cautery using iron proceeds in this manner: with fire for the cautery, like this form:
It is called a lock of a key, where the head of the patient resembles a form of a rose, and in the middle part there is a small prominence.
And place your hand over the area of pain, and hold your hand back - so as not to burn the skin which has been exposed - and rotate the small iron piece slowly but quickly.
And if the quantity that gets burned by the specificity of the scalp is such that it reaches most of it, lift your hand so that the artery which has been exposed does not get burned either, so as to prevent blood flow.
And then dip your palm in salt water and place it on the area, let it rest for three days; and afterwards dip your hand in hot water, and after it is healed, treat it with ointment.
And if you notice this, perform the cautery at the end of the lancet as with cautery, and be careful not to incise the artery in this new type of migraine.
Final chapter.
On the treatment of old migraines with cautery.
When you treat migraines as we have said in previous treatments and the divisions of diseases, and if those treatments do not relieve the patient, because their disease does not respond to what we have described for the first cautery using medicine or with fire; then understand that you should ignite the lancet cautery so that it becomes white, meaning place your hand over the area of pain along a line whose length is most of what we have described, or choose this method; and rest your hand for a moment and apply strength to that while incising the skin and going into the skull.
However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuation of the mandible, which should not allow chewing, and that the tongue does not get burned as well as the nerves that control it, and that there be no muscle spasms.
And if it is about guarding against the flow of blood from the artery which is cut, where there is fear in cutting, especially for those who do not know what they are doing and are not cautious; leave the operation to begin as usual with the patient.
And I will come back to remind you of the regulation for blood flow accidents in case of burning the skin, according to your method, in this free location.
And if you see that this disease does not respond to this cautery and when you find the pain tolerable in the patient's head, perform the cautery at the middle of the head as we have recounted, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you see, apply the cautery which we have said to use on the tip of the scab in an artery with a cautery having two blades. This is the better and more precise cautery treatment.
Head or brain area.
关于耳痛的灼烧治疗。
当在耳中感到摩擦引起的疼痛，这是由于缺乏所致，并且与我之前描述的另一种治疗方法一起进行，在这种情况下没有加剧疼痛，那么使用灼烧治疗，这就是我所说的点状烫伤，这种疗法就是它的形状：
然后在灼烧点附近戳孔，让火焰遍及整个耳部，就像轮子被旋转一样，或者在任何时间的电路中，如果疼痛发生在任何位置。 逐渐地使用耳垂上的灼烧方法一点一点地，直到你找到疼痛的位置并尝试。
如果在整只耳垂上的灼烧点，如果在那里疼痛，然后就在那些位置上进行治疗直到它们愈合。
头皮、头部或脑部区域。
关于扭伤的灼烧治疗。
那种扭伤可以通过灼烧治疗来治愈，这种治疗方法并不是用那些通过淤血我们已经在论述病人疾病部分提到的特定种类。
避免使用针对干燥或神经痉挛而适用的灼烧治疗。
当你治疗那种由于关节炎、头痛和发热而引起的扭伤，如果治疗效果不佳时，那么在处理坏病时你应该用三次灼烧法：第一次是在耳垂上，第二个是在其热区域，第三次是连接两个唇部。
然后将您的灼烧器放在坏病的对面，只有在出现健康部分时才会看到缓解。
灼烧的形状是在耳垂的最尖端，比耳朵的顶部稍微高一点，在头部的角上，其长度按照所述部位的长度而定，在灼烧处放置您的手直到该部分被完全燃烧。
这就是灼烧的形状，是外科医生的特殊技艺，其形式在台面上展示出来。 然而，这种方法更加微妙，只需要少许；当你在多余粗糙的部位使用时，只需一点。
然后治疗该区域，在其前面进行处理直到它痊愈。
头、头部或大脑区域。
关于古代中风的灼烧治疗。
当中风是旧病，并通过我们所说的治疗方法进行治疗但效果不佳，且患者没有发烧时，则用四次灼烧对它进行治疗：在头部的所有角上；以及在头部的中间位置（如之前所述）；并在喉咙处。 灼烧的方法是按照之前的说明进行操作。
已经对胃部进行了灼烧；并且在后面更多；然后用您正在处理的方法进行治疗。
头部或大脑区域。
关于由淤血引起的健忘症的灼烧疗法。
确保给病人在早餐时提供大剂量的金银花和能清热解毒的丸剂。
然后刮去患者头部的所有部分，并在服用描述在敷料手册中中心描写的敷料时停止。
然后进行几次灼烧，这种就是灼伤的方式。 按照之前我说明的顺序做这些事情。
因此，如果这些疗法对他的健康有好处；否则，在他头部的最后部分对他进行三次灼烧，这些灼烧是从头部顶部的部分到颈部下面的部分。 在每次灼烧之间暂停大半的时间，然后用这种方式处理已经进行的灼烧。
如果您的身体能够承受疼痛，那么对您进行在中间部位的灼烧；如果感觉更强烈的疼痛，那么在两个角上进行灼烧。
然后在它痊愈时治疗它，并用橄榄油根据前面给出的形式进行涂抹。
头部或大脑区域。
关于对全身的驱虫和缓和疼痛的灼烧治疗。
确保您在头部进行金银花和我们所说的药物处理；然后刮去患者的头，用灼烧在头部的中间位置对它进行治疗，并在头部的所有角上用灼烧，以及在身体最后部分用灼烧，在颈部椎骨处进行三次灼烧。
如果在许多疾病的缓和治疗中，病人能忍受疼痛并且疾病很严重，则用四次灼烧在两个椎骨上进行，并且在灼烧后将您的手放入火中，直到该部分被完全燃烧，然后移开您的手。 然后在它痊愈时处理它，并用橄榄油进行涂抹。
头部或大脑区域。
关于癫痫的灼烧治疗。
只有因淤血引起的癫痫才进行灼烧治疗，其他类型的癫痫则不适用此方法。
因此，确保在开始治疗时用金银花对他的大脑进行处理，并使用我们在描述中提到的另一种治疗方法，当病人体量较大且能承受药物的副作用时。
And if it is a child who does not tolerate medicines, then he administers gargles and mouthwash solutions, altering the diet for several days, with improvement of food digestion.
And then cut the patient's head, and then apply a cautery at that spot in the middle of the head according to the previous method, and another cautery on the back of the head, and on each forehead bone he applies a cautery. And if the patient is strong and tolerates well, then apply the cauteries I've mentioned, with paralysis and body soothing over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And use olive oil for the cautery as it has been described.
If the patient is a child, then apply a subtle cautery according to this method.
Chapter XI.
On the treatment of melancholy by cautery.
When the causes of melancholy are dampness corrupting and weakness in the body, then apply the cauteries we have mentioned in the area for paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is excess reducing to melancholy, and the patient's body is damp, then make them drink what clarifies their brain according to what was previously described in the division.
And then cut the patient's head, and then make a reasonable tortoise shape on it over the circle, and then return that area to the middle of the head.
And if the patient is sixty years old, and has used all parts of their body.
And then place a liniment; it's worth using an old remedy from sheep. And heat that over the fire for a seasoned warmth measured by quantity, which the patient finds sufficient when it increases in them. And then place that at the middle of the patient's head on the circle, let it cool in them until it is cooled.
And do this for the patient throughout the week once, according to their other regimen of drinking until they are healed; or if you wish, apply this by making small punctures as much as possible, otherwise have your hand with a cautery in that orderly manner: this is a type of cautery that moistens the brain equally.
And then place that cooked piece of meat in fat or in gray mutton grease.
Chapter XII.
On the treatment of descending water by cautery.
When it is confirmed that the beginning of water has entered the chest due to the symptoms described in the division, then start and give the patient what clarifies their head, and keep him/her away from all dampness.
And let that sugar be dissolved in water for several days.
And command the patient to raise their head, and apply a cautery on it in the middle of the head; and then apply two cauterizations in each temple if it is the beginning of the descent of water into both lungs, or one on either side if it is the beginning of water in one lung.
Apply the cauteries to all veins and arteries that are left from the chain; and place those cauteries in that line at the breadth of the temples.
And watch for any bleeding when it is being treated by cautery; and if you see that the patient's bleeding, hold back with some medicine which could be suitable to use.
And I will come about knowledge regarding the extraction of arteries and the removal of those, as well as caution against bleeding.
And some times it is treated by cautery on the neck leaving two bones with two cauterizations sequentially produced.
Chapter XIII.
On the treatment of old tears.
When tears from the lungs are old and spreading through veins and arteries in the prominent part of the head outside and it is confirmed that this is due to excessive phlegm, then apply a cautery with the one we recounted in the chapter on the beginning of water affecting the lungs, and apply a cautery in the middle of the head and two cauterizations at each temple leaving two temples, and two cauterizations at each neck leaving two bones. And if you have difficulty with addition, then apply a cautery over the entire length of the ribcage in the area at the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter XIV.
On the treatment of nasal fetidness.
When treating it with what we have said in the division and your medicine does not improve, then prepare and give three nights of milk to the patient; and then cut the head of the patient and apply a mixture of olive oil and cautery. And then apply a cautery with a thorn oil on each eyebrow leaving some hair, and two small cauterizations.
And watch that the artery does not burn there.
And this is how the thorn oil cautery should be applied.
Chapter XV.
On the treatment of the lungs' eyelid by cautery for soothing.
When the eyelid of the lung is soothed due to illness or dampness, then apply a cautery on that eyelid using this lunar cautery. This is how it should be:
And if you, cauterize that above the two eyebrows with a small point of the cautery on all sides, and let them extend to the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the eyebrow.
And do not press too hard with your hand on the cautery, but according to how much of the inner part of the eyelid is heated.
Chapter XVI.
Regarding the cautery of the eyelid when the skin turns into parts inside and at the palm of the hand.
When the skin of the hand turns into parts inside and when it touches the palm, if you place the hand, apply a cautery in two ways: a hot cautery or one with burning medicine.
If you apply a hot cautery to them, ask the patient to display their skin like those who undergo circumcision, until they are extended and equalized; and if you place that hand at its origin, then strengthen the hands of the patient with one bend so that it does not hurt as long as the skins are born.
Then when they are born and equalized, then place the head of the patient on your seat, and approach to mark on the eyelid of the hands with a sign that resembles a pine needle figure, and let the beginning of the sign be near the skin.
And approach with about half an inch in thickening in album from urine or in pus of pustule on the hand.
And approach lighting the cautery which has this form.
And approach cauterizing on the figure that was marked, little by little in spots visible, while burning the surface of the skin which resembles a pine needle entirely outwardly.
And a sign of health in the operation is that you see the eyelid of the hand already contracted and the skin of the patient elevated above the puncture of the hand.
And then raise your hand and let that for three days, and approach to place the edge on him in a bandage until the scab is formed. And attend to that with ointment until it heals.
And if for any cause there returns to their birth parts and the eyelid is softened, then do another operation on that whole again as you did initially.
And if the skin is on the eyelid, then cauterize that until it rises to its natural place and is equalized so that the skin does not hurt the hand.
And the cauterization with burning medicine is that you ask the patient to display their skin until they are extended and equalized, and approach it being done by a strip of cloth in the shape of a pine needle.
And take some known soap and live ash for an ink. I., o let us do this, and approach mixing these ashes with water, applying it quickly without cooling; and then spread this over the cloth which is made like a pine needle shape, place that on one hand or both; and place your patient's head on your seat.
And place the above on the medicine and press that a little but do not hurt under which the patient feels the sensation of the medicine, which sensation is in him as from fire.
And when you notice that the patient feels a biting sensation, then remove the medicine and place it on your seat; and when the biting stops, then reapply the medicine with water; and then consider if the eyelid has been lifted as it is cleaned from the scab by fire or incision, which is now done. And if it does not return to that part of the medicine on the spot where the medicine was applied and does not burn under until your operation is equalized and the hand is contracted again.
And approach to place the edge on him with a bandage until the scab of adjustment is eradicated, and then attend that with a final ointment or another until it heals.
And for this, you must preserve vigilance in your operation that the medicine does not fall from it on the hand, and if the eyelid is softened within several days and some cause of skin pain nears the hand, then apply your medicine to that place which makes the eyelid soft, precisely as at the beginning, and attend him until he heals.
And this is the shape of a pine needle.
Know that men's hands vary according to size and minuteness, so according to this your contraction is made.
And let there be no disguise of the way towards rectitude towards that toward which study has been devoted in this art.
Chapter XVII.
Regarding the cautery of fistula that is in the tear duct of the hand.
When you treat fistula with what we have said in the divisions of diseases and do not apply your treatment, then you should know how to cauterize that according to this method: ask the patient to place their head on your seat, and make one of their ministers hold their head between your hands so that it is neither hurt nor disturbed under their head.
And approach placing the edge on thickened in urine paste or pus of pustule on the hand of the patient.
And then heat up the cautery tool which this is in the form of:
Which is curved, like the shape of a cane or a bird's wing, from one end where the cautery is made.
And if you see, it penetrates into the other end. And if you want to pull it out like trying to catch something.
But whoever is curved is better for this work.
And if there's an opening, press the fistula if it's opened, and cleanse and dry that area with it. And if it is not opened, then open that and extract the pus from it.
And place your hand on the patient with the heated cautery which should be well lit, and hold that near to where you are going to remove from the nostril a little bit of the edge of the cautery, so as not for your hand or the patient to become agitated, then stop the cautery at the back part of the nostril and burn it.
And thus if during the start of your cautery it enters into the mouth, that's good; and otherwise, then heat up the cautery again once or twice if needed; and leave that there for three days, and then place a bandage around it with a layer of dried grease inside so that it becomes healed.
And if it has passed more than ten days and is not healed, then place a piece of corrosive acid medicine inside the mouth until the bone is exposed and scrape according to what seems appropriate in your judgement.
And another way to cauterize a fistula that some of the early doctors suggested: take to the location of the fistula and make an incision there and place close above that cut a thin layer as its shape is; then put inside that a bit less than one unit of melted lead; hold your hand properly with good control, so as not to alarm the patient because the melted lead does not go into the nostril; and cover the nostril of the patient with a bandage dipped in egg white or water, when you place lead around the fistula it heals that miraculously through healing.
And if the healing of the fistula with what we have said about the cautery and the treatment is good, that's fine; otherwise, then it's necessary to administer medicine up the nose and reduce the fistula into the nasal cavity according to where it naturally belongs.
Chapter XVIII.
Regarding the cautery of the cut on the foot.
Wounds that appear to result in cuts, particularly in the labia, occur more often in children's labia.
So when you treat those cuts with what we have told you about the divisions and do not deepen your treatment, then heat up this small knife according to this form that we show:
And make the cavity according to the thinness of the blade.
And place that initial cut in those cuts so that the cautery reaches the base of the cuts.
And then treat it with bandages until it heals.
Chapter XIX.
Regarding the cautery of a fistula in the mouth.
When there's pus in the uvula or on the palate or at the roots of the teeth, and then it swells up, and after that it bursts open, and becomes old, causing inflammation; this leads to a fistula formation. You should treat this condition without deepening the treatment.
And if the healing is removed and it heals, that's fine; and otherwise, then it's necessary to discover the location and expose the infected bone according to what seems appropriate in your judgement.
Chapter XX.
Regarding the cautery of teeth and soothing of the gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and teeth are affected, treating those with medicines without causing complications, then position your head over where it should be in relation to this situation. Heat up the cautery tool like what you will do similarly, making sure that when you place your hand on the tooth and insert the heated cautery quickly into its location, your head is just slightly inside so that the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And then raise your hand, and repeatedly apply the cautery for several times as you wish.
And then have the patient drink water from a salt bowl and keep that for an hour, and then you can stop that. In this way, the decayed tooth is hardened, inflamed gum is soothed, and dampness in the mouth is dried out.
Chapter XXI.
On the treatment of toothache through cautery.
When toothache is due to cold or worms, or if the treatment doesn't respond to medicine, then treat with cautery in two ways: either apply it near the roots of the teeth, or apply it directly on the fire.
Cautery near the roots is when you take cow's roots and boil them in iron vessel. Then cut off a piece and wrap it around the tip of the needle, and then immerse that in boiling water. Place that over the painful tooth as quickly as possible until it gets cold.
And then apply this several times so that the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you see this, soak wool or cloth in the boiling water above mentioned, and place that over the painful tooth, and place iron that is burning inside so that the heat of the iron reaches the root of the tooth.
However, the treatment with fire is that you wait for the embers or iron to heat up, and if there's any roughness in its core, so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
And then ignite the cautery to what shape it will come in, and place that on the tooth while keeping your hand underneath until the cautery gets cold; do this several times when the pain starts to subside or on the following day.
And when the patient feels the heat of that cautery filling their mouth with good water and keeps it for an hour, then they should drink; this is how the cautery works.
And apply cautery to whatever area you see as necessary according to what is possible for you.
This is the form of the cannula:
Chapter XXII.
On the treatment of hernias through cautery.
When hernias are due to phlegm and fluids that do not respond well to digestion through medicines, and you see a slight improvement in their digestion, then ignite the cautery with this form: having two hubert tips so that the smoke from one end should be directed towards the other end of the cautery. Place the ignited cautery on that lump for one time, and if you need further applications, do it while its heat reaches the root of the lump.
And if the lump is small, then place the cautery according to the size of the lump. Lay it out for three days and then rest on it with a moistened cloth while letting what the fire has burnt remain there.
And then treat that area with ointment, bandages, and cloths until it is healed.
Chapter XXIII.
On the treatment of inflammation and constriction through cautery.
When moisture enters the channel of the lung, especially when this is due to cold constitution, you should guide that person to start with medicine laxatives at meals, and then treat by applying cautery near the navel in the area where the discomfort is felt.
And remember, do not let the cautery reach the navel or don't burn too much of their body with this procedure but only a little.
And treat that area by applying another cautery near the junction of the neck and at the lower part of the spine of the person. And the treatment for the person's elbow follows the same manner as previously described.
And then treat that area with whatever was previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter XXIV.
On the treatment of lung illness and cough through cautery.
When cough and lung illness are due to moisture, and the patient doesn't have fever or scabies, but it is old cough, then apply two cauteries on the sternum in the areas where discomfort is felt in the back; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples. And for elbow treatment, follow the previous method for that.
And if you want, do your cautery-pointing with the type of cautery that is called "puncta", its form which we previously described in the point-pressing method for ear pain.
And make points inside the cay; and then treat that area by applying what was previously mentioned until it heals.
And for each cautery, have three points; for that treatment you can make three cauteries in this manner:
Chapter XXV.
On the treatment of pinkeye, which is at the head of the eye.
When the head of the eye is dislocated due to lubricating moisture and does not return immediately in its usual way, you should return its dislocation while it's still in the state where it usually returns. Then gently move it so that it gets back into place as we have demonstrated. If it needs to be pushed back further, first reduce the dislocation, then have the patient lie on his or her two hands or palms up, and lift the neck which is at the inner corner of the eye towards the forehead with your left hand fingers touching the part above those points of your left hand if the joint is dislocated inward.
And prepare two points for the cautery; this is how it works:
And apply the cautery between where it penetrates into the other side; and here comes the diagram of the cautery treatment when using two points.
And some operations are adjusted according to this count and for these reasons, there are eight cauteries.
And place your hand over the cautery to apply salt, and then attach the patient to the bed, so that the body is not disturbed for some time until it is comforted.
And if the dislocation is in parts above and the fracture is made this way, then apply the cautery to the muscle around the cautery or on bone points, where the joint is confirmed and moisture is increased, thus healing the patient.
Chapter XXVI.
On the treatment of gastric cautery.
When cold and moisture accumulate in the stomach, causing an excess of its constitution leading to multiple swelling issues, if you continue with these methods of treatment without addressing them, then it's understood that the patient should be lying on their back with arms and legs extended. And apply three cauterizations: one to the feet with a quantity equivalent to one finger in a gastric cautery, and with two cauterizations at both sides of the stomach area, allowing for triangular-shaped marks; and extend those that are not properly adjusted to produce oozing.
And if the depth of the cautery corresponds to the two thirds of the thickness of the stomach wall.
And if the appearance of the cautery matches this form it is an addition, and if you wish, apply a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; this is a cautery according to the circular form as shown here:
And the stomach should be cauteryed until it's scared by that part of the cautery: and you apply points on the stomach according to the amount of substance in salt, and then apply the cautery around those points; and cure that with the treatment which precedes its healing.
Chapter XXVII.
On the treatment of gastric cautery.
When experiencing stomach pain due to coldness or moisture or excessive wind leading to an imbalance through excess egress from its normal constitution, if the patient is treated with what we have discussed and no recovery occurs, then it's understood that the patient should be lying on their back, applying three cauterizations according to this form and half of this quantity over the stomach area between the hips, in the anatomical position.
And let the space between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger, and make the cauteries according to the length of the body straight.
And don't hesitate with your hands on the cauterization points.
And if the amount of substance that is applied corresponds to the majority of the stomach's constitution, and it is not properly adjusted; and if the patient is standing on their feet; and if they are not standing, then lie down, which already extends their limbs, and lift their arms.
And it is within your capability to perform these cauteries with surgical knives, when you have subtlety and caution in the art.
And remember not to overdo the cautery process, and ensure that the substance of the entire stomach is applied so it reaches throughout the body, especially where the stomach is subtle; be aware of this.
Chapter XXVIII.
On piercing and treating an abscess in the stomach with a cautery.
When experiencing excitement or an abscess in the stomach and you want to know if that abscess is within the stomach flesh or in its lining, then if it's within the stomach flesh, the patient experiences a significant drop in weight and increased pain intensity.
And if it's within the stomach lining, then the pain is intense and frequent, often causing doctors to tire from treating him.
Then understand that the patient should be lying on their back; and place your hand over the location of the abscess with salt; and prepare the cautery which is similar to a needle, as its shape was described in another page. And apply the cautery until all of the stomach is heated up, until it reaches the cholecyst, and until the patient feels relief.
And treat that by curing the other abscesses until he/she is healed.
And don't use this method of cautery except for those that are studied in the art of medicine and in which various stomach maladies have been recognized; however, sometimes some operations might cause discomfort on this procedure, but remember that you should follow this one, and it's better.
Chapter XXIX.
On the treatment of ulcers with cautery.
The ancient cauteries used for the arteries in ulcers are performed according to this manner, and you should take this from the arteries of aristocracy: a long, dried artery, which is found, and it should be as thick as your finger.
And you submerge that in oil and heat that there, and place a cautery over that spot which is between the continuation of the sternum and the rib cage; and with two cauterizations apply this way, one declining towards the part where the beard is left, and with two cauterizations at that point declining between the fifth rib and the spine, one declining towards behind; and another cautery in the middle location of the foot; and another on the stomach, and three cauterizations at those points behind; and a cautery in that place which is between the two shoulders, and two cauterizations from each side of the foot, let this cautery be placed where there are two shoulders.
And do not remove your hand from the cautery, but rather in front of the patient's suffering is it that you should apply it.
And they would say that some ancient ones, among the men who use a kind of iron cautery resembling rays and flames, place that in that spot which is between the ribs, until it reaches from that to that soreness and becomes healed, as we have said about that soreness in the stomach.
And within this puncture with cautery there is not much fear, for you have just experienced it in the place of the fistula where healing does not occur.
Chapter XXX.
On the cautery of the liver.
When you treat liver disease as we have discussed for treatment in the division and do not apply your cure to it, then apply cautery on it according to three ways, all of which are curved, of which one is to make three or four lines along the length of the liver according to the shape of the liver's cauteries, which I have described previously.
And between each cautery there should be the width of a finger or less, and the method of the cautery is the same method that we have described for the stomach's cautery equally.
And do not remove your hand from the cautery; and the patient should lie on their back.
And there is another way of applying cautery, that being you ignite the cautery with two streams of flame, which we have described in the chapter on muscle dislocation, and raise the patient's body in a position where it can reach the liver from the left side without moving.
And make your elevation as you raise the body according to the length of the torso, so that the cautery is applied according to the width of the body.
And then insert both streams inside, ignite the fire, in that place where you enter the body from the other side.
And then remove the cautery; and thus four cauterizations have been done.
And if you see it, apply a three-stream cautery.
And then you treat the wound of the cautery if it has left behind too much discharge for too many days; as often this is considered more important than other previous causes in treatment.
Chapter XXXI.
On the cautery of dropsy.
Cauterize only in the arms, not in any other part in dropsy.
When you treat dropsy as we have discussed in the division and do not apply your cure to it, then follow this procedure: cautery four times around the umbilical circuit, one on the stomach, another on the spleen, another on the liver, two more between the shoulders, one on the right side of the foot, and another on the stomach. And the depth of the cautery should be about the width of the body.
And then smooth out the wound until it can freely allow discharge for a long time.
And do not evacuate the patient from treatment near the cautery as this would cause two types of misunderstanding for you, and it should be treated with medical assistance.
The shape of the cautery for that which is applied to the abdomen should be like a keyhole according to its previous form, and for the one which is applied over the two, it should resemble an olive in accordance with its previous form.
Chapter XXXII.
On the cautery of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are swollen in dropsy and filled with watery fluid, you should apply the cautery to the feet above the elbows, even between the wrist and finger bones. Lift your hand towards the cautery without twisting it; then raise your hand, do not move it completely, as the watery fluid will drain out.
The shape of the cautery is as follows: Then make two cauterizations on each thigh, and for any thing done, apply a cauterization at the end of the knife-like part. And make the cauterizations along the length of the thigh: keep this one at the knee and the other in the middle of the thigh; and on each thigh, two cauterizations.
And smooth out the opened wound for a long time so that some water can drain from it.
And treat those causes as we have described them.
Chapter XXXIII.
On the cautery of belly flesh.
When belly flesh is due to fomentation and dampness causing congestion, these are the digestive and retentive qualities that are in the stomach and intestines, it is treated as we have discussed for treatment without applying anything else, and sometimes the patient suffers from a vertuity-causing cautery, then apply large cauteries on their stomach according to what preceded in the stomach's cautery, with the circulatory cauterization and four small cauterizations around the subtle umbilical circuit, with keyhole-like subtle cauterization; and apply cauterization on the liver area over a large spot, or two cauterizations.
And if you see the excess of dampness and the patient tolerating it, then apply a cautery to that above the navel and on the intestines, and strengthen him by adjusting several cauteries around the stomach and before the inguinal area, which is the perfect cure for youth illness in which you do not err.
Chapter 34
On the cautery of old hemorrhoids.
When dealing with old hemorrhoids or those filled with thick fluids or corrupt dampness, which were treated as we explained in the division and do not provide your cure, then apply a cautery to three spots on the pus left behind by the two small and triangular areas. And perform the second cauterization above the umbilical cord line for two dits.
And if you determine that the stomach of the person is chilled and their food is not properly digested, and their face times are swollen, then apply a large cautery on the stomach according to what has been previously stated; and perform one cauterization on the chest, and another on their belly. Do the same with the elbow area, and let each cauterization rest for some time in an open space, and shortly after cure them until they are healed internally.
Chapter 35
On the cautery of the testicles near the location of their absorption.
When you remove the testicles, then you apply the prepared cautery that resembles a ray's tail. Place the burning part of it on that testicle in the process of being removed, and complete your hand's movement so that the cautery reaches to the opening of the vein from which the sperm flows.
And do this one or two times, if the testicles are too large, then apply to each according to what we have recounted, and shortly after cure those with what you give them of ointment until they are healed.
And if you apply a large cautery to the surface area, it is more effective in youth.
Chapter 36
On the cautery of fistulas that naturally occur in the parts of the body.
When nature does not comply with the procedure we recommended in its location, and the patient is frightened by this, let them be cured through a cautery.
So when some disease manifests in nature as an old and infected fistula with pus, which is the source that should be treated gently, you must apply a subtle cure to it. Then understand the depth of the lesion based on this indicated method.
And apply the cautery that resembles the shape of a ray. And place the burning part of the cautery in this fistula, according to the depth of the probe.
And apply the cautery repeatedly inside until those corrupted bodies are burned out, once or twice or three times, according to your need.
And be careful not to burn nerves or veins. Or if the fistula goes towards the bladder or the intestine, then be cautious of all those areas; and do this only when the fistula is in a fleshly location and you consider it non-penetrating.
And take care of that area until it is healed.
And if the place is sealed, and all materials are removed from it, but remains like this for a long time, then know that it has been completely healed.
And if the substances are not yet removed from you, then know that it is penetrating or in your own body they have become corrupted, or comes from those causes which will bring recurrence in its location.
Chapter 37
On the cautery of the bladders.
When in the bladders there is pain through cold or due to excessive wind, and the chest below the belly is hardened, then know that you should apply a cautery on the bladders with a cauterization over each bladder, followed by a cauterization of the elbow area where you seek recurrence.
And firmly apply a second cautery on the slightly smaller area, so that three linear cauterizations come about, and thus they are more effective in youth.
Chapter 38
On the cautery of the bladder.
When there is debility and softening in the bladder due to cold and dampness such that the belly does not retain urine, then apply a cautery on the area just below the bladder, starting from where the skin begins at the navel. Apply one cauterization on the right side part, and another on the left side of it.
And the length of each cauterization according to the depth of the foot's marks; apply one cauterization with a cauterization on the lowest part of the two sides; or make two cauterizations if it is necessary.
And do the elbow cauterizations as instructed.
Chapter 39
On the cautery of the womb.
When there is coldness and dampness in the womb, thereby preventing pregnancy, and the periods become corrupted for her, and their induction is delayed, and pain occurs during childbirth, then know that this place should be treated with three cauterizations around the umbilical region, as we have instructed for the bladder cautery; and do so on the area just below the two sides, or make two cauterizations there, and perform elbow cauterization.

And in all cautery procedures, do not end the process until you have left the cautery as long as it burns nerves or major arteries, and thus you are above injuring or constricting the patient.
And I have seen one or two of those who would apply the cautery to the cavity and lastly in the process of cautery, and the bedfire inflamed within causing the tumor to achieve the foot, and was perforated and corrupted throughout the foot. And soon there is a strong belly solution, and thus death occurs.
And if the pain is in two parts at once, cauterize each one according to this manner.
And it is said by the wise in the process of applying an iron cautery, like this method: make as if it was a circle of iron where its circumference is about half a palm; and place its opening according to the size of a bone of a finger or perhaps a little less.
And inside that circle is another tool; and leave the space which is between them equal to the thickness of your foot; and those circles are opened in two parts; and the length of those cuts is about half an inch or one inch, and make in those marks on iron decently arranged in the circles; and this is its form:
And let it be heated in the fire until it heats up and sends sparks out, and let it be placed over the part of the iron, the patient standing on their left side. And then cauterize that with three round cauterizations in one go.
And then let that rest for three days; and then plaster that with a paste, and let the opened wound heal without too many days; and then treat that with ointment until it is healed.
Diagnosing Al-Zahrawi: oh, children, for this type of cautery we have used it due to the lack of attention towards him, and thus we have found those who care about him.
The number of iron cauterizations you endure, find that place in yourself.
The number of cauterizations that adhere to medicines is that you make two circles having a hole in each where the smell of iron escapes; and let the length of the edges be about half an inch or perhaps those.
And if the space which is between each one the size of the thickness of your finger; and make them below and above, and let them contain themselves among each other according to this form:
And then place your hand over the part of the iron where the patient stands on their left side, and hold your hand over the part of the iron; and take hot water and put it between two circles, and let its quality be like small fire, and keep that for about an hour, and let the patient feel the biting and adjusting - as if they are bitten by fire - until the biting ceases.
And then raise your hand towards the instrument and wipe off all the hot water from the entire iron with cold water.
And then let that rest for three days and place the plaster over it until you see the color of the adjustment deepened, and let this be like several days, and there will be no more pus coming from your wound; this is further in youth.
And then treat that with ointment until it is healed.
And if the pain extends into the thigh or the leg, make the patient stand in that position where contains water as it is done with the iron.
And this is the method of hot water, and I have already written about that in my treatise on the rectification of medicines. Recipe of alkali and of fire not extinguished from both by one part, and mix them in a new wave where the part left is pierced through a small tool, according to the amount that enters into your iron.
And place the bottom of the wave another wave again, pour over that live alkali and earth with lukewarm water which absorbs them by one finger, and when you squeeze those in your own hand well, let the foam that escapes from your sharp water in the part left to the new wave.
And then adjust all that water, pour it over fresh live earth and new alkali, which will then exhibit strong corrosive action, this is administered in powdery surgical treatments and in cauterizations of other limbs, this operation is done with fire.
And among some medicines that are cauterized extensively, like tumeric and honey and earth with fat in it, let them be mixed together.
And Gaulia recounting of a procedure from the ancients for operation and healing which treats pain in the leg and sciatica, praises this method greatly and says that no other treatment is necessary, and that it becomes healthy all at once as recommended, and that he feels good and is well already with that.
And it should be close to certarragi vert if that is not found, use a recent fig; and let it be finely ground with a little oil and placed in water where the pain is, or in the thigh or leg, and tie it.
And let it be left for about three hours or until the patient notices improvement in their condition.
And then put it on fire and when the patient's body has reddened, introduce that into the sun where the pain disappears and they become healthy.
And know that it should not be used by anyone with a cautery on these medicines, but rather close to the body's purification.
And it is known that when the goat has a vein rupture and there is a bleeding, it is cauterized, which benefits the patient more; and do this with the cautery according to this manner: take wool and soak it in antiseptic oil, then place it between the chest and ribs.
And it is necessary to make an incision in the dried goat and apply the flame inside where the wound has been made, with charcoal; then place it on the wool and let it burn until the skin stretches. And continue with this, and do not stop doing this until the sensation of the bite reaches inside the water and rests on the pain.
And this way of cautery is called cattle's cautery.
Chapter 42.
On the cauterization of two pains.
Some pains occur in both due to various causes, such as injury or impact, or due to excessive purification, and through causes similar to those, by the infusion of wet and rough matter.
And cautery is not for cuts but only in this single type which is done through the effusion of rough matter.
Then know that the purification of the intestines is with pills and resembles them, which are made over each of the two areas where there is pain in three lines according to the width of it. Since signs appear in every line you apply a cautery or more, according to the quantity that the patient can tolerate and its effectiveness.
And do the cautery with pointed cautery.
And if you wish, apply three or four points of cautery on each side as follows:
Chapter 43.
On the cauterization for the beginning of gallbladder issues.
Some common symptoms due to this illness in infants; and signs of the beginning of it in children are that they occur over their body, causing swelling and elevation, as well as movement.
And you can feel in the lower part of the spinal column in infants where it begins to rise above other vertebrae.
And when you perform this and wish to stop it, then apply the cautery around that in the following manner: Let the cautery cover all parts of the spinal column equally.
And if you wish, apply the pointed cautery around the spinal column in two or three lines. And let the points be placed between them.
And afterwards, treat the area until it is healed with what we have said.
Remember that cautery should not be administered in jaundice caused by muscle spasms of nerves.
Chapter 44.
On the cauterization for gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold fluids that are contained in every part of the body, and when it causes pains in the feet, this is customarily called gout by doctors.
And how does gout caused by friction get cured using a method of cure and not leaving the pains untreated, it is treated with cautery.
And what you do is apply the cautery around for purification in the area of the joint on each side as cauteries.
And use olive oil, which has this form:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And if the pains rise inside each hollow or to other joints, and these signs are observed, then apply three or four points of this olive oil cautery on each hollow.
And if you apply these cauteries that are necessary to you, then apply the cautery and do not press too hard on your hand before it, just around the size of the hairpin.
And if the pains are inside each hollow and two, then administer the cautery which we have said in its chapter.
And if the pains are only in their chests and it is called gout, then pierce in the area around the veins as they move, pierce those two lines.
And if the pains remain in their thumbs, then pierce around the veins on each finger and over the pulse of your hand.
And if the pains rise close to several days in the elbows or muscles, then apply the points around all parts of the joints.
And do not allow the intestines to move and receive medicines well; for if they are given good movement and warmth is provided by this cautery, then purification will occur, God help us.
Chapter 45.
On the cauterization for ruptures.
When there is rupture in the arteries and discussing the hernias in front of the opening to the abdomen, as this begins from here, then know that you should instruct the patient to leave their food for the day and use gentle causes so that the egressing wound of their stomach.
And continue guiding the patient between your hands on their back, and command that they keep their breath while it is being processed or when the opening or hernia appears.
And then return that to your fingers, and try to rupture it on the bones of the ankle with a signal indicating the end which is similar in size to half-circle parts of the body's lower parts.
And then heat up the cautery like this:
So that sparks are produced and glowing embers form. And then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity and place your hand on the spot to prevent the intestine from protruding.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, and had another servant on their legs, and another one on their chest to hold their hands.
And then place the cautery on that mark with your hand and the tip of the cautery straight, enter that into where you feel the bones of the ankle in the middle of your field; repeat this for another time if you haven't succeeded in the first attempt up to the bone.
And observe wisely the consistency of the hernia when you are about your cautery operation; do not burn that hernia too much because it could cause death or other severe harm to the patient.
And know that when you use the cautery near the bones, do not touch them directly; if you do so, your operation will be incorrect.
And know that the size of the cautery for children should be fine depending on their size and measurement.
And then, over the next three days care for the site of the cautery with a poultice until the scab from the heat has hardened.
And continue to treat that with other ointments until it heals.
And let the patient rest on their back for ten days until the site and wound are sealed.
And know that you should feed the patient according to the duration of their recovery time; this stretches their stomach and ensures that the hernia does not protrude due to the effort of healing.
And when it is time to remove this after about ten days, administer medication properly and have them rest for another ten days.
And make sure they have rest from labor and plenty of food and drink, as well as vigorous activities; when they use this complete regimen of treatment, they will fully recover.
And I will tell you the treatment for ruptures in other parts of the abdomen, starting from the beginning, and when you don't allow them to rest, then cauterize that rupture with a round point cautery according to your patient's size; this is like removing a segment of it as if it were another part. And then treat that as we have said, and do not adjust it.
And already tell about certain first things where the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery in this manner, because it is indicated like so:
And draw a line that extends past the width at the bottom of the rupture, and another line above it. And place your hand with a triangular cautery; for the first cautery, make it smaller and better.
Chapter forty-six.
Regarding the treatment of torsion.
When pain persists in any limb due to dislocation or impact, and if the pain continues for a long time without showing improvement with medicine, then know that you should treat it with a pointed cautery.
And size and shape of the limb dictate how to use the cautery, along with its strength and development, as well as the location of the twist and pain.
If the first cautery results in recovery, then it's good; otherwise, apply another round of cautery. For usual pains, punctures are made on the limb closest to the patient, as you should find those punctures with a cautery until the patient recovers.
Chapter forty-seven.
Regarding the treatment of leprosy.
Some areas may require cautery treatments for several months, and especially if the type of leprosy is caused by putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And if you want to cauterize that area, assess whether it is contagious and treat it with the remedy we described in the division, without delay or hesitation. If you're concerned about the patient's health as corruption could spread throughout their body and affect their entire structure, then cauterize that area on top of their head: one in the middle of the head, and another slightly above it; place the forehead at the end of the hairline; apply two around each ear; and have one behind, on the neck or jaw.
And place your hand with the cautery for a little while until it starts to exert pressure in the bone, and if there are any dislocated lumps, so that their expiration of thick vapors is relieved; then cauterize on the lump according to what is necessary.
And if leprosy has already spread to the back and is clearly visible, then know that you should cauterize that area with those cauteries we have mentioned in the head; apply a cautery on the end of the nose, two cauteries on each earlobe, two on both collarbones, five on the ribs, one large near the ankle, one on the sternum, and two on each elbow. Cauterize that area over all joints of these and his feet, as well as every single heel, and over each of his knees, and over each of his elbows, and over each knuckle, and over each of his kneecaps, and over muscles, and over tendons near his ankle; cauterize that area on all joints of the mentioned parts and his feet, as well as over every single heel.
And protect yourself from the nerves that are on the foot, do not damage those.
And some burns are treated with a cautery on the bones of the ankle and another on the mouth of the stomach, and another on the intestines.
And know that the more precisely you apply cauteries, the better and faster they heal. And know that in a patient with a fever, there is no pain from the cautery, just like when it's raining cats and dogs, for their body has become numb.
And know that the size of the cauteries should be large or small according to the limbs and joints, depending on what is suitable for the tools used.
And then treat the cautery with ground bee's wax mixed with honey and another treatment until it heals.
Chapter 48.
On the application of cauteries in fever.
When any limb is swollen or numb and is treated with medicines, bandages, but if it does not heal, then you apply cauteries to that swollen limb according to the size of the limb or its diminution.
And let your cautery penetrate slightly into the heat of the blood vessel. And then treat that with ointment until it heals.
And sometimes burns are treated by applying to certain fevers which affect the majority and the feet, as well as the spinal column of both sides, and remove the heat of the nerves that belong to that limb, and it is refreshed by the fever.
Don't guess about this unless that person is knowledgeable in the anatomy of limbs and the exit of nerves throughout moving parts of the body.
Chapter 49.
On the application of cautery to those that are whitened.
When warts are old and do not respond to any of the medicines' ointments, then you apply a cautery on that with a slight touch according to the amount of heat in the blood vessel inside. The whiteness and color of it should be renewed, and its color should change.
And then treat that with bee's wax and lentils mixed with olive oil, and with leaves of arnica, or with poultice from dove's dung or with poultice from apricot kernels. Each from each type should be used in equal parts, all mixed together, and apply a plaster thereon until it heals.
Chapter 50.
On the application of cautery to children.
When cancer begins and you want it to stop, then apply the cautery in a circular manner around it as it turns.
And the wise say that it should be treated with the inner part of the cautery at the center; however, I have not seen this way before, fearing it might be infected, and I have seen some burns in this manner.
And the pus that is outside should be treated with a circle of cautery as we have said, or with small pieces of cautery.
Chapter 51.
On the application of cautery to abscesses.
When any abscess takes longer to mature, and this is due to the excessive formation of pus, or due to the patient's old age in decrepitude, having few strengths, or due to time, and you want to hasten its maturation; then apply small pieces of cautery in a circular manner around it; and smooth that which will facilitate its maturation.
And if you want the perforation of it with cautery, then heat the cautery in this shape: and leave that at the center of the abscess until the blood penetrates.
And if the cautery is placed in that place where pus is left, because it relieves the body's arm; and then treat that until it heals.
Chapter 52.
On the application of cautery to corroding (possibly meaning ulcers or other skin conditions).
Corrosion is an infectious spread in the limb, which eats away at that as wood burns when it is eaten by fire.
So if you see this corrosion in the place that suffers from heat, then apply small and large pieces of hot cautery as it is convenient in the place where there is corrosion.
And then apply cautery to all parts until you eradicate all the corrosion without causing any harm to it.
And then leave that for three days, and place on the treated areas some oil mixed beforehand until all scabs have been eradicated and all corruption.
And then treat it with meat-producing ointments.
And if after three days the healthy meat grows in what is not corrupted, it's good; but if not, then repeat this process on that which has been corrupted in the affected areas.
And corrosion is treated for some days with an acute medicine, which is half on the site of cautery. However, cautery from heat in pus produces a mild youthfulness.
And I have already described the treatment of this with acute medicine in the section, therefore take that when you have prepared it for him.
Chapter 53.
On the application of cautery to lumps and other similar conditions.
Warts that appear on the affected parts of the body that are called lumps, they are a large cause, invading, which weighs down the body; and applying cautery to those is done in two ways: with hot cautery and with boiling water.
A hot cautery is used where you heat the cautery tip like a piece of red-hot iron. This tool is made of metal according to its capacity to contain the key part of any operation, and it has thin grooves.
And then place that flame on the key, and then rotate your hand around the cautery within the curve of the key so that the cautery reaches the depth of the key. And let that be done for three days until it starts to scab over. And then cover that with treacle-soaked bandages impregnated with salt, and let the bandage stay on that for one night, until the worm is eradicated from its nest.
And then treat the area with a healing meat grease until it is healed.
And if they do not convert, and blisters break out on the surface of the body, especially on the buttocks and feet, then you should apply these cautery treatments with water. And take a small tube of earth or iron or red-hot iron, and place it over the key; and pour in the water a little quantity, and twist your hand, and turn that around with pressure from all parts of your hand, and press the edge of the tube onto the key's nest, and make the hot water flow into the exit channel of the cautery; and let the patient endure the biting sensation of the hot water for an hour, and then remove it, until the key is eradicated.
And do this with those and next to each other, making sure you cover all of them on their body.
And then treat those abscesses where the worms of the keys have been eradicated with that from the grease which the meat generates.
Capitol, 53.
Regarding the cautery for trembling.
When you are dealing with tremors due to friction on nerves or fever resulting from friction, or any similar cause, then it is customary to apply four cauterizations or five times on the ribs of the back, between each rib having one cauterization; and on their feet, and over the stomach area, you should perform an olive-like cauterization.
And the trembling of the patient subsides, and facilitates the recovery of the illness.
Capitol, 55.
Regarding the cautery for accidental injuries to the body.
When there are pus-filled wounds in the body, which are made of thick corrupted substances; therefore, as soon as they appear, it is to be treated by applying a cautery over all parts of the fistula with a thin stick of myrrh, where the tip is extended into fire; or with long wormwood stumps; or with a conical-shaped cautery.
And some blisters are to be treated with cautery during their expulsion process in this manner; they should not be popped, and the excess is allowed to drain away from those areas, thereby healing them.
However, it is advisable that this should be done in conjunction with bloodletting therapy for evacuation.
Capitol, 56.
Regarding the cautery treatment for bleeding infections caused by the puncturing of veins.
When you encounter bleeding from a vein that needs to be punctured due to infection, or if it's necessary to make incisions in swellings or apply cautery on the limb, then do this process while keeping everything similar, and it becomes difficult to keep that situation.
And when it happens with any of them, then cover your hand over the orifice of the vein, and place it on the said hard spot, inside which keep that bleeding from the infection where you indicated, and do not allow it to stop.
And then place the olive-shaped cauteries for few and large times in number over those until they ignite.
And then take one small or large depending on the location and wound where the artery has ruptured, over that vein as you have indicated, and do it with haste once you have covered your said area, and apply cautery until the infection is eliminated and restrained.
And if the blood is expelled from the artery's orifice when you have covered your said area and removed the cautery, then take another small cautery among those that are prepared in the fire, therefore do not cease to perform this one after another until the bleeding is restrained.
And remember not to burn the nerves here, which might bring other harm to the patient.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to restrain the bleeding in those cases, especially when the artery is large, unless one of four ways applies: or apply this cautery as we said, or if extraction is made and not extracted, when it is extracted its ends are burned and the bleeding is restrained; or they are tied with string or ligature by strong constriction; or they are laid over medicines whose virtue is to restrain the bleeding; and they are strengthened with poultice in proper restriction.
Apply that which restrains the patient's condition with ligature and constriction through positions of burning causes and similar methods, do not impose it except in moderation.
If this needs to be done and the doctor is not present or medicine available, then open according to the indication on that vein as we have said, understand within the patient's large constriction until the bleeding stops from the major part of the wound, and over the artery do not cover it; and over the artery apply with a cold friction water until the blood coagulates and thickens; and consider which needs to be cauterized or medicine required.
From incision, puncture, suction, phlebotomy, pus, and their appearances.
We have discussed in the first chapter all of malaise for which a burning cautery is appropriate and burn medicine, as well as opportunities and causes for it, and the instruments necessary among the forms of cauterization; I have organized the chapters on the body's ascent into the feet.
And I proceed in this chapter according to that medical manner, so that the one who desires it may be relieved, now about what has been requested.
And before I begin this, child, learn that in this chapter it is about extending what was in the first chapter of cauterization.
And because of this you should be careful in it, which is about the operation that is in this chapter where there are cuts that can lead to evacuation which depends on your health from the application of the vein or cut above the boil or puncture for pus release or purification of the plague or removal of needle or incision in the flesh and their appearances. And all these are accompanied by fear, trembling, and at their worst, death.
And I warn you that do not let this happen to you in which there is a risk, for some precautions should be taken by you as with various methods of diseases. And some of them will die from their disease and it is a minor matter for them to die, also because of the intensity of what they find in their illness, and due to the duration of their illness, and in sickness fear means death.
And those are the ones who give you their account and statement, hoping for that health, and their illness is harmful.
And so do not consent to what someone comes to you about this manner; and your caution should be greater than greediness and your gluttony; and do not presume any cause about it unless you have certain knowledge that verifies this for you, and from which reasonable success follows.
And use in the treatment of all your illnesses by predicting and indicating what becomes of them when it is converted to health, so that there is assistance for you regarding acquisition of fame and memory, praise, and glory.
Oh, children, God breathes his understanding into you and does not withhold direction and protection from you, for that is in his hand.
And I have organized this chapter distinguishing by chapters according to what was in the first chapter on cauterization, for the treatment of the body into feet, so that you may be relieved of what you requested and of which you need.
First chapter.
Treatment of water, which is contained in the head of children.
Know that this illness, which often befalls children, is called infantile sickness and when the child grows stronger, its head becomes livid.
And some cuts due to a concealed cause that is unknown.
I have only seen this illness in children; and for all those I saw they died, thus it seems to me that the dying has been shown in them.
And I have seen that a child whose head was full of water, the head of which was always thus magnificated within that it could not cease to be on itself due to the size of its head, and more than the humidity increased within that became death.
And this moisture is added between bone and the skull, or it is added to you from the outside on the scalp.
So that in that operation if the moisture is between bone and the skull and there is a small boil, then you should make an incision in the middle of the head through a crack in the width, and let the length of the crack drain two nights until the moisture comes out, and this is the form of pus:
And if the moisture is more increased and the boil is larger, then these are two cracks according to this manner:
And if the moisture is outside of the skull, its sign is that you open all corners of the head and water squirts out when you press that against your own hand at the inside parts and it is not this hidden from you. And if you make an incision in the middle of the head through three cracks according to this manner:
And the cut should extract all of the moisture; and reinforce the cracks with bandages and feathers; and on the fifth day apply vinegar and oil, and then relieve the muscles and treat the wound with herbs and ointments, and strengthen the head with equality; and eat the sick with dry meat of little moisture until that member is comforted and healed.
And it is another way of cutting that you consider according to the size of the boil and the collection of water; some cuts are more in the occipital region, or at the front part, or on the right side, or on the left; so pay attention to where the boil appears and the filling with water, and do this as best suits you.
And observe that don't cut the artery and allow streams of blood to flow out so that you can relieve the illness by the flow of blood and eliminate moisture.
Chapter two.
When there is trouble or pain in the hands or feet, and it continues for some time, if you do not treat it with medicines, then here begins the effective treatment of those two arteries.
And when you want to penetrate where the patient's head is causing its neck, then prepare the area with a hard cloth so that you can see the arteries, and strengthen the patient's neck with another cloth; and consider where the pulse beats; and press the places under those areas which are close to the earlobes, and if not in some people.
And then place over the artery with your attempt, and penetrate each part of the sharp area at its beginning inside to the opening, and do this for the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the tip of your tool into the artery and twist it in accordance with its entry points above.
And make the length of the incision two inches long, for when any vein is cut, it causes an ache at its exit, which beats up and down frequently.
If the artery doesn't show up at the bend, then when you measure from the earlobe, take three inches of space, and place over with your attempt, and insert inside to the opening.
And what you must know about the pain is that it indicates a quantity of blood flow. and strengthen it as necessary for more or less, and all of this depends on the quantity that appears from the virtue of the patient's neck and the filling of the artery.
And then consider the wound, and if there remains over the bone any cause of swelling, then cut that so as not to create a pus pocket.
And strengthen the wound with plasters and with strips of cloth, and heal that one with ointment until it is healed.
Chapter three.
Regarding the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
When an old or acute headache occurs due to dampness and the quality of those lumps in the temples, or an ancient strong one that resembles those, and is treated with medical curative methods and you don't agree, then we proceed to this disease: extraction of arteries in the temples, or cauterization of those similarly as we have shown.
The method of the operation and extraction is that when the patient's skin is in the temples; and understand the artery apparent in the temple area where it beats for you shown by its pulse, and is hidden only in a few people due to the strength of rubbing.
And if it's hidden from you, then strengthen the patient's neck with some cloth; and prepare the area with a hard cloth or boil water in that place so that you can clearly see the artery prominently. And then take this tool, which is like this: And then you heat the needle at that place for ease of passing into the artery; and apply oil on it and extract there in front of the parts; and extract from that part of the artery and discover those of the tunics which are left behind, from all parts.
If the artery is thin, then wrap it at the tip of the onion, and cut out a portion from that according to the length by which its tips are spread and contracted, and do not create pain; if they are not cut, then the patient's blood will flow continuously.
And remove the blood of one unit. Into three.
And if the artery is large, then when you hold it in two places with twice the strength of each or with strings long, do not let it decay before the healing of the wound and do not allow blood flow.
And then cut the excess that is between two cords; and do this either in this moment or another time.
And if you wish, cauterize that with a cautery inside the opening and with a surgical knife where its extremities are incised, and remain in place for this task.
And it is better work if the patient has fever or is of cold complex; for cautery is from those causes that help in eliminating dampness, and therefore it is better in youth.
And consider the extraction of arteries that you prefer in the middle of the neck, and be placed over the dust well prepared, and then treat it with dry medicines so that the flesh emerges and within where it heals.
And if while working another wound occurs and blood from the artery flows, then you must restrict that blood flow, or with cautery, or fill the neck area, and strengthen your hand until the blood is restricted. And if none of those causes are present to you, then pause your hand on the area until the blood cools down, and soak the area with water from intense coldness until the heat subsides, and strengthen according to what you see.
And when there is more pus in the extraction of an abscess, you should cauterize the vein at this point with a cautery that has two blades. You have already touched both spots on the skin, and then push fire into them so that it reaches the body and splits the vein in two places, for which reason it becomes extended where it is between the extremities of the patient, which are not hardened by all means at this cautery.
And this is how to perform the cautery:
And let the sharpness of both blades be equal. However, if your skill allows for two blades to be sharper than two, where if they are sharp like two razors, and do not cut the flesh at speed.
So when there is some thickness, heat the tip of these and the flesh is cut slightly.
And this technique is better in every work and even more so for the lighter ones.
And let the space between the two blades be equal to the thickness of the finger.
Headquarter.
Regarding the treatment of chests affected by sharp and acidic tears in the lungs.
When it is acid tears, and those are the veins that lie above the forehead when viewed from behind, and you do not associate any medical treatment with this cause, and the patient's face already reddens and walks around in their mind as if it were a walk of ants, and the breaths of those have been exhausted, wetted by this way that their skin is known, and their eyelids are scraped by the sharpness of the tears, the old ones prefer to treat those with this operation, and many undergo that treatment through this procedure.
And you command the patient to rub off the skin that is on their forehead, then proceed to cut into the forehead three equally spaced cuts according to the length of the forehead. And if the length of the cut is two thumbs: one cut should be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length of a little movement of the tear ducts which are under the lacrimal, and the third on the other side.
And guard yourself from the beginning of the veins which are in two sides, and extend your hand along the continuation of both jaws. And if the space of each cut is adjusted to be three thumbs wide.
And if you have a sponge or dried cloth, apply moist heat on those to which the sweat is released.
And insert the tip of two sharp points, here's how this incision would look on him: It goes from splitting at the junction between the first cut to the second. Excise all the chain that lies between two cuts close to the root which is on top of the bone, and proceed with this incision moving towards the second cut. And then cut this point and insert another tool in the first incision; it is called a scalpel, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
Place the sharp side of this you must cut off the flesh and chain along with it, and the other end inside the bone, insert this tool where it reaches the second cut, and cut off all the veins that descend from the head to the lungs.
And let this cutting continue up to that appearance of the chain, and then proceed with this at the middle cut between the other cuts.
And since it runs in the same amount of sweat quantity, squeeze out the spots of concentrated sweat together.
And proceed to pause in every cut for a while, and place on those ashes burned in vinegar and oil and vinegar, and makes sure not to develop an abscess.
And on the third day let him take off the dressing and applies large fumigations of boiled water or vinegar, and then treat this with balsam in oil among others until the wounds are healed.
Head V.
Regarding the treatment of tears through catarrhs and lungs descending from parts inside the head.
When on one vein of catarrh you cut and continue, and sometimes the lungs of the patient are exhausted, they weep, and their appearance is debilitated, and their eyelids are ulcerated with their color of skin, and in front of the head there is acute dental pain and consequent exhaustion, then know through these incidents that the materials and catarrhs do not come from veins of parts inside proceeding.
And the best treatment for these is this: command the patient to rub their forehead, then proceed to cut in a small incision at the middle of the forehead, little by its width (and start from the left temple incision to the right; and if the incision goes into the bone; and extend your hand along the cheeks which are swollen due to chewing), so that the bone is exposed.
Sweat off all the sweat with a sponge or on a dry cloth, and then fill the two lips of the incision with ashes or on pieces of leather. And proceed to strengthen it above with ashes burned in vinegar and oil, so that there is no development of an abscess.
And when you remove that and as the abscess has diminished, then it is known to rub inside the bone starting from their inner flesh, and then treat this with regenerative drying which makes the flesh sweat, as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of beeswax and mix them, and make a poultice from them and apply it on these wounds as for the natural skin.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
From the cure of what happens in the ears.
All causes that happen in the ears are of four types, one being like stone caused by mineral substances such as iron and lead, similarly to them. Another is plant-based, like cress or fava beans. The third is fluid-like, like water, wine, and what is similar to them. Lastly, it can be due to some animal cause.
And therefore when stone is found in the ear or some other cause similar to those causes that do not adjust and do not grow in the ear, place the ear near the sun. If you see the stone, then distill some of that particular substance from the oil that has gone rancid or saffron, take out its extraction, and make them sneeze under supervision. After which, let their noses expect a sneezing incident. And then place some pieces of cloth or wool near the circuit of the ear, and spread the ear to these parts above them, where hot spots are found to be caused by these conditions.
And if it is not getting heated, then administer its extraction with the instrument called the subtle epicyclic gesture of which this is the form:
And if it's heated by that gesture, good it is; otherwise, then administer its extraction with the delicate spoon of small duplication.
And if it's not heated by this, then make a reed tube and insert the end of the tube into the canal of the ear and seal around the area of the tube with beeswax and soft, soothing oil, so that it only opens when the tube itself. And then remove through strong suction at the ear hole, where hot spots are found similar to what we have described.
May it be that if it's not heated in this manner, then take powdered alum or powdered vinegar to which some earwax is mixed in a small quantity, place that on the tip of your finger, and hold it near the ear opening, then wrap it properly around that. And then insert this into the canal of the ear with ease, and then proceed to dry out the ear from moisture.
And if it's not heated by all the causes we've described, then take your knife to cut out that which turns into a boil or spasm in front of you.
And the method of cutting that out is as follows: at the beginning, you hold your patient's cephalic vein and cut where it starts, then proceed to extract according to the manner in which its essence flows. Then make a small incision between your fingers and convert the ear to these parts above, and create a tiny fissure near the root of the ear where his hair lies on the spot pressed by him. And if the crack is of lunar shape and goes through to the stone, and if you find the stone blocked up, hold that in place with appropriate instruments if you can; then fill the crack with speed at that moment, and cure it inside until it's healed.
And if the cause caught in the ear is one that grows and inflates, then administer treatment and extraction for it; but if you don't agree with this, then take a thin spatula according to this form: And administer to remove that lump which is found in the ear.
And don't do this when you think that the lump is moistened by the ear's vapor; place it in hot spots and then extract from those either through the canals or with subtle gestures, or using an incision as described previously. The extraction should be relieved by this method.
If the water which has entered into the ear canal causes your patient to sneeze at the beginning, then fill your patient's ear with a small amount of old wax and place it over that particular part of the ear where there is water. If it gets heated this way, good it is; otherwise, then take some small pebbles or shells according to their length relative to that described before, heat them slightly in the fire, have your patient put one near the canal of their ear and light a piece of their own hair on fire over that particular part of the ear, striking another stone against the stone that is inside the ear. Then don't stop this until all the water within turns hot.
Then don't stop this until all the water within turns hot. And as soon as the water starts turning hot, take a piece of paper or a match,. And place one end inside the ear and extend the other end into the fire until its tip is burned.
And place another match and do this so many times until all the water is heated, then remove it with the tube described earlier for extracting stones.
In the case of foreign animal matter entering that ear canal, if it's small and similar to it, cure it as we've said in the division; but if it's a large thing causing an obstruction in the inner ear, then administer its extraction through gestures and canals, and the cause is much easier than all other causes found in the ear.
If you're dealing with worms that have been produced in the ear and are curing it as we've said in the division, and if your treatment doesn't seem to be working, then observe the ear under the sun.
And so if here appears any cause of the worms, then extract that from the intestines or those subtle substances; but if no cause appears, then take one cannula and make it straighten out and expand from which this is the form of such. And insert the subtle extremity into the ear according to the amount it suffers in the patient; then suck through that with strong suction, and do these punctures, within which all worms will be expelled.
And if you do not observe your speed in this process, then fill and seal the circuit of the cannula with wax as we have said; administer distillations which have already been prepared for the treatment of worms, and find this matter in our discussion on distillations.
And when your effusion is into which you pour the medicinal oils in the ear with this instrument, of which this is its form: And make it from silver or amber, straightened out, with a small hole, and on the top.
And so as they are to be applied when it is in the cavity of the cannula here where their necessity arises. And if you wish, take the rod and wrap it around the descending end of the cannula at the knee, then pour oil into the cavity of the auditory canal or juice from any herb, or whatever you choose of these medicines in the cannula — and that is inside the ear — then insert the rod at the knee and squeeze inside your hand until the oil is expelled into the cavity of the auditory canal and the patient feels the oil internally.
And whatever is inserted in the ear should already be heated by fire to a small degree. And remember that the substance you will distill in the ear should not be too strong, for the medicines of the ear do not tolerate this.
Title VII.
Regarding the treatment of wax in the ears.
Some pustules come from the womb of the elderly women without perforation, and this happens in some men, wax in the meat of the ear by infection or by nothing in that area; and this wax is sometimes made before the entrance of the auditory canal which does not know the movement, and some pustules are outside the parts.
And that which happens at the entrance of it, which does not comprehend movement, is in the older dispositions for difficult treatment.
And in that where you gain movement, cover that the ear of the patient to the sun and look into it. And if there is visible pus, open that with a subtle spatula of which this is the form:
If the end of it where the width is small, for which one part is sharp and the other is not; and the spatula is of two widths lion such that it does not harm the ear.
And if the wax is due to flesh inside the ear or in its meat, then you have that with subtle needles and penetrate it vigorously inward until all the flesh is exposed.
And if wax is at the entrance of the ear, then take a subtle lion rod and heat that with fire just a little, then place it in the meat of the ear.
And if you have sensed pus with what the patient feels with difficulty, by straining to hear, relieve the pressure on it with ease; and remember not to irritate the nerves of the ear.
And then place linen in the ear according to the size of the opening of the hole which you have wrapped with Egyptian ointment; and do this for several days until you are sure of the healing of the wound; or that you take some, insert it in water, pulverize it on the third day and use it; and if you see the ear already pierced, then remove what you used and replace it with another which you wrap in a bandage made of cotton that is soaked in oil, until the abscess ruptures; and then treat it while it heals.
And if there is a discharge of pus, then immerse the sponge or cloth in water and place it over the ear, and use another treatment which tightens the pus discharge, which is mentioned in our discussion on distillation.
Title VIII.
Regarding the treatment of adhesions that occur to the eyelids.
Adhesions which stick to the eyelids of some people are moist, others' adhesions are dry.
So scrape them with tweezers or with needles, and divide those with the use of a small spatula from their roots, then place on those spots after the third day.
And if pain with pus discharge is present, then you apply a cautery to those with a subtle tuberculin cautery.
And the best cautery is near incisions and too many pus discharges return when there remains any cause at their roots; and when they are treated with fire, those roots burn and do not return.
Title IX.
Treatment for inflammation that occurs to the eyelids of children.
Pimple-like inflammations that occur in the eyelids of children are caused by an assembly of something that increases in its size and hardness, and due to this increase it is called inflammation.
And it's an increase in thick moisture on the eyelid and above it.
So, the operation for them is that you consider if the swelling is coming from within in the area where it appears on the eyelid and spreads everywhere; and the cause of this is slight.
So cut across that seam in the width, and by facilitating it completely inside, make sure to evacuate, and place that under suspension, and discard that.
And if the figure is large, then adjust it with suture; and care for that until it is healed.
And if it's small, you won't encounter any harm in that quarter where the warmth of this restores and brings back to life that part.
And if the swelling is declining towards the inner parts of the eyelid you should adjust it inwardly, then lift that eyelid and suspend the swelling under your hand, another that you would use from the start, press it all around, and if the eyelid is lengthened from its start, there's usually no cause for concern.
And at the beginning, wash the wound with salt water; and care for that area until it is healed.
Capi.
From the treatment above of the eyelid, on top of the wound.
Axsirnath is white, which is produced in the tunics of the eyelid above, and more so in children, intensifies the wounds among them and leads to their catarrh; and they cannot see the brightness of the sun because their tears are concentrated on those.
And for that purpose you rub those on their faces continuously, and they sleep on them; and the wet eyebrows of them leave on their eyelids, which have already covered puffiness, and the potentiality of irritation is visible in the eye; and when you press the area with your own words, you feel irritation within those.
And some method of operation is in that where the patient rests their head on you, and then places a sheet under them and creates a space, and draws a circle according to the quantity which contains pus from all sides, and then pauses that over there and presses with your own words everywhere so that irritation accumulates in the middle of the circle, and at its center make a small incision perpendicular to the line on width, and the incision should not be larger than the incision made in a paracentesis.
And in the proconsul's case where you cut through completely until you reach pus, which after that position proceeds pus through a small incision according to the shape of white whiteness.
Then remove those with the sheets which you enveloped between your own words at the front parts, and rotate back and forth between your right and left hand until it is dispersed.
And remember not to adjust in the small incision for yourself that under this you do not reach into the wound, and discard that.
And if you do not find pus at the beginning of the incision, then adjust in that incision a little with facilitation so that pus proceeds; and by the way remove this too as we said; and soak sheets from them in water and vinegar and place these on top, strengthen those with powder.
And in this way they pass salt and pause that at the cavity of the incision so that what remains from that moisture disappears.
And then care for that until it is healed.
And if an abscess occurs in the wound, then care for that with plaster compresses until it is healed.
Capi.
Methods of touching the wound.
When in the eyelids of wounds are natural hairs adjusted by us, these are towards the wound and cause ways of maladies such as frequent tears and inflammation of the eyelids and tissue inside which this is a cause for destruction of the wound; it is called blanching of the wound. And treatment is done through four methods: or with cautery fire; or with acute medicine according to what was mentioned in the section on cauteries; or by lancing with an incision and suturing; or with canals as I direct you.
And thus when you place the head of the malady on your own side; then convert the eyelid of the wound to your left hand, if it is converted, then yes; and if not, insert a needle into that in which pus is located from the eyelid, make the needle penetrate through above, and this - near the margin of the eyelid where hairs are born - near the hairs, pull the thread upwards on the eyelids, and convert it to light.
And then make in the inner part of the eyelid adjust your hairs to a needle that goes from the major tear duct into the lacrimal gland; and remove this needle and pause the eyelid with powder petal or cotton, and press on the eyelid with a finger, and it should look like the shape of a mint leaf.
And yet when it comes to the shape according to the amount of evacuation of the eyelid, which is already differentiated in humans, those that require being cut deeply from the eyelid depending on the amount for which the eyelid is swollen.
And then make the incision along the two lines you marked, starting from the greater lacrimal into the lesser lacrimal. And if your incision is near the natural folds such as that of the king's thickness.
And then place the snout in one of the two corners of the chain, and thoroughly scrape that area, adjusting to the cut with both lips under the tongue or at the wool-thin fleece's throat. Clean any secretions, and remove excess from the hairs on the eyebrows for some causes requiring it, if you wish to do so; otherwise, leave them alone.
And then change the bandages of the hairs every three or four days, and take care of that.
And if you wish, change the wound's stitches, and treat it with what dries and constricts. When the eyelid is lifted, you should seal the wound and add to it; more stitches are better, so do this every day following the traditions of surgery.
Yet in this you should concern yourself with the patient's condition, and it is a good operation, not out of fear.
And there is another way to ensure accuracy, and that is to form the eyelid like a mint leaf on top, and then lift the eyelid by three nails, separating and gathering them according to this shape:
If it is not possible to do this, use nails instead. If that is not feasible, take a needle with thread and insert it in the middle of the shape, then place another hair near the greater lacrimal, and one after the lesser lacrimal, adjusting them between your fingers for equality, then lift your hand as high as you can lift equal things, lifting the entire chain over which the treatment is given, as we have instructed.
And then adjust both lips of the wound for stitches, and treat what should be healed internally.
And if you encounter an abscess, your operation or incision should be made, and treat that abscess with bandages and make it look alike, using ointments.
And sometimes the eyelid may require that its hairs be converted, then take care to use in that what we have instructed about incisions; more stitches are better for others, as they are more artificial.
Surgery on canals is according to this form: And this is to convert the eyelid and divide the inner figure as I recounted; then, by artistry, make two canals or two fine threads of which their length should be according to the length of the eyelid, and their breadth should be akin to the width of the incision. And you have already made incisions at the extremities of each division, where you have the threads.
And then add whatever is subtle under what exceeds from the eyelid of the patient, and strengthen the threads for each division by making them very tight. Leave that for a few days; when the chain due to tightness will wither and be denied entry so that it will fall in on itself.
And if it's delayed, then break off the threads at the corners, and treat the wound internally until it heals.
Then when it is hardened, the eyelid is lifted and the hairs do not prick.
And this is how you should make two canals as instructed in this manner: And have the quantity of length and breadth neither more nor less.
Chapter XII.
Concerning the elevation of prickly hairs on the body when the hair is hard.
When they are unnatural hairs, hard and rough, prickly on the body, then in this operation for you take a delicate needle and place it at that point of the fine thread and the lion's beard, and carefully adjust both ends of it without breaking them. And let the length of the threads be as much as a palm.
And then you make another fine thread from yours for quickly, and if you want, use the ends of that one as well.
And then place the patient's head in your position, and be close to the sun so that your work may be proclaimed, for it is a subtle and detailed operation.
And then insert the needle into the adjusted hair that requires skill, and make it penetrate through the eyelid carefully until you remove that from the hard hair.
And then pull the hair inwards and insert that one inside, and have the hairs be one or two or three but no more.
And then pull your hand towards that inside where the hair has been pulled out from the eyelid in the hard hair.
And if it's pulled out straight and the hair isn't pulled, pull it straight towards each division with the thread you have made for that one inside. Inside which the straight pulled hair will be.
And release that to the patient's sight, where then you will pull out straight and the thread, and trim all the hairs and shape the body, leaving the scar for two or three days, during which the hair will adhere to its place and grow over it good flesh.
And if the hair is longer than usual, then adjust a long hair from the natural ones, and elevate it towards that or leave it so that it grows about some space further, then you will elevate that one.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Regarding the treatment of trachoma which manifests above the eyelid.
When it comes to trachoma, which appears above the eyelid when the eyelid is contracted in its place, either to the right or left side, due to bad consolidation of pus, section, or cautery, it is called leporine, and this trachoma can be natural or accidental, caused by the consolidation of pus, sections, or cauteries, or resembling their maladies.
The method of the operation on you is that you will cut through this consolidation and separate your folds, and place between them a strip of linen cloth, and bind those together until they are healed.
And do not use the healing of your conditions which dry up and constrict; if you do this, it will return trachoma pus bad that had not been there before.
Use for those causes that soften thus as fennel, and soak them in the water where your legs are raised and mixed with it or apply tallow grease, which should be liquefied with a little oil, then immerse that cloth in it and heal with that.
And the treasure of your healing is that you puncture through all organs that are not consolidated according to the shape it had at the beginning.
And this operation which we have mentioned is nothing but some rectification of trachoma that does not return the shape of the place according to what it was before.
Chapter XIV.
Regarding the treatment of trachoma, which occurs on the eyelid.
This trachoma which occurs on the eyelid, it is called instantly-trachoma and some of it is natural, others are accidental.
Accidental trachoma is caused by pus, a cut, cautery or other similar conditions.
The method of the operation for this is that you take a needle with a double thread and fix it in the flesh. You should then make it pass from the left lacrimal to the right one, so that the thread reaches both ends of the tissue.
And then extend the tissue to the sides on the needle and hold the needle with your hand, and cut through the wide opening. And if it returns the shape of the eyelid as expected, then it's good; otherwise, take the thread and place that on the cut opening, and with that reshape the eyelid, and make both cuts in the corner of the left eye.
And let the ends of the two cuts be at two corners of the incision you've made between them, and make an angle with that so when they come together, it will form their shape.
And this shape is the Greek letter: the omega.
And then hold that amount of tissue there which is at the corner of your left eye, so that it secures the eyelid.
And then adjust those separated parts and stitch them with the thread of wool; and heal those using the medicines that soften and the ointments in which they are to be healed.
And if trachoma is caused by a cut or suturing or cautery, then it means you should make an incision on the flat plane of the eyelid as described. And then separate with the ointment between the two folds as we said.
In the overall discussion of treating trachoma which occurs on the eyes or at the corners, it should be carried out in your operation, according to how trachoma is prepared from the shape of trachoma, and that one comes in various shapes.
And skilled artisans always prepare organs in every possible way that can fit within them so that it returns the figure to its natural form, or close to that form, and the patient according to what suits him from the operation and the tools in their most appropriate positions.
Chapter XV.
Regarding the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this consolidation occurs in many people it means that the eyelid is solidly placed above the white of the eye, and prevents ease of movement and its natural actions. So it's known that you should intervene with your hand on the left side of the eyelid, lift it there or extend it to the eyebrow.
And then you should cut the adhesion with a fine incision that is not at the sharpness of the cuts, having it somewhat blunt so the patient does not get disturbed by the operation, and keep the incision from weakening the eye's sharpness.
And your cut should remove that adhesion in a convenient manner so that the eyelid returns to its natural shape and the whole adhesion is healed.
And then put salt water in your eye, or distill it from juniper dissolved in water.
And then separate between the eyelid and the eye with an ointment from your body, and place over the eye wool infused in egg white, and regularly use causes that consolidate until it is healed.
Chapter XVI.
Regarding the cutting of the nose and the elevation of flesh around the tear ducts.
Know that the nose can be cut in two ways; either nervously, which resembles a hard fine bone; or non-nervously, resembling whitish condensed moisture, which when touched, tends to take hold of the nostril and is removed without being left inside.
And both of these areas do not start from the larger tear duct, where it grows little by little covering the view and prohibiting light and motion of sight.
The method of acting in the treatment of the patient is such that the sufferer places their head in their usual position, then opens their eyes, and raises their eyelid with your hand, then collect their tongue at the tip of their palate and extend it to the upper parts. And then take a thorn and insert it into a hair from a horse or a ox or a calf, or any similar thing, or make the tip of the thorn gradually longer, place that in the middle of the tongue, and penetrate that with the needle, and hold onto it with your finger; and extend this to the upper parts, scrape off the skin at the edge of the tongue which seals the pupil. And thus continue following that under the hair until you reach the backside of the patient.
And then you puncture the remainder in the root of the tear duct at a subtle spot or at small slashes, and remove the flesh of the tear duct naturally, so that with this incision there is no continuous flow of tears.
And sometimes the tongue at the heel or under the nail, as we have said, and then scrape it off at the groove which has this shape:
And be careful not to touch the corneal membrane on the groove, and that it does not result in a rupture, and that the pupil is not punctured.
And at the incision place a little of salt water or vinegar solution on it, and leave that in until another day; and then care for that with anything that covers until it heals.
And if the tongue is not nerve and you cannot insert the needle, or it is fixed in that place under the heel, then this type of tongue is treated with medicines, and heals just like I have recommended in the division.
And if you want to incise that, then open the groove of the patient and take out a subtle groove like this with sharpened scissors according to this shape: With subtlety. And if you notice that it is thinning and becoming mixed in that groove, then distill from your mouth into the vinegar made from vinegar or from rose water or from salted water, and pour the groove inside until the next day.
And then continue the operation until all of what is yours has been removed, otherwise it will leave a boil under the groove, and then you leave that, and care for the boil so that it heals.
And continue your operation on that with reason until it is healed.
The inflammation of the tear duct flesh, if noticed in the groove due to great injury, should be suspended under the heel; and make an incision from that point onwards, and do not finish the operation so as not to cause continuous tears.
And then continue by distilling vinegar on the tear duct groove until it heals.
Chapter XVII.
Regarding the incision of the nostril and what is born from flesh that is adjusted in the groove.
Some grooves in the nostril grooves are born of reddened flesh, and it is over-extended covering the pupil, or brings it close to or strengthens the eyelids and presses them towards the outer parts and is assembled like rubbing against the moustache.
The operation for this is such that the patient places their head in its usual position; and then opens the nostril groove of it and collects all that flesh with convenient hairpins or tweezers; and then makes an incision from where you begin until everything is finished at the clippers, and beware not to let go of that which you should do your operation.
And your incision at which you make these or at the groove that we recommended in the operation of the tongue, or with small slits where they are collected by rabbits according to how their form approaches this chapter.
So when your operation is complete and all that flesh has been removed, then fill the groove with salt water, or distill on it vinegar powder and substances similar to those of corrosive medicines, and place over the groove towards outside a slice of egg white until you ensure the absence of boil pus.
And if there is any cause of nosebleed and it becomes stopped with blood clot, and you fear boil pus, then leave the groove and care for that boil with water that dissolves that boil, and then continue your operation on it until it heals, and similarly do to the flesh which happens in this groove.
But remember that you should cover all healing of the groove with vinegar through natural or through accidental means, act by force, and do not put your hand into any of these operations while you see that that member is undergoing this operation.
Chapter XVIII.
Regarding the collection in the groove.
Sabo is a kind of vein that is stubborn in the groove and prevents its operation, it thins out the groove over days.
So it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the groove where there is sabo is strong and in this area there is no other illness besides sabo, then you collect that sabo.
And you command the patient to place their head in your lap, and suspend those veins with an ounce or two according to your discretion; and let that ounce be of subtle duplication as per this form:
or two ounces gradually within a body according to this form:
And let those veins be collected with subtle forces, with subtlety, and cleanse the wound little by little, as you see those veins become swollen with heat and turn red.
And remember not to let the heat reach to the extremities of the thigh; and if your operation is in midday towards the sun, and you are firm in your operation, do not penetrate any further than those veins.
And when you have completed it, then in the wound you distil oil of wormwood or rue so that its acuity erodes what has become swollen from the knife.
If it is not possible for you to collect all in that hour, then cover the entire area where there is pain from them, and let them rest for a few days until their pain is relieved and the wound has healed.
And then continue to work on them according to your mother's teaching until they are healed.
And this is the form of sickle blades:
Capitol Nineteen.
Regarding reduction of nasal deformities.
When you treat deformities of the nose with a cautery or with hot medicinal applications following their description and if they are not healed, then it is not enough in them; rather, you should wait for the maturity of pus, and extract all the moisture that is within them until the bone is exposed.
And so when the bone has been exposed and there's corruption or darkness within it, then you should treat them with an incision of this form:
And it is called a hard cap, and it should be made of iron indigo, and make the cap slightly rounded as if you were to press with a finger that is punctured by the point of a saw or finely ground (as seen in the following form).
Place that over the corrupted area of the bone and gently rotate it with your fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that that corruption is flattened.
And let it be applied with some passes, and then restore the area against drying causes and tightening forces.
Therefore, if the area is consolidated and there's good flesh in it, and if the scar tissue is removed and healed for forty days, and it isn't renewed or doesn't leave a wound, then you will know that it has been healed.
But if not, then it is not in its place but reduce the fissure to the shape of the nose, and according to this method: you would uncover from bone or with acute medicine, once the bone has been exposed, then you take it apart according to this form:
The extremity of the iron should be triangular, and the shaft of it should primarily thin out towards the extremity as shown.
And place that over the bone and let it be near to the lacrimal; extend your hand a little in the wound, and rotate your hand towards this area so that it penetrates all of the bone, and the patient feels the touch as they find an exit path when you feel their hand.
So then restore the area with tightening medicines, drying them as they should be taken.
Therefore, when the flesh and area have endured, then that substance which was expelled to different parts returns to the nose; thus this is minor pus over the patient.
Capitol Twenty.
Regarding reduction of the prominence of the nose.
When the nose protrudes in its entirety and does not cause any damage or diminution, then bend the patient back and gently guide them, placing gentle incisions on their neck scarification and bleed well; then place liniment over the nose made of garlic and aloe vera and sesame oil, and reinforce the plaster placed on the nose with powdered dough.
The method for the powders is that you take cloths of powdered dough and each cloth should be divided into four parts; make them from these powders.
And place those one upon the other according to the quantity needed by how much the nose needs it. And reinforce over those with a tight bandage made of strong material; and apply the suction cups to their bleeding incision scars; and keep the suction cups in place and let the nose be straight during the day and night.
If while the ligament is being softened, then you should make it very straight.
And hold the ligament tight both during the day and night as we have said.
And if the nose has already been reduced, then that's good, but if not, then continue to apply plaster with powders and the bandage and suction cups until it is healed.
Capitol Twenty-One.
Regarding the excision of the prominence of the tunica uvea (the inner layer of the eyelid).
When there is disruption in the tunica uvea and it protrudes outward like a slight swelling, and after this, let the edges of the eyelid form as if they were slightly raised, and you wish to incise them, then your operation on them should be as we have recommended: You would insert the spatula into the gap of the uvea at the site left from where it was done in the upper part, and insert another spatula at which there is a double thread from the lacrimal side, make that penetrate and guide the first spatula according to its position; then incise the area of the double thread and lift the part of the uvea around the spatula's path, and reinforce that with pressure.
And then remove the gallbladder, place it over the liver, soak it in egg white and let it cool before letting the thread pass through where it would fall under the fruit.
And then treat the liver with this so that it reinforces him once the disease is healed.
Some bandages are gathered from all the parts in a circle of cloth around the liver and adjusted to fit, a large one is sewn through a fine needle that goes towards the inside of the liver. Let the humid heat penetrate and descend the liver back into place.
And then strengthen until it is healed.
Chapter XXII.
On the treatment of colic.
This disease called colic is simply an ailment that settles in the liver like descending water, and it is not that one.
The method of acting on it is to have the patient lie down on the padded saddle and stretch out straight, then take hold of both ends of your hands on their knees and push them towards where you see the illness reaching into their parts, and make sure it dries up without descending further, and let the light in. The patient saw these things happening.
And if it does not descend downwards, know that it is water.
And if it is not prepared for the descent of the illness to water, then have the patient lie between your hands and take a fine needle and place it on top over the neck skin cutting slightly into the conjunctiva towards the corneal epithelium in the corona (within where the disease exits), so that once the disease is expelled.
And once it's expelled, then you should distill in the liver water with a tail in which you have mixed honey or water into which you have boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then let it be treated for the other causes once it is healed.
Chapter XXII.
On the treatment of descending water from the liver.
We have already discussed the types of water in the division and which one should be used for puncturing according to their declaration, this second type according to health.
And have the patient lie down on their back between your hands with their liver towards you, apply a strict motion.
And then place your left hand close to the liver of their eye, if the liver with water is the left liver; or with your right hand, if the liver is on the right.
And then with your right hand take an almond, if the liver is on the left; or with your left hand, if the liver is on the right.
And then place the tip of the almond near the crown for pregnancy of the eye in the white of the liver from the side of the tear duct, and then peel off the almond on its back and turn your hand towards it.
And then penetrate into the white of the liver and you will feel that the almond has already been penetrated due to sight.
And guide the almond to the end of its journey through the channel as long as it is equal in size to the space which lies between the pupil and the end of the shadow, this is the crown of the liver; where you will see the liver's vision by the clarity of the corneal tissue.
And then place the almond in the spot where there is water, and pull it down just one notch upwards from another, so if the water descends immediately, you will see the patient's liver above which they are seeing immediately, and the almond on their liver.
And then rest for just a little while; so if the water has descended, then you should stop that notch before the almond becomes stuck.
And when it is stuck and does not descend, then you remove the almond with ease, turn your hand little by little towards it, and dissolve a small piece of clear salt from a gem in water; then wash the liver inside with that water; and then stop or cut off the liver using wet wool dipped in rose oil and egg white, then apply that to the liver.
And those are the ones from our time who rest on it like a comb immersed in egg white.
And if you do not comply with your almond into the liver due to its hardness - which is characteristic of some people whose liver is hard - then have in mind that you should take the needle named almond, this being its form:
And then puncture that conjunctive area, and do not let your hand end at the tendon, but rather make a path towards the point of the almond needle.
And then guide the almond according to what we have said.
And you must conclude your work, have the patient lie down for a descent sleep made ready in which they rest on their back in a darkened room, and prohibit all movements.
And allow the water to take its natural form for it to be clarified by its nature, and do not turn their head towards either side of the right or left.
And let the sweat follow its position within the third day.
And then remove that from this dark room and let them see the coldness clearly, and show him some causes, and then return the sweat by the seventh day.
And don't do this when it's time for treatments or shortly after infusion. The water should be allowed to pass through this by itself, for fear of excessive or violent drainage.
If an abscess appears with a puncture, then you should open the wound in front of the eye for three days, and correct that amount as to where pus drains.
Then you must stop looking at the patient and place your hand over their mouth for which the patient's breath is regulated by this method for a few days, existing in the dark morning.
And gradually take stock of that situation and discuss it regarding its causes.
And know that in alchemy, a disciple should not ignore some occurrences, and thus you should be fervent about the operation.
And already has been revealed to us some of those which belong to the Artach, and some say that in Al-Ayrac, you should make fire on a perforated board where water will drip.
However, I have not seen such perfect water in our land, nor is there authentic water in any of the ancient books; it may be that this water is new.
And these are the forms of the spices used for which one should use them on those, as to that which ignores those:
And they should be made of iron or properly steel, and their extremities at this subtle triangular extraction, the sharp end is also like that; that is the form.
Chapter XXIV.
Regarding the treatment of flesh, there's nothing to be done in the nose.
When in the nose there are various kinds of flesh lumps, some cause that is assembled to the sign of Mars' weight or to a land disease; this illness is called a polyp which resembles that land representation. And of the patient's flesh it is crooked, flabby, of dark color; and of them there is flesh that is not of dark color.
Therefore in that which is in these non-fraudulent and non-crooked flesh, you should make the patient sit between your servants and place them under the sun, and breathe into their nose, and pinch your finger on those lumps of flesh. And then extract from those parts in front, and then ignite whatever you have understood from those among sharp, fine spits between one part where you know that the entire flesh is affected; if there is a cause of which cutting is possible in the patient, then cut it with one of these subtle tools inside so that it cuts off any cause. If you are able to master or if a suppuration occurs with a puncture, then you stop doing that for the patient; or it is among malignant abscesses, then you touch and cauterize inside where the disease is removed and all cavities are affected.
And if you need to apply this in the nose close to the incision, add water or blood. If the nose is opened and there's moisture within the palate from it, then you know that it is already healed.
If the moisture does not penetrate as the doctor says, then you know that inside the patient there is flesh in the pus under your nose which has not undergone cutting.
Therefore you should make the patient swallow a piece of fat with which there is some lumpiness, use it in the meat juice, pause between each nut for the quantity mentioned or monthly, and make the patient sit and insert one end of the fat into their nose either by the ray or by another cause which might be possible for them.
And once this has been done, have them inhale their scent so that it reaches the canals of the nose, and let them sit on their pillow, for many children perform such actions by instinct in schoolyards, and it's a slight cause to those who want to do it.
And then pause both ends of the fat stick, one end that sticks out over the nose and the other that sticks inside the nose, and apply bandaging to the meat that is in the fat stick, do this so that you know that the flesh is in the meat of the fat stick.
And then extract the fat stick, pause in the nose near the removal of pus with a spoon, and do this for three days or more until all that is rotten from the flesh heals.
And later at the end of the cause, pause in the nose with a lead tube for some days until it is healed.
If you are dealing with treatment that dries out, use that method.
And this is the form of the apparatus for nose purger where oils and medicines are distilled in the nose:
And do this of silver or iron which resembles a small opened lamp like a small basin, and the meat similarly.
And if you want, make a closed tube like a cane, and the tube of this apparatus for nose purger is flat, exposed; it has a handle at the back part of it, as when you immerse that into oil or what you want from the liquids and easily suctionable causes.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
The nosebleeds occur at the extremities of the nose.
Nosebleeds occur at the extremities of the nose, and if there is inflammation, it improves over a few days during which its cause needs to be examined.
And for this reason consider when the appearance of the patient begins, and clarify everything about it. Then place over the area or use a cautery or burning medicine where there is damage.
If its development takes longer and it improves, then consider if it is infected, hard, dark-colored, and with little sensitivity; do not touch this one with iron as it is a pus sore; the symptoms that occur in this sore should be avoided due to their great mischief for him.
And if the pus sore feels like a lion and is not dark-colored, and its development is possible everywhere in this area, then evacuate the patient and operate on this sign with fear, and treat the area with what dries and restricts until it heals.
Chapter XXVI.
Suture of the nose, lips and earlobe when continuity is dissolved by infection or by cuts.
Know that when you encounter solutions to continuity in one of these bones, there is little consideration for this operation rather than in some people.
Then understand, when it comes to some cause of those, consider if there is an infection in his body, then adjust both edges of the infected area with sutures, and treat that until it heals.
And if the edges of the solution to continuity are already separated, and some is healthy, then understand that you should scrape off every part of his obvious body until there's no infection. And then adjust both edges with sutures and strengthen them, sprinkle the infected area with dragon's pus, and apply trissat on it. Place a piece of alum plaster on the powder for one day or another of the consolidating plasters, and let it heal for two days or three. Then remove it and replace the plaster again until the scabs fall off by themselves, and treat with ointment until it heals.
The method for suturing is that you add the solution of continuity or with needles in this way as we have recommended in suture of the abdomen, or add the solution of continuity with wax in this manner and inform about it.
Chapter XXVII.
Chapter 27: Removal of those causes that occur in the two lips in their parts inside.
Symptoms that occur when examining male patients in the inner parts of their lips include hard pus sores resembling fat from cattle, some are smaller and others are larger.
Then understand that you should convert the lips and cavities of each of those hard lumps from all parts, and then fill the wound with sage trissat until the infection is reduced, and then wash it with warm water and treat the area with what dries, until it heals.
Chapter XXVIII.
Chapter 28: Suture of the adjusted flesh in the gums.
Many symptoms arise over the adjusted flesh of the gums which the ancients called albus, therefore understand that you should suspend this one or whatever you have with this one on a nail, and when suturing it you should follow its own size, and let the healthy blood flow or the infection run.
And then place sage trissat or other drying powders on the area.
And if that flesh returns, then sew it again, and cauterize it; the cautery will not return there.
Chapter XXIX.
Chapter 29: Reason for teeth being iron.
When sharp, rough scarring appears on the surface of the teeth in their parts inside and at the corners, and some symptoms are dark-colored and occur citron or yellow within where they affect the gums, making it corrode this way causing the teeth to bleed.
Then understand that you should pinch the patient between your thumbs and place their head in this position, and remove the teeth where these scarring and similar causes appear, making sure no serious cause breaks them. Do this for the darkness and citron yellowness as well as others until they are modified.
Then if this is the same as during the beginning of bleeding, then it's fine; and if not, you should repeat this process on these to another day and to the second and the third until it reaches your desired statement about what you want.
Know that teeth require various forms of reorganization and shapes in different figures according to how you prepare for your operation. And for this reason, which reorganizes the tooth from its internal part is different from the one that reorganizes between the teeth according to other forms, and these types of reorganization tools should be prepared by you, which you will see soon:
Chapter XXX.
Chapter 30: On the removal of teeth.
Understand that you should cure the tooth from all pain until complete removal of it, which is not a cause that replaces the symptom when it is removed, which is sublimation where an abatement occurs in the removal of it.
When the patient is convinced that they must have their tooth removed, you must surely be certain which tooth is painful. Observe the spread of the pain under the patient's tongue and confirm where it falls upon a healthy tooth, then remove that tooth, and soon the pain ceases until the diseased tooth causing pain has been eradicated; this we have seen through surgical operation of barbies.
Therefore, you must be certain which tooth is painful, and how you know this well, then observe that when you incise in the circuit of the tooth at the gum line where there might be any anomaly, within that it dissolves from the tooth of the gums on every side, and closely hold those to your speech or with fine knives at the corner gradually, until that concludes.
And closely discuss with the patient's strength holding large gauzes for good communication or splinter shock, place your hands on the back of the patient so that you do not harm them, and carefully remove the tooth according to rectitude in manner, without piercing it, nor cause greater pain to the patient.
And therefore, if it is not yet removed, then take one of those instruments, and place your fingers on the patient from all parts with ease and effort in removing them as smoothly as possible, starting from the beginning.
And if the tooth is extracted or corroded, then observe that you must cover it with a cloth and hold it at the subtle tip of your thumb to prevent it from being sucked during your compression over it while holding your fingers.
And when you incise delicately at the scarification around the entire part of the gum and preserve your strength so that you do not pierce it and damage any part of him, return to the patient for the cunningness that is more than her first pain.
And remember not to do what some ignorant barbers do in their rashness and audacity during removal, as they don't administer what we have recommended; when observed under the skin come great ailments upon men that are more difficult than sucking out, and all of their swollen glands, or some of those, or that you remove from certain bones of the jaw, as we have testified.
And after removing him, wash his mouth with vinegar or add salt to it.
And if it needs to drain pus through the hole, like when observed leaking out, then add a quantity of honey and sprinkle it on the wound. If that honey doesn't heal, then cauterize.
The form of the forceps and delicate tongs under which the tooth is held at the beginning should be of long extremity, short handle and thick, so that they don't bend when you use those.
And let them be as thick handled so that when you stretch them with those, they don't bend, their ends being short.
And they should be made of iron from India, with straight ends, and the ends of those should have teeth from which one can insert into the others by bending down forcefully, and some of their ends are the shape of a bird's beak that is called stork, so it's sturdy, and they have strong constriction.
Title XXI
On the removal of teeth and extraction of jaw bones that are sucked out.
When you need to remove a tooth that is sucked out by some cause, then observe that you should place your fingers on the spot about the gum for a day or for two until that place is softened; and then insert or hold the ends of which are assembled to the beak of a bird called stork or glove, in the form of forceps:
The ends of them should be made as inside as a rasp or an axe.
And if you do not adhere to this advice with these forceps or tongs, then observe that you dig into the gland and remove all the flesh, and insert the tool which is called an awl, it being a small lever of which the shape is as follows:
And let it have a short extremity thick on one end and not be bent so that it doesn't get sucked.
So if the gland is already opened by this, it's good; otherwise, help yourself with these other instruments which have these forms: the form of the first tool is triangular at the end in which there is some thickness:
The form of the second tool is that it be triangular and have a more delicate extremity.
And already help yourself with this tool having two ramps as follows: And also with other tools which precede in the cleaning of teeth; when youth is made with this tool which resembles a large wolf, and it has this shape:
Of the triangular bent or short extremity, which is some thickness, and not bent so that it doesn't get sucked.
And know that the tools for cleaning teeth are similar to other tools.
The artisans are wise and subtle in their craft, finding for themselves according to what it means to them the operation and various ailments; for the ailments to which the ancients would neither describe nor use proper instruments, due to their varied forms.
And if it is sucked out the bone of the jaw or other bones in the mouth, then place your weight on that at its location with what suits him for the tools and forceps which we have said about removing glands from teeth, help yourself with this gesture:
And if there is any lump, it should be treated gradually, and bound around the mouth so that it doesn't escape or the scent doesn't enter before the hole in the bone is fully opened; then return to its place with appropriate medicines for this purpose.
If there is a small boil in the bone, then remove that from its surrounding area and its blackness, and treat it internally until it heals.
Chapter XXXII
On the treatment of prominent teeth over others.
When teeth are prominent not according to their natural course and in that form they are stuck, especially more so when it affects women, and even more for the most distinguished elderly ladies; therefore consider this: if a tooth is in no way attached to another tooth, and there's no possibility of extraction or application of a salve on it, then that tooth needs to be extracted. However, if it is not connected to another tooth, then you should incise that with an instrument whose form resembles this; it looks like the cutting of pork, made from Indian iron having extremely sharp edges.
And make your incision on the area where you would cut that tooth for too many days due to its hardness of the tooth, and make sure it doesn't resemble another tooth.
And if it's an extracted prominent tooth as sharp as a file, then file that with a file made of Indian iron having this form:
It is all made of Indian iron and the groove is sharpened just like when you file with a tool that has needles on it. It should be used in the form of small cuts over soft days for ease, so that no other tooth becomes similar or breaks off. And at the end carve it gradually, and shave it with a small razor.
And if it's a tooth where one part is broken and touches the tongue, then consider that you should file that in the area where the roughness of that fraction is smoothed and leveled, and ensure it is filled so that the tongue doesn't hurt nor does speech become impaired.
Chapter XXXIII
On restoring teeth that are lost in the gum using gold or silver.
When teeth are lost due to impact or blow, and the patient cannot bear on what they eat, and you have treated that with stomatic medicines, but your treatment was not effective, then considering it's necessary not to allow them to fall into those that are lost in the gum of gold and not silver, for silver tends to turn green, and you can leave it there for a few days, whereas gold does not change color under any circumstances.
And let the gum have such subtlety and thickness according to how much could possibly enter between the teeth; regarding the shape of the implantation you should take the gum and place twice as much as that between two healthy teeth, and so that it grows with the double curvature of the gum between two lost parts, whether one or multiple, until it reaches the thread to the healthy tooth of the remaining part. And repeat this insertion into the part where you started, and strengthen your hand with ease and knowledge so that it doesn't become lost.
And when you tighten the thread with which you hold the gum, make sure that there is no escape for it.
And then with the forceps or remove them all, place those in every position during the operation, and hide those as well between the healthy tooth and the lost tooth, so that it doesn't cause injury to the tongue. And then flatten that inserted like a Roman would.
If it's slipped or broken, strengthen that or those with another gum in such a manner throughout its entire period.
And this is the form of teeth and the figure of restoring two healthy teeth and two lost ones, like this as many times as these are used:
And when you return one or two teeth back in their respective places and they grow as we've recounted, and that they regain.
And do this only a skilled artisan and wise person should.
And sometimes it's appropriate to use a cause of cow bones, and made from them as the form of a tooth, placed in the location where a tooth fails, and is strengthened as we have said, and remains and serves for a long time.
Chapter XXXIV
On the incision of the lymph that appears in the tongue and prevents speech.
This lymph that appears leaving the tongue in some cases or is natural which humans are born with, or accidentally occurs due to a wound that has already become established.
And the operation on you is that you open the mouth of the patient, locate its original position there; and elevate their tongue, then incise that lymph along with nerves according to the width where the tongue has been freed from its recent location.
If there is any hardness or clotting in that area, and it has become established due to the healing of the wound, then you cut out an incision across the width where you have incised the lymph, so that the clotting dissolves.
And make sure that a crack is not made in the edge of the flesh and that you cut here so that pus can drain.
And afterwards wash the remnants of the incision with hot water or add vinegar or scrub with water; and then have the patient rest their tongue in this position for every night so that it does not become established as another clotting.
If there occurs a flow of gall, place over the location where it is emitted; but if the gall escapes, then cauterize the location with an irritating cautery which you apply to that area. And that cure addresses other causes within so that they may be healed.
Chapter xxxv.
For the extraction of a boil, use your tongue.
Sometimes blisters occur on your tongue, resembling small pustules that prevent the tongue from performing its natural function. And enlarge them until they fill up the mouth.
And in the operation, you open the patient's inner thigh sixty degrees towards the sun and consider the boil.
And if you find it a dark color or black and hard, which the patient does not feel, then do not touch that which is tender.
And if it has turned to whiteness, in which there is moisture, then you place the needle inside, and cut that under a thin surface, and cut from all sides; and if gall comes out during your operation, then pause over its right side, which is the gall bladder, so as to restrain the gall.
And continue with your work until you have treated it according to its needs, after washing it with warm water and salt; and treat that according to the other treatment for it so that it may be healed.
Chapter xxxvi.
For the extraction of boils on both ears and that which is nothing in the genital region, as well as other boils.
When it comes to the genital region, they are glands that are gathered in this area, and sometimes they appear outside and are called the two ears. When you treat them as we have said in the division, and if they are not healed, then you consider if the boil is hard, of dark color, with little sensation; then do not touch that with iron.
And if it is of yellow color and the root is thick, then do not touch that with iron because of the flow of gall; before letting it rest so that it matures, and then either you drain that, or it will burst on its own.
And if it is of white color, soft, and the root of it is thin, then that which must be considered to be cut.
And for the operation on this patient, you consider whether before your operation, if the boil has rested under the cauterization or if it has diminished with some diminution; then have the patient stand in front of the sun, and the head be up to your left side, open his mouth, and the servant take between their hands his tongue, leaving it on an instrument made from a noble material which has this shape:
And make it of silver or gold, and let it be thin like a thorn.
So when you press on that tongue and it shows the boil to you, and place your fingers on that area, then take the needle and make an incision there, and pull that outwards as much as you can from all directions. Also, if you remove some cause of the tunics, then cut that with an instrument which has this shape:
Also, if you remove some cause of the tunics, then cut that with an instrument which has this shape: It is similar to forceps, but the extremities of it are curved so that the opening of each one of those faces in front of the other, sharp, made of iron and flattened.
If this instrument is not present for you, then cut that with the surface of it which has this shape: It is sharp on one side, but not sharp on the other.
And after you have cut one side, then cut the other according to this method of incision, and afterwards apply the patient with rubbing water.
And if it comes to the flow of gall, apply water from the decoction of hops or mistletoe leaves and resemble that among the causes that restrict, so as to restrain the flow of gall, and then treat that until it is healed.
And sometimes blisters occur in the genital region other boils besides those two ears, then cut them according to what I have said and told about cutting both surfaces equally.
And I have already treated a woman with a boil which was native in her genital area, this boil had a dark color, little sensation, it had already clotted her genital area and the woman could barely breathe, she was also prohibited from eating and drinking water, she was already on the brink of death if not for one more day or two.
And the boil had swollen so much that it contained two garlic cloves between which they could pass through with their fingers.
And I cut it in the middle and left him with one of his needles, then pulled that out, and then pushed out most of its large portion, then I incised where I understood from the other side of the cut, and forced the patient's mouth open, pressed their tongue, and then placed the needle into that boil.
And I removed a large part of it, and there flowed out only a little gall from it. Then the genital region of that woman was completely restored, she started drinking water again and shortly after began eating food. So I did not stop cutting from that boil for a long time, and another boil formed in place of it, which continued to incise until that prolonged itself.
Then I open and cauterize the groin of the patient, then proceed to additional procedures; and afterwards I wander around, not knowing what God did with that part towards me.
Chapter xxxvii.
Of the beginning of the boil when it is infected.
When phlegm accumulates in the tonsil, and it is infected and extensive, then it is called "perpendicular"; and if it is at a point on your left side that is thick and round, then it is referred to as "a boil".
When it is cured with what we have discussed in the division, and you do not follow your treatment, and especially when there's a boil that has been cauterized already and subsided from you, if it becomes subtle, then consider that you need to make an incision where the new lump has formed circularly; and if it is along that length, and it bleeds, of a dark color or black, and is not in your hands, then you should prepare for making an incision here, because there's fear towards the patient.
And when you do that according to the manner I've instructed regarding its whiteness and length, have the patient open their mouth and press their tongue with an instrument whose shape allows for it to rest on the new location in the mouth, then pull it down and make an incision using one of two instruments as described in the section about making incisions between two teeth.
And you should not make an incision there but only the one that is adjusted to the natural termination of your addition; if you make it too far down, you will damage their speech.
And during the incision, use what we have recommended for the incision between two teeth, and treat it inside so that it heals.
If the patient is frightened by your incision, you should use skill in the cauterization procedure so that their fear does not continue. The method of cauterization here consists simply of water. You should hold the patient's mouth in place with your hand and gently press their tongue against the tool we've described, taking water from what is called the cauterization section and applying it to this area while making sure there is a living flame but not too thick or thin. Then fill the cavity of the instrument with this water:
Let the cavity of your incision be filled with medicine like that used in cauterization and place it on the patient's tongue so that they may saliva or gargle inside their mouth because of the intrinsic medicine, ensuring no unnecessary discomfort on the palate and preventing damage to them.
And afterwards hold your hand over the medicine and squeeze it onto the uvula for about half an hour while you observe that it has turned black and been soothed by the chewing of the medicine.
And if you wish, take hold of and wrap that around the end of the tongue, submerge the stick in medicine, insert the tongue into this channel so that the stick adheres to it within this tube. Do this several times until you get what you want from the cauterization of the uvula, then leave it to dry out which should happen approximately three or four days later.
And if you find that you need to repeat the medicine, do so, then for cauterization clean out the channel of the uvula with a moistened stick, modify it according to what's in this channel of your medicine. Wash it with water and further treat with ointment externally, clean it inside with a tongue scraper until it heals.
And this kind of treatment saves from the incision and removes fear.
Some healings are treated by the one that is made subtle with cauterization and incision, which heals through sub-inhalation in this manner: collect camomile, ivy, dog rose, mugwort, Arabic gum, chamomile, thyme, and similar substances from among herbs; adjust all these causes or some of them into a mixture, and let it be submerged in hot water, then boil. Let the mixture be strained into broth, and place an earthenware pipe on this mixture with its mouth up. Make it from silver or metal according to this manner.
And place the tip in the patient's mouth so that the steam rises to the uvula on the tongue, while the uvula is somewhat obscured.
And afterwards apply it to the healed spots while they are still moist, remember not to perform this treatment at the time of the boil's appearance as it might damage the boil excessively, and do not do what I've instructed but rather declare the need for cauterization regarding their boil.
If this tool is not available to you, then take a stick and apply a bundle of garlic at the tip of his mouth, so that the patient's mouth swells, for which the garlic prevents steam from burning their mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter xxxviii.
Of the removal of thorns and what adheres in the palate, as well as other causes.
Healed spots adhere in the palate or thorns from plants, or some other cause.
Then you should remove what is apparent from those, on which you can see, for when you press the tongue against the tool in front of your soleil, then it will be made clear to you what is in the mouth.
And what is not present and hidden in the belly, seek to make the patient vomit before the food becomes digested in the stomach; thus, if the cause of this issue lies within the belly, the vomiting will force it out; or let the patient swallow a piece of bread, or a spoonful of raw lettuce juice or a handful of dry flour; or take a piece of sea sponge and bind it tightly with a bandage; then let the patient pass it through their mouth until they reach where the obstruction is, so that vomiting will occur from there. And take an eel and drink it with tightly bound lips, then place it inside your stomach gently and extract it; or take a spoon and gently put it in your mouth and carefully remove the obstruction.
If vomiting does not occur with those causes we've mentioned, then use this lead tool according to this form:
And if the lump is large enough to pierce through a small hole, then at the tip of it place something that you will insert into their throat with ease.
And have them raise their head upwards, and ensure that you do not touch the inside of their throat, in order to allow it to pass through their body and remove whatever is causing pain or discomfort from within the throat, or what the doctor removes with their hand.
Yet have the patient lie on their back with the stomach towards you, according to their knowledge of the location of the source of the issue and remove it downwards, then place your hand on the tool, doing everything as prepared within them until vomiting occurs.
Capitol. XXXIX.
Regarding the extraction of gallstones attached to the belly.
When gallbladder medicine has been prescribed as we have indicated in the division of treatment with medicines and not responded, consider doing this on the belly of the patient towards the sun, because you will understand their tongue with an instrument that we recommended.
So if you remove the gallstone, extract it at a small size or in subtle stages.
And if it's not possible to extract it at that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the belly of the patient, and place near the concavity of the cannula a heated iron, and do this as many times (until the gallstone dies and leaves the stomach) and advise the patient to drink only water for the whole day.
And then take a basin full of water and make the patient open their mouth with that, and wash their mouth with it; do not swallow any cause from that and let the water sit for an hour in your hand before the patient, as soon as they feel the water flow.
And if vomiting does not occur with what we've recommended, then fumigate the patient with garlic or with asafetida using the tool that we recommended for fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, and let it take its effect.
And another method of operation in fumigation is as follows: take an earthenware bowl containing burning charcoal and cover it with a cloth in the middle of which there's a handle; place the tip of the tool inside this handle; then hold the bowl above the fumigation area; have the patient put their mouth at the tip of the cannula, close their mouth so that the fumigation does not escape until you know that the fumigation reaches the gallstone; as soon as it's in contact with the gallstone, it will start reacting.
And if it doesn't react, then repeat the fumigation several times, and keep the patient from drinking, eat salty foods and others, and don't drink water, and it is necessary that this regimen be followed.
And this is the form of the tool with which gallstones are removed from the belly when seen; it's similar to forceps like these, except if it has some curvature in it: Which is flat towards the belly, and the end of it resembles a flamingo's beak that is rounded, which when you grasp any substance, won't slip.
Capitol. XL.
This is the summary of the discourse regarding blisters and their section.
Blisters are special spots, of bodily origins, according to the memory recall, from any in this book.
And they are various in penetration and section of them by two methods, among which one is through the peculiarity of blisters themselves; and due to their absorbing moisture.
And the second method is on the locations where they occur in the body, for blisters occurring in the head are different from those that occur in the anus; and the blister in the meaty location is different from the blister at the juncture; and each has its own way of operating.
And some blisters are those which only need to be pierced after their healing progresses or completion.
And other blisters are those which need to be pricked immediately upon crossing them and not wait for their completion as in the case of blisters close to joints; when a blister approaches a joint, prolong the being of it until you place what is inside it into its circuit, causing corruption of the fibers or nerves at that joint leading to contraction of that limb; or if a blister is near a main member and you delay piercing it until it matures, it will affect the main member; or if it's close to the anus, prick that unripe one; and don't pierce in an unevenly digested area but rather the one near the anus, so its passage doesn't get elongated within the parts inside the anus leading to a fistula formation; or if it's done at the end of the member which isn't healed. When you know the time for the puncturing of the abscess, this is when it has ripened.
And know that it has ripened when the pain and fever have subsided, and near the reduction of sweating and pulse, and the sharpness of the abscess head, and other signs.
And when you know to puncture it at the spot of pus below the abscess and from the discharge of pus coming from the inflammation.
Puncture promptly according to the length of the flesh or body, if abscesses are in parts of the muscles or feet, and on spots of lumps, along the cords of nerves, blood vessels; and, later, in all equal places where reflection does not occur; for those that reflect do so, use puncturing according to that member.
When the abscess is in a fleshly spot, then it's that you make the puncture within which digestion of it follows according to complement, as we have said; for if you puncture it before that point, it prolongs the duration of the disease and the hardness of the pus, and thickens its fluids.
Puncture such abscesses according to the width of the flesh or body as necessity demands, or according to which part the member requires.
And know that you should administer a small puncture, and in large abscesses, a large puncture or an incision with some pus collection according to the variety of the size of the abscesses.
And others are of abscesses in which it is known that the opening should be brought back and be sewn up, when done so with bread and made in time that it already sticks, as happens in many cases of dubel and bubo.
And of those that are cut at a point having three corners; and of those it's done in the manner of a thorn figure, as with gout abscesses.
And among them are those where circular section and lunar section are administered, resembling those.
And for that which cannot be handled as such as with superficial lion abscesses, know that you should puncture it at a superficial puncture, or just flatly so.
And when the abscess is thick and has already collected clean pus, puncture it and do not worry about removing all the pus at once; take out some part of it, then restitch the abscess by another day, then extract a larger part, and proceed to make pus discharges according to graduation until it's hole-drained.
And most importantly if the patient is of a green blood type, or female weakness, or small child, or old in decrepitude, for when the animal spirit pus is resolved with the discharge of clean, it weakens the suffering and thickens the patient, so you open them.
Take great care with this chapter, and your puncture where you are puncturing these abscesses, know that you clean the infections and consider hence whether the pus of the abscess is small or a flat section; then administer remedies or local remedies accordingly. And if the abscess is large, and the cracks of the puncture are pus-filled, then know that you should place stitches in each thread as they reach their time.
And if in the abscess is separated a part of the opening or has concaved that on the circuit, then know that you should complete it with old thread or make stitches from linen fabric as when you remove bandages or roots, consider humidity; strengthen it by the third day; and proceed with that and cure what covers the ointments until it's healed.
And if it happens that you are bleeding with your surgical operation, then you administer cold water and vinegar in which you immerse a linen cloth, and place that over the area of blood pus discharges.
And if bleeding persists, then know that you should administer remedies and treatment with the powders which I have recommended in locations of our book and division.
And if it's in winter time, and the location of the abscess is on a spot with nerves, then know that you should dust powders in vinegar and oil caut, and place those over the spots.
And if it's in summer, and the areas are fleshly, then know that you should apply powdered substances in water or oil, or with vinegar and oil, all of which should be rubbed until by the third day, as we have said, and then know that you should relieve the abscess and clean that and administer remedies for its treatment until it's healed.
And this is what is necessary about the knowledge of abscess treatment universally, but according to the way of distinction that I have said for all abscesses in how their treatment proceeds through specific chapters.
Chapter 41.
Concerning the section of abscesses which occur in the neck region.
In the neck area small abscesses, they are of special lymph nodes which contain layers that form them; and the types of their pus.
And about their pustules, and those that contain moisture resembling lime. And about those which contain moisture resembling dust, and resemble them; and about those which are hard, lumpy.
And in the section of all, and in the extraction of those there is no fear, just like with the extraction of those that do not involve constriction of blood vessels.
And the operation in this section is that you apply those with instruments of a shape that is somewhat like it, which are called prongs, so you know what they contain.
And if it is moisture that causes it, then divide that in this section according to its length by sections superficially following this form:
And start from the section of line .B. within the line of .G. Then, as the moisture is evacuated, then you excise that skin which contains that moisture, and do not leave any cause of it from all, so when checked you return, if from that there was any cause.
And then immerse it in Egyptian oil if there is any, or else in water and salt; fill that with the wound and let that stay inside for another day, so when you eat it away completely what remains from that skin.
And then repeatedly apply that Egyptian oil on it twice or as many times if needed, until you are confident that there is no remaining cause of that skin; then treat the wound with oil until it heals.
And if there are fatty nodes in an abscess, then you must cut open that area according to this form: In this section with a cross-shaped form, cut into the two parts of the area's folds and extend it from every direction, and use your strength in extracting the membrane that contains that.
If there is any contradiction with this tool, then do as I first instructed you.
Similarly, do this for the hardened abscess area and its treatment according to what we have told you; the area over a hardened abscess is lightly padded, since it has few scars and little moisture.
And some of these abscesses are in the head in certain men for whom it is not moisture; this cause is when I cut over an abscess on the head of an old woman and treated the abscess like a hard, rough, white stone that could not be squeezed, if another one was touched, it would cause a wound.
And in other abscesses incidents in the head like this are not the brain, as with the abscesses that come to the heads of children and you should consider the reasons for the earlobes, but the area of all these is superficial.
And pause in making the incision at the lower part of each for that may relieve the body from parts that are lower.
And then treat those according to what is suitable for their healing process.
Capitol 42.
Section on the lymph nodes that occur in the neck.
These abscesses are found in the neck and underarms, as well as on the elbows; others may occur in other parts of the body.
Those are the ones that occur in the neck; they are lumps that develop within them, and all tuberculous disease of those is within their own membrane, just like in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
The varieties of these lymph nodes are lumps, among which some are hard, and others contain moisture, and those that are malignant do not respond to treatment.
Then in that one you must have good disposition in the touch, whose color which is manifest corresponds to the color of the blood, and it affects all parts, and does not stick to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the sinew, and it is not a swelling when you cut open that in the dry superficial part of the body above the line of .G. between the lines of .B., and scorch it from every side, then extend the folds of the neck with one, or with several more if necessary, as we have said for abscesses on the head, and extract that little by little.
And it is better caution not to cut into the vein or nerve.
And if the knife is not sharp enough to fit your hand during the cut or harms the patient, you should not make unnecessary cuts; so if you were to cut into a vein or artery and forbid yourself from continuing with your operation, then pause on the inflamed wound, use powders that keep the pus flowing, strengthen the wound, and leave it inside until the abscess's inflammation subsides and the wound softens and begins to heal. When the pus is eliminated.
And return to your operation while you complete it.
And then inquire about the things you have described for the other small lymph nodes, therefore cut those and clean them.
And if it is in the area of a large lymph node vein, then you should not cut that lymph node from its area. Before this, lay that on a thick board so that it will fall by itself when you remove the obstruction.
And then fill the wound with old leather which you have already immersed in Egyptian oil, and treat that.
And if you cut the entire lymph node, then proceed to adjust the two flaps of the wound so that there is neither a superfluous nor a remaining cause.
And if you notice there is excess cause due to the size of the lymph node, then proceed to understand where to cut it, remove that and perform suture as described.
And for those with scrophula containing moisture, puncture that at the surface opening here where it appears in your patient's location of maturation, and make a puncture of that which is beneath their body pus, as we have said.
And make a close incision, you must dress it and resemble those, so that the pus that is in the inflammation rots. And when you turn the wound which has already healed, then you treat that with meat-generating ointment until it heals.
Chapter 43.
Of the section of the neck in a pustule occurring within the scrotum.
The ancients dissected this section in the prepuce, and not seeing anyone in our land who has done that.
And this is the inscription of the report of those things.
And in men there is a corner, cover that the removal of the prepuce takes place without causing pain, because thus it is not done violently where all the veins and major blood vessels are here.
And in those who have pustules in the mouth or scrotum or both ears, when the testicle is not in the canal, it's best to avoid the section of the prepuce and prevent the loss caused by puncture.
So when we want this, I would make an incision in the prepuce with three circles of the prepuce's circles, or four on a smaller section by its width in that which is between two circles according to quantity, making the incision within the skin, not the cartilage. This location is suitable for the incision, being without flesh and the blood vessels from it are veins.
And if the doctor is inexperienced, it's best that he extend the scrotum line to the inner side, then make an opening in the membrane so that it reaches into the canal, but avoid blood vessels or veins like those anywhere.
And make the incision there as we have recommended; and it indicates on that part of the canal by the lump which is from that eruption in that which has burst out, and by the retraction of the swelling.
And let the opened wound heal for some time.
Therefore, when the time is ripe for the feared puncture, add two layers of the membrane of the wound, and if that alone is bone.
And apply medicines that cause the flesh to regenerate until it heals.
And as for Al-Bucasis, the summary of our report is that some of these pustules have already opened the scrotum of the testicle, and the testicle has gone into death, and the body of him is decomposing. Some would incise the epiglottis so that he could breathe the testicle over the site of the wound for one breath, and be saved from death.
And for this reason, let the wound remain open until its malice is consumed; and the malice of it lasts three days; and then order thus the wound, and treat that until it heals.
And what I have seen personally, is that a servant had a catel and spend months in her scrotum and made an incision on one part of the lung canal, and I was called to treat him, and he cried thus like those who die, and uncovered the wound and took up the blood which was seeping from the wound small.
So I was compelled to confess that it had not punctured a vein or artery, and the wind escapes from the wound, and treated that until it healed.
And nothing befalls the servant unless not even in veins, and some days return to his health.
And I would say that there is no fear in the section of the prepuce.
Chapter 44.
Of the section on pustule which occurs outside the scrotum, and is called the scrotal hernia.
This pustule named scrotal hernia is a large pustule according to the color of the body, and it moves in women.
And there are two ways, whether it is natural or accidental.
And in the natural case, there is no need to treat it.
And the accidental occurs in two ways of which one is like fatty nodes, and the other way is like pustule which happens due to blockage of an artery, and in that there is fear. And do not assume that it has been squeezed out with iron rather than in the smaller one. And you should examine that and investigate it according to the description, and if you find it similar to fatty nodes, and is not suspended by any of the veins, then make an incision on it as with nodes, and extract it from what contains it in the skin and fat; and otherwise, it's examined thoroughly of its nature, then treated that where it directs for treatment until it heals.
Chapter 45.
Of the section on types of nodes.
Of the types of nodes, I have already described all their types in the division.
And you should note this difference between node and exiture that may cause doubt.
And I say that with exiture is heat, fever and violent pains within which the bubbling of excess ceases; and the process of putrefaction is completed when later fever, pain, and heat cease.
May it be that there's neither heat nor fever nor pain, and consider that lion's tooth which is inside the stomach itself.
And it depends on the color of the body, and the patient's appetite is like a fever, and this happens similarly to digestion, whether it is more or less, and there are two types according to that; some contain fat and retain moisture, and the colors of moisture are spots, as I explained in the division.
Therefore, when you come to the treatment of inflammation, remove it and examine it at the appetite for a substance which is called an introse, according to what comes to its form in the caput that is near this.
And this is the method for examining abscesses and all types of nodes; you take this substance and introduce it into the pus-containing wet spot that you find in the abscess, and you will move your fingers into that little by little until you know that the substance has penetrated the chain.
And as you approach your hand according to the size of the abscess, and then extract that introse substance and consider what is situated in the remnant of it.
And if the moisture is removed, regardless of its color, then you incise on the superficial section as I have said in other abscesses.
And if there is no moisture left of that introse substance, then you will know that it is fatty.
Dry on it as the incision has taken the form of a cross according to this manner: As such as you have been taught, suspend it with strings, and scrape the skin from all sides with ease, and keep the membrane or sac, if possible, over that one and extract that health from the node.
May it be that if it is broken during the operation, it's not possible to extract that health, and spots observed inside must do so, then you will extract it piece by piece without causing any damage.
That is, if it returns for some reason, either partially or completely, the node returns as before.
And if you notice that some small part of it returns, then fill the wound with some corrosive and sharp powders, strengthen the wound, place your hand over the spot that was an abscess, and treat this other way until it heals.
And if it's a large node, then you open both of its lips and treat that as what inflames.
May it be that if there is pulsatile pain, or not, then you cut and apply heat to the area of the boil that is under the skin, smoothing that stretch for two days or three until the wound heals, and stops the bubbling of the blood; and then return to incise that which has been broken from the node.
Capitol Chapter XLVI
Regarding the necessary forms of the substance in section and puncture.
Among those are the forms of the introse substances, and they are of three kinds, which among them is large, and from those it's intermediate, and from those it's small.
The form of the large introse is this:
The form of a small introse is this:
Let them be made with iron, in alchemical substances, from the ends of fallen limbs appropriately, so as to stimulate the internal substance in abscesses.
And these are the forms of the experiments, and they are named differently, one of which is called blood.
They are of three kinds; some of them are large, intermediate, and small.
The form of the large experiment has the form of this:
The form of the intermediate experiment has the form of this:
The form of the small experiment has the form of this:
It is necessary that they pass through those abscesses, exits, and fistulas, and boils so that within them are from the bones and other causes.
They are round forms, large ones, lions, like large needles where the thorns stick to them, and they are made of iron, or of brass, or of silver; and the best are when they are made of citrine iron.
And they are experiments of black feathers which you remember to have opened those fistulas in the cavity where reflections reside, that those reflections are reflected on their lightness towards those reflections.
They are of three kinds; some of them are long, and of the others intermediate, and of the others short, according to the quantity of thickness of the fistula and the constriction thereof.
The form of the large lead experiment:
The form of the intermediate lead experiment:
The form of the small lead experiment:
The forms of the strings are of special spots; some of them are simple ones, which have only a curvature, and they are of three kinds: large, small, and intermediate.
And from those come threads, and they are of three kinds.
And among those come threads with two curves, and they are of three kinds.
And among them come threads with three curves, and they are of three kinds.
And all these are necessary in their place.
The form of a small simple thread has the form of this:
Method for treating gout in a large joint with two curves: Method for treating gout in the middle joint with two curves: Method for treating gout in the little toe with two curves:
Method for treating gout in a large joint with three curves:
Method for treating gout in the middle joint with three curves:
And these are the forms of the scalpels by which they cut and pierce the nodes and abscesses, and there are three kinds of them, where among those one is large, middle-sized, and small.
Form of a large scalpel:
Form of the medium-sized scalpel:
Form of the small scalpel:
The ends of those (scalpels) on which sections are made are sharp, and the other ends are not sharp. They are not used in such a manner, but rather so that during the scraping of nodes there is no risk of cutting into a vein or nerve, and for those treatments to benefit the patient and bring them tranquility. A small part through this adjustment brings about the excision of abscesses.
And these are the forms of lancets; there are three kinds: large, middle-sized, and small, just like arrows.
They are made of ivory and resemble reeds, on which alcohol is applied.
And in the end piece there's a perforation on the hidden surface and within that hole you can reach both inside and outside, as you wish, just like what you see.
The forms of spatulas that you hide between your fingers should be used to pierce abscesses and not allow the patients to feel their discomfort. There are three kinds of them: large, medium-sized, and small. And these are the forms of those:
The forms for suction cups which reduce the flow in diseases, there are three types: large, medium-sized, and small; these are their forms:
They are made of citric ivory, round with some length, and they are delicate.
And you should have these types of suction cups: large, medium-sized, and small, for when you need to quickly remove the flow from disease. Otherwise, when medicine is first applied, it doesn't happen this way.
However, do not use those to expel blood everywhere in the body; instead, use them only on fatty areas. Such as on the knuckles and thighs, and on the elbows, breasts, belly, testicles, and similarly on fatty moist lumps.
Some operations are performed with those tools or small objects resembling pins according to this shape; when done through phlebotomy, the blood is removed, or if you need to cut a vein or artery.
Some operations are performed in a circular manner according to this shape:
Chapter 47:
On the treatment of men's breasts which are made by women.
Some operations cause the men's breasts to swell up like those of certain men when they begin to become fatty. And then the breasts swell and are assembled like women's breasts, and we should use a small amount of remedies far away from them.
And for those who apply this, know that you should cut the lunar section according to this shape, from line B to line G. Then scrape off all roughness and fill in the entire wound with ointment medicine, adjust both edges of the wound for stitching, and treat it inside so that it heals.
If the breast sinks to the sides and becomes softened due to its size like in women, then it should be split into two halves containing pus, each with a cut resembling a lunar figure. Each part should contain the other half of each segment so that the larger line contains the smaller one according to this form between lines B and G. Then scrape off the redness which is between the edges of the wound, remove the swelling, and apply as previously mentioned about stitching and powders until it heals inside.
And if you do not complete the cutting of what needs to be cut due to anxiety from the patient and bleeding, then you should fill the wound with corrosive ointment and treat it inside so that this corrodes the fatty tissue, and afterwards heal it once it has been treated.
Chapter 48:
On the piercing of abscesses that appear under the nipples.
The abscesses that appear under the nipples are of the species of scrofula, thorns, which contain a skin that is pus-filled.
And among those that contain moisture; these ones with moisture should be cut according to this shape: from line G. to line B. And when all the pus in the abscess has been removed, then fill it with a paste and treat it on the other day.
And then keep the wound clean with a suitable ointment for a while until it heals.
And if the abscess from the glands or from the catguts is present, then you cut in that place as we have said in the section about catguts for equal treatment.
And if the wound is spreading to an area that causes secondary infection, then apply the cautery according to what we have previously described.
Chapter XLIX.
Section on abscesses that occur due to cutting or through veins.
When the cut is ruptured and the coagulum (clot) above that place causes an abscess, then pus accumulates forming an abscess. The symptoms to identify whether the abscess or inflammation is due to an artery or a vein include: when an abscess caused by an artery extends throughout the body; and when you press on the abscess at your fingertips, you feel a rasp sound.
And that which is due to a vein shows up more clearly in the symptoms of the body.
And this section is about that abscess, especially when it comes to the symptoms, and in anginas, and in the throat, and in fixed body parts; and it's a large one, so iron treatment should be avoided until its cure. And in those at the extremities, or at the head, then iron intake should be avoided as well.
About the one that is due to inflammation of the opening of the cut, split in the coagulum section longitudinally; and then ligate the section with strings and close to the cut, and remove from the tunics where it's exposed.
And then proceed with that needle and make it penetrate into the other side, strengthen the cut with iron at two points, - which causes you to feel your strength in the removal of two cuts which are in the temples.
And then prick that spot which is between two ligaments under the skin until you can release the whole infection, and dissolve the abscess.
And then proceed with the treatment under which they are formed to fall into the ligaments; and continue with the care using suitable ointments until it heals.
And if it's an abscess due to a vein section, you should use your hand like this that is near the point of the abscess in the skin and then insert the needle at the spot where you had placed your hand earlier with your finger. Then make it penetrate; and inside that thread double, as I have told you when using two threads on both ends of the thread at the ends of the ligament.
And if you fear that you will cut the thread, then insert iron into that needle so that all the abscess from the first needle is in it. And strengthen your iron at four points.
And then dry the abscess in the middle of it until when you sit like this with it, then cut off the excess skin from it, and leave what is tied to it.
And then place on the powder which you have soaked in vinegar and oil, and continue with the treatment that is done with warm water and ointments until it heals.
Chapter LX of the abscess that occurs due to twisting of nerves.
Just like an abscess occurs in arteries and veins, similarly, an abscess can occur in nerves when they are injured during percussion or due to excessive manipulation, respectively.
And the way it affects is in the places of the supporters or at the heel, or everywhere where the joints swell up.
And this is a heavy abscess, and its color resembles another body's, and it occurs in the larger parts of its disposition beds; when you strengthen it with vehemence, feel in it the thigh-like stupor.
And it's not an abscess that extends throughout the body; instead, there's a release of blood and swelling occurs everywhere, it doesn't go forward or backward to any parts.
So with those that are in the joints, you should not harden them with iron, as it will lead to a contraction force.
And this applies when it's in the head or forehead and releases blood under the skin. And if it's a small abscess, then take it from the edges and cut off that root part.
And if it's large, then support it with a string and scratch that area, then hold it in place. Adjust the wound with stitches, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter LI.
Section on the abscess that occurs from a cold affecting the stomach.
Notice the symptoms found in the stomachs of those individuals and other parts of the body that are called fungal in similarity to fungi, from which the cause is subtle, its head is large; already the lips of these are discussed, it's from those that are small, and it's from those that have greatly increased.
And I have seen one case, in which there were two parts in the stomach that resembled fungi, and there was no difference between those white ones, of subtle origin.
And already the lips of these were turned inside out and would split open, with moisture flowing from them continuously.
So I inserted those and looked into it within a part of eighteen inches on each side. And the other has seen one.
And in the operation at the beginning of their disease, if you consider that the patient is wet and the color of his skin is white, wet, due to subtle sweat; then you will cut with a long incision, and be present as you apply heat on your location, the area where you should remove the sweat, which should be treated with a cautery in fire. If you see the sweat, apply the cautery there.
And if you see that the patient is fearful and anxious, avoid cutting with iron. Instead, take freshly melted lead, strengthen that part of his skin, which works in the way we have described; leave it there for two days.
And adjust closely in the constriction of the lead thread; therefore, do not cease to strengthen the large amount of lead within it until it is separated and falls on its own.
If that part is due to abundant sweat, then there is often a cause of fear and anxiety in it, and especially in the case where it is in the abdomen.
It's possible that you separate his sweat, and then apply heat to that area so that it doesn't return.
And treat that area while the wound is healing.
And remember not to assume that you should cut any part that is of a dark color, with little sensation, under careful observation, for such areas may contain cancer.
And I will come back to remind you about this shortly.
Chapter 52.
On the treatment of the navel prominence.
Navel prominence is caused by various reasons; either due to cracks in the belly which is above the stomach and causes leakage of liquid or intestines according to what happens in other ruptures; or because of a disease that causes fluid to leak from veins or arteries as previously mentioned, or due to constricted wind (possibly referring to air flow) within it.
It might be due to cracks in the belly and due to leakage from the membrane, then the color of the pus is similar to the body's color; it has varying pain intensity and appears at various locations. And if it's due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its location corresponds with what we have recounted earlier, with varying intensity. As you press on that area with your fingers, it becomes concealed, and then returns; it feels soft under your touch, and there is a significant effort needed during insertion, and vigorous work must be done.
It's due to wetness if it is visible and not concealed when you press with your hand, nor is it constricted or bulges.
And if it's due to an infection, then these symptoms will appear on the pus turning black and declining.
It might be due to nothing in the flesh (possibly meaning some sort of lump), then the pus is heavy, large, and hard, and feels like a lump according to the quantity.
It might be due to wind (possibly referring to air or internal movement), then touching it is sensitive.
And in the operation for this, you should consider whether the navel prominence is due to arterial or venous disease, or wind; hence, you should refrain from treating it because there might be fear and anxiety associated with it as we have taught earlier when discussing pus due to arteries and veins.
And if the navel prominence is due to an intestine or membrane issue, then you should command the patient to lie down straight. Additionally, feel around the entire area of the navel, and command that they place their hands against your palms on their stomachs, so as not to obstruct the movement of the intestines. Then circle with a long incision along the circuit of the navel in relation to the point you felt. Extend the pus mass upwards to about half the body, then lie down on the circuit using strong or soft lead, and the method of applying lead should be gradual.
And then, with the spatula extended over the navel and your fingers inserted into that spot, you try to retrieve the intestine. If it is caught or hidden by the membrane, then you quickly remove it and push the intestine back inside the abdomen compartments.
And if you have retrieved the membrane, then take that with a spatula; and cut off the excess parts of it.
If it is contrary to your artery or vein, then encircle that area and proceed with your operation. Take two needles and insert them into those two strong points, and place the needles in the circuit you created around the pus mass in a cross-like manner, making sure they penetrate. Strengthen the pus mass into four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, leave the needles in place so that when the flesh is extended, it falls by itself; or cut that once it becomes thinner and settles, then proceed to cure it with what you apply between when it's healed.
And if the navel prominence is due to nothing in the flesh or due to wetness in it, then you should drain the pus as we have said and remove the infection or wetness found within it. Then proceed to cure that with what you apply so that it heals the area.
Chapter 53.
On the treatment of children.
We have already discussed, in the division, of different types of children's ailments and how they are treated with medicines, that healing without causing harm or ulceration is sought for them; we have also mentioned that diseases of children can be generated from the carelessness and oversight during their treatment.
And it was said by the ancients that some childhood diseases are in locations where their eradication is possible, such as within the brain which can be found in the breasts or on the thighs and similarly distributed throughout the body to remove everything there, especially when they start small.
When it becomes old and intense, don't try to touch them, I cannot cure any of that for you, nor have I seen another, nor has it reached this.
And the operation for you is as we have said when it is distributed in this way, you proceed and leave the patient and purge them of black bile some diseases, then target that, if it is inflamed visibly fills the cavity.
And prepare the patient with preparation in which the operation is located, and proceed with cautery on those that approach that; and make a concave from all sides to ensure good excision without leaving any cause of the reasons for you. And let the treatment flow, and don't abscess it lightly, and press on the areas, and remove any pus in full with your hand or with an instrument of which is within reach among the tools.
And if it causes an opposition of large pus in the flow of vein or artery, then cauterize that within where the pus flow has ceased, and proceed to treat that among the other treatments where it is healed.
"Capitol. Liv." typically refers to a historical Roman structure which served as an administrative center, but without context in this passage, it seems out of place or perhaps incorrectly translated or referenced. If "Capitol" refers to the city, and "Liv" is intended to mean "Life", it might suggest that the text focuses on medical knowledge related to life-saving measures, particularly surgical practices for treating injuries resulting from violence, as indicated by references to wounds inflicted by swords and arrows. However, without more information or context about the translation process or the specific language being used here, a precise interpretation of this phrase is challenging. The original text seems to be discussing various medical procedures including gout treatment, foot surgery, hernia management, patient positioning during procedures, and methods for purging black bile, which are all related to healthcare practices rather than directly linked to "Capitol" or "Liv".
Regarding the treatment of dropsy.
We have already discussed in the division of the species of dropsy from water, and the signs for each type, regarding their treatment we use medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is merely the species of splinters alone, and it does not approach to iron in species of tympanic or in species of syphilitic dropsy, which one is deadly.
And when you have treated this species of dropsy due to ear maladies with medicines and your treatment does not work, consider that if the patient has already become debilitated or if it's a different ailment another type of dropsy, as in their cough or belly and similar conditions, then be careful not to medicate them with iron, for fear is on this.
And if you find the patient with excess vigor and it is not another disease but dropsy alone in them, neither young nor old, then the method of operating on them is that you lift the patient between your hands, then minister to them by pressing their belly with your hand, expel the water from their body at this point opposite the navel. Take a thorn-shaped tool according to this form:
It should be of two parts long and sharp at the tip like a thorn; however, it should be as short as possible gradually in your case, so that during the operation you do not enter into the intestine and that you do not touch it.
And then consider if the generation of dropsy is from within the intestines, in which case you have to look for the section that is three finger-widths away from the navel towards the sides on his right above the belly button.
And if the cause of dropsy is due to a disease in the stomach, then your section should be on the left side of the navel for three finger widths.
And if the cause of the illness is due to bile, then your section should be on the right side.
And don't let your area be over the rib where the patient wants to relieve themselves so that excesses do not flow towards that location.
And then puncture the entire length of the tool through that segment, and insert it into that section. Raise your hand with the spike between the skin and the wound; you should scrape that area off. And if the amount is as long as a finger or slightly more.
And then pierce the siphon so that the spike reaches the place desired, it is the location of water. And then remove that and insert an instrument of which this is the form: and it is similar to a fine silver catheter; it's made of silver or ivory or bone. In the lowest part of its body there is a small tube, and on its sides are three needles: two from one side and one from another side; its tip is cut in such a manner like a feather, as you would see:
And at the end of it there is a larger loop, which when the instrument reaches water, that immediately presses against the instrument, therefore evacuates out water in moderate quantities, if you evacuate too much from it before this, it weakens the patient by resolving their spirit animal or leads them to fainting as death is approaching.
Remove from that according to the quantity of virtue in him and according to what you understand from the position of the patient's body related to the nature of his virtue and the goodness in him.
And then remove the instrument, and heat the water which causes this to be often retained by the obstruction that holds it up on his intestines, where you have noted that you should pierce it according to that method.
And then apply the instrument to the other day if you find that the patient tolerates this, and extract a small amount of water, and do this for several days with caution, and be careful not to let any of the water evaporate rather than a little.
If you fear for the patient, and let out a large amount of water, then treat that as if it were burial in sand, sweat baths in the river, and exposure to the sun for long periods; and treat that with drying medicines until he is healed.
And cauterize over the stomach, and cleanse close to the water extraction site, according to what I have recounted in that which was preceded.
The text seems incomplete or possibly contains a typographical error as "Capitol .lv." doesn't translate into understandable English content. It might be referring to 'capitulum' (chapter) if it's part of an old document, but without context, it's hard to provide an accurate translation or interpretation.
Regarding the treatment of children who are born with unperforated urinary tract obstructions.
Some of the children are expelled from their mother's womb, and the tip of their mixture (or umbilical cord) is not perforated (or it is stretched or not in its proper place).
Then there should be a percutaneous puncture as soon as it is born with a fine needle according to this form:
And then place in the umbilical cord a small lead wire and bind it there, and hold for three days or until it drops.
And when he wants to urinate, let him urine; and then return that (referring to the umbilical area).
And if you do not stop the lead, it is possible that the urine which goes over the place will not close this closure.
Let that in which the umbilical cord is stretched be treated with a lead wire as we have said, for too many days until it becomes widened.
Let those in which the umbilical cord is not in its proper place be left alone, this causes this of them, that which was born with an umbilical cord should pass through the end of the head of the penis so that he cannot urinate in the parts inside; and it does not affect his generation, according to his sperms do not reach the mother correctly, and is a malformation stuck.
The method of the operation in him is that the patient should be on his back and you extend the tip of his penis with your left hand with strong extraction, and cut the head of the penis's tip at the opening in the suture point, like cutting a feather, or without cutting any part, so that the middle section of his foreskin resembles the tip of the penis and that the umbilical cord falls into the middle point according to how you do it.
And be careful in your operation for blood flow, what marks happen when you do this; and pause him at this where you cut off the cord, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Capítulo 56.
Regarding the albata that occurs in the foreskin at the tip of the penis and congestion, darkening, and adhesion of the foreskin at the tip of the penis.
Marks are seen in this albata on the skin, it is an indication of stuck flesh.
And one of them is malignant and the other is not malignant.
Not malignant, do it by suspending with a delicate string and remove that until the entire albata is gone; and then rest on that place dipped in Egyptian oil; and then there, treat with oil until it is healed.
And if the albata is malignant, look at its color, then you should apply cauterization near its cut and its length.
Let it be if the albata is on the foreskin of the tip of the penis in uncircumcised people, and one part of the albata is inside the foreskin and the other part is outside; then let it be that you remove the albata which is inside until it consolidates; and then you treat the outside, when you treat this period, it is not guaranteed that it will not become inflamed.
And just as it happens in the testicles and on the foreskin, turning black and being corroded, then let it be that you remove everything that has already degraded and that is about to corrupt or that has already been corrupted; and draw a line over that area with honey, which gets treated with flour made from rye and poppy seeds and crushed sesame.
And then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Let it be if there's blood discharge, then administer lunar cauterization according to this form:
And the juvenile cauterization is in two positions at once, it's for blood discharge and when the wound gets corrupted.
And if the tip of the penis is corroded and gets completely destroyed at that time, then you should insert a lead catheter into the middle of the foreskin so that the patient urinates through that.
In the adhesion of the prepuce, there is the head of the penis (and this adhesion occurs only in the case where the prepuce is retracted, and on him circumcision is not required; and when adhesion occurs due to disease or abscess), you must cut with a blunt blade until the tissue dissolves and the head of the penis is released from all sides.
And if it is difficult to remove them with great care, then proceed by cutting with the edge of your blade around the cause of the penis head and prepuce, and so when the prepuce, which is delicate, is easily torn through its delicacy, it is just a slight piercing.
Then separate the prepuce from the penis head by a line of its delicacy, which has already been rubbed with water so that it does not adhere to another substance.
And later treat with astringent ointment until it hardens.
Chapter 57.
Regarding the development of children and the treatment of what may occur in those who have been circumcised.
Circumcision is not a solution like other diseases: rather, it's more akin to our operation and our will, and differently from that in others, it is necessary for us to assign the best operation and the least painful means leading to health, particularly in children.
So I say that the ancients did not recommend circumcision in certain free men, who do not use their laws for this, but rather they have acquired it through experience. The reason is that among most artisans and tailors, circumcision and maiming are done on the foreskin and nipples; and they use tendons on the penis and cuts on the thumb.
And I have tried all these methods and found that the best maiming is on the foreskin, using tendons on the penis similar to maiming on the thumb; this protects against cuts and injuries more effectively. The prepuce has two tunics, and the deeper one remains intact, and when it heals from another cut, it causes less pain securely. And in the maiming done by aphecati, which is manual, as blacksmiths use it, it does not ensure a cut at the end of the male organ, for it easily enters the passage of the organ.
Similarly in this operation with the thumb, slightly pressing iron and corroding your operation. And the cord of a child is short by nature, and cuts do not occur in such a manner that it requires maiming, which I have seen.
The maiming done with foreskins and tendons on the penis, its benefits, an insight from experimentation for me, where the foreskins have proportional cuts, so that the sharpness above is as that below; and when you press your hand it proportionally offers two sharpnesses, cutting according to a comparison in one time; and a compression of the penis figure containing the circumcision cord all around, at which there isn't any mistake throughout.
The way of the initial operation is that you make the child stay for a longer period if he's among those who are considered smaller; you do nothing other than let the penis inside its foreskin only, and leave it until another day.
Then proceed to make that pleased in every manner possible that is within your capability as long as he receives his understanding. Then make that person stay among your servants in a prepared manner, and do not let it be too short; hide the foreskins in your hand or leave them on your thigh, so that the child doesn't see those or any other of the tools.
Then insert your hand into the penis of that person and blow in the cord, and pull it so that the head of the penis comes out, then proceed to maim what is added in the area of swelling.
The form of the foreskins in maiming is this:
Let some of the ends be not-cut (uncircumcised) and others be cut, so that it does not exceed the length of the clitoris shaft, and let the length of both sharpnesses be as long as the length of two middle fingers equally.
The mistake in maiming is when you easily cut off the entire intrinsic cord or part of it; you should avoid this cut.
So proceed to extend that of your time on the thumb in front of the abscess at the site, and cut it according to equality.
And if you cannot hold it on your thumb, then cut that with scissors and cut it there.
And if three days have passed, and there remains that is swollen after the circumcision abscess, then you leave it so that the abscess scab falls off, and cut out that with ease, and cut it according to what has been prepared for you.
And protect yourself from the head of the penis, which should not be this way for us.
And so treat that with the powders we have recommended in the chapter on powders.
And if it has descended beyond measure, and follows the divisions above, that will not be good for you.
And treat that with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
On the treatment of urine retention in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstructions due to stone or clotting, or by insertion or foreign objects, and resembles those for which we have discussed methods of treatment in the section.
And if it has not been dissolved as we have said and is very persistent, then the cause must be forcefully applied to the patient, in which case you should prepare for an extraction with a tool called a syringe, of which this is the form: It is made of silver and is slender like lion's tooth, similarly to a needle cannula from Ausel, with a slight thickness equal to that of a long finger, to which there is a fine tube at its tip.
And the method of emptying the urine through that is: hold the bent needle and bind it with wool or thread for a good seal; then insert the ends of the needle into the area around the syringe, and if there's any unnecessary cause from the wool, better to get inside the cannula forcefully. Then pull the syringe towards your body and towards the abdomen.
And have the patient lie over the bed, and wet the bladder and penis with rose oil, olive oil, and water.
And have the syringe inserted smoothly so that it reaches the base of the penis; then fold the penis over above the navel region; and have the syringe pushed inwards; then push that inwards until it reaches the bladder, and ensure that the patient is aligned with an empty cause; this process should not be done out of order but rather based on where there's discomfort.
And have the needle extend through the wool little by little, because urine will wet the wool.
And remove that and perform the urine treatment accordingly, use a syringe, don't stop doing this and use the syringe until the bladder and patient experience relief.
Chapter 59.
On the quality of bladder irrigation with opium and similar instruments which should correspond to this.
When there is an ulceration or abscess in the bladder, or a clot within it, or constriction due to insertion, and you want to distill waters and medicines in that area, then it should be done with an instrument called opium clamp, and this is its form:
If the end of it is blunt, then it closes. And in that there are three tubes: two on one side, as many times.
In the beginning is a concave place, with what is to be inserted, and according to how much is pushed by that, it's added, when any cause is pushed out from that wetness, it's pushed away, and when it's expelled, so is it pushed away, and when it's expelled for a long time, as the opium clamp does in naval battles where naphtha is saturated.
And if you want to stop wetness in the bladder, insert the tip of the opium clamp into the moisture and pull it towards what is pushed out upwards, where the moisture is pulled away into the cavity of the opium clamp.
And then insert the tip of the opium clamp into the penis according to what we have recommended in the syringe; and then push moisture into it as you push it, because that moisture reaches the bladder immediately, and the patient holds onto it.
Shape of the subtle catheter by which the bladder is irrigated, and this is its shape:
And it should be made of silver or bronze; where the tip is slightly like a small feather, and have its tube inside smoothly.
And then take the bladder and stop there where you want to irrigate with moisture in the bladder; then bind that between two with strong thread on each side, and heat that moisture over a flame.
And insert the tip of the catheter into the penis.
And press your hand on the bladder with the moisture, stretch down as much as you can until the patient holds it when that moisture has reached the bladder.
And if you do not have access to the bladder, then take a piece of pork and make it into a circle; puncture that with all its roundness; then insert a strong needle in those tubes as they are turned; then add the circle as it is added greaseproof paper, since you leave in that where you want from the moisture, oil and waters.
And then you lie that one on the instrument and do it in the same way as you did with the bladder, and direct your hand into which moisture will penetrate the bladder.
Chapter 60.
Regarding the extraction of phlegm.
We have already discussed in the division the types of phlegm and treatment with medicine for it, as well as the difference between phlegm produced by heat and phlegm produced in the bladder, and the signs of that.
And we have discussed the phlegm with which one performs an operation on the body, and sectioning.
And the phlegm produced in the bladder is that which is found in the bladder itself.
And I will explain that with clear and brief exposition.
Therefore it is said that phlegm produced in the bladder predominantly affects children. The signs of this are that urine excreted from the bladder is as transparent as water in its subtlety, and appears with sand-like particles; and the patient rubs their penis and gets red marks on the skin, which tend to heal; and there is a passage from this anus through the dung of these.
And healing for children with that happens within twelve years; and it is difficult treatment for the elderly. Among the young, it might be due to this which is between those.
And for that one in which more phlegm is present and the treatment is easier; if it's scarce, it's against that one.
And how do we achieve the treatment of that, we start with the beginning of that which modifies the patient through the cross which draws out all the opening which is in their intestines; for that opening, some treatments prevent the entry of phlegm until their recovery.
And then have the patient lie down with their feet up and let them be strengthened and healed by themselves to ensure that phlegm descends to the base of the bladder or escapes from some place or other.
And then make that incision between your hands that are prepared, and let the rest of their things be left as they are for you, so that the bladder is made to bend downwards towards the parts left.
And then remove that and all that surrounding area.
And if you feel the phlegm in the space, then you quickly cover it with a section over it.
And if you don't cover it all with your touch, then apply oil to your index finger on the left hand, if the patient is an adult, or a small piece of wax if they are a mature young person, and insert that into their anus. And remove the phlegm that remains with your finger. And convert that small amount gradually into the opening of the bladder.
And then press on it with your finger, and expel that towards the parts outside of the body from the area where you made the section.
And command the minister to press the bladder with their hand; and command another minister with their right hand to extend the thighs upwards towards the parts above, and with their other hand lift up the buttocks that are left of the thighs in the part where the section is made.
And then insert a spoon inside which has this shape: And split that which is between the anus and the thighs, not in the middle place, before the left side of the buttock; and make the section over that phlegm and your finger is in the anus, and it should be a transverse section, so that the opening outside is wide and inside narrowed according to the amount that I remove from the phlegm to you possible, but not excessively, for when we hold your finger which is in the anus the phlegm should allow this section, and it is an open-passing without difficulties.
And know that some phlegm is angular and has edges, which makes the passage of this difficult for this reason.
And that one which is lion-like resembling a stick, and is round, and makes it easier for this to pass.
And if it's that one with angles and edges, adjust in the crack.
And if it's not like this open-passing, then apply as you make on that, or strengthen as you make on that decently, the end of which is like a file with which you strengthen over the phlegm, and don't slip from it; or insert your own delicate instrument with curved end.
And if you can't on that, then extend a bit of the thread, and if you want to see blood flow, cut it strongly with vinegar.
And if the phlegm is more than one, then at the beginning you push your hand into the opening of the bladder, and then cut over it; and then push slightly towards that area; and similarly do this if there are multiple small ones.
And if it is large phlegm, then ignorance is that you make this cut with a large section, which can happen to the patient one of two causes: or it dries up or becomes absorbed into the continuous process of urine, so that the body isn't entirely consolidated.
And then administer expulsion of this while it is open-passing, or you make on the crack with scissors so that it pulls out that in pieces.
When you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe leaves and dragon's blood, and strengthen that area. And place over that cloth immersed in oil and vinegar, or in grated oil and water, because the doctor allows pus to escape.
And then have the patient lie down on their back, and do not loosen the bandage for at least one day.
And when you have loosened that, wash the area with water and add oil, and then treat that with tincture of opoponax and tincture of balsam inside until it is healed.
If pus and corrosive matter occur in the wound, adjust it and make it corroding, and let it resemble as if the urine is frozen inside like a bladder, and for this reason urine is forbidden (and this is known by the discharge of urine into the urine). Therefore intervene with what you said in the wound and remove that urine matter, because if Rome causes the bladder to decompose the bladder and its putrefaction.
And then wash the wound with vinegar, water and salt, and against all kinds of opposition, use what is suitable for its recovery until it is healed.
And throughout the entire course of treatment, take care of all the parts and adjust the medicines which are placed on the area.
And if the wound is small and is in the middle of the scrotum, and urine discharge is prohibited, then treat it with what I recommended before you reach that section; and for this treatment many complaints are noted by its completion. And here is how you do it, because you should take a puncturing tool made of iron, which has this shape:
having a triangular tip, sharp, fixed in the handle.
And then take the puncturing tool, hold it against the scrotum leaving the wound so that it does not return to the bladder.
And then insert the iron into the scrotum, puncturing with ease so that the puncturing tool reaches that wound. And rotate the puncturing tool with your hand in that small wound little by little, and you make the perforation inside so that it allows the other part to penetrate; and urine is released immediately.
And then press your hand on that which is ruptured in the scrotal wound from the part behind the scrotum, because it is squashed and sealed by urine, and the patient is healed.
If this treatment is not suitable for any reason that forbids it from being done in this manner, then place a file against the wound, and another file above the wound. And then press on the wound in that scrotum between two layers. And then remove that. And then loosen the bandage and change the frozen urine in the wound.
And it is not necessary to have a file against the scrotum, but rather in order that it does not return to the bladder, and the other bandage above, otherwise; when removed, the file nears the exit of the wound, the cure then returns to its place and heals the wound.
And for this reason it is necessary when you have the file above, that you raise the cure to the upper parts, or that you return your operation so that it heals the wound as we have said.
Capitol 61.
Of the extraction of scrotal hernia in women.
Scrotal hernia in women is rare.
If there were to be a scrotal hernia with any of those, then it is difficult for the treatment of her, and it is forbidden by many means.
One of them is that in women childbirth weakens the muscles of the uterus.
And the second is that you do not find many women who know how to describe if they have hernia when pregnant, or if it's due to a woman having given birth in the past.
The third is that you don't find many women who know this art, particularly manual surgery.
And the fourth is that the location of this section on scrotal hernia in women is far from the site of the hernia, so you need a wave-like incision, and there is fear in that.
If it becomes necessary to do this, then consider that you need a skilled female doctor, who is rare.
If you are lacking that, then approach a surgeon who is almost subtle, or present a female matron skilled in women's affairs, or a woman who has part of this art down.
Then make that present, and command her to do everything you tell her, from inquiry about the scrotum to beginning; the cause is that she should look if the woman has weakened muscles, then consider putting her own statement in the woman's anus and feel for the hernia.
If she finds that, extract that leaving her statement, then command her to make an incision over that.
If she is not weakened, then command the matron to insert her statement into the woman's mouth and inquire about the hernia; because place her left hand on the bladder, and hold that well in a good grip.
If she finds that, then consider gradually guiding that down from the opening of the bladder towards the sides until it reaches halfway through the thigh.
And then incise in that position on the area of the male's scrotum where you have to consider the size of any part under them and center the skin at that point, so it doesn't get pushed out by the skin when they are pressed.
And the section should be small at the beginning; and then insert the needle into that section, and if you feel the skin, then adjust in section according to how much you know that the skin will penetrate from there.
And know that the spots of skin are grains: some of them are small and large, rough and hard, long and round, having no edges.
So you know how many spots there are on you for this reason that you specify about what you want.
And if you want to have blood flow, adjust in the place where there is inflammation and leave that for an hour after it has been removed of the inflammation, then return to your operation while the skin is being expelled.
And prepare for yourself the tools that were mentioned in the extraction of skin in men, so you can be helped by them in your operation.
And if you want blood flow, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery where the incision is made, then you pause the powder over the area and strengthen it with powdered and concentrated essence, and do not continue this; let the skin be and do not remove it, for a sick person will die from this. And then heal the wound.
So when the intensity of the blood flow is reduced for some days, and the place has calmed down, then you return to your operation while the skin is being expelled.
Section 62.
About inguinal hernia section.
Inguinal hernia is nothing but an addition of moisture in the white matter which contains the tubes carrying urine, and it is called bladder.
And sometimes they occur in the proper cavity of them which nature prepares for urine in the part where it is cut, when already there's another urine; and it's the tube of the generative system between the white bladder which we have mentioned, and it is not this but rather a twist.
And the cause of this hernia is due to overstretching which affects the reproductive organs, so this substance accumulates among them, and sometimes they occur due to strikes made on the reproductive organs.
And this moisture has different colors: some of them are decaying to yellow, or bloody, or reddish, or black and greasy, or watery white, which is what it most often manifests as.
And the signs by which one can recognize where this accumulation of water is: if it's in the bladder that we have mentioned, then the lump is somewhat long and resembles the shape of urine, and the reproductive organ appears, for moisture accumulates from all sides.
And if the moisture is in the proper cavity, then the lump appears near the urine outlet and that's why we estimate that it's another urine.
And if the moisture is between the reproductive tubes and white bladder, then you will feel its centering.
And if you want knowledge of the color of the moisture, then inflate the color of the moisture within the lump in the middle part that is cut; and according to how it appears in the trace of the incision, judge what's inside.
And when we come to the treatment of you at home, then guide that urine flow if this is possible for you, and make him fill his body.
And then he should lie on his back for some cause or another, and place your clean cloths under him.
And then sit on the left part of him, and instruct that the surgeon follow his right side, who extends his arm to one of two sides towards the tube of the reproductive organs and the opening in the belly.
And then take a longitudinal cut laterally, split the tube of the reproductive organs in the middle place longitudinally through the pubis.
And make the incision according to rightness equidistant from the line that should be of the skin of the reproductive organs, until it reaches the white bladder including it.
And scrape that, observe, and take care not to scrape too much; and your scraping is along the part where you scrape from, which seems hanging towards urine more and carefully examine your scraping according to how much it's possible for you.
And then puncture the bladder full of water with a large opening and remove all the water.
And then separate between the two folds of the incision with scissors, and extend the bladder towards the upper parts; and do not touch the tube of the reproductive organs including it, and puncture the bladder in that manner which is possible for you. And puncture it completely or in pieces, and especially its posterior side which is subtle, for if you do not examine the puncturing carefully, there's no certainty that water will not return.
Or if urine proceeds from that outside of its tube during your operation, then when you have completed the bladder incision, return inside it, and adjust both folds of the reproductive organ's tube with stitches, and treat that just like other wounds until it heals.
And if you find the uterus corrupted by other illnesses, then uncover the vessels that are under the suspensory ligament, and remove the uterus, and properly treat the area we have said.
And if the water is divided into two parts, then you know that these are hernias; therefore, cut that part as you did in the other equally; and if it's evident to you that it's an operation, then do so.
And then clean the wound, and place a piece of cloth in each section where the wool is submerged in oil or roasting oil; pause another cloth which you have submerged in water and oil, and spread that over the two testicles and the belly; pause sheets folded and powders, and place those on top with a mattress according to this form:
And make them hold two sheets and fill them with soaked wool according to this resemblance; let the ends where pressure is applied be placed against a spot or wet wool, have them attached to the structure in the crotch of the trousers, one end take the buttocks inside the other, the other end takes the thigh part of the pants, two ends on each thighs and two others on the hips, all tightness should be adjusted in the trousers' waist.
And when this hernia needs to be treated artificially with a cautery in the location of the section at the groin; and you take a fine surgical blade and incise there where the reproductive organs are located, it is ignited according to what we have recommended that the white gall bladder containing the water should be exposed, and then you take a cautery like this: And it resembles Greek letter.
And then pierce that gall bladder, and it is ignited so that all the moisture is expelled.
And then extend the gall bladder with forceps, and excise them with forceps, and excise with a heated fine cautery; and cut it as possible for you to remove all of it; and be careful not to let the fire touch the wound.
And know that this operation is safer and further from the wound exudate than an operation at the groin, and better than section operation.
And if you find any contradiction in the pus under the wound or during cautery, or exudate of pus, then uncover what treatment this contradiction causes to you for it, and apply that healing as advised according to it.
And if the patient is scared and does not expect a second operation due to its horror, then you administer perforation according to what I advise; and that's when it should be certified by you, based on what we've said about meanings, that this is an aqueous hernia.
And then uncover that you make the patient lie on an elevated surface, place in a lower part of the wound at the side near the belly button, and perform the perforation according to the length of the body.
And if it's an opening wide enough that all the water flows out completely.
And then place your hand on that spot and smooth it out, so that the remaining water can flow away. And then treat that area where the wound has healed.
And if the contradiction is against the elimination of water at that time you perforate it: and this is not done unless that white paper in the opening of the wound causes a contradiction and prevents water from being excreted, then uncover how you insert into the wound a strip or instrument on which water is extracted from dropsy, its shape is preceded; or adjust in the elevation of the wound a small piece.
And know that water returns, and is healed approximately two months or about those; and when it's added, then be pierced according to that method described, so the patient will pass their days.
Capitol. LXIII.
Regarding the section on fatty hernia and its treatment.
And know that in the section concerning this type of hernia, there is fear lost due to the negligence of major considerations; for me it seems better to avoid you and be saved by that means.
And I recall the operation in that one and the specifics of the abscesses.
So I say that abscesses occur in the bodies where the testicles are contained and this is done due to these causes: or by acute excess heat which infiltrates the testicles, or by impact.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and it doesn't get reddened by your pain, and it's a heavy abscess.
And a soft one is an inflamed abscess, whose color is dark, and doesn't swell your body.
And sometimes it is caused by occlusion of the arteries, and due to this swelling already noticeable from you, or due to swelling of veins.
And this is due to the spreading of abscesses when you press it with your fingers; and know that don't touch it.
And this one is done due to swelling of veins doesn't spread from any cause, you need the compression with your fingers.
And it is possible that sections are made on this species and on other muscles; and you incise the canal of the kidneys, then bring the hand to the parts above, and extract that from the white bladder, and deliver the suspensory ligaments of the vessels, and tie them, then incise the suspensory ligament since you have delivered that from all sections of the bladder parts.
And if the cow has become like those hardened muscles, then you need to remove the cow and cut into it.
And if there is adhesion within any part of the bladder or between those parts that are between the veins, then you need to remove all that adhesion and cut into it with a round incision.
If it is a native tissue formation in the place of adhesion which is behind, then you need to cut everything that belongs to him, and remove the cow also as we have said.
And once your operation is completed, then fill the wound with oiled, waxed wool and vinegar; and proceed to treat it like another healing process until it is healed.
Chapter LXIV.
On the treatment of a hernia that is in the groin.
It is an abscess enveloped by some kind of sheath resembling a shoot in the process of softening of the testicles, and makes movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness there is a consideration to avoid what preceded it.
However, perform the operation as I did for the first one.
And say that when you have the patient lying on an elevated stool; then place the suspensory ligaments of the testicles at the places I've left; and position the canal of the kidneys with your hands towards the abdomen where they are palpable in relation to the pubic bone; and keep those other servants as well, and extend them with a vigorous extension.
And proceed to make a deep, sharp incision through a transverse section in the middle of the blood vessels where the blood vessels are exposed.
And proceed to remove everything from all parts as we have said in the extraction of arteries which are located in the axillae.
And place there a needle in which you have made a double loop, and tie that at the first point of action where blood is flowing out, and then tie it again further towards the end of them. And proceed to make incisions in the middle section by a straight longitudinal cut according to the length of the body, and remove what is added by the humoral putrefaction and corruption.
And treat the wound with healing methods for other wounds where you wish to have health be produced through what falls into the blood vessels which are from one of two kidneys, which is not harmful for that.
If blood occurs in all veins, then you need to remove the testicles or that part of the testicles for which they are connected by vessels, so as to be deprived of all nourishment through the incision of the vessels and for them to become hardened, or that is what becomes mature for those.
Chapter LXV.
On the treatment of an intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia happens when it invades the bladder spreading out over the abdomen from the angles of the abdominal cavity, so that the contents of that rupture come to some of the parts.
And this rupture is either from the bladder or from its contents, and it happens in these two species due to various causes: by impact, by jumping, by crying out, by lifting something heavy, or by stretching.
The sign of this, when it's due to the extension of the bladder, is that it occurs gradually over a long time and does not happen suddenly. It's an abscess equally distributed inside the abdomen because the bladder presses on the intestines.
And the sign of this happens when it's due to a section in the bladder, at first it causes sudden severe pain; and there appears an abscess differing in appearance from the canal that seems to be close to the surface, and this is due to movement of the intestines, and the body is above the bladder sections behind.
Some ulcers occur on the surface of the intestine, this condition is called an intestinal hernia with a bag.
Some ulcers are caused by windiness, some ulcers occur inside the intestine cavity and they get stuck there, this causes great discomfort in the stomach. Other ulcers cause pain and it is worse when they are pressed.
In the treatment of these conditions caused by this illness, there is concern, so you should avoid that which causes pain in that area.
The method of performing the operation for that is to command the patient to draw up the intestines with his hand towards the inner parts of its cavity if he returns according to his own movement, then wrap it around his collarbone between your hands and lift up their breasts.
And then pinch the canal which connects to the testicular canal upwards, and cut the testicular canal all along its length; and place two incisions on either side of the section according to what you need for opening that section.
And if you have the ability to take out as much of that section as possible from within it.
And then scrape off those small blisters which are left from the chain of the testicles, while it is revealed the white hard scab on each part.
And then insert your finger into that which is cut on the testicle, into that which is between the white scab, which is left from the chain of the man's body, and between the scab secondarily, and cleanse around that adhesion which is in the part behind the man.
And then direct your hand to the chain of the testicles towards the parts behind, and also extend the white scab on his left hand, and lift him up to the scab at the part of the section; and command the attendant to hold him up while you dissolve the adhesion that is behind with a completed solution.
And search with your fingers to ensure there is no cause for the hernia being wrapped in the hard white scab. If you find any cause from him, then remove that from his belly region.
And then pierce the part left of the chain of the testicles through this section where it can run with healing and health as we have recommended in what we said.
And then apply wool dipped in oil, pause on the wound; and apply the binding (and some white scabs are cauterized as we said near the incision of his testicles' flow, where several parts can happen to these parts) and smooth the tie so that it falls naturally.
If his healing is delayed, then let salt water be applied, pause over it so that it falls according to what we said.
And then treat the wound with the other cure for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
On venous hernia.
In this type of hernia, it has not been observed that one can be burned during the treatment of it.
And the first ones say that it is done this way as we have recommended in the hernia which is with veins; which is that you tie up the vessels near the section above that for him's ease; and dry off in the middle area around where I do this, within which the vessels fall.
And treat the wound according to what we said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
On the dislocation that happens in joints.
Some parts may rupture in joints as we have said, and rise up from the place.
And do not let any cause of hernias affect the body; and if they do, it's few; and return to these always.
And if the time with that extends, there is a break in the scab where the hernia descends into the scab; and this happens due to the extension of the scab which is in joints as we have said, this cause is that the scab is stretched, and then it softens the place becomes inflamed and rises.
And the treatment for him is with a cautery as we have mentioned in the previous description of this.
And some cases are cured with iron according to this manner: that the patient lies on his back between your hands, and then dry off the area of the rupture of the abscesses apply at the section by width as much as three fingers in quantity.
And then strengthen the white scab which is under the chain where it is revealed.
And then take the rod and pause it on the prominent part of the scab, and press it against the belly's front.
And then pinch the two prominent spots on the end of the rod of the scab, and adjust to the suture one of those with the other.
And then remove the end of the rod, and do not pierce through the scab entirely, nor extend the man or any other cause such as I know in the treatment of intestinal hernias.
And then treat that with the treatment of wounds, and when you pierce those threads, clean it up and restore the wound until it is consolidated; which is that the scab tightens and there isn't a bulge from rupture.
A pointed cautery is better in this location, which is closer to health.
Chapter 68.
About the softening of the chain of the testicles.
The veins of the chain of the testicles in some men are softened due to heat; this causes the muscles that are within that area to become softened and requires care for it.
So it is necessary for the one who is treated in the cure of him to make the patient lie according to his age, and unfold the entire chain that is softened above the natural chain; and then adjust two lips against the suture.
And if you want, as in the beginning, with an excess of the softened chain there can be three or four sewings and a firm suture.
And then you should enter between the stitches; and later treat with recovery from the other wounds until it is healed and falls off the scabs.
Chapter 69.
About castration.
Know that castration in our law is condemned, but due to the instructions given to me, I will remember it in this free text; and there is no need for remembering about it except for two reasons, of which one is that when a doctor asks about it, he should know how to treat the one who undergoes it. The other reason is that since we often have a need for castration in our livestock due to their juvenile needs as well as in mares, dogs, pigs, and similar animals.
And so I say that castration is done in two ways: either through excision, or through incision up to the testicles.
In the case of that one where it is done through excision, the method of the operation is to make an incision in a horse with tail water until the testicles swell and become reddened so they hang down. And then you should take those ones in your hand while they are resolved, so that there do not appear any marks from touching them.
And in castration done through incision and sectioning, you should have the animal and press the chain of the testicles from it with your left hand.
And then you should tie the suspensorial, and cut through each one of them with an incision until two testicles are processed.
And then you should cut out the pus that you have scraped from any of them. And do not leave anything on those of the penis, but leave only the subtle one which is above the veins.
And this method of castration is better which is done through excision because the excision slightly leaves a cause of the testicles so that the animal desires copulation.
And then treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
About the treatment of androgyny.
Androgyny in men occurs in two ways: one is when orifice appears in the chain of the testicles, in that place between the two testicles where a male part with female hair can be seen.
And some cases involve urine flowing from that opening which is located in the chain of the testicles.
In females it is a special case: that the male part is located above the pubis like two male testicles, all slightly smaller than those of a man and in front like the prepuce of a man and two testicles.
The treatment is divided into three types: for two cases of men, and for one case specific to women. And you should make incisions through those muscles so that the discharge of that one escapes, and then treat them with recovery from other wounds.
And in the second case of men where urine escapes from that opening which is located in the chain of the testicles, there is neither treatment nor operation for it.
Chapter 21.
About cough and flesh protrusion due to female conditions.
A strong cough is adjusted to natural causes that have been relaxed and requires careful attention; some cases are exaggerated in certain women as much as in men, and proceed into sexual intercourse.
So you should take the excess of coughing with your hand or a tool and cut it out.
And do not finish with cutting, especially at the beginning of the throat, for fear that no pus will flow.
And then treat that with treatment until it is healed from other wounds.
Rough meat is meat that appears in the mother's uterus filling it up, and forcefully comes out through parts ahead according to the shape of a penis (and for this reason some early ones called it "tail disease"); so you should cut it out like cutting coughing, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
About the treatment of arrhagia.
Arrhagia is when the male part of a female (assuming 'femna' should be 'female') isn't pierced, or there's a small opening. And it can be natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to tail disease that has preceded, and this one is done or through rough meat not adjusted or through a subtle penis.
And it can occur in the mother's womb, or on her body, or from excessive pus inside her, or from lower pus, and you forbid intercourse, pregnancy, and childbirth, and strongly forbid menstruation.
And the knowledge of that is achieved through observation of the doctor, if there's an obvious increase, move it upwards; but if it's not obvious, then you look for that near your fingers or by your side.
But if the increase is subtle and close to the two lips, then you press on it and try to relieve that.
And you press over the two lips with dust, then place your fingertips on both their chests.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs spread out, and you extend both lips as far in so that the subtle increase is relieved and the swelling opens.
And you take wool, soak it in oil, and place that over the affected area, then leave it there for a day to ensure the incised spot doesn't heal.
But if the lump is large and thick, then you need to incise it on a flat surface or under a mint leaf.
But if the swelling is due to pus, then suspend that with a string, and cut it there.
And use the medicines that stop the flow of sweat and itching, such as cacao, sweat from dragon plants, and others, mix them with butter.
And administer an open-ended lead tube, so that the wound doesn't heal quickly.
Keep that there for a few days and apply lard oil.
And afterwards, use another method of healing to ensure it heals properly before it becomes healthy.
And sometimes accidents occur in the main digestion of other organs, and you need to cut according to this method. But if it's due to a bad boil, for the boil in the main body, don't let it be treated against iron using any method.
Chapter 73.
Of the treatment for hemorrhoids, and tail, and the red boil that happens in the womb of women.
Hemorrhoids are the affliction of the openings of varicose veins where blood flows continuously from them; and if they're old hemorrhoids, then this is their state.
And I have already mentioned in the division of those and their signs, and to say that these receive treatment and these do not receive treatment.
So it's said that hemorrhoids and boils when they're in the first phase of pregnancy and not showing symptoms, then there should be no treatment with iron for those.
Those are the ones that are in the mother's openings where you can feel them, they are those that receive treatment.
And you need to immerse the woman in warm water and then extend her abdomen with flax or on a coarse cloth, and cut them at their roots.
And then apply the sweats of the iron's sweat powder to relieve sweating and itching, such as cacao and similar to those.
And then soak her feet for an hour, and then place that in cold water.
And if the sweating persists, then have her make a decoction of sumac and water from rhubarb and juniper berries and herbs.
And then take flour of oregano, mix that with honey and wine vinegar, prepare a poultice with it over the back.
And if the sweat is removed, then drink it; otherwise, attach two blistering plaques and on the nipples make cuts.
And then take wool and immerse it in colander juice or in the juice of elderberry or in vinegar mixed with water, to attach it to the place; and then treat the place with oil until it heals.
And treat that until it heals.
Chapter 74.
Of the operation of percuting a hernia accident during pregnancy.
Types of boils that happen during pregnancy, such as hard boil, boil with pus, ulcers, hemorrhagic, and other boils. And I have already mentioned these illnesses and their types and their signs, as well as their treatments in the section.
And you should know that in this treatise on boil caut, which appears during pregnancy from the boils that cause illness, if you want to know how to perform its operation with iron.
Then consider if the pain of the boil at its beginning is sharp upon percussion and pus, fever, and sometimes it reddens and if you can feel it on that, then note to perform an operation on it, and treat that with what helps in the maturation until the intensity of the accidents ceases.
And then you should have her cut the woman on a bench that has two benches; lie down on her back and place her legs at the lowest part of the belly, spread out her thighs, lay her hands under her shoulders, and tie them in such a way as is comfortable.
And then the midwife should follow her left hand and administer the tool where she has opened the opening of the womb, its shape will come about in those causes that are to be explained later.
And when you wish to administer this tool, place it on the axis of the mother's hand in the female, and whatever enters into the mother from the instrument must not exceed the size of the mother's hand and affect the patient. If the tool is larger than the mother's hand, then when you do this, cover the mother's hand texture with powder so that it prohibits all tools from entering into the mother's hand.
And when you do this, make sure the tool rotates while moving upwards on the instrument of the male's urethra, and that the minister holds the instrument and rotates the tool until it opens the opening of the mother.
And when excitement appears and touches the hand and is hot and wet, then when this happens, make sure to dry that area by spreading on it a damp cloth.
And when the sweat is evacuated, then when this occurs, make sure to place in the wound a sponge submerged in rose oil or castor oil with some irritation; and place the foot on the area near the mother's hand.
And wet the mother with water, and over the knees place woolen bandages soaked in water containing walnuts.
And approximately two days later apply grease which is suitable for use once it's become healthy.
And some washes are made for the mother and the wound with water mixed with honey, so that it is treated in water, then return to using grease.
And if the wound is deep inside the mother's body, then when you must prevent treatment of him with iron, instead treat it with what we have said in this section.
Capitol 75.
To teach the midwives in what manner to treat pregnant women when they show symptoms that deviate from a natural figure.
The necessary cause is that the midwife knows the figure of normal childbirth by means of signs on her person, and when you observe a woman expelling her waters and wanting to smell the air, and in this way she is encouraged by what happens with her during labor, and accelerates the expulsion of the embryo. Then you know that this labor is according to a natural figure, and it is the expulsion of her towards her head, and the second one either hanging or suspended below the umbilical cord.
So when you observe those signs, then ensure that her belly is compressed by itself so that the embryo descends slightly when it comes down over its head. Then give her the second one, and get rid of those excesses for good correction.
That which is the other of this labor is not-natural and unmanageable, when the embryo is expelled on its feet and the body of the woman is seated in front of her head, and her legs are one, or under her waist... or when the head of the woman is expelled and her hand is, or towards her belly, and heavily it is converted onto her neck, and resembling those unmanageable figures.
The necessary cause is that the midwife should be knowledgeable and discerning in all those causes, and avoid error and deception.
And I am showing you all the figure of those, and which organs are in those for what it signifies and its state on that.
When it is expelled over its head by natural effort, and that is vigorous on the woman and makes her have a hard part, and sometimes weakens her virtue, then she must do this treatment, or what women should do for themselves, and evaporate her sweat with fenugreek tea and with wetted olive oil.
And later the midwife should intervene between her little belly and small opening for the second one, or dry that in her ear with what is within her for humidity. And press the woman's belly so that she expels the fetus.
And if it doesn't come out, then when this happens, make the woman sweat from garlic juice and garlic oil.
And later command her, near the cramps, that she is squeezed and makes her sneeze with a cold; and leave her mouth and her nose open for an hour, so that the fetus can exit immediately.
And if both ends of the fetus are expelled at the beginning, then when this occurs, make sure to reduce those with gentle stimulation gradually. And if you don't follow the instruction, then when this happens, have the woman lie on her side and lift her feet up, and later return the leg to the ground; and make sure the woman doesn't fall from the concussion.
And if the ends are not reversed and push out the fetus, then insert those and extract the membranes of the fetus or tie it to her stomach with a cloth and extract that when it is expelled immediately.
When the fetus comes down over its feet, then when this occurs, make sure to push those inwards, and later make the fetus smaller, and make that equal, and take one of her feet and gradually extend those inwardly.
When it comes inside the thighs, then when this happens, command her to expel and make her sneeze with a cold condition; if it is expelled immediately when God wills.
And if it is not correctly treated as we have recommended, then you return the operation little by little into what will make the second natural figure appear, which will be somewhat easier in terms of discomfort.
And if it is prohibited for all that we have recommended, then take a bandage of hemp and of dissolvable rubber, and crush them together in the mortar with good pounding, and draw a line on what we call the woman's womb, the base of the belly. And make that incision in hot water, so that it achieves the under-ribs.
And as often as your parts from you are hardened, then have them smoked with myrtle and place that under you. And when you have smoked it for an hour, then make that incision on a table, and proceed to sneeze and open your mouth wide, then stand up from there, and apply gentle pressure to the lower part of the patient's abdomen, so that the operation will soon become less painful.
Examination of the back position of the fetus while hanging one of its breasts. Have it guided in the reduction of her hand, or if you cannot reduce that, then lift the woman and let her go.
And if she can't go, then have her lie on the table, and shake her thighs with strong vibration, and proceed to administer sponges which I use and recommend for purgatives.
And if the child has come out, then make that incision on a table, and proceed to study about hand reduction, and guide the operation according to the natural figure, and have the woman sneeze and command her to squeeze herself as soon as it becomes less painful.
Examination of the fetus hanging over its neck, spreading its breasts and the tissue around her is twice as long as her mother's. Have the midwife hold the hand of the fetus and gently rotate that little one bit by bit, so as to make it easier.
And when they are equal and what is long, then place pressure on the chest of her which we have recommended using oil and purgatives.
And command her to slowly become pregnant little by little, and when you have done that, then make that incision on a table and command that she be inclined over the right side, and proceed to command her to squeeze herself; and have her sneeze with concentration. The expulsion of the prepared fetus onto the side.
When it is expelled from the mother according to this method, consider, and then you cut into the second on your thumb as it is freed of moisture.
And if the fetus is hanging on its mother's neck and face, then you cut into that of the belly button, so as not to be retained and to drain.
And proceed to push the fetus into the parts inside as you guide that second which comes out, command the woman to squeeze herself several times, and it will become less painful soon, if God permits.
The expulsion of twins or multiple fetuses. Understand that twins and multiple pregnancies are natural, and sometimes there may be three or four of them, but this is unusual and rare; mostly these are caused by nature, not by human intervention.
Count them, whether they are multiplied, one second, and are separated by ciphers, distinguish those among the ligament in each of those. Some pregnancies may become divided as if it were a fetus through natural expulsion somewhat quickly, and others may be expelled as if it is not possible through any method that we have recommended.
And if some are difficult for you to handle, proceed with the delivery and move towards what we have mentioned about the non-natural figures, then take care of those as we have recounted.
And if the midwife is skilled and makes it as easy and with finesse, and in case of delay, and guided according to all figures so that her skill leads to health.
Remembering what forms inside the womb from embryos and gets aborted.
Some boils are formed in the mother's region one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten, at which point you should verify that if a female miscarries her first child, and another x of them, this is caused by the measurement of the glorious sages.
And all of this is covered that it be in the science of medicine which greatly resembles this, and thus remains with this as long as one covers it.
Chapter 76.
On extracting the fetus when it is dead.
When you care for a dead fetus in accordance with what we have discussed in the division of medicine and it doesn't move outwards, and you are hesitant to use an operation with your hands, then consider if the woman is healthy and not affected by any conditions that could cause loss.
Then consider if the woman is laid on her side over a bed, and if the head of the fetus is tilted inwards and her thighs are raised.
And the minister should have that part covered or be bound on the bed, so that the body of the patient does not extend during fetal extraction.
And then you moisten the mother's mouth with oil and with moistened mullein, and with fennel and sesame seeds.
And then anoint the woman's hand with those oils and remedies, and place her hand comfortably under the patient, and arrange her hand so that it stays in touch with the fetus.
And place them conveniently in this: then consider if the fetus is prepared to be descending through its head, and in that case you should have your hands on its hips, or on its neck, or in its mouth, or on its palate, or let it hang freely from your chin, or on its sternum, or on the appropriate locations of the back, or let the lower parts be free.
If descent is through its feet, then in the buttocks, or in the middle of the back.
And have the hand on the right side, pressing against the curvature of it in that location which is between the last two fingers of the left hand, and place your hand comfortably to press and keep the hand in one of those locations we've mentioned until it reaches the lower part.
And then press and stay in the position of its other hand, or use the elbow if necessary, to ensure a balanced pressure, rather than extension according to its straightness alone.
And apply your strength to every part, so that the movement of the fetus is eased in the same way as when removing a tooth.
And apply that which is between them so that the extension becomes softened; and if any part of it is being held, then consider to have the woman oil some of her fingers with oil and skillfully insert those into the area that is being held, and turn around that which is being obstructed.
Therefore, if the part of the fetus is too far out, then have your hands pressed against the location that is more appropriate; and do this until all the fetus is out.
If the hand is inside and it's not possible to reduce that by pulling on it, then consider having a cloth wrapped around it; and then extract it until everything is out, and cut it in the location of the hand or at the side.
And do this for the other hand and for both feet as well.
If the head of the fetus is large, or if it's caught during the birth process, or if there's water around the head and it fits snugly, then consider inserting the fingers into the shoulder's spinous space and widen the head, or find an instrument named "alundat" that can be used to separate this area, with its shape resembling other tools close to this section.
And do the same if the fetus has naturally large head: then consider cutting that area with string or using something like an "alundat" as we've mentioned, and then use the forceps to extract the bones.
And if the head is within and is being squeezed at the sternum, then cut into it where the moisture in the feet can be released.
If there is no complication or obstruction to delivery, then consider cutting the head as soon as it's feasible for you.
And if the ends of the belly are stuck or in its ydopod region, then consider piercing that area where the moisture is.
If the fetus is above its feet, then the movement of it is gentle and its direction towards the mother's mouth is gentle.
If it's being squeezed between the abdomen and the feet, then consider extracting that with cloth you've wrapped around your hand, cut through the abdomen and feet where the fluid flows in that area.
If the other limbs are still and turn the head, then consider inserting your left hand; if the mother's mouth is open, then insert your hand in the area of the ribcage, and close it around that head, and pull it with your hands towards the mother's mouth, and then place one or two fingers in there and pull her.
And if the mother's mouth is being squeezed by a hot boil that affects one, then consider not to raise it above her; before doing this, give the administration of fluid from causes of moist and fatty substances. And apply bandages; and follow the patient with waters that soften and moisturize.
And if the fetus is on its side, then if possible, make it straight: and apply what we've said about live fetuses.
And if this is not possible, then it should be done by incision, and then extracted.
And ensure there are no leftover causes from the second one.
And when you have completed all your operation, then administer what we said about treatment for the pus-filled, heated areas that occur from the mother.
And if there is discharge of pus, then treat with warm waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have seen a woman in her belly who was carrying death, and further about that fire there was another pregnancy taken, and further death is the thing carried. A long time ago an ulcer occurred in his abdominal region; and it inflated inside like a fire, and began to bleed.
And I was called upon to treat him, and treated him for a long time, and the disease has not healed.
And I applied some powerful attraction plaster to him, and made him sweat with him for several days, and then made him sweat with another one; and I was too amazed, because there is no bone in the belly.
And then I realized that they were from the bones of the dead fetus.
And then I cleansed the wound, and extracted bone from him, the woman being in her abdominal position, and had been suffering in such a manner for a long time, I healed him of a little of his bleeding.
And I do not consider it strange, but rather that in this is knowledge and assistance to what the medical art allows for treatment.
Of the forms of the tools necessary to extract the fetus.
Form of inversion in which the mother is opened:
This is the form of strengthener in which the free are equalized, to which equality are two strengths at the ends of two fetuses. However, this strength should be more subtle in straining, and it should be made of wood or cane.
And the width of any pole is two fingers and the edge of each side is one finger, and the length of each is a hand and half; and in the middle of the two poles are two adjustments for those metal poles which are already fixed, of which the length is almost a hand plus, and the width of each is two fingers or slightly less.
And these two additions should be inserted into the mouth of the mother so that they open when you rotate the two prescribed strengths.
Another form similar to this one, which is subtle and lighter:
It should be made of wood or cane according to the resemblance of forceps. However, at the end of it there are two additions like that sometimes; and the length of those additions is almost a hand, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you want to open the mother with those, then you cut the woman on her back so that her legs are hanging, open what is between her thighs. And then open your hand with the tool like you do with scissors according to the amount that you want from the depth of the mother's mouth, while you measure it as you want.
The form of inversion which the ancients would say:
Form of a pusher on which the fetus is pushed:
Form of assistance on which the large head is turned:
And it is similar to forceps with teeth at the end like that sometimes, some pregnancies are done long like that like forceps according to this form, like that, in which the teeth are like the teeth of saws on which incision and turning are made. Form for a short assistance:
Form of an uncinate with one spine:
Form of an uncinate with two spines:
Form of a spatula with two ends on which the head is severed.
Form of two spatulas side by side:
All those instruments are exercised, and when more are multiplied by the species of that one and they are prepared you should use them according to the artificers, it is lighter for their operation and more appropriate depending on the quantity.
And do not use those instruments already whether you are equipped with them or you should equip yourself, for the need of those is not excusable.
Regarding the extraction of the second one.
When the second one is retained, you should give birth to it, then realize that you must command the mother to retain her breath, and then make her sneeze with condiments, and strengthen your hand on her mouth and on her nostrils, and if by this she comes out, it's good.
And if not, then take one spoon and puncture in the roof a groove and pause at that herb to open the mother's mouth, like with a hot and rough and nettle and chamomile and powdered gum Arabic and cassia lignea and st anthyllis. All of these herbs or some of them should be submerged in water in the spoon, and pause that over the fire.
And place an ear tube in the mother's mouth, then let that be where the vapor goes into the cavity of the mother.
And perform that sneeze there as we have said, and the second time let it come out quickly.
May you approve this cure and not be disturbed, then you instruct the midwife to submerge her left hand in saffron oil or in an alum solution, then immerse that into her stomach and when she feels it a second time, like when she finds it, then take it out slowly. May if it adheres to your body, then you put her hand as we have recommended, and when she finds the second one, extract it gradually according to correctness so that the mother does not fall back with her effort. Afterwards, make sure it is easy to bend both in front and behind on both sides.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted, as we have recommended, this cure with sneezing and with medication of the air with herbs.
May if it is not resolved in all the causes that we have recommended, then remember to not tire yourself out with repetition, but rather make sure what escapes from you into the mother's mouth remains on the woman's cheek. Then apply that with ointment and tetra-formula; so that which will dissolve and come out easily over several days.
When you lie down, it raises the mother's illness to the head and stomach, and this causes the disease in the mother; then make sure that sub-smoke treatments and suitable things are administered for this.
Just like the ancient ones already use sub-smoking with pine needles and dried figs.
Formulate a device for this tool that the woman should be sub-smoked so that it retains her menstrual flow and the second one:
It is made of wood or reed.
And the subtle end is placed in the stomach and the broad end over the fire, and the sub-smoking should be placed above the arms of the fire.
And let that be where that sub-smoke is consumed and repeat another one.
Regarding the cure for an unperforated child's anus.
Newborn babies don't have their butts pierced, which are small and thick. Then instruct the midwife to pierce that small intestine as recommended; and if not, pierce it with a sharp needle, and make sure not to touch the wound.
And place over that wool soaked in vinegar and oil; and then treat it with ointment inside where it is safe.
May if you fear that it's thick, then leave an ear tube in the newborn for several days, and observe when the child wants to pass gas.
And if it happens that thickening of the anus occurs due to infection or abscess; then make sure that this thickening is dissolved, and apply the cure as we have recommended for the treatment and lead.
Regarding the treatment of fistulas that occur in patients.
The fistulas that occur during childbirth in the lower exit are soft and large, which often occur near the anus outside or in the space of one of the exits.
And it is a fistula or marks.
And when that swelling is old and prone to moisture with white or scaly humidity, some of these eruptions are from these fistulas sometimes penetrating them.
Those that penetrate are known as they escape by exit and through wind; some of them use the mother's exit, and forcefully escapes from those worms.
And some eruptions from those fistulas penetrate into the bladder, and inside the shaft of the penis; and some of them penetrating between the thighs and inside the anus.
And the kind of fistula that penetrates into the anus and does not penetrate is that you insert your recommended device into the anus, then gently insert a reed or iron rod into the fistula when it's not too tight.
May if there's tightness in that, then insert a subtle lead rod or horse hair into it where you feel the rod or the hair on your recommended device.
And if you don't feel that through all or none of it is causing any cause of discharge or worm or wind, as we have said, then know that it's not penetrating, and now do the treatment.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or inside the shaft of the penis, then this signifies that there's an escape of urine from it and prohibition for you to add to this situation where the location has medical treatment consolidation.
May if it penetrates into the thigh joint or inside bone accompanied by pain in the circulation, then this is a sign that the rod passes here if there's not tightness inside the bone and pain in the circulation of childbirth; and that it produces constant pus; and that this treatment does not help, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas there is no cure for everything, and the treatment of those consists of hard work and the skills of doctors on which they operate.
In cases where it is not penetrating or old, healing with iron and hope is expected according to what I will tell you, and what I have already experienced and proven.
And it is that when the patient lies between your hands above their belly and elevates their legs inside them, with their thighs inclined towards their abdomen, you introduce a lead or an iron rod if it's in the fistula, until you know the location where the introduction of the tool occurs.
And if that pain is around the neck, then you should introduce your prescribed instrument into the neck.
And if you feel in your hand that the object has already been discovered and is being exposed by penetrating it, another thing that you feel between your hand and that siphon or flesh, then you will surely know that this is penetrating; and from then on do not work on this, because there is no healing in this, as we have said.
However, it's often said that some people are healthy for others.
And for the treatment by which youth is expected in them, you should use a subtle cautery according to the size of the fistula, as previously mentioned, and introduce that heated instrument into the fistula until it reaches around the neck; then repeatedly introduce it two or three times until you know that all those flesh tissues adhered to the fistulized area resemble a feather down.
And after that, treat that with heat wrapped in bandages until all those tissues that are adhered recover, and then treat that with medicines causing healing and consolidation. If it is healed, it's good; otherwise, it's not healed within a time for another treatment.
And if the object enters and does not penetrate your hand which is in the buttocks, and between that and the object that is thinly covered with flesh or siphon, and when the fistula is found within where it touches the skin of the anus, then dry out the anus from the start of the fistula. Then watch if it dries up, and if it's inside the fistula until the drying reaches the place where the object protrudes, and that way the object will be released and exit.
And afterwards, refine those flesh tissues that resemble the feather of a goose and do not disturb any part of them.
And indeed, when there is a discharge of pus that comes between you and your operation while touching those tissues, then the amount should be treated with a small instrument heated either with fire or with acute medicine; when using fire to cauterize it adjusts well twice. This corresponds to healing those adhered tissues and the excision of pus through the elimination of moisture.
And afterwards, treat that with heat wrapped in bandages or in rough fabric until the affected area becomes strong, and then proceed to treat the wound with hard flesh medicines for healing and consolidation.
And these are medicines that have a restorative and drying effect; when this happens, it is already healed and you do not fear repetition.
And if the fistula already protrudes into the rectum and is extended from the body's surface, then you should introduce your hand into the anus and investigate that area.
And if you find the object and between you and it is thinly covered with siphon or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then it's not an operation in them but rather according to trust and hope.
This situation can be handled in one of three ways: either by cauterizing that object as we have described; or by allowing the healing to occur within a point where you regain control of the situation so it's possible for you to manipulate that area and allow the healing process to continue; do not allow movement with drying procedures lest you penetrate the membrane containing the anus, and let your intention guide you over the patient's rectal pain during the process; then proceed by treating that area according to what we've said that leads to strength in health; or extend that object gently while draining any pus that dries up within the proximity of the anus as we have described, either on the object or with a sharp tool, and then refine those fistulated flesh tissues which are within the drying zone where you can apply pressure; and finally strive to restore the entire wound by drying, and if there's still pus above not consolidating, and opens up the fistula in the anal part, and only minor pus leaks over the patient. And there are times when the fistula ends according to this method: when you introduce the object into the fistula and is in the middle of the anus around the skin near the anus and at the margin of the anus, then it has the appearance of an perforated extremity that resembles a needle as follows:
And you should introduce the object into that layer wrapped in silk or around it; then proceed to introduce an object inside the layer within the fistula until you regain control of it.
And if it penetrates near the margin of the anus towards inside, then you should remove that object as you introduce your hand into the anus; and remove the tip of the object and adjust both ends equally, strengthen each one, and let this rest for a day or two. And when more of the object is penetrating into the flesh, strengthen it within those parts of flesh which are between the two ends of the object and can fit inside.
And then treat the wound once it has been consolidated and healed.
If the openings of the fistula are not penetrable, then make them penetrate in any manner that you have prepared, but rather in the region where it is present, so that you do not cause an incision that would leak; and then allow that to happen until it has healed.
The method of splitting the spine-like structure which is torn by the fistula: the curvature of that one is made quite sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that you do not make unnecessary incisions, thus sometimes.
Sewing hemorrhoids where there is inflammation in the site of those.
Hemorrhoids occur in two ways: when they are within resembling the buttocks like charcoal, or make those appear like raisin fat. And those are small and large ones, and the inflammation from those comes suddenly, and it's one for them all, and they're spots, and they're inside the anus, and at the extremities of that.
However, those that are outside the anus occur according to the times of little humidity, from which water turns yellow or has a slight inflammation in the body continuously, and according to the color of the body.
And the treatment of that which is inside the anus is that you command the patient to sit and to squeeze when the anus leaks and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Therefore you prepare yourself and suspend with ropes or whatever you have those near your knee, and then strike those at their joints.
If the ropes are not near those due to their moisture and softness, then take them with stiff fabric or with a cloth or with woolen sheet, pull those at your knees, and then strike those using your fingers, and place some powdered remedies over those close to the incision; or cauterize those according to what is prescribed in the section on cauterizing in this treatise. And then treat those with the other treatment until they heal.
And if the anus does not allow passage, then anesthetize the patient with anesthesia that includes a slight bite, and wash them with water from the anus that allows mild passage when the patient is squeezed.
However, if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, their cause is minor, so you should hold those near your knee, or take those with ropes and strike them, and then treat those as we have said until they heal.
And the one who has made an incision, take care to administer stitches according to this manner: take a covered thread and insert it into a needle and then remove the hemorrhoids from their locations, and make that pass through the needle at the joint of the other part, and wrap the two ends of the thread around the location beyond the needle, and longitudinally; tighten the hemorrhoid with strong tension, and then clip the thread and pull out the needle.
And do this to all of them, leave one undone for that reason, because the excess fluid from the inflammation will drain through that.
And then place over the anus cloth soaked in olive oil or bandage, and place that under the anus and command the patient to rest. And then wait for that to settle in; and when it heals, treat those with grease or other treatments until they heal.
And since they are old and do not benefit from that medicine, then make sure to clean those with the tip of the spine or with your knee until they become wet and have exuded pus above, which prevents their consolidation; and then treat those until they consolidate.
And then you keep that with an abundance of pus the first time until it causes inflammation and is scratched; and then treat those until they heal.
Know that abscess formation is the key, and not otherwise until you notice a reddening resembling the end of a needle throughout the body, especially in the limbs and hands, and for those pains, you should walk.
And then take care to make the one that is in the circulation of the key to be cut, and keep it with scissors or with ropes, and remove its joint; and then treat that.
And if you wish, cauterize according to what is prescribed in its chapter.
True warts are small, hard, round, and fleshy tumors on the surface of the body, and abscesses often occur in many children.
And for treatment, you should spread it out or make an incision on it, or tighten it with thread or cloth until it settles. And if you wish, cauterize this, as we have said, with fire or using acute medicine.
An ant is a small, soft or fleshy tumor that occurs on the surface of the body near the anus, and when you touch it feels like the bite of an ant, and it occurs around the body.
The treatment is to take a needle from the eagle or from the peacock's plumes, ensure it is strong, place that over the sting inside which the circle of the needle contains the part of his body; then rotate your hand around the needle as you pierce through the stinger circuit and stop at the base of the flesh, and extract the stinger from its wound.
And if you want, do this with an awl needle or iron according to this manner:
Make the part above the needle hole to be fine and silent (meaning not to cause perforation), wrapped around it, that on the said place of his body would have an appearance removed and the rotation of that.
And if you want, cauterize the stinger according to what was mentioned before in the cauterization of thyme in the tip of the cautery.
In terms of the tools that you should use for bleeding.
Some times bleeding is done with silver or tin spoons, melted or hammered instruments; and some times it's done with small and large tools depending on which ones you use. The smaller ones are used for treating small children in the healing of minor wounds; and for those where sores are present or painful, the bleedings from these should be small.
The form of large but few bleeding:
The tip of the needle of his body above where the bag is tied should be wide according to this manner; and place him in such position that the bag, when tied, is similarly positioned as often.
And the extremity of his pus, which enters the anus, should be closed (meaning not to open) as smooth as a lion's claw; and in one side of this pouch there are two cuts, and on the other side one cut, and the size of the cut according to the thickness of the pus, being larger for thicker ones.
And make the bag in which the medicines from a beast's bladder or sheepskin are placed, and his wound should be about one handspan.
And it should be punctured through smooth cuts as they are rotated; and if the space between those cuts is about its size.
And then insert into those cuts a strong piece of raw honey as about ten pieces, or roughly that number. Adjust the bag to this place; and when you place the bag on him, make it stretch in the tip of bleeding between two distinguished with strong constriction, and bleed under each cut: The quality of bleeding under these is that you fill the bag with medicine, heat it according to the tolerance of the patient; and watch that it's not too deep nor too shallow.
And then the patient should lie on his back, and lift their legs up and place them somewhere under him with another person or a stick; and then grease the tip of the cautery with oil, or with egg white or with extract of fennel or fenugreek; and then insert this into the anus with ease, and the healer should take the bag and squeeze it twice vigorously each time until everything inside the bleeding is evacuated out through the intestine; and then remove the bleeding and lift their legs to the wall.
And if the medicine pushes this into urine, use as much as you can; and if he sleeps with this for the entire night, it will be better later in adulthood.
And if you bleed this in the patient's abdominal fluids and urine leakage, then you will repeat this cauterization until he is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or boils in the anus, then this bleeding should be fine and gentle, like bleedings for children.
Regarding the treatment of wounds.
And I have already mentioned in the division of treating wounds what was suitable for free treatment, and thus I will say this treatment with me and with medicines according to its nature.
So I say that the wounds are diversified depending on how they occur and according to where they appear on his body.
And the causes for why small stones cause wounds are like gallstones, or injury of body parts, or impalement by bone, spear, or arrow, or from substances that cause stone formation.
And the wounds that are in parts of his body are like a wound that affects the head, or neck, or feet, or stomach, and so on for other limbs.
And I suggest treating some wounds by suspending this reasoning and rule about the others.
And I will begin with simple head wounds, for the consideration of compound wounds will come in the beginning of the next chapter.
So I say that when a simple head wound occurs and is not a fracture, then consider: if it's due to gallstones or something similar, already has taken the medicine until enough and it's large head wound and you fear the patient might get an internal abscess from this, then you should urinate and perform cephalic bloodletting immediately, don't delay this; and extract according to his virtue if there is no reason prohibiting bloodletting, especially if the discharge coming out of the wound is little.
And make bloodletting from opposite side of the wounded part; and watch that the patient doesn't overfill, doesn't drink water and doesn't eat heavy foods.
If you prohibit any cause from the beginning, then it will be diminished by food and not approach meat nor drink.
And place over the wound, if it happens that there is an abscess on him, apply oil heated either in fire or in water in which it is antiseptic.
If you are sure of an abscess on the fire, then place over the wound, if it is near to his heart and air has not changed that powder which I recommend very finely.
And if the air has already changed it, then place upon any ointment inside that is healing.
If the wound is large or due to dissection and similarity, and his lips are not adjusted for pins, then adjust those according to the stitches I recommend for their stitching.
If the wound has already been discovered from the bone and flesh, and it is not retention for him but a small suspensorium, then incise that and cure the wound with medicines and restore the flesh in place of the defect. Command the patient to eat vegetables where there are fibers: cabbage and forms like meat and similarity, until it is cooked.
And if there is putrefaction in the defect and does not stick to the bone, then you must incise all that pus and let it out, and cure that.
If in these wounds an artery or vein that could cause bleeding exists, and it is not removed by medicines, then you must inquire about the artery, and if you find that unincised one, then you must incise that with a sharp tool, or tie that; and if necessity requires that what we have said does not apply to you, then you must cauterize until the blood stops.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is minor. Therefore, you should powder this powder over them, until that powder stabilizes before the air changes those.
And the method of this powder is as follows: take oil of pomegranates part one, of dragon bark a part two, and of unextinguished tar parts three; grind it all thoroughly and sift it. Then fill your wound with this, and press it tightly for good compression until you can pour it over that, and then solidify in the blood.
And then sprinkle that with powder and leave it, do not remove it until you find that it has healed, which means that the medicine does not have to be taken internally for it to heal.
And sometimes you can do this alone with a cautery, when you don't have pomegranates and dragon bark available.
And this surgical procedure is done in large wounds when it seems fit to place it over those and tighten them, and the wounds are recent with their blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, especially when it's during summer time, then this method of placing this powder in its usual position is not applicable, rather treat those with what we've said, so place some digestible ointments over those, or you put these flour pols from the barn into water and honey until they turn into a paste; and further heal them with the other treatment until they are healed.
If there is an accident on the fracture wound in the bone and it's small, then you extract that with your hands.
And I direct the treatment of head fractures in what is poisonous.
Of the wounds on the chest.
If the wound occurs in the neck, then there's no difference in treatment compared to a simple head wound.
If the neck nerves or artery is incised, then if it's the nerve, it should not be treated internally in his stomach but avoid using substances that cause intense coagulation like zinc and say that they are toxic and similar to those that damage the nerves and constrict them. And do not place any cause over the wound that frees it, for the substance of nerves is freed and its continuation is in the brain which is the essence of all parts of the body.
And if this is treated with minor medicines like washing in hot or unheated oil, or when washed in boiled water and the other minor burns are treated according to this manner, then ointments are applied.
If the wound is large, then you should perform stitches, or tighten his lips, and further heal that with powders until it heals.
If the wound has depth or occurs in his lower part near the surface, then pierce that at the most depressed location.
If an artery is already incised in the wound and bleeding has been achieved, then you should separate or dry that, or tie it, or cauterize that if necessity requires.
If you have already incised the spondyls of the gole or all of them, and the veins on the chest are saved, then adjust his lips for stitches over the gole's stalk but do not touch that; equalize that and reduce it to its natural shape, then strengthen that with a decent structure, leave it for several days; further heal that with ointments where there is coagulation and stimulation until it heals.
If the wound has already created damage in the bone, then puncture that, and if there are bone fragments in him, extract all those you can from them; whatever cannot be removed, leave it until the wound heals, and make sure his relief is relieved.
And if the wound is recent, then apply over that powder which has been recommended. If in the wound a fistula has formed, then treat that with what will be remembered for its cure nearby in its head.
If it's the impact of a lance or a club, and you gauge its depth, then consider more if there is wind flowing from the wound when the patient breathes; then know that the wound is fatal.
And if there is no depth to it and the wound is recent on its surface, then you should apply the first aid powder here, and don't use that for which it would retain the sanguine humor at the depth of the wound and return to the heart causing malaise, but instead leave an attractive ointment here, and cleanse those two washes a day.
And if the ointment is not at your disposal, then you should cover the wound's opening with a cloth to let out what comes from moisture; and make the patient lie on the wound so that what is contained flows.
If already three days or more have passed from the wound and no seizure or heart tremor occurs in the patient, nor does there occur a constriction of the veins, then consider that the wound is saved; and thereafter treat it with warm baths and all other good treatments until healed.
If the healing of your patient is excused and all time has passed, then know that a fistula has already formed; therefore treat it accordingly from its head.
And if the wound is due to incision of a space or from a club, and it's simple on the surface of the foot or two, then treat that with what follows before suture if it's large, or with powder if it's small.
If it has already formed pus in the bone, and your patient's bones are cut, then you should press the wound and take them out to extract those pieces if they are separated. If they are not separated, then smooth them inside until the wound discharges, for which the extraction of these becomes easier.
And for other wound accidents in the other limbs, juvenile healing is what we have said about it.
Of the wounds of the abdomen.
The indisposition which occurs in the belly is either great, or small, or midway between them.
And for small disruptions it is done in another manner, and I know that the return of them to their place is more difficult, if you do not take care of the introduction of them back to their place promptly, which opens up and swells so that the material of your patient becomes difficult.
And therefore the best disruption is midway, where it's not difficult to return the intestine in that one, similarly as it is difficult in the two previously mentioned species.
And know that suture of the abdomen is according to four manners, but two stitches are common and apply in stitches of other wounds of the heart.
And there are two more stitches peculiar to these, but however they are even more peculiar in the suture of the abdomen.
And I advise you to include every exposition and declaration in your instructions.
So state that when the wound is small and pushed by some cause of the intestine through it, making its reduction difficult, then this is in one of these two manners: or due to the minuteness of the disruption as we have said, or when the intestine swells due to the coldness of the air.
And when it's like this, you should wet the skin with cold water or use a damp cloth dipped in hot water, or take one in cold water that sours, and mint, and you immerse the part of the intestine into which the swelling is present until the swelling resolves.
And some washes do this very well in which there is astringency, and it's better than just water for resolving swelling.
And when you want the swelling to resolve, then you soak the intestine with water in which garlic and almonds are placed, for this helps to alleviate your patient's material from a little cause.
If your patient's material is alleviated by this treatment, then break up the disruption with a small instrument where you have inserted needles.
And the first treatment is better when it's adequate and isn't drying, without needing to dry in excess or cause deficiency.
Regarding the instrument, if its shape is such:
One part of its shape is rounded and sharp, while the other part is not acute, with a subtle tip, but not so subtle that it becomes blunt just a little bit.
And when the wound is enlarged and forces out of the intestine, you should know that its return should follow its natural form, in its proper place, if it's possible upon this, which is better.
And when the disruption is wide and located in the lower part of the abdomen, you should have the patient lie on their back, placing their legs as close to their head; and if it's in the upper part of the abdomen, then place your head and feet further than the parts left.
When the disruption is in one of the two halves of the belly, then you should focus your understanding and consideration on that area so that the part with the trouble may be more than the other.
And thus care for this in the major pains and in the minor pains.
And in the small pains, use what you have prepared and make sure to let the person who administers it be among your most experienced. They should hold the wound entirely with their hand and adjust the lips of the wound. Additionally, place them close enough together so that each stitch is done closely followed by another.
And this is the common method of suturing: when you take the needle or count the number of needles according to the size of the wound; then lay off from the end of the disruption of the ring finger, and hold the needle in one place, or another that you do not put your thread into both ends of the cord, at both ends of which is left the part within each other when you make it penetrate through that part; and you have added both ends of the cord and both ends of the thumb. Then you make four rows like this.
And then hold the thread double in the circuit of the needle, and stitch together parts from both ends at the same time. Then add both lips and wound by adding in a decent manner; and adjust the thickness of the finger and place another needle there, and stitch that with thread as you would with the first needle. And don't stop doing this while threading the needles until you have completed all the contraction of the wound.
And let the needles be medium in hardness and delicacy; for delicate needles cut the flesh more easily. And thick ones are difficult to insert in the cord; thus it is wise that they should be medium in both delicacy and thickness.
And don't let the needle be placed at both ends of the thread far apart; for that way the flesh will not be cut too easily and the wound will heal in front of its consolidation.
And don't let the stitches be too long so that the wound isn't hindered from healing properly.
And then cut the ends of the needles so they don't penetrate too deeply into the patient's thigh and thus not allow them to bleed excessively; place powders that expand from all parts over the stitches, where you have the ends of the needles; leave them like this until you know the wound has already consolidated.
And this method of using needle stitches is particularly suitable for small wounds, where you can often use just one or two needles around them.
The second method of suturing involves this: you should administer the stitches with four ends, both ends of the thread and both ends of the thumb, in one go, using a needle where the thread is wrapped evenly in terms of delicacy and thickness.
And when you have placed the needle through these four ends, return the needle from that part which started, so that the thread being pulled will not push up the other part towards the wound, making sure that the stitches are according to the sewing of cloth where the cloths are tight.
And pause between each stitch the thickness of your finger's breadth.
And this stitch I know how to do.
And with such a stitch, I healed the wound that happened to a man in his belly which was torn by a rope, and it was an eruption of the major wound as large as a palm. It was situated inside about two palms from each side of my location; it was the disruption in the middle of the member; and then I returned that (the rope) after the wound had been penetrated for twenty-four hours.
And the wound was consolidated in about fifteen days or so, and he healed it and became well; and then this kind of medicine worked with various remedies, and he recovered his health.
And the other doctors had judged that it would not be healing; and by miracle of fire, though I did not cure him with ointment, which was in a place where neither the ointment nor any medicine could be found, rather placed my hand like many times on the wound just twice each day and washed it vigorously with honey water, and that healed.
I may tell you two types of stitching according to the story of Paul.
And it is that you begin with the needle of the stitch, and insert the needle from one part to the inside part.
And so as the needle pierces the thread and within it enters points according to rectitude and length across all the body, let the end of the silk remain in which you have inserted the needle; and make the needle penetrate in the other end of the thread from inside to outside in the other end of the fabric.
And when you have made that piercing, then make another piercing in the same horizontal end of the fabric from outside to inside; let the end of the silk be which is here, and make the needle penetrate in the other end of the fabric from inside to outside.
And make that piercing in the silk at which you have made that piercing in the fabric at the end of the thread, which is inside the patient where all of it should penetrate.
And from this horizontal side begin, pinching that at the end which is on the thread fabric at the other side, and remove the needle of the thread which penetrated, then pinch it in this thread and make the end of the thread which is on the other side opposite to this end of the fabric; and remove that from the thread which comes from the patient.
And do this once and again, and repeat this with another piercing between which you sew all that is outside according to that example.
And the conclusion of this method of stitching is that you sew with thread on which you sew the skin, so that you sew the silk at the end of the fabric part, and let that other piercing remain until it is completed.
The second type of my own stitching that I call Gualia, according to its description and as recommended by others, is that you sew it according to its likeness on which some doctors sew it, so they add all parts to their corresponding part according to nature; and apply the end of another from them and the end of the fabric at the other end of them, and this is done according to what I have recommended to you.
When you hold the needle at your fingertips of the outside end, make that penetrate into the inside part in this single spot, and let two ends of the silk; then rotate the needle and have it penetrate from outside to inside in two ends of the silk.
And rotate each one of those, and make that penetrate into the inside part between the outside part in two ends of the fabric other than which are on this side.
And this method of stitching is better than the common lighter sewing, and it is stitching which has prior knowledge.
This is the description of Gualia.
And as such, abdominal stitching is corrected with two needles, so you insert into these each one a thread, and begin by inserting the needle of what you are supposed to do, and have that penetrate inside the other side according to stitching on which they sew equalizing organs.
And know that when disruption is in the middle of the abdomen, then this stitching is more difficult than from other parts of the abdomen.
The treatment for wounds follows the treatment of other wounds.
This is the cause: when you obtain the wound fresh at its root before air alters it, and return the hernia and sew that properly, then place over it powdered meat.
And if air has already altered the wound, then place over it such ointments which you have at your disposal so that they make hard peyra and take care of the threads, and let them solidify meat and fabric; and treat it in this way like the treatment of other wounds until it is healed.
And if medicines are not at your disposal, then place over it immediately, since it starts to ooze pus, like milk, and change that twice a day as you have been taught, until it is healed, which you would not need other medicine in various situations when the wounds are simple.
And if you fear that the wound might spread to the main limbs, then when you immerse lion wool in oil of high quality, or in heated oil, place this over the area and leave it between the armpits and let these be.
And if you feel pain or decay in its hernias, which happens with these days, then rub that with a black anticoagulant vinegar, and especially if the pus has spread inside the hernia and is caused by drainage penetrating into its cavity.
And know that which comes from the larger hernia is a light pus for healing, while that which comes from finer hernias.
And it is difficult to heal which hernia that is called “gegunu” does not receive healing from wounds that affect it completely; and this is due to the large number of veins that are in it and the magnitude that is within those, and the subtlety of its body, and its proximity to the nature of nerves.
If what you are dealing with is the fabric of the disease and successfully reach that layer, return that second one according to your judgment along which you reduce the hernias equally.
If it has entered the patient's space and turned either red or black, then you strengthen that on the spot where the damage was done, to allow for fluids of infection to come through, considering that in the fabric there are veins and arteries.
And you should insert what is another layer of tissue underneath it, and place the two ends of the fabric hanging from the starting point of the disease area, so that you can be relieved of your concern about the patient's recovery. You must sew the fabric and release the discharge of the disease.
Remembrance of diseases when they occur in the intestine.
When disruption happens in the intestine and is small, then it might be repaired in some people. This is why I saw that one who was hit in his abdomen by a spear had abdominal gangrene as an old condition causing fistula, and his pain and flatulence subsided.
So I sought the treatment for him even though it wasn't treated in his healing process, but I found a way to heal it internally and the area becomes solidified.
And I noted the location that became solidified, observing over his body what happened due to that bad event in his abdomen; and not caused any further harm due to that bad accident and changed his diet and drinking habits. He then took baths and exercised according to my instructions.
And some experienced people say that when disease affects the intestine and is small, then one should cover it according to this method: you need to take large cabbages; next adjust the two edges of the diseased area, placing a piece of cabbage with an open mouth over those two edges. Then, when they are covering it, strengthen its mouth, cutting off its head, which sticks and doesn't dissolve.
And you should place another cabbage close to the first one, and do not stop doing this by placing cabbages one after another according to the amount of the whole diseased area.
And you should reduce that and cure the disease; remove those extra cabbages in the intestine until the intestine is cured; there should be no harm to the body due to this.
And it is possible that the intestine can be treated with something subtle made from animal intestines which is thicker; and you need to take the end of those intestinal tubes, make them clean, place their ends near this tube, encasing them, then insert these tubes into needles and thread them through this area, reducing it in the disruption.
And this method of sewing with cabbages is merely following a path of trust and hope.
If the disease is large and wide, especially if it's in one of the finer intestines, then it can't just be treated with refinement; it doesn't treat the entire body.
Regarding the treatment of wounds and fistulas.
Knowing that all diseases and pus form when they become old and hardened, causing ulcers, which do not heal or release fluid continuously, so, in any part of the body, it is universally named a fistula, and we call that one 'wound'.
A true fistula is a tightly packed nodule, hard, white, not painful, and where one can feel it as if feeling the skin of an animal; thus, that particular region is named 'penis'.
And it exists in some people who are wet, which releases fluid; and if the moisture is strong, it can be released within a few hours. And in some cases this wetness turns into pus, which is little and thick, but subtle.
I have already shown all those causes, their symptoms and the treatment with medicines as explained in the division.
So this is how I will teach you the treatment of a fistula which is made through surgical operation using my knowledge.
Knowing that fistula can occur in any part of the body; some are caused by veins and arteries, nerves, bladder, intestine, or in proximity to major limbs and similar areas.
And among these types of fistulas that occur due to difficulties in healing and not receiving treatment, the management of such cases is a challenge due to lack of knowledge and skills.
And if it is concerning one of the fistulas whose depth does not reach to these places that were mentioned, and you wait and trust in the patient's recovery while hoping for knowledge about this, then try methods like burning or cutting; and if the fistula follows a straight path, then explore it with your hand.
If the fistula is tortuous, then investigate it with a subtle lead method, which is where lead from the patient's body is lifted and curved against the tortuosity.
And if the fistula has no movement or is silent, it isn't within your capacity to operate on it with this method.
Then cleanse the opening by your openings, through which the moisture for cleansing that thing will flow from the other openings and go out of them.
And inquire carefully, according to the manner by which you are capable of knowing if there are bones or nerves here, and whether it is a distant or local cavity. Or this is a fistula with multiple openings and covers all your strength, through your questioning of the patient, by which you question the sick person, and the knowledge of the pain should be by your pressure on the body, resembling the meanings and causes of complications in pus.
And when you have assessed all those causes at the truthful station, then proceed with treatment according to confidence: it is that you consider this, whether the fistula appears nearby or in the place of exhalation, distant from joints, or from nerves, or an artery, or a vein, or any other location which I have mentioned and told you.
Then you dry the fistula as was described in its narration for the patient's case, and maintain this until there is drainage from the putrefied flesh and whatever has emerged from that opening in the meat or any part of it, and cure that inside where it has healed.
And if the fistula is of distant depth and follows a straight path, then dig it until it reaches as far as you can, and adjust that to remove all its putrefied flesh; and also administer hot ointments wrapped in sharp remedies, and introduce those into the cavity of the fistula which you have comprehended with iron.
And do this by making some incisions inside where the acute medicine will erode all that is rotten in the cavity of the fistula due to putrefaction.
And then restore that with ointments which generate healthy flesh where it has healed.
And if it does not heal through this method, then you apply the cautery according to what we have recommended.
And if the cause of the fistula is bone and you must confirm this, then inquire about it and dry it as we have recommended. If you do not prohibit any cause of a vein or nerve or main member, as we have said.
And if the bone is revealed to you and there is putrefaction and blackness in the patient, then you must cut into that where all the putrefaction has been located. And then heal it by promoting the growth of flesh inside so that it heals.
And if it is not healed and behaves like that as before, then you realize that you have not achieved the total eradication of the putrefaction; and thus, you reveal to yourself about this again thoroughly, and take care of your own strength by performing the operation on this second time, and then restore that.
And if it is healed, then well done; and otherwise, you realize that this putrefaction is in the distant depth of the body, which has not been achieved, and thus for that one, it's merely to leave that.
And if the bone is rotten and small, or it is within your capability to pull it out, then you perform this action using fine tongs suitable for that task.
And if it is bones, then carefully make the extraction of all those, and from this do not leave any cause for your strength.
And if it encounters any cause of moisture resistance and in their incision there is neither fear nor error, then you cut those ligaments or tissues if they are here, and deliver the bones.
And if you are not prepared to stay with the bones of your time, then pause over that wound so that that wound remains in it, and leaves it within the vicinity of those bones and ligaments, and prevents the wound from hardening, and ensures the closure of the section that you have incised in your operation.
But if you fear, pause over the cut submerged in heated oil, or the cut submerged in Egyptian ointment, or any other kind of ointment with vertigo, so that when these ligaments are released and the bones are separated from each other, this extraction is relieved.
And if it's a large bone like the bone of a rib or thigh bone or such, and what from you is corrupted is only the flesh of this person, then cut that just behind where that blackness and corruption is located, and then restore the wound.
And if what from you is corrupted is a large portion, and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it's necessary to close this and all that incision into the location where the corruption has been achieved, and then heal that once it's hardened.
And I recommend to you what happens in a person during their thigh, that you pause this according to the example and assistant on your operation.
Translate the first sentence into English:
And then, throughout the time of this treatment based on the error of doctors until the abscess is opened, and corrections are made to his moving parts, his cure was carefully carried out while the change was forming into a fistula, and operations were performed on the pus orifices which all led to drainage and body moisture.
And then the extensive treatment by doctors lasted for two years, and I did not know much about it until I was called in.
And I saw the change in him and the fluids that flowed from his those orifices through large veins; and already, the body of that man was completely hardened and his color was yellow.
And then I inserted a tube into one of those orifices and conducted the treatment to the mouth.
And then, I examined all those orifices closely and found that they were connected from every part of the body.
And then I carefully cut and incised into one of those orifices where I discovered a part of the bone, and removed that decayed material; it was already rotten and decayed, and deteriorated; and it had decayed a part of the body within which it had reached into the marrow.
And then I made preparations for what was revealed to me that pertained to the discovered bone.
And I checked that it was not within the bone but rather that corruption which caused and led to decay, and I had already removed it.
And then I proceeded with the long-term restoration of the wound using consolidative medicine, but it did not consolidate properly.
And then I repeatedly examined and rediscovered on the bone following the initial discovery, and continuously found decay on the bone.
And I carefully removed what appeared to be from that decay, and then proceeded to thoroughly prepare for the treatment and restoration of him, but it was not restored properly.
And then I discovered another vein and did not stop gently drilling into the bone little by little, performing the restoration of him, but it was not restored until I drilled around one palm's distance away, and extracted from his marrow, and then restored that with medicines; it consolidated slightly and healed.
And there is no need for repetition in the operation of this and section of him but due to the position of his nerves and the limited tolerance of his pain and fear of death, which would happen to him at all times from overabundance of evacuation leading to a bad syncope.
And therefore, health is through complete healing, and nothing is in place of hard bone flesh; good positioning for him has been made within his body and virtue returns to him; he is consulted about his positions and does not do anything against his movements or injury under any cause.
If there is an opening in the body already made in the chest area, then follow this method to proceed:
And place a stick or table in front of the bone reasonably, so when you do this, it's not forbidden to use the saw that doesn't cut through the rotten flesh.
And know that the saw should be used on the corrupted area little by little; if it is in the concavity of the rotten bone and does not appear in its manifestation when touched, force the opening of another vein.
And if the bone is rotten and not prominent, before it continues to one side from the other, where the decay is in the middle or part of him, then you must expose all the flesh everywhere; and place a stick in front, and proceed to cut through the first part until there's decay inside which should continue sawing on the next part.
And make the sawing according to the location of the decay as we have said.
And if the decay is in the joint, cut into that decayed joint and saw through the bone where it continues from the other side.
And if the decay is in the continuation of two joints, then it's not directly in him but in between.
And if the decay is in the palm of your hand or chest area, it's very difficult; however, know where the decay appears to you in which manner and once you've identified that, expose it, then proceed according to each position possible for you, and adjust every tool towards you as long as they don't oppose veins or nerves.
And know which are the drills and saws to drill and saw these bones depending on the position of the bones, their preparation, their size, their subtlety and grandeur or smallness, and their hardness and rarity; so be aware that you prepare for every type of operation suitable instrument for that operation.
And know that this operation means to you about the specifics of the tool you would need; when you have great study and long experience with the methods of this art, and testimony from methods used in treating illnesses, if you have already done these operations for yourself, then place what is convenient according to each tool for every illness.
And I will show you at the end of this chapter the number of tools that you will use, as well as those for which you will follow your prohibition which you will experience on the others. Saw shape:
Shape of another saw:
Shape of another large saw:
Shape of a lancet: The head of this lancet should follow the shape of the head of a star-shaped key, and its points should follow the shape of the points almond-shaped.
And it should only be that at those parts friction is applied to the heads of the joints when they are corrupted, or that there is a large wide mouth.
Shape of the smaller razors:
Shape of the side razor:
Shape of another well-made saw: it should have an arc above the pus and the sharpness of its iron, and the member of its handle is to be made decently descending. Shape of it:
Shape of the razor with a hollowed-out area:
Shape of another subtle razor:
Shape of another curved-ended razor:
Shape of small razors resembling those of spiders:
Shape of another smaller cutting tool:
Shape of another cutting tool; this is similar to a saw, and its end resembles a blade, and it is exhibited in various locations along the bones:
Shape of the lancet which should be as fine as those that penetrate through the bones.
And its end is triangular and has a sharp point.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly hollowed like all the causes that we have said about razors, cutting tools, and saws.
Of the tip of the incision and of the joint's lock.
The tips either press or due to an intrinsic cause or an extrinsic cause, or as you have treated that corruption with the curative action of those medicines and the cure doesn't take effect, or sometimes the corruption must be removed from the member which you haven't been able to press against any cause. In this case, hollow out that member inside your incision so that the disease can access it, for the patient's recovery may come through this means, or by a misfortune that is greater harm than the original malady of the limb.
And the sign of where you are affecting is that the limb becomes black inside which should be red, or you bring the blackness into that part of the limb that affects it and consumes it entirely in the body; then continue with your incision at this point.
Similarly, if it is due to the effect of certain poisonous causes like that of a marine scorpion or sea worm or ratel and their equivalents.
And if the corruption or the impact is in the extremity of that finger, then you cut into the finger and do not allow space for the corruption to enter your hand.
And similarly if it reaches your hand, then you cut that part of the inside of the wrist, and do not allow space for the corruption to enter in the elbow of the arm.
And if it affects that area, then cut into the arm towards the armpit at the joint.
And if the corruption passes elsewhere and often around the armpit, then that is death for the patient; administer another cause to counter this in treatment is an abundance of virtue.
And similarly do with the chest when corruption affects that part of the chest; then you cut there towards one of the nipples.
And if it penetrates into the sternum of the chest, then you cut all of the chest. And if it extends into the diaphragm, then you cut through the lung at the junction of the diaphragm.
And if the corruption has already reached beyond the diaphragm, then in this case it's only release and leaving the patient to death.
The method of cutting or sawing the limb is this: you tighten one piece of muscle at the part you wish to cut, and place another piece of muscle over it. Extend your assistant's hand with one piece of muscle towards the remaining parts, and extend their hand with another piece towards that area; then separate the flesh which lies between two muscles so that all the flesh is exposed without a gap; and then proceed to cut or saw.
And make sure that a piece of the skin is laid out from all sides in such a way that it doesn't touch the area being cut, and that the injury comes to the patient's wound properly sized and with a pus blister.
And if bleeding occurs when you work, then you cauterize the area carefully, or place some powder that intensifies blood on it; and proceed to your treatment until it's completed.
And afterwards, lay the injured limb under the muscle in such a way that it's comfortable, and treat it so that it heals.
And I advise you to watch out for what happens in his foot, this is an unfortunate event that I have advised both to you and myself, which often occurs in him with darkness in his foot, due to the assembly being akin to fire's combustion.
And that corruption happens first in his right hand inside which extends throughout the foot.
And then that man prepares himself for the doctor to drain pus because the healing tends towards the body with the force of its pain and the heat of his body, and he incises that foot into the joint, and heals it.
For a long time this corruption event has been happening in his right hand.
And then it befalls to me, and I proceed to feel the excess on what is placed above my hand of the medicines, close to the transformation of the body; and the excess does not revert, but begins to spread into the other hand where it began in the hand.
And he asks me to incise my hand on him, and I do not want to do this fearing the effect of that excess, rather I dread the incision of his hand's death, for the virtue of the patient was upon disease.
And when he recovers from me, he returns to his land and informs me that this man prepared himself and incised his entire hand, and he healed.
And I have not recounted this story merely for the sake of assistance in understanding this kind of illness, and its meaning is ascribed to it according to which it is understood and by which it is performed.
Regarding the treatment of sinuses and the quality of enemas with medicines.
When gangrene affects the flesh of certain parts and the space of the gangrene is prolonged, it collects pus. Then it bursts and pierces, allowing the pus to escape from him, leaving the place empty as if it were a vessel. The cloth that covers this, like a fine sheet, does not reach deeper corruption, nor spreads into bones or nerves, or inside the body cavity; such an area is called a sinus, and it is not referred to as a fistula.
However, if the space is prolonged so that corruption begins in some member, then it is called a fistula and not sinus.
And the treatment for it is to incise that sheet completely as if it were being twisted, especially when it's fine and done like a cloth, and make sure you don't stick it due to its corruption.
If you hope that the sheet will stick and that this corruption hasn't reached by subsequent consequence, then your treatment is with an enema in the sheet.
And you consider the sinus, and if it's large, the arm that smells of fat, then administer an Egyptian enema using medicine made from oil, vinegar, and wine, with equal parts taken in a container, and they are heated over fire until the medicine is cooked and reaches honey-like consistency.
And then you take what is necessary from him and dissolve it in water and honey; administer this to the sinus, strengthen his opening, and let the medicine rest in him for about two hours.
And then you extract that with precision; do this for several days until the sinus is healed and his shame is restored.
And some times an enema is made with ash water when you don't have this medicine at your disposal; so take the ash of wood, mix it with water; then drink that and administer it as an enema until you notice that the sinus has stopped.
And if the patient doesn't tolerate the Egyptian medicine or ash water, then administer an enema with water and honey mixed with wine that has been strained, and do the same with wine and honey mixed. Honey's property is to transform and cleanse, while wine makes the sinus stick more so when there is excess of coagulation and dryness in it.
And when you do this for a few days and notice that the sinus has healed, then administer an enema with what causes meat to birth in him.
And you take from the dyafinicon ointment and dissolve that in rubbed oil and vinegar; or you administer this as an enema with some medicines and other ointments which have the properties I have already written about in the book on ointments.
And if the sinus opening is narrow where you can't insert the catheter of the enema, then gradually enlarge it with a small piece of metal, and rest in him covered in Egyptian ointment or basilicum ointment until it's enlarged.
And similarly if the opening is wide, then you add his cheeks with suture and leave him the quantity in which the enema fits.
And if the opening of him from which the arm flows is elevated to his parts above, then dry that at the lowest point where it's in him so that the arm can flow down. For when the arm is constricted in the depth of the sinus, the meat will be produced in him.
And if it's not possible to dry the sinus inside near the bone at the lowest point as you wish, then perforate it in preparation for the member so that the arm flows slightly from him according to your ability and ensures there is no obstruction of the arm.
May that be over the opening of the sinus, which you enlarge at all times to ensure that it does not restrict the motion of the arm. And so you can know whether what flows from the arm is a lot or little, if it's being digested, or not.
And also always consider the location of that sinus, whether the patient feels pain there or not, and if it's in pus.
And as your treatment is prolonged in such manner, you observe the matter that's being discharged over the sinus opening has adhered or approaches adherence; then you let it be for a day or two. When you remove the dressing, change the sheet and renew the ointment.
May it be that if there's ample space close to the sinus where viruses are subtle, do not waste over the adherence of it, for the healing process is taking hold in him; this applies to certain individuals who have a delayed response in their bodily wounds and those who undergo the opposite procedure.
And if the arm is indigest for several days close to the sinus, then you understand that the sinus does not adhere; and if the adherence of the sinus takes time and becomes prolonged, then adjust in drying out the medicines. And if the medicines are moistened in their substance and in their effectiveness, they are dried as well into a beeswax form, when there's excess addition of oil in it.
And the best remedy for what is being treated comes from beeswax ointment that's dissolved in roasting oil, and is applied as much as needed on it, and you place this near them, use this.
And when there's no arm, beeswax ointment and honey, when mixed inside the wound cause it to swell, use this; or take myrrh and aloes and ground these, mix them with honey on a flame, then place this near the sinus; and place this with honey that has been mixed inside causing swelling, grind this further into powder onto linen, strengthen this over the sinus;
And sometimes it is administered to you from the aristocracy of long speech and wisdom (and this is heavenly lily) and flour from earthworms and centaurian, use these simple remedies or adjust them, grind those finely and sift into honey as I've recommended; and use this.
And if the sinus is prolonged and isn't healed by this cure, then you know that corruption is within him, and it has already inquired into bones or other hard members or ligaments; then you heal it with a tuberculous treatment, as previously mentioned.
From the treatment of eruptions and nail scraping, and addition to finger cuts, and sectioning.
Apanarici is an eruption which doesn't let the nail of the said foot or hand die out, and strengthens in other digits too; and when it's prolonged and its treatment is costly, it either becomes a pus-filled eruption, or turns corrupt, and you immerse your arm so that it corrodes the root of the nail, and you strengthen the corruption all over, and spread its corruption into the bone where its odor smells rotten, and cut off the extremity of said side, and the color of it is made black.
And so when you have that as we've discussed in the division and don't confirm your cure, then consider that you must cut off all excess that has gathered under the nail and proceed with burning the wound near it, where burning is beneficial in this case.
May it be if the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, and the projections of the nail have already encompassed the flesh towards the divisions inside, they start piercing it and guide this way, then consider that you should pause at the delicate part leaving a subtle angle under the nail that pierces the flesh, push this further into it with ease and cut through that flesh gently, pause on what remains of the flesh from the use of burning corrosive medicines until all is sufficiently enlarged; then proceed to heal this with ointments until it's healed.
May it be if corruption has already spread into the bone, then consider that you must cut out the bone at that point and remove it, because there is no healing when the bone is corrupt.
And if you observe the corrosion and corruption spreading into that digit, then consider cutting it at one of the joints according to how its memory is pressed, and proceed to heal this once it's healed.
May it be if there's pressure or injury to the nail, and if that pain is severe, then consider doing bloodletting at the onset near the foot, and proceed to dry the nail with an acute blade on a crosswise section above in juice; see to it that the drying doesn't reach into the flesh left behind by the nail, for this would cause severe pain in the foot, and results in the formation of excessive tissue adjustment in that place; then proceed to heal that area according to what relieves pain.
A disease that often appears in some men, it makes their flesh very thin and weak, and also weakens their bones or weakens their nails.
Such things are inherent in the nature of the joints, or it is the natural state for them in some of their joint's anatomy. The one that occurs naturally in some joints is not harmful, whereas the one that happens in joints making them weak is harmful.
And for those that are fleshly, the section is slight; you should make an incision there to its proper depth.
As for the one that occurs in the depth of the joint, the cure is difficult; therefore, be careful with cutting it.
As for the one that occurs naturally in the joint, take care with the joints; when you make your incision, do it at the beginning of the bone, and carefully cut into it with a round-edged blade, then proceed to cure it so that it heals.
The consolidation which occurs among joints due to their movements or by nature of the body that grows in this manner, or through the consolidation from disease or fire burn, or due to deformities; when this consolidation occurs within the joints, make sure it is cured so they return to their natural shape.
And between their layers apply oil that has been rubbed for not to consolidate lightly, and separate them among each other or place a thin layer of lead under where it should be consolidated as you go.
Similarly, if consolidation occurs in certain joints on the palm, then you dry that consolidation as it is prepared and conforms to the figure of the member.
From incisions made by tools, they are varicose.
The tools create varicose veins, which are large, full of melancholic excesses. These occur in the joints of the body's members, and their greatest manifestation is often on the chest area, but especially for those who travel, work, or carry loads.
Then you should administer black cholera's heart purge to produce strong evacuations in some of them, and then bleed the patient from the basilic vein.
The cure of their black blood is according to two methods: one is to make an incision and remove that dark blood, and the other method is to elevate the vein and extract it all.
The section of it is according to this method: embrocate at the beginning with hot water and salt into the joint until the thick blood dissolves, which becomes fluid in the joint, then strengthen the patient's knee up to the top of their thigh under the joint, and lift your hand holding the vein above where it leaves the joint on both sides, and dry the black blood at a place or in two, or three with wide sections, and lift the black blood to your waist inside and above it, until you extract the desired amount of blood, which will take away the essence of the knee.
Then guide him to that point and command him to avoid foods that cause black cholera.
And repeat the cure through phlebotomy when the veins are filled and you notice in the knee area.
The elevation of them is according to this method: you should warm the knee by rubbing it if there are joints on your knee, and then immerse it in hot water while applying hot water to the joint until it reddens and the veins become prominent; or it can be exercised with vigorous exercise if bathing is not available, as long as the member is scraped.
And dry the leg at the right of the vein by section along its length or at the back of it, or at the lowest part of it you should remove the knee, or at the lowest point of it you should remove the foot.
And cut the leg with scissors and clean out the vein from all sides until you feel it, and you should observe the appearance of it which resembles that redness turning to black.
And therefore, as soon as you have evacuated and from the leg you take that white which is like a string.
And then place those ends of it inside so that they are elevated and hanging from the leg, and suspend them in a bucket or a lion's skin.
And then dry another section near that section for three fingers, and scrape the leg from the part above the vein until it appears.
And then lift that and make an incision at the very last section which should reach to the foot, and then extract it and lift it until you can see through the second section, and then extract it from the section above that.
Do that until you extract it from the section which is more prominent or another of all sections, so that everything can be seen; then make an incision there.
And if you don't follow to extract and lift it, then insert a strong double-thick needle there and pull out the string, or insert your thread there and twist your hand in all directions so that it hangs. And make sure not to make an incision; if it breaks, you will have difficulty lifting that movement and it will become problematic for the knee due to that injury.
And once all that has been taken out is hanging down, then place over the site of the wound wool soaked in vinegar and rubbed oil and un-rubbed oil, and cure it so that it heals.
And if the body is contracted with curvature in which it is enveloped in its parts, and does not follow straightness as we have said, then cut that wherever you find curvature and the places of envelopment of the body, and suspend that with threads under which lift that completely.
And when you should have your section, make sure not to invade the vein and do not trouble that area; it will be difficult for you to lift that. Use caution in that matter.
Shape of the incision at which the body is closed:
It is not as heated to the patient as to nails nor does it have a sharp tip so as not to irritate the vein; and it has great flexibility like a lion, for if it were subtle, it would cut into the vein due to its subtlety; having said that, it should be in excess of the normal size as we have said.
Regarding the extraction of the crural vein.
This vein is generated in the legs at the lower parts, like Al-Ategi in the desert areas of Arabs and in the dry southern lands of India where little vegetation can exist, and there neither grass nor trees grow.
And in other parts of the body, it is generated elsewhere like the legs.
And the origin of this is decay that leaves you, like poison within the body snake-like and worms and maggots and parasites causing decay between the poison and the flesh.
And the sign of anticipation for this occurrence is that this vein, in the leg inflamed; and when you see it blistered; and nearby begins the vein departure from the site of that blisters, as if from a plant's root.
And when you see the extremity come out, then take care to place upon that a piece of lead whose weight is equal to one drachm; within two drachms, and immerse it and flatten the lead suspended from the abdomen.
And for as many times as the veins of your patient cause to appear outside the parts, wrap this in lead and guide that. And if the movement is prolonged, then you should incise a part of it and wrap the rest; do not incise that right away from its end which would be outside, for if you incise that, it contracts and enters the flesh causing pus formation and inflammation in that place and a bad ulcer.
And when you should have it treated gently and be extracted little by little, so that it is pulled out from the rear of its body and not dragged by any cause within the body.
And this vein is found in some people that extends up to their waist length and has surpassed me, as I have incised one measuring twenty hands.
And if it is incised during its treatment process, then insert the needle into the patient's vein and pierce that inside long vein in the body, so that all that exists within the material is evacuated, and administer decay to that area with some days worth of medicines; and then treat that for the healing of pus.
And this vein sometimes has ramps in it, and mostly when it appears at the chest junction or on the chest, it creates openings in the patient, and it is found coming out of any of those opening branches.
And therefore treat that as we have said in division and for what was mentioned above.
Regarding the section on removing worms generated under the skin, it is called cattle sickness.
This disease is named in some regions as cattle sickness due to the fact that many times in cattle, there are worms which have a little length and it's body is found between the poison and flesh, and it travels throughout the whole body upwards and downwards, and it becomes evident by feeling their presence in each part of the body as they break through the skin and protrude.
And its generation is from decay of some fluids like the occurrence of worms, snakes, earthworms and hookworms in the stomach.
And it is found due to the cunning of this disease, when it goes into the body and rises to the head, then a strong lead comes in it and enters and destroys the head, and thus there are many times veins.
And when you want to treat and extract that, it should not be done unless you observe its movement and appearance at your touch, then cut where you find this above it and what is left of it firmly, and then dry it over it and extract.
And if it is spread in the flesh and does not adhere, then you pause with a cautery from fire on the spot where it lives, and the main cause that is feared is decay of it as we have said.
And if it goes into the head near the forehead, then press firmly on the upper eyelid with strong constriction, and then dry over it, and extract; cut where·the patient uses to change their body with medicines that evacuate putrid bad fluids, and guard against foods causing decay.
Regarding the treatment of cattle sickness.
This disease is named as 'nafir' in our land, and it's pain that appears in some limbs, and then spreads from one limb to another.
And I have seen this twice, which I will now describe. I was called to assist a sick woman in a town, and I found her arm swollen slightly along the spinal vein of the arm. After an hour when it was inflamed, I saw that swelling go away as if it were moving up towards this area, somewhat faster than water, like silver flowing from one place to another.
And then the pain in that area increased and settled into the muscle, it stayed here for about an hour.
And then moves on to the other side across which extends to the other arm.
And then I was told to observe it moving throughout her entire body as I saw, it was too astonishing for me regarding the exchange and speed between limb and limb. And I had already seen this before in my patients according to that manner, but I have seen movements where the pain is being exchanged from limb to limb. However, I did not see it like this in my patients as I did with the woman.
And I do not consider it to be like this simply because the woman was elderly, with dry skin and exposed veins, and in this case arose that sensation of circulating breeze.
And it is necessary that it does not appear in this manner for those who are delicate and have wet skin with swollen veins.
And if you want the cure of them, and the patient feels that pain, then it does not appear as visible in this way as we have said. So, strengthen there, slightly hold the patient down, make it a little wet at that point where there is that sensation of circulating breeze, and cauterize that area.
However, if you do not see it in your patients, then you heal that at the point of chest release and at what you are expelling breeze, make those pills stinky and those pills of sulfur and similar.
From the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are differentiated according to species and the locations within the body where they lodge. Their diversity lies in their varying sizes - large and small, concave and flat, soft or hard. Some have three angles, while others have tongues and points.
And of the symptoms related to the skull, when it's hit by the arrow and pierces the bones above the head, causing severe nausea, blindness, dizziness, abdominal pain in patients, swelling and inflammation on their tongues, spasms and confusion affecting one's understanding, vomiting due to diarrhea, a feeling of weakness spreading from the affected area accompanied by dehydration symptoms akin to bodily fluids.
And if you notice these symptoms, then refrain from the treatment and extraction of the arrow if it is not protruding.
The signs of the arrow when it hits the heart, if it's close to the left breastbone and feels like it's stuck in a hard place, not visible. The movement of the arrow resembles that of the wrist, and there is a dark infection at the wound site; it causes coldness at the extremities and chills, fainting. Therefore, know that death descends completely from head to toe.
The signs when the arrow has pierced the lung include a sense of gushing blood at the wound site, and vessels near the neck are swollen. The patient's complexion changes color, they start to gasp for large breaths, and they request air to be forced into their lungs.
And if the arrow hits the abdominal cavity within the legs, the pain is close to the small ribs, it causes a huge intense pain and sighing, and not all parts of the leg muscles are involved.
And if the arrow hits the stomach, then there is a sense of discomfort and indigestion at the wound site.
And if the arrow hits the belly and is stuck there, there's a sense of some wound opening at the site, or tissue, or hernia which has been disrupted; in such cases, there's no hope for treating the injury by extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow hits the bladder, and urine starts flowing out, causing discomfort to the patient; if it's expelled from the body in any way, know that this is fatal.
And for the other limbs such as the face, neck, shoulders and auxiliary muscles, the backbones of both sides, the ribs, breastbone, waist, thighs, and their corresponding parts in these limbs, are preserved according to the most vital positions when the arrow doesn't hit a vein or artery and isn't venomous.
And I will share with you what I have observed about these arrows, so that you may understand their significance in treatment.
This causes when in a man there is an arrow wound on the eyelid of his eye and extending into the base of his nose, if one removes that from him from the other side, leaves behind the ear wax of him, and then he heals, and does not get hurt again at his nose.
And when in a Jew there is another arrow wound that hits him on his nose within the ear wax, leave behind the eyelid and it, and the arrow was already hidden so it could not be found from that except for a small tip at which it adhered to its shaft; it was a large arrow among the arrows of the sharp Turks, made of iron without any ear wax.
And if it is about a Jew, and does not hurt at his nose in case of bad accident.
And when it comes to removing another Christian arrow that is stuck in the shoulder blade, and it is an Arab arrow, that is the one with ear wax; then I penetrate through this between two guide pins, and it was already submerged in the shoulder blade of him; then I sharpen this, and then extract this completely, and then the Christian heals.
And remove another arrow from a man that was stuck in his belly, and considered that it would cause death by this; then, since I passed thirty days without any change on him due to any reason, penetrate through the arrow and apply a needle over this, and he heals, and does not get hurt in case of bad accident afterwards.
And I saw a man in whom there is an arrow wound on his back, and the disease has solidified on him, and since it was about seven years, remove the arrow from the base of his foot.
And I saw a woman in whom there is an arrow wound in her belly, and the disease has solidified inside her, and it does not change with any of her natural operations, and the woman does not get hurt during any of her normal procedures.
And I saw another man to whom there is an arrow on his face, and the disease has solidified and removed the arrow, not causing any pain or similar symptoms here.
And remove the arrow from the king's prince's man who was stuck in the middle of his nose, and it had begun to descend on the right side slightly, and the whole arrow was hidden.
And I was called for his treatment around three days after being hit by the arrow.
And then I checked the wound of the arrow injury; and then I probed around the tip of the needle tentatively, but did not feel that; however, he felt it clearly on his right earlobe, and so I realized that that point was at the end of the arrow.
And I treated the area with stimulating and digestive ointment, confirming to me that this place should be rubbed where there is magnetic attraction, so that it appears to me the place of the arrow, so that it works on that.
And it does not happen in significant accidents that you have hit the arrow at this place; I continue to apply the ointment on him for many days and no accident happens; while the disease consolidates, and then removes the pain from his face for several days until I feel the arrow inside his nose again and report this to me.
And then I place a quick-corrosive medicine on the wound for several days until it boils open, and with this probe, I examined that, and felt the tip of the arrow, which adheres to the shaft.
And then I adjusted the opening of the wound with that quick medicine until it visibly appeared to me the tip of the arrow, and passed this time over that period of four months.
And when the wound expanded, and became possible for me to insert the scissors into him, I shortened it, and did not give in to impatience, then I no longer continued to sharpen and apply on that with various tools over time until one day about this began using forceps hanging methods according to what comes out of their shape at the end of the head, when I removed this; and then restored this wound.
And some doctors thought that the cartilage of the nose could not be restored, and I restored this and the wound consolidated. The face healed completely, and there is no pain in him for any reason.
And I advise you on the quality of removing some arrows for which you should consider this rule and significance about what I have not mentioned, that are understood neither in writing nor can they be comprehended freely.
And the artisans wisely compare on few matters; and about what is presented compared to what is absent; and finds a new operation and a new tool should be used when you are dealing with foreign causes of the art when they occur.
And therefore, I say that arrows are not thrown outside the parts where they are located but according to two ways: or by penetration into the place where they enter; or by contrary of the other side.
And that which is thrown from the place goes in, or if it is an arrow coming from a meaty place, it is shot and thrown outside.
And if you do not listen to the sense of when you catch it, then cover that until a few days where the meat around him should settle down, and relieve the penetration and his exit.
And similarly if it's found in the abdomen and doesn't respond to your decisions, then let it rest for a few days and repeat this process with attention and movement every day, and soon it will be expelled.
And if it doesn't respond to your decisions for a few days, then consider that you are piercing in the circuit of the arrow in that part of the body from all directions through a subtle area where the place is expanded by the arrow, and then extract it.
And if the arrow is already hidden in the body's location, and hidden from feeling, then you inquire about it with temptation, and if you feel it, then pull it with such strokes that are convenient for its extraction.
And if you cannot over it due to the constriction of the wound and the length of the stick, and here there are no bones or nerves or veins, then pierce into the wound where it is expanded and it's possible to extract the arrow.
And if it's in the fatty tissues where it's stuck from all directions throughout your reach; and work on this, if you cannot remove the flesh in the fracture of the fats or when twisting them as desired.
And when you administer the extraction of the arrow in any location where it is, then you use twisting of your hand with forceps from all directions where it makes that obey; and delicately with subtle subtlety so that the arrow isn't broken and is done in a way that makes its removal and the extraction difficult for you.
And if you cannot do that in your own time, then let it rest for a few days within which the parts that are in the circuit of it will subside, and then repeat this when it's relieved. And if it causes you opposition in the flow of blood, then administer that which we have said about treatment in its chapter.
And preserve your virtue from the beginning of vein or nerve or cord, and apply skill in every possible way to remove the arrow; do this with ease, calmness, slowness, and strength as I have advised you.
And therefore make the arrow bend according to its own way that the patient's head follows the figure according to which you should place the position of the arrow in them, which is more beneficial. And if this isn't within your capability, then administer what is within your capacity according to the figures.
And for arrows that are expelled in the opposite direction of their normal course, or which have already proceeded into some parts from the outside ones, or if there is an inclination towards the extremity of the arrow due to the sensation of the part further than the knee joint, then you should act on that; and choose the section according to the quantity in which the forceps are taken; then pull it, as it's done with deliberation.
And if it is stuck in the bone, then you twist the hand according to opposition within which the arrow starts penetrating into the bone, and expand yourself, and then pull out that one.
And if not, let it rest for a few days, and then repeat this inside where it burns.
And if the stem of the arrow is in that one, then you push it towards them.
And if the stem is broken and you want to administer thrusting, then you insert it into that one, if it's deaf, strike a concave shape so that it enters the cavity of them into the tail of the arrow, and then push that towards them.
And if the arrow is concave, then you push it with strong thrusting entering that one, where the arrow is relieved by that.
And if the arrow is contaminated, then consider that you hollow out all the flesh in which the wound is present, if this is within your capability, and then care for it as what is convenient.
And if the arrow penetrates into the legs, or into the belly, or in the bladder, or on the side, and is near enough that you can touch it with temptation, then touch it when possible. Then touch it, preserve yourself from touching veins or nerves, extract that one, and then smooth over the wound if needed, care for it so that it gets healed.
Shape of forceps with which arrows are pulled:
Let the ends of them be like a duck's bill, which are made like a saw when they grip the arrow so that they don't let it go.
And among those are formed special spots, large, few and mixed, depending on the quantity of the arrow's size and its relative weakness, as well as the extent of the wound, and the constriction around it.
Thus like a ray for one to ease the passage within him in the concave arrow and it is propelled towards that.
From phlebotomy of the veins.
The veins for phlebotomy which usually one is accustomed to perform at .xxx,. of which it is in the chapter XVI, those are the two pulsating veins which are near the ears, they're called alhasisain; two herbs that appear in both temples; and two veins that are visible under the eyes; and two guideveins at the neck; and two veins that are above the lips; and two veins that are below the lips; and - these are the veins called algelic; and those are two veins that drain the tongue. The veins that are phlebotomized in the elbows are .v., Among those is one cephalic, which is under the wild heart; and the people call it "the head vein", and silently, and it's a mixed vein, made of a branch of basilica, and another branch of cephalic; and they name that the people "vein of the whole body", and basilica is the vein that's placed in the domestic heart, and named "flashing", and call that the vulgar ones "vein of the belly"; and the artery of the arm, it's placed over the wrist, and that's where phlebotomy is performed, and that one appears above the elbow through manifest appearance; and the save all, it's the vein between what was mentioned auricular and the small pus named, and are in both ramps.
And in the chest and under the arm there are three veins; one of those is that leaves the curve of the base of the wild heart. And the second is sophena, its location is under the bend of the domestic heart's elbow; and sciatic vein, its place is under the bend of the wild heart's elbow; and in the arm pit they have other veins similar to those.
The youth of the veins that are near the ears is cataris old, and emigranea and sahafati and ulceracious of old bad head.
And the quality of this is according to what I recommend to you: it's that there be a redness on the head of the patient, and to rub the head of the patient at the back of the neck in the place between both veins with ample cloth for good friction; then strengthen the patient's neck by having them bend their head within which two appear close to the ears at two prehistoric spots on the head; and touch that one with your hand, and if you feel the pulse of those ones with your hand here test.
Approach you take the surgical lance, and that is the one that slants downward, approach you insert those veins into the main artery where phlebotomy leads to the heart. And approach you lift your hand at the vein and main artery to the upper parts, then cut the vein starting from where it slants downward. And make the length of the cut equal to that of two fingers or slightly more than that; and drain out the blood as much as you want.
And afterwards strengthen with powders, leave that until it is healed.
And already in the introduction of this book, we have described the incision and their cauterization.
The youth of those two arteries which are at the temples, for phlebotomy, is ancient emigranea, malicious and frequent, ophthalmia, and nose bleeding due to excesses.
And the quality of phlebotomizing those is according to what I recommend to you: strengthen the patient's neck by having them bend their head within which two veins appear through manifest appearance, and show your hand on the pulse of each one at that spot; and then you test it.
And approach you raise the main artery above the vein to the spots on your indicated hand, and insert the phlebotomy slanting downward there, and lift the vein in its place; then cut that like you did with those other veins; and let the blood flow according to the quantity of your need.
And approach you relieve the constriction of the neck, place your hand on the vein for an hour, and then place that part in a powdery way with strength, strengthen it above with firmness, and leave that until it is healed.
And already described have been their memories, and the incision of those, and the extraction in the beginning of this book.
And therefore the youth of phlebotomy of the frontal vein is close to the phlebotomy of the cephalic artery in relation to the old face ailments, emigranea, fever and malodorous ulcers.
And the quality of phlebotomy for this is according to what I recommend to you: it's that the neck be strengthened by having them bend their head in such a way that the vein appears; and then take the tool which is called the fossor, whose form is as follows:
Place the point of your instrument at the prominent part which is at the head of the wound over that vein, strike it on that area either straight or with some angle in your hand's position, and let the bleeding flow as much as you desire; then release the perforation under the patient's thigh and strengthen that area for healing.
And sometimes, the operation is performed at the site of blood withdrawal on the leg, but it's not that a common method like other blood withdrawals, which are made at the outer extremity similar to all others, before being positioned towards the inner extremity. The blood withdrawal there goes across, where the bone is close and makes the withdrawal easy when the tool is sharp enough.
Let the young of the two veins that are in the tear ducts of both eyes by way of discharge through the eye due to snot and acne on the face, and for the cheeks.
And the quality of blood withdrawal is that the thigh strengthens its fold under one bend, and then withdraws blood from those areas, and you stand above the head of the patient.
And when blood withdrawal is performed across from the longitudinal direction for a few with a few needles in the location where there's not meat; and if the needle is sharp, its tip breaks.
And let the bleeding flow as much as is necessary for you, press on those areas, strengthen them with one night, and release those afterwards.
Let the blood withdrawal from the vein of the nose be related to acute fever and intense heat, as well as for the thighs on the face and migraine that occur on the face, especially when it's old.
And the quality of blood withdrawal is that the thigh strengthens its fold and then places it on your left hand, takes the needle which is long and fine, puts that in the middle location of the nose according to right direction, where the vein does not appear here and when bleeding starts to flow immediately.
Make sure to finish your hand at the small needle gradually and let the blood flow according to your needs; and release that for one night, because that is quickly restored.
Let the young of blood withdrawal affect both limbs and start the leprosy, as well as for the bad leg ulcers and corrosive diseases like scabies.
And the quality of blood withdrawal from those is that the thigh strengthens each one in its fold with tension; and let the surgeons be on top of the thigh, and the thigh should be resting on a seat.
And let blood withdrawal take place along the long vein with ample needles gradually; and release the bleeding according to temperature quantity or according to what necessity you desire; and let it seem like the other vein.
And then release the tension and strengthen both veins with a mild compression so that the thigh doesn't get infected, and leave it until the morning when the illness is healed.
Let the young of blood withdrawal from veins in the alveolar region correspond to small abscesses and pustules on the mouth, gum deterioration, bad ulcers, and cracks, as well as bad ulcers that occur in the nose and around your face.
And the quality of blood withdrawal from those is that you sharpen your thigh in front of you and strengthen its fold with one bend, then rotate each of the lips and look at both veins; the first being on the right side of the lip and the second on the left side. The demonstration for each is by the darkness of each on both sides, especially when they are located within the circuit of those small black veins; so you cut each one with an incision that goes inwards.
If you have any doubt and don't know which one of them is, then you understand through the incision of the largest among those, and the evident pus from those.
And let it resemble the two veins that are in the lips above.
The two veins that are located at the back of your tongue correspondingly prepare for blood withdrawal from the cephalic region before those in the glandular area, to the tonsil's throat and oral ulcers.
And the quality of withdrawing blood from those is to follow your thigh between your two most forward on top of the knee, elevate the tongue for it, look at the tongue itself, examining both sides of each vein, and the color of either changes into darkness.
And then withdraw blood from each one; and be aware that you should not finish your hand on withdrawing blood from these ones, because they are arteries.
Your veins that are withdrawn blood from the side are in those where pain is common in all men, and blood withdrawal from them is performed according to two ways, either place it with a pincers or an olive-shaped tool with gradually declining sharpness; or stop with a surgical knife and call this scalpel technique. This is its form:
Let it resemble the parts of your body just as you've seen, and aligns to open up the concave veins that are full with visible thick contents, and towards those which contain large pus-filled clots.
This type of puncture is narrower in width and has a finer tip, suitable for the puncture of subtle veins that contain delicate blood.
Let the youth of the puncture for the basilic vein, which is one of three veins: extract the blood from the patient's malaise that causes pain in their groin and stomach area, as well as from this which affects their feet.
And it should be done by the one who performs punctures of this kind; they must protect and support this part, with caution in this area. For if there is an artery near this place, and if you err or adjust during the puncture, that artery will bleed along with any blood flow, so it's necessary not to puncture too deeply when using a sharp tool for these kinds of punctures; first ensure proper technique by following the instructions provided beforehand.
And if you can't see the basilic vein due to lack of obvious appearance, then make sure not to puncture this area and instead try another method, or look for any nearby veins; or perform a puncture at the end of the arm where the vein is clearly visible; use your puncturing tool with the same care as we have instructed.
If you wish to perform an arm puncture, then proceed in front of the elbow bend where you can identify the location of the pulse, and gently press on it with your hand; and guide the arm while pressing down; and guide the arm while pressing down. Locate the vein at the concave section during the puncture using your tool as we have instructed; remember to avoid percussion over a space near the artery area.
And when you press with strength on the muscle, there is an inflation in the area you pressed under your hand; then that inflation is due to the artery, and so avoid that area.
And if the blood flows like water in this puncture area, then it is fine with subtle blood; here you understand that it's part of the artery's blood flow; and here you guide your hand over a long distance; and place your hand as instructed, and if the blood stops flowing, wherever the bleeding has stopped, then you strengthen your arm and leave that spot.
And care for the patient's thigh wound, with caution of their health and don't let it get infected within several days until they recover.
And if the blood doesn't stop flowing, when you should not provide medicine under this situation; then you will have pierced the artery, if it's visible to you; where its end is tightened up and bleeding stops; or use a previous type of forceful method, make that action, take one strength and press that spot on the vein at the elbow bend among muscles between the other day.
And if the bleeding stops then it's good; and otherwise, then treat that with this as described in our previous instructions about how to manage the powders that can stop blood flow.
And the stopping of blood from them is difficult in small locations for the wound area and the space available for muscles in the arm.
The puncture for the dark vein, the youth of which involves extracting blood from the upper part of the head and towards the back area of the body; thus since it consists of branches from the basilic vein and cephalic veins, as we have said.
And when the one performing the puncture observes this over-caution in the blood extraction area of the patient, where there is a nerve; then if they adjust during the puncture and find that nerve, it will cause them to lose consciousness, making recovery difficult, and if not treated completely, this nerve can affect feelings at certain points. And for those who hide this nerve or make it subtle and do not expose it, you should perform the puncture near your strong position and avoid the nerve with your strength.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you will find the vein along its length.
The youth of puncturing the cephalic vein involves extracting blood from the head and guiding it to alleviate chest pains.
And be careful about this, if you want that punctures use an olive puncture tool or a myrtle puncture tool; which is the saved liquid from all veins, not leaving your artery or nerve.
So you should strongly restrain yourself in some people when it's not punctured during the first percussion, but don't disturb that lump later.
The first thing to consider is understanding that blood puncture should only be performed for the maintenance of health and with hope for recovery and caution against potential complications; and blood punctures can be made on one of the veins found in the axilla, which are: cephalic, dark, and basilic; and it's appropriate to perform a blood puncture at the beginning of spring, after fasting in early spring and autumn, and during winter close to meals when there are significant signs of replenishment.
And after performing a bloodletting, let them rest until three hours have passed since they began experiencing morning mucus.
Bloodletting should be done when it is convenient and necessary, either in the morning or at night, at any time and under all circumstances.
And let there be no bloodletting in a child under fourteen years old, nor should a woman who is pregnant undergo bloodletting until the fourth month into the seventh month, and let the elderly not undergo bloodletting if they have already passed sixty years.
And when someone wishes to be bled by any means, let them change their bowels before bloodletting with a lion's purge; if they have a retained wound in those areas, so that the veins do not draw the excesses during bloodletting of the bowels which are cleansed and should not burden the main limbs.
And let no patients undergo bloodletting during the night or from illness, nor inebriety, nor pain of labor, nor vomiting, and near a colic attack or nausea, or any cause that dissolves their virtue, whether bodily or spiritual.
And consider in detail the humors before that if the disease is large, with food and drinks, and with medicines if it's possible for you.
And between in baths if any cause does not prohibit it, or exercise through some physical activity so that the disease is attenuated.
And let bloodletting for them take place on their chest in the morning, around the third hour of the day, as we have said.
And observe that the chest of each should be watched on every day of all animal mishaps, such as distress, anger, fear, and all bodily accidents, such as work and excess worries and sex and things like them.
And when they wish, let them be given the causes in the use of which there is custom among men for fragrance and odors, and for balms and similar things according to their quantity's possibility.
And let the bloodletter proceed on a cushion that is larger than the pillow which should be bled.
And extend their arm, and rub that with their hand the bloodletting implement for two or three rounds; and strengthen their muscles with cords and envelop that with two rounds.
And for the correction period, if the constriction is not equal, or if the constriction is due to excess, then prohibit the discharge of the disease; or if it's about alleviation, then prohibit the body from removing the disease.
And during the correction period, let the one who is to be bled rub their hands among them while their veins are swollen, and make them feel this sensation.
And during bloodletting, let the bloodletter apply a little ancient oil on the bloodletting instrument. And then place his hand of the left on that vein for a moment; determine where you want the bloodletting to take place so that the vein begins to leak slightly and the pulsation is stopped like when your heart beats and forces the blood to flow, it's as if you're trying to avoid letting blood from there, because it's full of air. And when the bloodletter stops on that spot, it should be compressed; and the bloodletting instrument does not pierce the vein, but if it does, that one is stretched out.
And therefore, let the bloodletting instrument be stopped and diligently consider all these causes.
And then stop the bloodletting instrument again; however, if a vein is punctured in one round, let it be; otherwise, do this again with another round and leave that spot slightly to yourself, or over them if the spot is not moved.
And if the spot is moved or the patient recovers, then you leave it for a day or two, and do not strengthen your muscles, lest you pull out an abscess with too much force, nor enter into baths.
And continue the bloodletting if she desires it.
And if her pulse is slight and there's subtle disease, and you fear it won't remove enough disease, then continue the bloodletting at that place according to rectitude and adjust the amount in the pulse slightly. Do this with haste before the spot is moved; for men of one month, you should take a little more pulse.
And if you see that it has already moved, then don't continue over them, for there's no excuse for any cause; pause above them with some part of the olive oil cuticle, which delights the body with disease. And it is better in this place than oil and other oils.
Similarly, apply olive oil cuts in every bloodletting when you bleed the veins; do this tyroica alfadoc and sagzenea when it is paused on that spot, because the disease becomes subtle when it's large and mixed.
And if in the location of bloodletting a large abscess is created, which affects several rounds, especially that which hasn't been bled at all until that round or on the pulse, or if it's on the vein and there's a slight move, then you cover it, pause over that spot with an infused sponge in water and salt, one that has been scratched, and strengthen that for one hour when it is dissolved.
And guide them to do this close to the bend of the arm at the height of their pulse or another vein.
And if there is any darkness or greenness at the spot for a few days, do not notice this; and if you wish, place over that something of aloes and myrrh dissolved, or some substance from mint juice or wormwood or similar.
Blisters and pustules occurring indicate abscesses and prominences; you should perform a bloodletting from the basilic vein.
And place your hand over that, and if you then find softness, apply compression there, that area is evil and bad; and hence be careful to place your hand over that something like what we said, so that a strong flow will come from the arm's artery.
And apply plaster to that where the inflammation is situated, so that the area is endured, and then attend to that with other treatments until it is healed.
And guide you to extract from the arm according to each man's quantity based on its virtue, and according to the color over the arm as it appears.
For if the arm is black, then you let it bleed into a basin until it becomes red. Similarly, if it turns thick, then you let it bleed into a thinner substance; and similarly, if it's sharp, then you allow the sharpness to be relieved within that substance.
And guide the one who is full and strong, needing bleeding in a single occasion, that you should greatly enlarge the bloodletting from the vein, and let the bleeding be deep.
And for the one who is weak, do the opposite of that. Guide you to bleed him in multiple sessions, and that he be restrained.
And the best thing for bloodletting from a vein is a cross-section, not penetration.
And this method of bloodletting saves from the flow of the arm and the cutting of nerves, it is commendable and more safe than bloodletting according to width and length.
And regarding this kind where sudden fainting occurs, you should perform bloodletting, and guide that you treat him before bloodletting with a little of powder in wine of meadowsweet or simple honeyed water; and draw out the arm's blood in three sessions or four.
And if it is caused by the heat of the complex, then before bloodletting take an infusion in a mixture of myrrh or in aromatic honey, with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger and similar, or in an aromatic and strongly scented syrup.
And if it is followed by fainting, you should perform bloodletting, and if it's caused by the movement of his arm, then guide him to drink water from meat and a strongly scented syrup; use aromaticity in vinegar, and limit his feet towards that.
And use the other causes we have mentioned in the division for fainting due to evacuation.
And whoever wants to exercise his arm and dissolve his flow in another session, guide that bloodletting is for evacuation purposes, and the virtue of which is cool, causing it to dissolve little by little, does so according to the amount of its virtue over consecutive days.
May who wants to exercise his arm and draw out his flow in another session, and whose body is strong, then do this close to seven hours or nine from the first bloodletting.
May who wants to draw out the body's flow in opposition to its usual direction of flow, guide that it should be exercised on the second day or on the third.
May this body in which there is already an acute flow that causes fever, guide that you should expel the arm's flow in one session and let it be a large quantity from your arm; and ensure that you have all the conditions for bloodletting within that area until you cause fainting; and place your hand on his wrist to prevent death instead of fainting. This many sessions must be like this when the bloodletter is ignorant and negligent.
And do not guide when you want to move the arm and evacuate the flow in another session, as soon as you close the openings of the vein and make it difficult for the flow to exit, then press below that forcefully and slightly curve your extended arm; this is too bad.
Let it bleed again; or leave this with the sharpness of bloodletting that is coagulated from the flow in the opening of the vein; or place your hand on that with thyme, or sage, and press that with light compression until the flow is out.
And if the vein is infected, then let that alone and do not touch it until the abscess has healed.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate the flow again, and it's not an excuse, then prick him in that spot or on another arm at another vein.
The vein referred to as "arm cord" is bloodletted in the place of the dark or basilic veins, when they are not swollen or hidden, which consists of those.
The quality of bloodletting for him is that the patient's hand should dip into hot water until it easily reddens and makes the vein appear distinctly.
And further strengthen over that with a ligature around the middle; and further perform bloodletting according to the cross small, not laterally nor longitudinally.
And make the incision broad and do your bloodletting at the point where you take out blood from that above the elbow joint a little.
And if the flow of urine is forbidden, then you will move your hand in warm water and let the urine run in the water until you achieve your need.
If you were in the days of summer, then you are excused from moving your hand in warm water, and similarly during winter, let the body cool in warm water.
And bloodletting from this vein is safer than from all others, because it doesn't have any pulsating vein or nerve when you let the patient lie down.
And bloodletting from the wrist artery is related to the maladies of the arm.
And the quality of bloodletting for him is that you strengthen your hand or with your own hand, because you place him in warm water, while the vein becomes swollen and is clearly shown through the skin; then do bloodletting across; and if you incise all over there it won't bleed back.
And remember not to finish your hand at the bloodletting point because when you remove his fingers from the flesh there are nerves of the digits exposed.
And move your hand in warm water and let the urine flow through it. If you do not move this part in warm water, the urine will clot in the opening of the vein, which is forbidden for urine to pass.
And when extracting the blood according to the amount needed, then you press on the vein oil and salt so that it is not compactly congealed; similarly do this for all the branches straight.
The youth of bloodletting from that on the left wrist is related to the ailments of the leg.
Do something similar for this bloodletting as you did with the other one.
And the youth of the saphena vein in bloodletting is to ailments that are in the lower parts of your body, such as stomach and abdominal issues, and retention of menstruation, and ailments related to impotence and ulcerations of thighs and old chest problems, and they resemble other ailments.
And the quality of bloodletting for him is that his body immerses his arm in warm water and does it over that friction where veins appear; he lies on the elbow joint with the arm straightened. The spot of the apparent vein you should place your hand, and from there its branches to the surface of the arm spread out.
And then do bloodletting on the larger branch or place his elbow where you should add to him, which is better and with more salt.
And if you do bloodletting on the surface of the arm, then you avoid the nerves that are located near the surface of the arm, and pause your bloodletting at which point you take out blood in a crosswise manner, as if you were trying to incise it.
And if possible, do bloodletting.
If urine discharge is forbidden, then move his leg on warm water and let the urine flow through it until it's completely emptied.
And if the bloodletting instrument fails in the first attempt, then try again with another bloodletting tool, which is salted; and don't be afraid of his complaints, rather than protecting yourself from the nerves as we have said.
Similarly do it for the saphena vein on the other arm in the same manner.
And concerning the sciatic vein, as we have said, you should place your hand near his buttocks.
The purpose of bloodletting for him is the thigh pain when it's due to urine stones.
And the quality of bloodletting for him is that his body enters into bathing and quickly strengthens his thigh from the back of his ankle under one long, thin bend above four fingers, which does not appear otherwise.
And when it appears, then you do bloodletting on that according to each method which is possible and according to the crosswise manner, which is better; or you incise it with a cut or make it bleed by squeezing, where his place is salted.
And it's in thick and meager men; and if you find this vein, but don't feel it throughout, then do bloodletting on some branch of this, which appears behind the earlobe and the ring finger.
And watch out for the nerves, let the amount of urine that you want flow.
And then relieve the constriction and pause at the bloodletting point with strength on that spot, which will be somewhat healed.
Regarding suction and the qualities to use those.
Suctions are made with horns, or reeds, or leather.
Suction can be performed in two ways: one method is through incision and blood extraction, and the other is suction without making an incision.
This type of suction that involves incision occurs in two ways, either with fire or without the use of fire.
And for those suction practices that involve incision and blood extraction, there are fourteen body locations. The first location where suction is applied is the alnocrati, which is the final part of the head; the middle location is in the middle of both parts of the collarbone; suction near the chin leaves the mandible behind, and further from the mouth; suction on two spatulas; suction on alohoster, which is at the tip of the penis; suction on two fire tools, and these are located about one span apart; suction on two cavils; and suction on two thighs.
Ventilation does not remove the pain from small, scattered veins in the flesh, and thus it does not have an effect through those vessels; similarly to puncturing for bloodletting. Nor should ventilation be performed with fire or searing heat on any malady caused by overfullness inside where the body is entirely evacuated.
If necessity causes ventilation due to illness or continuous pain, administer that during the entire month and at its end, in the middle of it and at any other time.
And therefore when times come in any cause of those, especially if it is near the end or middle of the month, then it is commanded that ventilation be performed immediately rather than wait until after the day or three hours.
The purpose of neck ventilation is that when it affects gravity in the head and to that which is settled in the breaths; more importantly, consider it as an evacuation of all throughout the body.
This ventilation is for the location of bloodletting on the head.
And it is not prescribed to use that which leads to overfullness or in those who are phlegmatic, as it gives rise to significant harm.
And thus it is not appropriate to use that with the old ones, and among those who have illnesses on their heads.
You should order the one who continues above that to make them forgetful; thus it is advisable for you to command the person performing ventilation to place their hand slightly beneath the suction device at the points applied, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Alcohol ventilation is for the location of bloodletting on the dark vein and basilica: thus it causes asthma, constriction in it, and the splitting of its bile duct; and also coughing and overfullness.
And it is advisable for the alcohol suction device to be placed slightly, because if it is left in that position, it causes weakness throughout the body and in the stomach.
Alhamdulillah ventilation causes head pain and eye disease, as well as migraine, fever, and pain in the cheeks of teeth; it is for bloodletting on the basilica location.
And it should be commanded to the person performing ventilation not to press their hand against a scarification, so as not to puncture an artery and cause bleeding.
And ventilation near the mouth is associated with alcohol in the mouth, and decay of gum tissue, as well as symptoms like those from illnesses found within the mouth, and are located on bloodletting sites on aliheric, which is situated between both lips.
The ventilation that is performed on the two spoons causes heatstroke, which occurs due to overfullness of heat quality.
And the ventilation of the two divisions inside the nostrils causes young people to undergo bloodletting from three veins, which are basilica, dark, and head veins. This draws out pain from all those small veins that exist in the flesh, as well as from the small veins within larger veins where the flow reaches the three veins.
And command the one performing ventilation not to proceed in scarification, where the place is stripped of flesh, and leave them with their nerves and arteries.
And there is one kind of suction on which hemorrhoids on the anus and ulcers are caused from those left behind.
And it should be commanded to the person performing suction that there should be a large suction, and one made of copper where the place requires strong drying; with the person experiencing the subtle pulling from the suction devices being treated with scarification.
The suction of the small joints through obvious diminution draws out pain from throughout the body and relieves ancient discomforts in the kidneys and uterus, as well as the bladder; they also induce menstruation and cause coughing and other symptoms. These are located at the bloodletting points for two syphylis sites, hanging amputation, and two cavities.
However, they weaken all throughout the body and cause dizziness to occur in men during movement.
And when it comes to hanging amputation ventilation, young people prefer it as much as the ventilation of two joints.
And the quality of the position of the suction devices is that you pause the suction at first view and continue with quick heat, and do not prolong the position of the suction devices, but rather pause them slightly, and reapply them gradually, ensuring that the fluids arrive at the place evenly. And do not stop repeating this until you see the area already turn red and swell, and that the suffering becomes apparent.
And then you perform scarification and continue with heat gradually, always considering the disposition of the bodies.
When that person who has thin, fragile skin is injured, it's advised to only do so once and not press too hard, in order to prevent the wound from becoming inflamed.
And command the scraper to increase the scraping and do it gently, always suctioning easily.
And if there is thickening in the wound, then it's recommended to perform two scrapings: in the first, you open the path for lymph drainage and for bodily fluids. In the second, focus on examining the acquired body fluid from the removal of the thick wound material.
And if the wound is filled with mucus, then it's necessary to perform a third scraping for it to reach the end.
And gradually, when we want to extract some mucus little by little or even just a small amount, enough for one scraping is sufficient.
And if we want to remove mucus, we scrape with a thick scraping; and if we know that the mucus is thick, then it's necessary to perform a wave-like scraping.
And the term of scraping until it reaches the depth of the wound only.
And for those whose wounds are thick, hard, dark, and whose veins are tight, it's recommended that the suction cup locations be treated gently, more widely, forcefully; during summer, such as with aloes oil or violet oil, or lemon oil, or camomile oil, or mustard oil; and during winter, similarly to onion oil, or linden oil, or chamomile oil, or saffron oil, and similar products.
And if the excess is thick, rough, then the oil should be saffron, or balsam oil, or aloes oil, or thyme oil, and similar products.
And if the scraper is made of thin flesh, then it's advised not to use oil, and that near the suction areas for the suction cup, they should be washed with water or saffron-infused water, or water from lemons, or water from bitter oranges, and similar products next to those.
And for that which has mucus in the wound, wash their suction cups with vinegar or water mixed with myrtle and sumac, and similar products next to those.
And for those whose excesses are thick, wash their suction cups with vinegar old, or with water of sanguinaria, which is marjoram, or from decoction of thyme, or chamomile, and similar products next to those.
And it's recommended that the suction be kept in front of bathing; you should also have it administered close to the bath for an hour or two, and make sure to sleep near the suction.
What is necessary is that the blood-sucking tool be regulated before the application of suction.
And when considering the meal: if the suction tool or the one who performs bloodletting is irritable and has a hot temperament over acute wounds and inflammation, then it's advised that they take cooling remedies, such as vinegar lettuce and milk, and spinach, and apple cider vinegar, and julep, and similar products.
And let their meals include such as poultry, cooked rabbit, and seasoned vegetables, and similar products.
And for those whose complexion is rough, it's recommended that they drink essences of almond oil or essence of apple cider vinegar mixed with sumac, and vinegar with a mild odor between old and new; and it should be advised to them to consume small quantities of water and food, and have pauses in their meals consisting of poultry, rabbit, fish, little hares, and doves.
And it's recommended that the amount of water consumed on the day of suction and bloodletting should be greater than food intake.
And it's recommended to give in drinking before some hours for people with tyroliac alfaarac or medicines of muscle, such as mustard, or garlic near suction or near bloodletting or nearby, so that the main members are comforted and that inflammation is reduced; do not recommend taking that hot remedy.
Use suction cups that are the result of scraping on the heel, over the knee and gout, on the navel, under the testicles, and on the waistband, as these limbs do not suffer from scraping internally.
Do not apply suction to those areas but for the elimination of mucus in the limbs, such as using a suction cup on the breast during mastopathy due to the flow of mucus in the breast; and use that remedy so that the thick, sticky wind is dissipated from the body parts, such as applying it to the abdomen and navel area; where that invigorates the limb, cools the body, and dispels the pain associated with wind.
And when it's applied to the armpits during their eruption or boil, through the force of suction, it helps to relieve sweating and removes the boil from its location.
Similarly, when it's applied on the thighs and hips to expel wind in those confined areas.
And these suction cups are administered with just juice alone, whereas some are given with heat.
And sometimes they're administered full of red water in chest pains affecting the hips.
And that's why the suction cup is filled with a large amount of pus, so it's just water or water in which herbs suitable for that are steeped.
Shape of the suction performed at the fire: make the size of the opening two fingers wide, according to how we have formed it; and the amount of smoke be the length of a palm; and it should be in the left side of him, in the place that is inside the circuit, the length of his, let the intake be small according to the quantity that enters him with one needle.
The procedure for an egg or citrus wound, with large margins, lion-like and smooth cuts, all must be done in such a way that doesn't lead the member to its usual position on him.
And it is at the top of the crosswise line of the egg or iron, where the candle is placed under the fire.
And now this large suction is like the one we described previously; and the small fluid of that, according to the patient's condition and state of health who uses that.
And the suction cups for children and weak are different from those for adults and large areas.
And the quality of placing this suction cup on a member is to spread the iron over fire wood facing a small candle wax, and place that above the middle of the cross line at the middle location of the suction, so that the fire be lit around that area to prevent burning the patient's body.
And it should be placed on the patient's member, and it is about the tip that we have said, when we have the suction cups and do not need the tip and the steam burns that part of the tip, then the suction will soon dissolve.
And according to its usual manner, heat the iron, and repeat that if needed with another.
For the suction that is administered in pleurisy, with water, in which there is no cross line or tip, and it is not administered except when filled with water, and it is placed only on the member.
And this is its form: And this suction cup; the larger it is, the better it is, for it can receive large quantities of water.
Title 97.
Sanguissugas are not administered in the joints of muscles, but only on those parts where it's impossible to place suction cups due to their small size, like the eye, gums and similar areas; or on flesh-free members, like the nose and areas resembling it.
And the quality of using those that you have found as blood-sucking cups that are in the boiled water's foam.
And they should be left soaking in boiled water for the day and night, without causing any disturbance in their stomachs; and have them evacuated with bloodletting and suction cups; and gently rub the patient's member until they turn red; and then place it on them.
And when they are filled, and if there is a case.
And if it's possible to use the area with suction cups, it's better in youth.
And if not, then wash the area with fresh water and apply moistened mud; and rinse it and press it.
And if the patient's body is prolonged to the site of the blood-sucking cups, and it is this residualness, then you immerse a cloth in cool water, and place that above so as to absorb the residue.
And if the illness is multiplied, then apply on it vitriol trisatted or similar substances for coagulation causes, until the blood is congealed; or they are placed on the area the ashes of toasted beans, and left so that the beans adhere to the area, and when the blood is congealed.
And if needed, repeat the use of blood-sucking cups, whenever it's possible to change those.
And if blood-sucking cups are prohibited from suspension, then rub the area with recent blood or leave a needle in those areas where it causes blood to flow; and they should be placed, so that when you feel some blood, they immediately adhere.
And when you want them to come down, apply a little of trisatted aloes or salt, or ashes on those and cauterize immediately.
Thus begins the treatment for the next part: restoration. This chapter discusses necessary tools in the art of medicine; and it's about restoring fractures and accidental displacements in bones.
Oh child, know that many doctors and laypeople, as well as those who will not study the works of the ancients nor read even a single letter from them, consider this chapter to be trivial.
And for this reason, this method of the scientists on earth is private; I won't forget that even in times when we had access to all their works; and I haven't included what I've learned, but only after spending time reading the works of the ancients and studying their understanding, extracting the science from them.
And direct yourself to experimentation and study throughout your life.
And I have described in this chapter all of my science and what was passed through experimentation; therefore, condense this to you others and release it from the occupation of elongation; and shorten this at the end of shortening; then demonstrate this at the end of declaration; and formulate this into various forms of storms that are administered there, as done through declaration, similarly as I have done in two preceding chapters.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
A summary and collections from the fractures of bones, from which it is necessary to have a prelude before we begin recalling the parts of fractures and various things for each one. Therefore, when speaking about the introduction of this chapter, let us state the summaries of what is said; and for each capital, when the understanding of those starts with the beginning, it is where the artisans are to test their truth. It is you and those who are eager to know or learn this noble art as well as others from you.
Therefore, when an accident occurs with a fracture or dislocation or twist or compression, then you should start at the beginning with bloodletting or apply that (a cure), or any other time, if there is no prohibition from any cause, such as vertigo, or if it happens to someone who is weak, or old in age, or during violent heat, or during violent fever.
Then be content with food made of herbs such as rue and meat of rabbits and crabs; and prohibit heavy meats and fill instead with foods and any kind of food that fills the veins of the hand, within which you can ensure against a boil. And if you do not fear leakage of matter in the limb, then so it is.
And then return the patient to their primary state wherein they usually are.
And when the broken bone begins to be restored, let the patient be nourished with nutritious foods of solid and dense kind, where their viscosity is prominent, such as bread cooked in water, eggs, soups, meats, belly parts of cows, oysters, fresh fish, thick and similar things to those, and under this regime coagulation of pus from the fracture happens slightly and honey.
And know that bones grow in those who are in the early youth and in those who are old, it is not possible for them to continue growing according to their nature through the drying out of their limbs.
However, nature adjusts and renews about the broken bones of every part with any cause similar to caking in which a bulk sticks and strengthens inside that where it hardens and becomes solid over time. Inside where is the end of strength and firmness, such as fire at the beginning, where for no cause you prohibit him from his works.
And for this reason it is necessary to abstain from foods of the patient, foods in which there is gravity and viscosity and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the species of fracture are various according to the diversity of the limbs, where a fracture of the bone of the chest is different from that of the skull's bone; and a fracture of the foot's bone is different from that of the leg's bone; and similarly, all other limbs are different among themselves.
And I conclude with a recollection of every species of fracture, detailed in its chapter distinct from the other.
A variety of fractures within oneself. And the species of bone fracture within oneself are varied; one is made in an arched manner another that occurs in the joints. And some are made according to the length of the bone: and these are fractures related to the neck, joints, and not-joints, such as when it's prepared for writing on paper, and it's a fracture through grinding and disruption in the head, and it's a small crack fracture.
And for every species, there is an appropriate or difficulty in restoration according to that which will come from the recollection of it distinct in its locations.
A sign of bone fracture. And for this reason, bone fracture is known: it has a curvature of the affected area, and the sensation of that prominence or attachment to one's hand when you press on it.
And when there is no obvious curvature in the area and it does not feel like you are pressing the bone with your touch when you press on the bone with force, then if the patient does not find great pain here, then there is no fracture.
It is possible that there may be curvature or a small crack, let it be known that you can feel it with your hand and the compression of all. Have patience about it with regard to the medicines for which recall comes at this moment what suits its place; and straighten it through subtle constriction.
And know that when the place is arched and does not split into two or another that does not happen in its joint, as it has been expanded throughout all parts of its comparison, then let you start from your time to correct it whenever there comes a boil with it.
And if there comes a boil with it, let you smooth that for a few days until the boil ceases; and then equalize that according to any method you can of lightness and skill.
And know that the restoration and alignment of it are less severe than in the bone where it occurs naturally.
And then strengthen it according to what will come from recalling it.
If in the bone there are joints, then it is necessary to extend this broken limb from two parts, whether it's the hand or the foot; or with your own hand if the limb is small; or with two strings or with one string and a hand.
And make sure your position allows you to place the limbs in their natural location equal according to their natural shape, while the parts are stretched out from the body's joints; then perform it so that you make those additions return to their original location, and according to any method you can apply in their positions.
And take care that your strength does not cause damage to the patient during your operation or injury, and perform it according to your ability that you apply one bone to another in their best forms as their companions.
And when in that moment usefully touch with your hand this one, and if you see any cause different here, correct this one and adjust this according to the amount of your virtue.
And avoid excessive extension and compression, even as some old doctors allow certain ulcers to form pus under their operations, or cause a contraction in the limbs like we have seen through their operations on their swollen ulcers.
And the quality of the tightness of the immobilized limb is this one that I recommend; so you know that broken limbs vary in their size and in their magnitude and in the form of those ones.
And for those that are small like the arm and so-called easy ones resembling those, ensure that the wrapping is made of a soft fabric.
And for those that are large like the thigh or belly, ensure that in those there is a bandage tight and hard, so that by connecting the hardness of the bandage with the large and strong limb from all sides to an equal tightness, thus avoiding any mark on it.
And begin to proceed, your operation of evacuation, place it conveniently with respect to this, over the spot of that fracture with three bandages or four according to which limb requires it; and strengthen your hand a little on the seam.
And proceed to take it towards that upper part of the spot of the fracture, and strengthen moderately so as not to force your tightness in which you have tightened the spot of the fracture. And proceed to lengthen the bandage at the spot of the fracture slightly, and gradually soften the tightness little by little, until you take hold of the spot for a large part.
And proceed to take another bandage and wrap that other swollen area over the immobilized spot with a bandage, and proceed to bring those bandages towards that upper part of the fracture; and your operation is in the tightness of the bandage and in softening it according to what we said about the first bandage above.
And proceed to pause between the bandages of the foot or cloth in which the curvature of the fracture is equalized, if there is curvature in it; and otherwise, do not pause for any cause.
And proceed to pause on the other bandage, and proceed to adjust over these star-shaped bandages made just now, if there is no swelling or pus under the spot, and then pause where there was that pus or swelling; and leave it for a few days; and then you strengthen with it those stars.
And let the stars at the highest part of cane be red, and formed wisely; or made from wood sticks; or from palm leaves; and make each star's width according to this form and this figure:
Therefore ensure that the star placed over that fracture is somewhat larger and slightly harder than the other stars, and adjust the length of the star according to its measurement in magnitude and size when compared to the limb; then proceed to strengthen with it on another bandage after your first tightness; then lie down properly according to what we have discussed about tightness, so that your tightness is most at the location of the fracture, and as you extend further from the fracture, more relaxation should occur.
And ensure that the threads are of medium thickness and are numerous; if the threads are thick, as I have seen through the operation of some times placing those cords' threads which were twisted, it is a great mistake when making tightness equal.
And thin threads are not convenient because you won't be able to achieve the tightness that you desire with them, and ensure that there is only one finger's width between stars and stars.
And if the patient is laid out so that their extremities are placed near the tightness at those spots, then pause and place them under the fur of a lion or woven linen to prevent any injury.
Some fractures occur due to injuries, and cause disruption in the sequence; I will come back to recall this situation specifically at the Capitol according to uniqueness.
And know that for all broken member it is not streched to the stars on the first day; which cause is that when the member, if it's big, cannot rest on your stars until approximately three or four or more days, according to your confidence in the occurrence of an abscess cautery.
And this is the method of splints on which the Ancients worked, which are placed over fractures, dislocations and twists.
Method of splinting like a short restoration of fracture, suitable for complex cracks and primarily for women and children, which is based on the powder from grinding meal, it is the starch part that comes out of the flour when you move the dough in the grinding mill.
And as such use it, instead sift that with egg white, and pause the thick or delicate process; and then use that.
Another method for treating fractures and dislocations: take a mixture of myrrh, dogbane, acacia, cinnamon, and saffron, which is prepared with one thousand grains each, totaling ten drachms; add five drachms of frankincense and twenty drachms of aloes; all these should be ground finely and mixed with almond water or egg white if the patient's condition allows. And then use this plaster, which has good composition and restores broken bones slightly, and enhances their strength in men.
Another method for preparing plaster which helps with fractures and twists: take one drachm of saffron, and three-quarters of a drachm each of frankincense and white myrrh; add twenty drachms of honey and mix well.
All together grind in a mortar with the twist stone, sift them, and mix them with water or with egg white and then administer it.
Method of splinting for joints and bones separated from their places, and relief the pain in those and cracks and fractures: take thread yarn and immerse it in strong vinegar and oil, then place it over the affected area.
This plaster doesn't just serve for restoration, but also expels abscesses and truly relieves pains.
Another method for a plaster that restores broken bones: take fig leaves and dried poppy stalks; mix all together to make a plaster from them.
A short plaster method for administering the restoration of bone fractures and when you want resolution of the remaining abscesses: use a mixture made from white powdery substances, chamomile flowers, violet petals, cornmeal flour, all in equal parts. Grind them all and mix with vinegar, if the body is not injured.
If it has been injured, then use that in wet clove water or in water and use it.
Another method of dressing pus to resolve faster than this first one, when an abscess occurs you need the restoration of the limb: use a mixture made from powders of white lead, charcoal, poppy seeds, honeybush, basil, and violet flowers; all in equal parts. Grind them all and mix with water from mustard or double strength water or vinegar, whichever suits the quality of the body and matches its color.
Mix Ypocras with olive oil instead of dissolving it in its liquid form when placed over the broken limb for restoring it, not a candle made from wax and oil but rather another cause; and advise that you choose between coarseness and fineness.
It has been observed that when placed over the broken limb it helps with restoration of the limb, and the causes in which dryness from quality is present are as such like myrrh, ashes and similar to those causes we have listed.
A plaster method that helps with injury and pain: use powdered ashes, hair from shaved heads or walnut skin, mixed equally with myrrh and salt; grind them, sift them, mix them together, and make a plaster.
Determine the quantity based on what is observed when you check if there's any swelling or inflammation, considering whether it is due to pain or pressure or if the bone is broken but not out of place, then don't move your body for days. And if you experience severe pain or pressure, inflammation at the spot, then restrain yourself or move that area immediately, and apply your plaster.
And take a cloth from him and wet sponge of the sea lion. Immersing that in boiling water, use it to wash the affected area until the pain ceases and the discomfort subsides; then lay the member to rest for an hour; also place over it wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rubbed oil, covering it throughout the night till you are sure there is no pus under the scab, and that the swelling of the limb has reduced, and the pain has been alleviated.
And then carefully stretch that constriction and apply the plaster without straining your initial constriction, and do this within an area where it will heal.
And if you notice that the pus and the heat and the pain and the swelling and all accidents have already healed completely, and if you need plaster and stretching, then do this by repeating the process from the beginning with equal intervals.
And if nothing happens to the limb for any reason as we have said, then do not change it but instead wait about three days or four or five. And some of this is left for twenty days according to how it appears with the loosening of the limb, as we have said, during which the fracture sticks together, and it comes to rest on that.
And then adjust more in the stretching than in your first stretching altogether, and adjust according to the thickening of the patient's thigh meat, as the recollection of them proceeds.
Maybe if you notice that the fracture site has dried out and is more stretched than compressed, then you know that nourishment cannot reach there; therefore, cover it with boiling water throughout the day; do this for all three days; relieve the stretching a little, and through this operation supply nutrition to the limb, and it gets slightly healed.
This is how the restorers of limb fractures do it in another stage when they are not restored at the beginning, according to whether it's compressed or restored according to its curvature, which is an error according to their operation, and great fear. If this were to be straightened out as enlarged by the ancients in their free works and was treated with this treatment.
And I have not seen any of them do this, so it is more reasonable that this does not happen.
According to the second: When a fracture occurs in the head.
The types of fractures are blows, and their appearances are various, and their causes differ. Some fractures occur due to impact by space, where the impact stops all bones within the skull, which leaves the bones alone, as if it were in the shaft, and thus this type is called scapular; or space impacts a part of the bone, impacting the meat but not passing the impact into the backside of it; and this type of fracture is called absolute lifting.
And the plague of these two fractures is great or little, and from the friction or compression; and the cause for it is impact on wood or hammering on stone, and in this manner they resemble.
And this fracture is penetrating that approaches the sinus cavity which leaves the bones alone; or it's within the bone itself. The plague of these two types of fractures can be either great or small.
And this is the fracture that is widened in the bone, with small subtlety of the hairline, and thus this type of fracture is called capillary.
And this is the fracture that occurs due to hammering or impact with stone, resembling it, causing one of the bone layers to enter into its divisions within. This happens in the concave area, similar to what happens when tools are impacted on and their entry points into the divisions happen within.
And mostly this happens in wet bones, such as those of infants.
And for all these types of fracture spots, they are like stars that are separated. And I will revisit with the recollection of all this in its place.
And I know all these types of fracture through detection on them and investigation of their symptoms and examination of the rotten flesh that is on them.
And the capillary type is known for this that it's revealed on the bone surface and cleaned off; it has a boundary around it when the fracture appears black.
And in the treatment of fracture, consider at the beginning the patient's symptoms, and then if you notice signs that indicate clear meaning for fever, as such as vomiting from cholera, expansion, loss of understanding, bleeding from sores, fainting, acute fever, smell disturbance and heat of those, and resembling their symptoms in major conditions, it is not healed.
And if you notice unusual symptoms, you hope for recovery; then you start treating the patient.
This cause is that if you come across the plague in the beginning as it's contracted and this happens during winter days, then you study in the bone remnant before day fourteen according to all disposition.
And if it's during the days of summer, then you wait until the seventh day when what remains of the bone is rotten from the sinus cavity and the symptoms that we have recounted occur.
And if the fracture has already spread to the sinus cavity and covers the brain, with small divisions that are compressed and forced, then you should cut into the affected part and massage it gently, according to what I will advise you.
And you would cut off the head of the patient's wound, and expose on it the bone according to custom and manner as far as possible according to the shape of the wound, and make sure not to press down heavily on the patient.
And if you happen to need detection of the bone, pus from an infection or abscess, then you press against it with this tool that covers it, and you would fill the place with infused cloth in vinegar and oil rubbed in, and let the wound rest within which should relieve the abscess; and be sure of blood flow; and proceed to circle around the bone and in its ablation.
And that is according to one of two methods of operation.
And the first method is that you incise the bone with a straight incision tool, and this is its form: And then administer another incision tool, slightly smaller than that one; and this is its form:
And then administer more of the wider incision tool than the second one.
And choose the number of various incision tools that you need, some of which are wider than others; and some of them are shorter than others, they should be at the tip of their extremities, and they should be made of iron or steel.
And use them for ease in striking the incision tools that it does not crush and damage that one.
And if the bone is strong and hard, then you must puncture in the vicinity of its front before administering the incision tools on the trails; which are named as non-deep trails.
And they are not named otherwise than those that do not reach the end of the bone in this way, for so it is close to them; whereby at the trail its round extremity or edge meets with the one where you leave its sharp tip resembling an edge or a small circle, which must be prevented from being submerged and going below the thickness of the bone.
It is convenient for you to use many of these trails each one that suits the thickness of any bone, within which must be present in all parts of the head, where its end should be sharp; the quantity in length and width should be according to the quantity of thickness of this part.
And this is the form of three types of trails: The quality of perforating in the circuit of the broken bone is that you place the trail on the bone and move it with your thumbs until you know that the bone has penetrated; then rearrange the trail to another location, and place whatever quantity corresponds to the thickness of the ray or around this.
And then you should incise with the incision tool between each piece of bone, and make it as subtle as you can at its end in levity, as we have said, while you eliminate the bone or with your hand, or for some other reason using tools you will have equipped for this, such as tongs and fine forceps.
And make sure that you take all precautions so that the incision tool does not touch any part of the scapula.
And when you have drilled the bone and if it is separate from the scapula if it continues with it, take out that piece, make sure to measure and compare it with the roughness of what is in this bone with another tool similar to an incision tool, however be careful that it is more precise and subtler than the other incision tools.
And if you find any part of the pettid and hard bones, then take that with ease using these tools; proceed to treat this wound with dressings and ointments as we have said.
The other method of operation is more gentle and far from pain, as Guillaumus taught and the method was through great skill; this is its speech: it is necessary for you in the beginning that you start to uncover the part of the bone of the body where the breakage is most violent and most evident. Once you have uncovered that part and paused at its extremity with a gentle yet swift incision tool, here's how it works:
And this is why the conical part is hard and does not cut any cause, while the sharp part is in two lengths ahead of it in width, as we see; that the conical part must be fitted against the scapula to the flat edge that sharply meets with the bone.
And then strike the incision tool on one part with a small nail so that you can cut all the bone easily as it has turned, and you should be sure of the compass that will not hit in the accident that you fear in any manner, and if the surgeon was the root of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, and if he was asleep.
And if you find any cause attached to the bone of the compass in some parts of the bone, cut that one with it from the conical edge of the incision tool, and remove that one easily, which is removed from its pain and distress.
And if the bone fracture does not penetrate into the compass, and whatever is separated or remains of the bone is its surface, and it is rough and hard in this area, then you must measure that roughness and remove those hard parts with fine razors which you have prepared with the number of various quantities so that it's possible for you to use them in every place according to their most suitable qualities and straight away from those following where your operation has left this broken bone and its shape.
And correctly follow your own reason when you should grind the bones at the beginning of their grinding process, and then use almost entirely the fine liquid from it, and do not stop performing this until you reach the point of administering the fat and the fine liquid from all those.
In any other small capillary fractures or subtle fractures, you should administer treatment according to how you would proceed with the correction of it.
And it's because these are not softened on all those who have studied in that art. And stand on what we have written, showing large fractures.
And if the pineal gland is obstructed when you remove the bone, then make sure to take lint according to the amount of the wound, and immerse that in rubbed oil, and place that over the wound; then take another folded or tripled cloth and immerse it in water and rubbed oil, and place that over the first cloth; and do so lightly on that until you can without harming the skin. And apply a layer of fat over that, and don't press that more than what the wound has enough of alone.
And let that remain with this treatment for one or two days until you are sure of the pus being evacuated; then remove that and start administering medicines against excessive drying, such as linseed cakes and cornmeal, and powders of essences and aristolochia, and those like them.
And you should use powdered medicines from these substances that are ground over the wound, such as dry ones; universally, administer to it all medicine of its nature which avoids contact and does not bite.
And follow your skill to ensure that the wound in your treatment is clean; do not let it be in the oiliness of ointments or any other substance; nor let you add toxicity to it. For when placed on the skin of the brain, corrupt that and let that happen, and spread this evil malice towards the patient nearby.
And proceed to the skin of the head, as if it were changed by your bones and much more when treatment is delayed for him; and you'll see a blackness on the surface. And therefore consider now if accidents happen to the patient that we've said, know that they are toxicities totally.
And if you don't see blackness but rather from the medicine placed above it, and this blackness is due to the virtue of that medicine causing this blackness, then make sure to take honey in parts and rubbed oil parts for it. And let these lines be on a cloth, and then place that over the head; and treat it with the spices of treatment until it is healed.
Third section.
On restoring the nose when it's broken.
Know that the nose is not broken from the nose itself but rather in two parts at its upper joints, or one of those sometimes dislocated, because there are two bones in it, and the part you leave is cartilaginous, not broken, and does not hurt it except for swelling, deformity, and obstruction.
If one of the two parts of it is broken, then you should insert your little finger into the nasal cavity and adjust that fracture internally with your thumb inside and outside, until the nose returns to its natural figure. And do this for yourself with ease, and watch that you don't harm the patient during it.
And if the fracture is in the upper joint part of the nose and your finger doesn't reach there, then make sure to adjust it at the end of the ray where there's a little thickness.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you should make like this.
And attend to the restoration of it on the first day of the fracture if possible; otherwise, in this case, after seven or ten days you should resume pus evacuation.
And insert a piece of cloth in the end of the nose with one band if the fracture is in one part, or two candles if the fracture is in two parts; and put it inside the candle with as much quantity that fills up the nostril.
And among the ancient restorers, they say that the candles should be wrapped in bandage and be changed every day, but I don't see this method; make sure that the cloth is covered with egg white mixed with essence powder; then leave it until the bone is set and the cartilage becomes firm.
And sometimes dislocations are found in the nose instead of candles, in case of much pus that's wrapped with a lion's hide cloth; and it seems that you already have the nasal fracture severe and that the patient can't breathe.
And this method isn't necessary for you; if you want to, do this way, and if you prefer, use candles.
And if another pus evacuation occurs, plaster the nose with cerat or with fat ointment mixed in water and rubbed oil, or with diacetyl.
And if you don't have pus evacuation, then make sure to plaster it outside with cornmeal and essence powder mixed with egg white; then place it on top of the stopper made from lion's skin; and never restrict your nose for any reason.
And if the bones of the nose are broken in a small fracture or comminuted, then make sure to open over those, and extract them with instruments that suit for those; then cover the cut, treat it with substances that promote healing and consolidation, and plaster with what's suitable.
And if it happens that there is an internal plague in the nose, then cure that with garlic and administer lead pipes inside until it becomes completely healed.
Chapter IV.
On the restoration of the jaw when it is fractured.
When the jaw of the patient is broken and the fracture is not infected, observe now if the fracture is only external, and is not broken into two parts but is bent inward from the sides; then its knowledge [i.e., severity or location of the injury] is slight.
And thus, if the fracture is on the right side, introduce your left index finger in the mouth of the patient; and similarly if the fracture is on the right side of the jaw, then introduce that same index finger of the right hand. And push outwards inside the fractured part, facilitating its return to its original position from both sides outside of the jaw opening; do this equally with the other hand towards the opening of the jaw from both sides.
And if the fracture of the jaw has already separated into two parts, then you should administer extension to both parts according to rightness while it is possible for their equilibrium.
And if there is an impact of teeth causing disruption, then strengthen those that you expect to break in the course of gold or silver or copper; and place your hand on the broken jaw with a clothe, and place another cloth under him/her, and place a large star-shaped cloth properly made, or one piece equal in length to the jaw; then lie it up according to how you are accustomed to do it and that suits the situation, while ensuring it doesn't get destroyed.
And command the patient to rest and be calm, and have them abstain from drinking sweet foods.
And if you estimate that the figure has been altered in some manner, then do this and untie it on the third day; and then correct what is already altered from your patient and plaster that with powder of moli, with almond butter, or with millet flour, provided you have left the clothe on your patient, and place a layer of the plastered cloth over it.
And when this plaster is adjusted on you and the position of the mouth is not altered, leave it alone, do not untie it until it heals and strengthens the fracture; for the times of this fracture being healed is three weeks.
And if another pus lump occurs due to a boil, then administer what we have said about times of healing for your body while it heals, and renew that boil.
And if the fracture is infected, then consider whether it is a piece of bone separated or stuck, then you should distinguish those stuck with what suits for their removal in the extraction of those from the inflammation.
And if the wounds of the infection are healed, then you should enlarge them with a bloodletting instrument according to the quantity of your need.
And when you have finished removing those stuck pieces, and if no pus is left from them, then when the wound of the infection is large; but if not, cover that with one of the plasters that suit it, until it heals.
Chapter V.
On the restoration of the sternum when it is fractured.
The times of healing are when the sternum is broken in front of the muscle part, and that fracture occurs in three ways.
Or it's broken, or separated, or separates into two parts without causing stickiness; and its restoration is slight in him/her; or thus if stickiness occurs in him/her, then the restoration of him/her is difficult; or thus if the fracture is infected.
And in that case, when the fracture is infected, you should have two ministers present, so that one has the assistant and follows the broken sternum, and the other extends the neck over that part.
And then enclose the fracture with your fingers until its form is made as he/she sees fit, and it should not be in his/her depression or concavity.
And if you need more extension, then take the patient's expectation cloth or wool, and make it as large as he/she sees fit; extend and elevate the sternum while holding the lump with your hand until you equalize the fracture according to what you see.
And if you cannot pull the end of the sternum outward to its sides, because it's pushed up towards the throat, then you should have the patient lie on their back, and place a hand halfway in size over the muscle of your body.
And the minister places their hand over the muscle of your body outward until the bone of the sternum is elevated as it's pushed up towards the throat in its position, and then you correct the fracture and enclose that with your fingers.
And if you feel stickiness from the sternum and they are swollen, then you should cut over that and remove those stuck pieces with ease.
And if it is stuck in the bone, then you should use incision on him/her with one of the incisors that you have accustomed to this, as you had placed the sternum over the inflammation that serves the throat; and this is the shape of that tool:
It is like the shovel of which this is the cavity; and its width according to how much you need from him, according to the size of the bone or its weakness.
May the length of him be according to what is possible for the operation; may there be two ends like times, and one end broad and the other stretched.
And if the rupture of the wound that you have incised when you extract the spongy part of the bone is large, and you are sure about a boil cautery, then adjust the two edges of the wound for suturing.
And if the rupture is small, or you fear a boil cautery, then use the wound with bandages and powders according to the quantity of the cut in the wound.
And if a boil cautery occurs, then soak a cloth in water and rose oil and vinegar, and place it there.
And in conclusion, make sure the tablecloth does not cover the broken bone; and continuously check if you see the patient every day, for when the swelling subsides or the tablecloth is no longer needed, then adjust this again and strengthen the connection.
And adjust the patient's sleep on his neck, place his pillow so that it is higher than his chin every night with just a small cushion; thus when this is elevated, support your aid under his armpit, and therefore the fracture of the sternum should be raised to an elevation in the muscle; or have his arm resting at his neck.
And do not displace the wound if it doesn't swell suddenly or form a boil within twelve days.
And adjust the plaster if you see his face in this manner, and correct the narrowing, restore it and smooth until the restoration is completed and the fracture of the sternum has coagulated.
And it is strengthened and made comfortable according to the month in twenty-eight days, and some patients are operated on in months of that period.
Chapter VI.
Regarding the restoration of the shoulder fracture.
The spatula tart is broken at his left side and not broken within him but rather on the margins.
And when his place is broken - and it's broken in the middle of him - not known except through touch, then according to how the fracture shape forces you, prepare for him and reduce that according to the natural figure throughout every manner of technique that is possible for you.
And adjust over that place, mill flour mixed with egg white and a bandage; and adjust on him multiple layers of cloth powder; then apply on his table a thin tabletop piece according to the entire quantity or even less than that of the spatula.
May if leaving the table is concave in one of the places of the spatula, then you fill that concavity with a bandage, and later adjust the table according to equality.
And then strengthen it from above with a long spoon to allow for proper descent and keep the table within not being swollen in its place.
And consider the wound every day; whenever it becomes softened, have another session and strengthen him, and level the table if it swells in its place.
And place the patient over his left side.
The table is restored in twenty days or in twenty-five days.
And when this number is completed, then you dissolve the bandage, and you should know safely that if it comes from the bones where it started, it will not be feared nor its dissolution.
And if you're dealing with the bone in the place and put down his chain, then you'll divide over him, hold it, and do as we have said about the fracture of the sternum for the presence of a boil caut here.
Chapter VII.
Regarding the restoration of the leg fracture.
The leg in some occasions is broken in the middle of him and that is where the spatula should be; but his ends should not be crushed or reduced.
And regarding the accidents of him when broken in his middle it declines towards the parts inside and occurs to him great pain, difficulty in walking, coughing, weakness, faintness, and vomiting; and this is declared in the cavity in the broken bone and cannot be hidden from feeling.
And the restoration of him is that he should be placed with his patient on his back and place a cushion between his shoulders; then press on his muscles, adjust his ribs according to two sides, refine in your operation and in the balancing according to every manner possible that suits you within that so as to return the figure of the bone whenever he sees.
And then place on them a plaster and bandage, and place something soft underneath until you have laid down a subtle table of sage or of ashes, as well as one similar in shape to yours in levity; because you wrap that inside cloth. And delicately cover that over the broken bone so it doesn't heal improperly; and then add padding according to roundness on your back for several times, and strengthen that with a tight bandage; and constantly consider the padding at all times, and when it has softened, strengthen that.
And if necessity causes you to cause decay or cutting, or pain, or abscess that happens in the area, then remove and untie that, and discard the plaster and correct whatever happens according to this manner of treatment for him; and then return the plaster, if you see something with the hand; and adjust the bandage so it is healed.
Chapter VIII.
On restoring the ribs when they are broken.
Know that a fracture of the ribs does not occur in small injuries but only when they pierce through to the other side; and at the extremities of them on their partition in front, it does not happen with those contractions otherwise because they are cartilaginous. And knowledge about it is not hidden from the feeling; you must inquire of the person for these statements.
And the restoration should be such that you align the fracture according to the possible method with the bones as they are covered, and then plaster and strengthen the broken bone inside, if you need that.
And if the fracture of the ribs is declining into the parts inside, then it causes pain and puncture in the patient, like the puncture that happens when someone has burst, because through that the lung is wounded; and it causes difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting of acidic contents; and this is difficult to treat.
And already the Greeks are ingenious with these motions inside.
And about them they say: breathe to hold food from the patient that produces inflammation and wind, so that the belly is inflated and stretched outwards, and the fracture is pushed towards the parts outside.
Let us avoid causing that through whatever way it may not be the cause of minor generation of an abscess to form, if it doesn't happen; and if it already happens, then help with that.
And they say about some that it is held up against the suction and closely that one sweats with strength; and this resembles reasoning, but however, it's feared that the suction carries off the excesses due to weakness.
And they say about some: breathe so that the area is covered with wool that is already submerged in oil caut, and dust is placed between the ribs until it fills up, making sure that the padding aligns as you wrap that according to roundness; and then let the patient be treated by colic from food and medicine.
And if the constriction causes intense pain in the patient who cannot bear it, and the lung is wounded by tooth puncture, we fear for the patient; then breathe so that you cut on the spot, expose from the broken rib, and then place the tool over which the technique follows, which I will describe next, and insert the bones with ease, and remove that.
And then adjust the two edges of the wound if it's large with stitches, and treat that with plaster until it heals.
And if an abscess happens inside, then you cut and place dust in rubbed oil on the spot, and let the patient be treated with this method that addresses the abscess inside.
And it should be folded over the side where he sleeps, until it heals.
Chapter IX.
On restoring a fracture of the vertebral column and neck.
Some observations about fractures in the bones of the neck, and similarly to their ligaments, and likewise for the vertebrae of the back. And if this happens with someone and you want to know if they will heal or not, then consider that if their hands are already softened, numb, dead, cannot be made stronger nor extended, nor pricked by a needle without feeling pain in them, then you know it is not healing, and in similar conditions it's fatal.
And if they're sick and you feel this constriction in your hands and puncture, then you know that the neck of the bone is saved and that the patient will recover from treatment.
And if you see similarities with this for the vertebrae of the neck and want to know if they will heal or not, then consider their feet.
And if you find that they are already softened, this happens in their hands like it does with the hands. And when you lie on their back, they have wind and loss of appetite according to their will, and several times you fold them on their back and want to urinate but cannot, then you know it is fatal, and hence do not strive for their treatment.
And if nothing of this happens, the cause is better and more minor.
And the treatment for this is that you perform on the desensitization of the abscess to oil rubbed on the vertebra protrusion, or with hazel leaves; place some areas over this each day until the abscess is numbed.
And then place one of the bandages, comforting and relieving, on it with strength; and command the patient to take rest and have calmness, not to sleep in the spot where he finds pain until it is healed.
And if it happens that you have to remove the bone of the tibia or any cause that has already separated from them, then let the exit occur over the seam and place that bone; then adjust both edges of the wound, with stitches if they are large; and then treat that with some ointment until it is healed.
If it is broken in the heel of the tibia bone and it's the tip of the penis, then let you insert the tip of your left hand into the buttock, and align that broken bone with your other hand as possible according to the second equation; and then place over him the bandage and sandal if you need those, and then strengthen that.
And if you feel bones broken in him, then place that one on it, and hold that, and treat the wound with the treatment that is preceded until it is healed.
Capital X.
For the restoration of the thigh.
The bones of the thighs are broken, and if they break, then their fracture is merely communication in the extremities of those, being inscribed along its length and declining towards the inner parts; it happens to the patient pain at that location and puncture, and the body becomes numb when there is a fracture.
And for his restoration, you would place your hand over it within which the fracture that is the shape of him lies.
And if the fracture is only at the extremity of him, then you would align that according to what can be aligned by equation within which it is assembled to its natural figure.
If the fracture is in the long or already declines towards the inner parts, then you must make the patient lie on his stomach so that you are prepared for the restoration of that fracture. And when you have aligned that, place over him the bandage, and then place over that sandal or seam, and strengthen with compression on which do not fear the puncturing of the fracture nor moving of the star.
And align the concavity with that which fills it within which that accepts compression according to equality, and command the patient to sleep on his two or neglect his side's.
And if it happens that an abscess appears, then you stop the extension of him and his restoration until that abscess is treated, and place over him what sedates that according to which was preceded; and then return to the restoration of him and strengthen that as needed.
And if it happens in the tibia bone or are broken, then you would treat them.
Capital XI.
For the restoration of the fracture of the助手 (literally translates to "assistant" or "helper", might be a specific part of the body or medical tool; context is needed for an accurate translation).
The assistant is that which is between the shoulder blade, in the area of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, then the restoration of him is in one of two ways, of which you would take half plate of wood with medium thickness according to this form:
And if they are located at both extremities, two ligaments exist, and then he should be suspended from the elevated location.
And let the patient lie on his back; and then extend his broken arm over the stick until it reaches to the tip of his body in its middle position, where the curvature of the stick is attached.
And then suspend over it something heavy or the surgeon extends that at the inner parts; and then let the doctor examine the fracture on his hands, until the fracture returns as needed.
The other method is that the patient should be supine on his back and have his arm extended over his chest; then command two servants that one of them hold what is underneath the fracture on his hands, and the other holds the elbow's region; each of them should extend at their part.
And if you wish for the extension to be more forceful, then strengthen on the fracture and on that with another ligament, and each of the two servants should extend at both their parts.
And if the fracture is close to the muscle's extremity, then let there be half of the ligament placed on the tip and the other part of the fracture should go towards the shoulder.
And similarly if the fracture is close to the shoulder, then let there be the ligament placed on that area and towards that shoulder.
Align that with ease and your work, and then when it has been aligned according to how you need it and a good application is applied, then strengthen that if no abscess occurs.
If an abscess occurs, then smooth the compression within the seventh day, and place over him unwoven woolen bandage with grease oil until the abscess rests, and then strengthen that.
The method of strengthening that is to place bandage over the fracture, and then wrap the naval cloth around the bandage; adjust the arm onto that assistant, and let his hand opened on his muscle.
And place the sheet and strengthen on the helper's arms so that the arm is in the place of stars, if you do not prevent any cause from breaking the bones.
And then use stars.
And that you pause on the fracture that star which is more close and more robust than the other stars; and place between each star the width of a finger, and let the length of the stars according to the breakage add three fingers from every side.
And place strength on the stars along the constriction which I mentioned at the beginning of the skull.
And that your constriction over the site of the fracture be more stretched. And when much stretching occurs on the fracture, the constriction is smaller.
And so, if you place the position of the stars and constriction as we have said when restoring the member to its original location, then do it.
And if you fear a wound from pus, then let the constriction and stars rest for one day as we have said.
And consider the ligament in all directions for three days so that it does not occur at the site of pain or swelling; or prohibit food from reaching the member due to excess constriction; and then correct all this according to what we have said.
May if you are uncertain about stability that none of this happens, then do not loosen the ligature but wait approximately three days or more.
And let the patient's back rest on their buttocks, and their hands are on their stomach.
And place on the helper's full bed of wool evenly, and consider at all times of the night or day whether the figure of the broken member is not disturbed or dissolved, or whether the ligament has softened; then correct this altogether with your skill.
And place the food of the patient according to the order which we have in front, so that the food is subtle at the beginning until strength begins; and then adjust how you thicken the food for them.
That the strength of the helper and the patient's chest is strong after 40 days; then adjust so that they are released, give them baths and use ointments which correct those.
And if the fracture is laid bare and rubbed, then do not release that ligament and stars in one day or within two months.
Capitol. XII.
Regarding the restoration of a broken arm.
An arm is composed of two bones which are called the ulna and the radius; among them, one is small, and that's what we call the wrist bone, while the other is large and it rests on the smaller one at the lower part above.
And if only the larger bone or the smaller one is broken in strength, they are broken at the same time.
And when only the smaller bone is broken above, then the restoration of it is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the break is in the bone below, then the fracture of it is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And even worse than that is when both bones are broken at the same time.
So if the bone that is broken is the smaller ulna above, then it's convenient for the doctor to restore it; you should adjust a small extension within which that will be equalized.
And if the large bone is broken, then consider placing an extension more vigorously.
And if both bones are broken at the same time, then you should apply the traction much stronger.
And consider placing the hand's figure for restoring it and extend its extension on a pillow; have the wrist of your hand above all other fingers, but more so than all others, and the foot should be at least as high as sitting in a chair.
And have a pillow in front of it either straight or inclined for the foot not to undertake labor.
And let the minister extend his arm from the lower part above towards the patient's hand or ligament, and another minister extends similarly above.
And let the doctor equalize the bones within which he shortens that according to the best figure that can be done.
And if there is a deformity in the bone, then you should adjust all parts in their place with your skill.
And if there appears an isolated deformity that breaks the continuity and is not within your hope for restoring it, then you should act on it according to the method which we mentioned above.
And if the fracture is with pus, I have already addressed this to a separate chapter, and so take care of that.
And if an abscess caut occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then you lay out a cloth covered with a wadded bandage made of roasting oil and white wax, so that it is midway between thickness and subtlety; place a cloth over that with subtle constriction until pus can drain; then remove the bandage and apply an ointment prepared from powder of moli in honey; then place stars; let the star placed above that fracture be more close and more robust.
And know that the number of stars on an arm can be seen in major dispositions, or if it's a break in one bone or both bones at the same time.
And then press your constriction over the spot of the bone with strong and violent pus, and when the constriction is as high as possible on the parts above the fracture or on the lower parts of it, press the constriction slightly moistened for as long as the reminiscence of it begins in the onset of the head.
And the sheets that envelop over the fracture be damp cloths, and not hard or scratchy. The consistency of the paste applied to them should be neither too thin nor too thick but just right between fine and coarse, as we have previously described.
And consider the limb and the skin for about several days. And if any cause occurs that requires correction, such as the pain occurring in the limb itself, then you should immerse the limb in cold water until the pain ceases.
And let the limb not be strained until it rests, and then return the constriction.
And if the constriction has already been softened and the bone has grown back as it should, then correct all this with your skill.
And consider more if the nutrition cannot reach the limb due to excess constriction, then immerse that slightly and let it rest for several days until the nutrition flows back to that area, then strengthen that.
If no other cause befalls the patient as we have mentioned, then do not immerse it in water for about 20 days or so.
And let the hand of the patient be suspended by its own virtue of vigorous movements, and have it sleep on its back.
And know that this fracture is restored in 30 days or 32 days, or is slightly strengthened and restored in 28 days, all of which depends on the disposition of the muscles and the nature of the virtue.
Capitol Chapter XIII
Regarding the restoration of fractures to the wrist and fingers.
And know that in the wrist and joints of the fingers, fractures occur but do not happen to them without swelling from bruising.
And when a fracture or bruising occurs in the hand, then immerse that patient so they lie back and place their head on it according to equality, and then press the hand of them onto that stretched out.
And let the minister extend the broken bones, and the doctor equalize those within which they become thickened to good thickening.
And then immerse and press on the plaster and stopper, if there is no pus to be seen. And then place stones according to the amount of the area, and you have already enveloped that in a cloth of it.
If the tear is in the inward parts beneath the palm of the hand, then you make a semblance of a hole in the cloth and order the patient to hold that against their torn palm; have it strengthened with long cloth.
And let the stone of the heart be in the cloth where it rests, so that the heart is applied to the palm; strengthen that according to how you see fit.
If the fracture is in the outward parts, then immerse it with a stone and another stone from that part left on the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; then press on the constriction, as the hand is twisted between the fingers against their skin.
And if there occurs a fracture to one of the joints of the fingers, if it is just the finger joint, it should be equalized according to how you see fit and then strengthened against the palm; and if you wish, place a small straight stone under him so that the fracture is elevated and not bruised.
If the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in that of the middle part or in the index finger, or the little finger, or the ring finger, then it should be equalized and held at the point where it's bent; or they are all held together continuously, which is better; or place a small stone under it, as we have said for the joint.
And consider in your restoration and before that, the disposition of pus to be avoided - during your operation - when there occurs any cause of those things, according to what has been recounted about it.
Capitol Chapter XIV
Regarding the restoration of fractures to the thigh bone.
The thigh bone with bruised swelling is broken and is perceived by the sensation as converting to the part in front and becoming above the pus.
And the restoration of this is done so that muscle strengthens over the fracture and other muscles away from the fracture, and the patient lies prostrate on their belly and face.
And let the minister extend all the muscle in its part according to quality, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
And if they are near the end of the thigh bone, then let the muscle be extended to the knee part of the quadriceps tendon, so that the extension fits into them, and the other muscles away from the fracture.
And similarly if the break is near the knee, then let the muscle be done towards the patellar tendon, and make the extension to the parts away from it.
And then the doctor equalizes the bone in both of their hands until you reduce that according to natural likeness and the bone is connected through good connection; then immerse it with plaster and constriction if there is no occurrence of pus on the member. If it happens in their abscess, then you leave that alone for a few days until the abscess heals under the cautery, and soon return to your treatment.
The constriction of his leg is made: cover the fracture with a hard bandage, fold it back and forth two or three times, remove any excess; then wrap the area within which it reaches the ankle and toe.
And insert the long needle between the leg and its area near the ankle to the parts you left, allowing the ends of the needle from the insertion point past above the two parts, then rotate around the leg and knee until excess of the band is removed.
And place on the leg at the spot of that fracture stars, and place one star over the bone at the knee area.
And fill in the gaps between the knee and leg with thick cloths, so that the constriction can be凝固.
And apply a strong constriction in the middle over the fracture area with three or four layers, and as you move further away from the fracture site, your constriction becomes smaller, lighter, and wetter.
And extend both ends of the needle to the insertion points between which it reaches into the chest cavity, and strengthen both ends of the stars from the other side so that the thread does not slip out of its place.
And leave the constriction in place, so that it does not cause erosion or abscess under heat nor swelling and resembles those; if any reason arises from these, then you must attend to them, and adjust whatever happens as closely as possible according to what we have discussed numerous times.
If there's a protrusion in the bone where it is placed, then cover such that you equalize it according to what's possible; and if not, do something on them and keep that position, and treat with the one preceding the memory until it heals.
And some times strengthen this leg fracture from the knee in another way that it is adjusted to your stars, as we have said in the guide and on the arm.
However, in the restoration of his leg done this way, do not cause lameness in the patient; and if it is restored alone, then for another reason that applies to their knee, then it becomes necessary that he walks with difficulty from time.
And know that the leg is strengthened in about ten days or one or two months, and all this varies according to the diversity of people's bodies and other arrangements.
Chapter XV
On restoring the fracture of the ankle bone.
And know that a fracture of the ankle bone is often caused by sudden injuries; however, it happens in various ways due to accidents.
And if it happens to his fracture, then it is merely a crack or bruise in its parts; and this is due to coldness or heat exposure, and everything depends on the feeling.
And the restoration of his leg is that it must be equal to what breaks in its parts according to these, where it should be added and joined as much as possible for harmony and ease of construction.
And place the plaster and put on that round star if you need it; strengthen above with constriction as convenient.
And consider all the arrangements we have recommended in other fractures, such as heat under the cautery and similar to those that oppose themselves against every accident so that they are convenient for healing within it.
Chapter XVI
On restoring the fracture of the knee joint.
And know that in the knee joint are two bones, of which one is thick and named by its common name as the knee. The other is subtle and named easily.
And it happens to all kinds of fracture in the same way as they occur in both bones of the arm, and thus restoration is done for him in the same way as for the arm when equalized, and his operation is one.
And if both bones are broken at once, the knee joint becomes dislocated in all directions.
And if it breaks the more delicate bone, the knee joint is dislocated backward.
And if it breaks the thicker bone, you need to find that out yourself, and those are reasons not within your expertise.
And apply extension, alignment, and realignment according to this equalization for the stars.
However, if the knee joint fracture is not too serious and has no distinct symptoms, let the extension be mild and more gentle, and apply to your strength.
And in the knee joint there is some reason for operation on the arm, and that's when you equalize the stars and complete your entire operation; then you take weights of wood that are placed under your causes which are placed in solitude, and made evenly from palm branches; lift those to whose small roughness they belong, and not those with hands, and make them as long as the knee joint is, and into the ankle among the rest.
And wrap around each cloth in two layers according to the length of it, place one over the knee joint area of one side and the other on the corresponding side of the other side, and be under the ankle within the area below the chest.
And place the two stars in three locations of each extremity and at the middle point, for this structure prohibits leaning to the right or left part, it stands by good station.
And after the first floss is applied according to the length of the tendon, then place the tendon on them so that it retains its mobility.
And especially ensure you do this in a fracture, and when that is treated properly.
And also consider each day the tendon and study it further to understand, and you should keep it free of abscesses or inflammation or other similar causes; and when any cause from those happens, then place your treatment so that it enters into what needs healing until it is cured.
Chapter XVII.
About the fracture of the heel and bones of the foot and fingers.
Fracture of the heel does not happen in entirety; sometimes fractures occur to the bones of the foot; and fractures happen less often to the fingers, but they do not happen to them except during the months of pregnancy.
And if fractures happen to the bones of the foot and they are elevated among themselves, then the patient should lie with their foot on prepared ground as usual.
And also place one foot on what is elevated from those bones, and apply pressure with the others, press, and equalize them among themselves until they turn into the locations.
And also place bandages and stops over it, and place the patient's belly on a small table with two cushioned ends.
And strengthen that on the foot in its downward structure, since you have enveloped that with cloths and against other causes from which you need.
And when three or four days have passed for the patient, then you release the ligament, where you will find the bones equalized, or they are broken or dislocated, and the operation in those is as you know.
And if some fingers are broken, then restore those, and equalize them as I have advised you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. And also place the broken finger with a star according to the length of the finger, and be more gentle with them. And also place your foot on this table which I have advised you about before, and strengthen that in its downward structure.
And if that which is broken in the bones are two or three or more, then place on each finger a star of its quantity enveloped in lion's cloth, and strengthen the table at the lowest part of the foot, and stand on one of the ends of the table to let the belly rest for good retention.
And it is important for you that you do not forget to consider all the causes which we have discussed with you in the other fractures of accidents that we have talked about, and apply this treatment to all accidents according to what has been discussed.
Chapter XVIII.
About the fracture of the shin bone and the bone of the tarsus, and the knee joint of a man.
When the shin bone of a woman is broken, then have her lie down on her back, and also incline that towards the right side just slightly, and keep it supported behind.
And the midwife raises the calf of the leg, and does this in the shin bone as it's expected; and make the woman bend down, and lift her right foot gradually, for all this is to be done until the bent part of the shin is behind and the broken bone returns.
And also place powder on her back, and when she wants to urinate, let her hold the leg in a relaxed way and she can urinate, then return it according to the manner in which you mixed it at the beginning, and return to her initial powder.
And do this for seven days or approximately that time until it is healed.
And if you wish, take an onion and place over her heel a cannula of wool; and immerse the entire bladder into her shin, then blow forcefully through the cannula until the bladder is inflated inside the shin, which returns the fracture.
And also fill with calf and stay for some days according to what we have advised until it is healed.
And when the bone of the tarsus in a man or woman is broken, then administer in its restoration and adjustment what we have advised for the bone of the thigh.
And that which is straight does not get hidden in these nearby fractures and rarely happens, especially among those who have some study and understand my free speech; for that fracture means to you in the major processes of direction in its restoration and adjustment, so please understand it well.
And for the knee joint in men when it is broken, take a large bag of sand and place the knee inside; and also cover it with a cloth wrap, keep it wrapped, and let it rest for three days or approximately that time, and it will be healed.
Chapter XIX.
About the restoration of fractures when they are treated properly.
It is convenient for him who experiences fractures in treatment, and especially if the bone is large such as the elbow bone or the humerus, or similar to that, you should take care of it and perform bloodletting on it immediately when your conditions for bloodletting are met or they testify like what we have said previously.
And if the wound is bleeding, then cover it with pressure from you until your dust, which you spread over it as thyme, is applied; if another cause is not presented to you.
And start to restore the fracture on that day itself, do not prolong this if an abscess does not occur.
If an abscess occurs through the cautery, then allow the restoration of the patient within 9 days until the abscess is drained, and do not approach it on the third day and in total over four days; this will prevent causing further harm.
If the broken bone is imminent over the exposed wound, then cover it with pressure to reduce and equalize that near your own fingers for easy manipulation and with a slight extension.
If the extension is not prepared for and the alignment of the wound near your own fingers, then reduce that with your fingers; this tool is made of iron, its length is about seven or eight digits, and its width is according to the size of the wound; thus, it is necessary for a doctor to have three or four of these according to the amount needed for treatment in all kinds of fractures.
And if it is round, and if it's in the slight hardness that doesn't bend, you must compress on it during the time of the operation.
And if it's at an acute end with a margin on each of its extremities; and let the top be of uniform thickness, and inside the middle part should have the patient's size.
And this is the form of it:
It's named in Greek "volentz hernia", thus it's a small palette.
So cover it with the patient's extremity raised above the imminent bone's extremity.
And push that in a groove until the bone returns, and equalize it with some sort of alignment.
And strive to equalize the ends of the fracture between them, and if the broken end is subtle and does not take that tool for good access, then cover it with your need to insert the end of this bone into a place where the instrument has power over it.
If you cannot reduce the bone completely as we have recommended, then cut it into whatever suits you from among the scalpels which we mentioned; or cut it with one of the saws in any way that is possible for you.
And remove that which sticks out from the bone of roughness and of small scars.
And when the bone is reduced, and upon this reduction the patient experiences severe pain; then know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; and from then on, give this advice to the patient.
When your restoration to the bone is completed, then immerse a bandage in vi wet with a black antiseptic; and especially during summer, do not cover the wound with ointment or any other cause that might lead to infection or corrosion on it.
And when you finish your process of restoring the bone, administer ointments at that time, and leave the wound exposed until you insert the thread with scissors and use bandages according to the size of the wound.
And use all caution not to damage the wound near the fracture, which is what many doctors do, and causes death or deterioration of their patients, this is how it heals. And if your constriction is slight, soft, different from the constriction of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or a bad wound, and you fear certain harmful accidents as we have advised, and find pain in that area, then do not cover it with those bandages, but use hard cloth instead of bandages and strengthen it around them.
And when the wound begins to heal around one or two days, so that there is a formation of flesh in it, then remove from under the cloth which you had placed over that with oil, and administer calgus (calf's foot extract), ointments which according to our custom medicate wounds; thus like tetrafarmacon ointment and similar ones.
And you should consider that the wound is checked every morning and evening until it becomes consolidated and hardened; so that the healing can flow from the patient to the parts left, with ease.
If the wound takes days to heal and it's not consolidated or the flesh is not removed from it by the formation of new tissue, then you should know that here are the reasons why you need to continue treating the wound with remedies. And those are the reasons that have separated and removed them; those that do not separate from their source and cause pain by affecting the limb, you must push to remove those as much as possible.
And if it happens that the wound becomes or remains infected, it's inflammation, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction, then cover it with one of those as you see fit for your treatment; this is preceded by a narrative in its chapter on surgical procedures.
And from that onwards, ensure the best position and present your plan: when the bone is broken, elevate the limb as if it were a bone of a thigh or helper and similar to those in large limbs; do not assume recovery from this, nor the removal that any cuts might cause leading to death; leave it there until something strong falls down by itself within about 20 days or 30. And then treat the wound if you see it, and if not, leave it as such.
Chapter XX.
On the treatment of dislocation that occurs in the aftermath of a fracture.
Dislocations occur during the aftermath of fracture healing, especially near joints, and are marked by distortion of the body's parts; and you must prohibit the limb from its natural operation.
Then consider if the dislocation is recent and administer remedies that have a calming effect such as aloes, eggs, vinegar, wine, or oil. Look at them and choose one or more of those; if they have a soothing effect internally, or if they improve egg whites, or add vinegar to them, place some of these over the dislocation on a cloth, and apply pressure with good compression on it.
And allow the dislocation to heal without letting it relax for several days; then release it and repeat another method until the dislocation is reduced; or press a sheet of lead over it from above, as lead has the property of reducing all that inflates in limbs.
Perhaps if the dislocation has already become bone and is hard to reduce, you may have to start it gradually. Then divide the dislocation along the most superior part of the body, and remove the excess or cut that area with some razors until it softens; and treat it while it heals.
Chapter XXI.
On restoring fractures when they are restored and then treating the delicate and fragile member according to its natural state.
When a bone fracture is restored, then you treat the delicate and fragile member according to its natural state, otherwise, only such causes occur: among which one is an abundance of tissue fluid and lack of movement in what should move; or due to excessive constriction of the tissues where nutrition is prohibited from flowing to the limb; or due to excess inflammation; or due to unnecessary movements out of their time; or due to weakness within the patient's body and debility.
And the treatment for this is to give the patient rest, so that nutrition multiplies within him; and apply baths; and immerse it in warm water and camphor.
And place a poultice on the limb, so that the poultice draws nutrition to it, or continue its treatment with camphor in water baths, until nutrition flows and returns to its natural shape.
Chapter XXII.
On the treatment of curved bones when they are restored in a tortuous manner, and you prohibit their operation from what prevails.
When the member has already been restored during healing of its curvature and overabundance in the curved bone and dislocation, and it is due to this deformation of shape of the limb, but nonetheless, the limb is not prohibited from its natural operation, then what you receive from that person who believes that their limb should be of new curvature.
Perhaps there are many foolish doctors and restorers who have done this in our land; and this operation is highly condemned, leading to great fear of its symptom which is fatal.
Perhaps if there is a limpness and dislocation that are recent, you should have them soaked in camphor water containing softening herbs such as mallow leaves and mustard seeds, or similar; then apply it repeatedly to the limb with this softening treatment, like after well-done lard. Or take gum from holly roots and mix it with beeswax or olive oil, and apply that; or use figs with fat mixed with goose grease, or similar medicines called consolidating remedies, applied in this manner.
And sometimes, it dissolves with frequent light rubbing on the wet parts of the body at all times.
Perhaps if curvature has already gone ahead and been made strong and turned into bone causing it necessary to treat it with iron, then you should have the pus above corrected and the continuous bone be dissolved, and this excess of dislocation is cut from that placing it on the bone using thin surgical instruments, and assistance is provided in this matter with diligence and study.
Chapter XXIII.
On speaking about dislocation.
Dislocation is the displacement of any part of its location, so that it becomes prohibited from movement, and distorts the shape of the limb, causing great pain and injuries to fall upon the patient.
So when a dislocation occurs, you should immediately force it to be reduced, and not delay reducing it; for if it is delayed, the place becomes stagnant and strength is required to make the reduction of dislocation difficult.
And for this reason, it should not be too soft or stretched during the process of stagnation, as it often causes seizures and sharp pains.
Perhaps when this happens, you should take the patient's flank, and then leave it so that the lump can rest; and have the limb soaked in warm water and oil, and reduce it with ease.
And the entire limb should be treated with what will bring its memory back to its place.
And I have already and ordered the chapters of dislocation according to what is preceded in fractures; from the superior part of the body up until the posterior part.
Chapter XXIV.
Regarding the treatment of a dislocated jaw, you do this.
So if the two jaws are dislocated and cannot be manipulated; and the total dislocation of both is carried out according to two methods: either they are partially repositioned at their places with a slight movement, and they become soft somewhat; or they are completely dislocated and fully separated, in which case they soften up near the joint part where saliva comes from the patient's mouth and it becomes impossible for them to have that nor can they close their mouth, and the tongue of the patient is enveloped by its own saliva.
When the dislocation is slight, then in larger arrangements it returns by itself due to a small cause.
If the dislocation is complete and full, then you must provide a minor reduction for it, and do not delay in doing so completely.
And if the minister has the head of the patient, then let the doctor place his one hand on the side of the dislocated jaw within the mouth, if the dislocation is from one part; or he should put both his hands simultaneously, if the dislocation is from two parts, and the rest of his instructions are given towards the other ends where they are outside; and command the patient to stop moving his jaws and let them go in any direction; and the doctor aligns the jaw and places the jaw inside until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult for it, especially if both jaws are always dislocated, then administer evaporation with hot water and oil, so that a slight reduction of both occurs and do not delay in reducing both completely as we have said.
And when they return and are aligned, and the mouth of the patient is closed and has not become soft, then place on those powders of dry daphne with cerate, and it should be made with melted wax and oil; and let them be applied on facilitating the molasses.
And let the patient of the patient sleep on his back, his head between two pillows, so that he does not strain himself at the right or left side; and do not force him to endure any cause out of weakness; have his food be forbibicium lion, so when the pains are relieved and the jaws are numb, then let him relieve as much as he wants.
And this should be administered in comfort, and do not work on the opening of the mouth for eating and drinking and breathing until the jaw is numb and healed.
And if the reduction of two jaws when they are dislocated for some time and cannot be converted to their original places is difficult, then fevers occur frequently and soda becomes intense, and it strengthens the patient's stomach, and strengthens them and vomits pure colera.
And when you do this, then know that it is a loss; and if someone experiences this, they will die within three days.
Chapter XXV.
Regarding the reduction of a dislocated sternal notch and of the end of the muscle.
The sternal notch is not dislocated within the chest due to its continuity with the ribs; and sometimes it is dislocated from its origin outside, which is felt.
And the restoration of it is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms. And then forcefully constrict the place with your palm, so that it will return.
And then place an ointment and powder on that and strengthen it.
The end of that which is connected to the chest does not get dislocated on any day, then you must reduce and align it according to what we have said and according to how your equipment allows.
And then place an ointment and powder on that area, and apply it with strapping and rest until it heals.
And with this method of treatment is the reduction of the end of the muscle when it is separated from its place.
Chapter XXVI.
Regarding the reduction of a dislocation of the muscle.
You should know that the muscle is not dislocated except in three ways, of which one is that it is dislocated at the place of the nipple to the left.
And the second is that it is dislocated at the top of the muscle, this one is done quickly; and it is not dislocated in the back parts through the shoulder; and it is not dislocated in the front parts by the nerves.
And it is mostly dislocated and situated outside at the left parts from the nipple, and especially in those where the muscles are few, slightly dislocated; but in those with large muscles, they sit out with difficulty.
And it often happens to some people due to impact or blow, and the muscle of the patient becomes inflamed by a heat blister, and it is dislocated because of this.
So you should perform this while you are well supported by the patient, and then proceed with treating him.
And when you recognize the dislocation of it which is at the left parts from the nipple; then distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the normal muscle, which you find among these various manifestations; and you find in the head of the muscle a concavity and leave the nipple of the muscle's head like one hole, and the patient cannot reduce his hand to his own armpit, nor extend that further with all movements.
If it's dislocated you must move or reposition it, and then you will find it openly manifested, not hidden.
And with this dislocation, a slight reduction is done when the body is cool and the patient is still in pain.
And the reduction is done by raising your hand to his parts above; and place your feet under him so that they stimulate him, and raise the joint with strength in its own place. The minister raises your hand and extends it towards him; then he stops that so gently returns slightly.
If it is that after what we have said it does not return, and because of the eating habits that cause dislocation, for several days then soak the patient in hot water and give them a salve to soothe and moisturize so as if they were herbs of high altitude such as fenugreek and mint, in water, and give it to them.
And the patient is to be laid down on his back and placed with their feet stimulated by you wait for the wool that has equal weight between levity and constraint. And the doctor places his arm over the spot, raises the muscle's head in strength, pulls the hand of the patient so it doesn't hurt the parts below, and another minister holds the head of the patient, so it doesn't get hurt by the parts below; then that almost returns to its place.
And if you wish, reduce that second this way: and make to be present a man who is longer than the patient, and he stands on his side of that later, and he inserts his muscle under your stimulating hand of the patient and raises the stimulation above him among where the patient is suspended in air, and another minister pulls the hand of the patient from the parts below of their belly. If the patient is slight, then make sure that what causes it to be suspended elsewhere, because of its gravity in this case, where dislocation returns almost immediately.
And if reduced internally according to another method: and place in the ground a long pole with its end round like a mortar's pestle, not thick nor thin, and have the patient lie down next to the end of the rod, covering it with linen. The patient stands according to the length of the pole, and extend their hand at the parts below on the other side; then extend their body from the other side with strength, so that the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if it's difficult to reduce you due to all the causes we've mentioned, then use this cure: and take a pole of which the length is that of two arms, and its width should be four digits, and the thickness of it should be soft like a nipple according to this form:
And then cover the round end with linen so that the pole doesn't hurt the patient.
And then have the patient lie down with their nipple area covered by linen, and extend their hand or arm over the pole in between the parts below, and cover the pole on the support and the arm and the end of the hand.
And have the arm lay on a ladder according to its width, and the hand extends in between the parts below, while the rest of the body hangs from the other side, so that the joint returns almost immediately.
And when the treatment of the patient is completed according to any method that is possible for you, then make sure you place under his stimulation a wool waiting cloth of equal quantity; and have an ointment prepared from moly powder mixed with albumin of egg spread over the entire muscle area, so as it's stirred above, and strengthen the stimulation part in constraint moderately; and let the mixture be spread on the ointment, and the hand of the patient is attached to his neck, and left undisturbed, making sure not to hurt the hand of the patient for seven days.
And make sure that the food of the patient is limited for some time, while the member is comforted, which makes it easier to heal him.
And have the food given more to about seven or five times and exercise is done with movements. And if it's closed and not softened, then he is already healed.
If the joint is dislocated due to moisture that affects him or for another reason, then make sure to apply a cautery at three locations, according to what was said in the section on cautery in this treatise.
And if all this is done and after seven days the ligament and joint are released but not closed, and the plaster and constraint are reduced over him for some times, but it isn't closed or bound and he can't lift that arm above his parts, then you will realize that the nerves of him, which are at the tip of the muscle, are already cut or stretched or softened, and you'll understand that the joint will never be properly fixed in its place.
And regarding the dislocation of that which is caused from the foot or the breast or behind the parts, the reduction is done with pressure and extension towards the muscles, so it returns.
And another constraint should be applied there, and treat that until it is healed.
And if there is heavy healing in the limb and late recovery of his movements, then the patient uses hot baths until that heaviness is alleviated and returns to its original nature.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
On the treatment of dislocation of the shoulder.
Know that the shoulder joint is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; when it is dislocated in all directions, but especially towards the front and back. The dislocation of it cannot be concealed from you whether you feel its movement or touch it according to any figure it may be dislocated. And when you adjust the dislocated shoulder to its place, this is openly declared by you, for the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm nor touch at all with that its muscle.
And know that with the shoulder bones, reduce the dislocation as soon as it reaches its pit point. If it reaches the pit point, reducing it becomes difficult, and strength is not completely restored; especially when it's towards the back, which is worse than all other types of dislocation, and causing pain, deaths are often brought by that.
And the restoration of it, when this is possible to reduce, is that your hand be extended towards both sides, and your arm be extended, and the doctor's hands are on the shoulder, and you leave it there. And you press the joint against the heels of his hands in turn, or against the base of his palm inside which he turns back into its place.
If the dislocation is towards the front parts, then returns thus that bends his hand to his hand, striking the shoulder inside his palm base.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer strong extension and hard force.
And that is why two ministers extend their arms, and have this support from two ministers so that it does not exceed the extension.
And then have his arm turned around entirely, because it is enveloped in a folded long cloth or blanket.
And when the doctor touches the joint with his hand, apply oil to it so that these causes help in the lubrication of the joint making it easier; and then press the joint firmly from inside until it returns.
And the restoration of it is that it be placed on that bed with stiffness and mobility in the album of hog oil, and be extended in the straightness of the limb, and his arm be hung from the neck, and left for a few days.
And then let it be freed; and therefore if the joint is formed in its place, then you free this muscle from him and leave that.
And if you see the joint is not strengthened, then you reapply the plaster and this muscle, and leave that for a few days until it is extended; and then release that.
And if it happens to you that gravity interferes with the reduction of the joint, and his position is in motion, then apply moisturizing in bath and subtle friction, or compressing, while it is rubbed; or place over the joint, on this greasy part of movement; and then tie it up, and leave him on the bone day and night. And then keep him there, and place him in the bath; and when he is clean, then you rub the joint with tempered friction, and then reapply this oily part of movement over him once, and then again, and thirdly. Corruption has already spread within the stomach's cavity, inside its limits.
And if you wish, place over that wet and scraped hole in the flesh and press on it; and do this several times, where that is moist and reduces to its position.
Chapter XXVIII
On the treatment of dislocation of the elbow, which is the joint between the arm and the hand.
Elbow of the hand is sometimes dislocated, and the reduction of this dislocation is easy, its opposite applies to other joints, but however it must be fast in the reduction when it is dislocated before the point becomes stuck or when a pit point occurs.
And the reduction of this dislocation is that you hold the elbow joint of the hand on a table and have one minister extend his hand, and the doctor pauses his hand or palm over the edge of the joint, and press that until it returns to its place.
And however it must be considered if the palm has already been placed in the belly of the hand, then the patient lays both hands on a table with extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is previous, then the position of the hand of him inherently on the table, so that the doctor's hand falls over that edge of the joint.
And if it returns quickly, it's good; and otherwise, then strengthen that with plaster over the pit point and leave him; and do not repeat this, because otherwise you can neither bear nor control the reduction of it as days pass.
And however the joint is adjusted according to its tortuosity; and you don't notice any cause in the patient, but that the hand is softened and cannot strengthen any cause; then know that the nerves are cut or torn, and there's no use in him except for the reduction with a cautery around it and strength you confer some cause.
And once the elbow has returned, then place upon that plaster which we have used, and leave him strengthened for several days; and then let it be released and left and the hand of him exercised.
If the patient's movements are still restricted and occur with some gravity, then moisten that area with water and perform a few friction movements, during which they feel better.
Chapter XXIX.
On the treatment of dislocation of the fingers.
Some movements cause dislocation of the fingers in all directions.
And when any finger is dislocated towards the two of the palm or towards the belly of the patient, then you move the finger and push back the dislocation with your thumbs, until it returns.
And place your hand on top of the finger, hang that part from which it is dislocated, and leave it for two days.
And suspend that (part), extend that until its length is equal to that one day.
And when it heals at night, continue this according to that narration, and do not cease to slide that (part) during the day and exercise with movements, and continue this at night; and do this for several days until it is straightened.
And do the same as if it is dislocated in the belly of the hand, and leave that towards that part, perform your first operation on this, until it heals.
And similarly do this when it is dislocated in other parts.
Chapter XXX.
On the treatment of dislocation of the hips on both sides.
When it happens to any of the hips on both sides or the neck that a complete dislocation occurs, and if there is much bruising in those areas, then there is no cure for this, as death follows the patient.
And the sign of this is that the evacuation of the patient is outside against his will, and he cannot retain it; or some friction movements soften certain parts of him or two of his legs or both arms, or one of these; or if you rub a hip in its place, then rubbing movements cause the removal of those to four directions.
So it has been rubbed towards the parts behind and it is called glibness.
And the treatment of this is that you then consider whether the glibness occurs in infancy, so there is no cure for it and there is no healing of the whole.
And in those that come by fracture or impact or similar to them, the ancient ways of treatment were said to be long-winded, for which the main point returns to profitability; but I have made it brief from the one that many excuse too much of him, based on my familiarity with his middle exposition, about which I have elaborated and structured this using various tools from him where I show this and expand upon that.
And only those are cured that occur in both properly as I have mentioned.
And that the patient should be laid out on his face with his arms extended close to his sides, and have his legs submerged in water so that they don't get cold.
And place a straight staff in the middle, standing it on the ground near the elbow joint around his head, and another staff at an angle supporting his feet at the other end of the leg.
And let the attendant hold the staff, and do not let it be too loose in a pit; and another attendant holds the other according to that manner.
And wrap around the patient's head and tie on a lion skin tightly; extend the end of the skin to the staff which should be under his head, and lay it there; and tighten the other skin on his buttocks with his legs, and place them in the second staff which is under his feet; and adjust all the skins and lay those there.
And the attendant extends the skin to the junction of the staff, and do not allow the two staffs and the skins at their places where they are placed to become too tight, but rather not as tightly as we have said.
And the doctor places his hands on the hip with strength until it returns, or he places one of them on that side and let's adjust his legs to the table until it returns.
And if it doesn't return in this way, then take a table whose width or length is approximately three arms, and dig into the wall as we said that there is a place near the patient where one can enter from the end of the table. And place the edge of the table on the hip, and the doctor holds his feet at the other end, and streches there until the hip is pulled and returns to its place.
And if you wish, open the circle which is turned in the hand; and that you place on the ground should be head of the patient at the end of the leg two staffs, whose length is one arm, and place his head at the end of the leg symmetrically two staffs; and let there be a distance between each staff as long as one palm, and this has been done in each staff to pull it clockwise, and each should be firmly placed on the ground so that it doesn't move.
And add one more staff around which is the circle, and let it be turned in both grooves of the two staffs.
And at the extremity of this is a vein in which the blood forms, its length being as long as one's hand when it's being stirred; and in the two other veins there's something akin to that.
And reinforce the ligaments that you have tightened in the thighs of the patient in this vein which should be at the head of him, and the ligaments that you have tightened on his hips in this artery which should be at his feet.
And for each joint place an attendant who twists the joints with his hands, and the doctor adjusts the spine according to what we have said.
And when the spine has been returned and the area is adjusted, then coat with a dry poultice made from almond meal, and cover; and place on the poultice until it fills a table of three digits or about that many, and its length should be as much as the area of yellow fat, and over the part of the spine.
And bind it with the ligament that we said, and use the patient to intake subtle nourishment so that they recover.
And if there is any lingering risk at the site of the injury at the end of recovery, then prepare to administer medicines that purify and clean up for a long time after the table has been used, which we have recommended; and already a sheet of lead has been administered in that area.
And some inflammations may occur at the end of the spines of both sides, and it is irritated by that dislocation; and that bone which already inflames so that it should not be assumed that this medicine, which will cause you to suddenly die, should be administered to them.
Chapter XXXI.
On the treatment of a dislocated thigh.
You should know that the joint of the thigh and the joint of the muscle do not require only dislocation, but nothing like what happens to other joints with small movement and curvature occurs to them.
And the joint of the thigh can be dislocated in four ways: it is dislocated towards the inside parts, or towards the outside parts, or towards the front parts, or towards the back parts.
And mostly it is dislocated towards the inside parts, and slightly towards the front parts or towards the back parts.
And the sign of dislocation towards the inside parts is that when you align the healthy leg with the other leg, it becomes longer and the diseased part is more prominent than the healthy one. The patient cannot bend their knee, they have to straighten their leg, this can only be seen in the area where there's inflammation due to heat from a cautery, because by then their thigh bone has already passed here.
And the sign for that which experiences dislocation towards the outside parts is that his accidents are against this incident.
And the sign for that which experiences dislocation towards the front is that he extends his healthy leg as if in a circle, however, it does not bend at the knee where there's pain, and if you try to force him to move forward he can't do it; and his urine is retained and his walking is prevented, and your should have him walk on his toe.
And the sign for that which experiences dislocation towards the back is that he doesn't extend his knee, nor can he bend forward as when he bends over; and his leg is shorter than the other one, and his walking becomes smoother, and the tip of his foot should be in that spot.
The proper reduction of these types of dislocation is that you consider them. If the dislocation is old and has been there for a long time, then when it is already adjusted by your own means in terms of its position, then it should not be reduced completely; thus, do not assume anything from this particular treatment.
For the case where dislocation is recent and belongs to one of the four types of dislocation, then you have to do what reverses the joint, extends it towards inside parts and outside parts, and moves it to the right and left sides; this force returns it without needing any other treatment.
If it doesn't return in this manner, then prepare for strength and extend the leg of the patient from that direction, or on their knees, or under any muscle that's attached above the knee; and another attendant extends his hand upwards to place their fingers over their knees. And reinforce with a ligament over the tendon of the foot, and have another attendant hold onto the end of the ligament.
And if it's extension of the leg or towards inside parts up to the elbow joint, or from behind to the joint of the buttocks, or from back to the joint of the thigh.
And if all these extensions happen at once while lifting their foot from the ground, and it hangs down.
And this type of extension is common to all four types.
And if the dislocation returns as we've said, it is good; and otherwise, then each type requires its own treatment according to its specific procedure.
In the self-reduction process of your own dislocated thigh, if the dislocation is towards inside parts, you should make it bend back on its lateral side; and place ligaments over the tendon of the foot in that area which is between the knee cap and the spot where there's inflammation due to heat from a cautery; and extend the ligament upwards from the part near the elbow joint up to the next joint.
And then another strong minister takes hold of the patient's arms, softens the fatty area of the bad thigh, and extends all parts outward through vigorous extension, so that it returns to its place.
And this method is for a slighter treatment of the limb which is reduced like other methods, but to a lesser extent.
May it be excused if you do not comply with this method of treatment for the whole body, then apply that both feet of the patient are heated at the same time, gently and slightly, on both ankles and both calves.
And let the length of each one be according to the quantity of four fingers, and let the bad leg be extended more than the other by a quantity of two fingers.
And place the bad leg hanging from the head of the staff, and have it in your right hand; let the length of this ground be the quantity of two arms.
And command a strong young man to hold down the head of the thigh, and have it hanging with the bad leg another young man, and the other young man holds up the thigh with great strength, so that the joint returns to its place at speed.
And for the proper reduction, when there is a dislocation outward, apply that the bad leg pushes against the ground as we have prescribed in the warm bath; and strengthen the ligaments over the bad thigh and on its feet.
And place two staffs, one on the foot of the patient and the other on the head; and place adjusted staffs on each side of the buttock with wet cloths wrapped around them, so that the bad leg does not get damp as the staff is between the thighs, because you must extend the parts left outwards without being pulled back.
And for each minister, extend according to their part, and the doctor with his hand encircles the reduction according to art.
And when the dislocation is in the front parts, then let the leg be slightly extended, and as per this half of the narrative on the buttock; and the doctor places the palm of his right hand on the bad thigh, and roughly forces that with the other hand, and through that pressure he keeps that extension to the rear parts at the calf.
And if the dislocation is in the rear parts, then do not let the bad leg be extended to the rear parts, and it's lifted on the ground; having thus place it under a hard cause, as you would for laying when the width of this is dislocated in the front parts, according to how we said about placing him between two widths; and it's over his face and its ligaments are stretched, as we said almost exactly.
And let compression be administered on the table at the place where it lifts the joint.
So when the reduction is completed as described - and the sign of the reduction being not hidden from you, that you extend both thighs of it, and when you equalize those in size and the bad leg extends its thigh and expands that sesamoid, then you know that this part has returned according to what's been done; and then you adjust the two limbs and apply plaster and stretch as much as needed so that no swelling occurs in any parts; and hold back the bad leg for three or four days.
And then untie the plaster, examine it, and compare one thigh to the other.
And when you see those equalities in appearance, then you know that the dislocation has been corrected, and thus allow the bad leg to go.
And if you see any sign of softening, then you return and plaster that again, stretch it according to your first correction, and let it rest for three days.
And then remove that, and have him walk about in both places for some days until he is comfortable.
Chapter xxxii.
On the treatment of dislocation of the buttock.
The buttock is dislocated in three ways: it is dislocated outwardly at the parts, inwardly at the parts, and more outwardly at the parts than inwardly; it is not dislocated at the front parts.
And the sign of dislocation in this is that you command the bad leg to apply its thigh to the buttock; then you know that the buttock is dislocated.
And the restoration of all its ways is that you make the bad leg straight, so that it already extends its thigh, if possible; stick your two hands to his face and pause his foot between your feet; then have another minister apply his buttock against your palms, pull those together with strength between your fingers over his buttock, and have him extend his leg when the buttock returns to its place.
And the sign of restoration is that his thigh sticks to the buttock at rest without effort.
And then plaster that, have the thigh stick to the buttock, and let those rest for one bend for three or four days, and then remove those.
Do not use the patient for walking for a few days, until they are healed and comfortable.
If the reduction of you is justified for me, then administer strength extension from those who in the treatment of the hip have been preceded by narrative.
Chapter XXXIII.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the femur.
The femur is sometimes displaced due to slight force, and in other cases it is displaced according to position, and the displacement of you occurs either internally or externally.
And the sign of the displacement of you is that when you press the femur towards the part where it is displaced.
The treatment of the displacement of you is a minor readjustment; it must be extended with support for your hands and maintained until it returns.
When in the treatment of you when it is displaced according to position, you should make the patient lie straight, have one of those on your legs strong and brave from that part behind both feet at the middle point of him.
And then take your right hand to the top of the patient's foot and your left hand from the lower part of the foot at the place of the cavity.
And then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and from left twice, and extend your left hand; and push the feet of the foot to the right side according to the cavity these work.
And do those two movements as we have discussed.
And then push the feet towards the cavity at the third movement, and you are at the cavity.
So if it returns in one or two movements according to this manner, and if you make the patient lie straight, it's good; and otherwise, then on you perform the operation again, when that has returned.
If for you the reduction of you is prohibited in this manner that we have recommended, then make the patient lie on their back on the ground, and place a piece of wood under them on solid ground, and place it between your thighs, and you have already enveloped around you sheet so as not to move the patient.
And the attendant of you has their thighs ready, and another servant extends their feet with their hands or on a mat that lies over the back of the foot; and extend each attendant against the extension of his pair, and the blanket is lying between the patient's thighs, so that the body of you does not be pulled towards the lower parts opposite to its extension.
And the doctor equalizes the displacement with his hands, and another attendant holds the healthy thigh in the lower parts, where the displacement returns by ease.
And when the displacement returns and its declaration of your health is confirmed with the reduction of you, then pause the plastering and strengthen that by vigorously placing it on wood, and place the foot onto the cavity.
And when you fear or protect from the nerves that are behind on top of the femur, for the muscle over there not to be vigorous and harm that strongly.
And then let him rest for two or three days; and if the muscle is softened, strengthen that.
And then on the third day or the fourth, untie him and prohibit the patient from walking for forty days. If it is forced to go before that space, then there must not be doubt that the displacement will not dissolve and corrupt in him, and anything that does not receive treatment should be avoided.
And if it happens that you get an abscess in the femur, then you should administer according to what preceded our narrative, in another place of treatment and application, until it is healed.
Chapter XXXIV.
On the treatment of dislocation of the fingers of the feet.
Make sure that which is displaced is equal to a little extension of your hands; and what is not difficult, before it is minor.
If the displacement is in some joints of both feet, then you should make the patient lie on their back over a location equal to half of the ground or on a table, and be standing as if they were walking.
And then stand on your feet, place your hand over what you are pressing from the joints, and apply pressure with your foot while bending it within so that it returns; and see that he is already equalized and does not appear in the pressing location.
And then place the abdomen of you with a table that takes all the foot, on which there are two ends, and strengthen it with good structure and firmness for three days; and then untie him and make rest from walking for several days, until he is strengthened and his recovery is assured.
Chapter XXXV.
On the types of displacement that occur from inflammation or from fracture, or at any time.
When any cause of those occurs, and you apply yourself to the treatment of that and in restoring him, several movements follow death.
And do not presume on the treatment of you, but that which is wise in the art, long used, merciful and compassionate; slow, not impulsive or presumptuous; who uses medicines that apply to abscesses alone, leaves the patient to divine judgment, rather than to any other for whom you hope recovery from illness, with alleviation of malaise, and in which you have some hope. And then strive to make such an effort that you reduce him during the beginning of the cause, before it becomes a boil.
And when the member returns according to our wish, then administer treatment which allows for the use of a pointed cautery and care for the wound in such a way that it suits your needs using dry ointments.
And if dislocation is like a fracture and happens in the separated bones, then you perform their surgery, and do it as we have said in the simple diseases of this that were described in those places.
And according to your skill, avoid or guard as you see fit in the midst of fear along the paths that were guided by my teaching; for what is better for you, you should do with your Creator, and more lasting for your glory, and more healthful for your true self, which you will see in your time. Thus ends the words of Al-Bucajim, may God bless them. Amen.
