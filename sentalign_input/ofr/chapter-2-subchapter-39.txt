of the leech in the throat
Sometimes the leech is treated, as I have said in the division, by the application of medicines;
and when that is not effective, then look into the patient's throat in the sunlight, after you have pressed down their tongue with the instrument that I told you about.
And if you see the leech, then pull it out whole with a small hook, or with fine forceps suitable for this purpose.
And if that doesn't work, then take a hollow cane, and put it into the patient's throat, then insert a hot iron into the hollow of the cane, and do this often.
And let the patient abstain from water all day.
Then take a glass full of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it around with his hand often;
and as soon as the leech feels the water, it will fall off.
And if it doesn't fall off as we have said, then fumigate the patient with asafoetida, using the instrument I described in the fumigation of the uvula;
Do this several times, because it will fall off without delay.
And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot containing live coals, and the pot should be covered with a lid pierced in the middle, and in this hole should be the head of the instrument;
then throw your fumigant in it, and the patient puts the end of the tube in his mouth and closes his mouth so that the smoke does not escape, but reaches the leech;
and the leech will fall off immediately, and if it does not fall off, repeat the fumigation several times;
and let the patient be thirsty, and eat salty and sharp things, and do not drink water;
and then it will be necessary that it comes out by this treatment.
And the shape of the instrument with which one extracts the leech, if one can see it, is similar to curved tongs made to enter the throat;
and it has a resemblance to the beak of a snipe, and has a roughness from a file, so that what it grips, it cannot release;
and see here the shape:
