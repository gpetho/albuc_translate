After I have completed for you, Son, this book, which is the last of medical science with its complement, and having finished it from its explanations and declarations, I thought it fitting to complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of surgery, that is, surgery by hand.
Since surgery by hand is laid out in our region and in our time entirely private: until perhaps the science of it has perished, and its track has been lost: and there remain no remains of it except a few descriptions in ancient books which hands have twisted: and it happened to them error and hesitation, until their intentions were closed and their meaning was drawn out: It seemed to me that I would make it clear with this arrangement of this treatise according to the second intention of explanation and declaration and abbreviation: and that I would bring it into being with the forms of tools Cautery, and the rest of the instruments of operation: since it is necessary to add a declaration and proper ownership.
Since therefore the reason for which a good craftsman of this hand is not found in our time, it is: because the art of medicine is long, and it is necessary that its author be exercised before it in the science of anatomy, which Galen narrated, until he knows the joints of members, and their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of bones, and nerves, and ligaments, and counting them, and their exits, and their pulse beats, and quiet, and places of departure.
And for this reason Hippocrates said, A name with a name is much, and with work it is little, and especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already said about that at the beginning of this book.
Since who is not aware that we have said about anatomy, will not be satisfied unless he falls into error, in which men are formed from this science, and boast of it without knowledge or experiment.
What is, because I saw a doctor seize an apoplexy scrofulous in the neck of a woman, and hit some arteries in the neck: why flowed the blood of the woman until she fell dead between her hands.
And I saw another doctor who presumed to extract a stone from the urine, which had stayed for a long time, and the stone was large. So he came to him, and extracted it with a twig of grass. Why the man died on the third day.
And I had already been called to extract it; and I saw from the great size of the stone and the care of the nurse that he would die.
And I saw another doctor who was taking a fee from the Duke of our land for medicine; and it happened that a black eunuch, who was with him, broke his thigh near the heel; and the doctor did not notice this ignorance and bound the break tightly to the shin with strong staples and did not let go of the wound's discharge.
Then he set it right according to his desire. Later on he discharged him after a few days and ordered him not to loosen the bonds; and he remained so until his leg was withered away, and his weight, and came to ruin.
So I was called to him; and I tried to loosen the bonds; and there followed peace, and he was free from his pains.
However, the corruption had already been confirmed in the member; and I could not restrain it.
So then the corruption ceased to walk in the member, until it died.
And I saw another doctor who pierced an apoplexy cancerous; and it was ulcers after days, until the disease of him became evident to his lord.
That is, because when the cancer is pure from the melancholy humor, then it should not be used at all to draw it out with iron unless it is in a member that bears it, so that it may be cut off all of it.
And for that reason, my sons, it is necessary that you know that surgery is divided into two parts: namely, the operation to which health is associated, and the operation with which there is danger in many dispositions.
And I have already aroused, in all places of this book, where an operation has come, where there is fear and alarm.
Why is it necessary for you to be afraid of that, and to avoid it completely: so that they may not hear the loudest word, or become ashamed to speak.
Therefore take a measure with carefulness and protection, and bring the sick among you with ease and firmness, so that by the grace of God for salvation and glorious succession: and remove terrible illnesses from difficult healing: and remove your souls from there, which makes you afraid, so that it may come upon you hesitation in our faith and comfort.
For there is more remaining to our glory, and higher in the world this way: and finally to our numbers.
For Galen has already said in some of his admonitions. Do not treat illness with medicine: do not call yourself a doctor for the worst.
I have already divided this treatise into three chapters.
First chapter.
On the Precaution with Fire, and the Precaution with Acute Medicine, Raw Herbs, and the Arrangement of Tools, and Tools for Cauterization: and everything necessary for an operation.
Second chapter.
On cutting and puncturing, phlebotomy and venesection, and wounds: and extracting arrows, and similar things: and all the chapter, arranged by the forms of tools.
Third chapter.
On restoration, and dislocation, and cure for torsion, and similar things: the chapter arranged from the head to the feet, and the forms of tools.
But before I explain the nature of the operation and its effects, I must discuss the qualities of cautery and non-cauterization and when they should be used on different types of wounds.
I therefore say that the speech about the quality of cauterization and non-cauterization is a long, subtle, learned, and secret speech.
A multitude of wise men also spoke on this matter and disagreed among themselves; however, I will suffice with a few of their words, as I am afraid of repetition.
I say that cautery is applicable to all types of wounds, whether they are deep or superficial, and with or without matter. Except for two types of wounds, which are deep and dry and devoid of matter.
But in the case of warm and dry wounds with matter, they disagreed. Some said that cautery is applied to healing wounds. But others said the opposite, that cautery is not suitable for a disease characterized by heat and dryness, as fire's nature is warmth, and it is contrary to how one heals from a hot and dry illness with warmth and dryness.
And he who spoke against this said: "The application of cautery is appropriate for any hot and dry illness that occurs in human bodies, because when you compare a human body to the elements and its moisture to the element of fire, the body becomes cold.
And I myself say through my own experience: because I have sometimes discovered it for myself.
However, it is not necessary to insist on this point unless one has already proven and practiced in the last exercise of the chapter on cauterization, and knows the diversity of human complexions, the nature of illnesses within them, their causes, and the accidents that occur with them, as well as the timing of these illnesses.
But fear not the residue of poultices upon you: and above all in cold and moist diseases. For all doctors have come to agree about them: and they do not differ in their opinion from Cauthereius on these matters.
And know you sons, that the secret of the cure through cauterization with fire, and its goodness in comparison with medication burned with it, is this: for fire is simple, whose action does not reach, except to the member which is cauterized: and does not hurt another member connected with it, except by a little harm.
But the action of medicine burned does reach to that which is prolonged from the members: and perhaps makes difficult the cure of a hard disease, and perhaps destroys it.
But fire because of its softness and goodness of its substance, does not do this, unless it is in excess.
But that has already become clear to us through experimentation, because of the length of practice and study with skill, and stability on the truth of things: and through it I forgive the length of speech.
And if it were not, for it is not allowed to my book, I would deliver to you the secret and mystery of fire, and the quality of its action in the bodies through its expulsion, which expels diseases through philosophical demonstration by the minds of your own, which are acquired with difficulty.
And know you sons, that they disagree at times when cauterization is to be done, and set a better time for the wound.
And I say that cauterization is appropriate at all times: for the harm that happens because of time is hidden in the cure, which is attracted with cauterization. And above all if cauterization is because of the pains from painful diseases, strong, and feasts which do not tolerate delay: for they fear those things, that evil which is greater than a little harm, which cannot be tolerated through time.
And do not say to you sons, that they do not estimate it, unless the common and stupid doctors: that is, they consider that the disease which is cured with cauterization does not always return: and they set a consequence, and it is not as they think: for cauterization is not, except in place of medicine, which changes complexion, and dries out the humidities which are causes, from which the pains arise.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem valetudinis suae, et virtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et virtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.
Indeed, the cauterization supera But that happens in a few cases.
But the word of the popular, which is that the cauterization is the last resort of medicine, is a wrong statement: for they believe that it is not a cure that is brought about by medicine, nor by any other means after the occasion for cauterization has passed.
But on the contrary, it is precisely because we use means of cure in some diseases and not others that we then apply cauterization at the end: so then it follows that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention that the common people and many doctors understand it.
But the ancient ones said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron: and they did not say that, except for the reason of the equality of the value of gold, and the substance of itself: and they said that it does not leave a place for cauterization. But that is not absolutely true: for I have myself tested that, and found that it does not do so in certain bodies without others.
And the cauterization with itself is good, and better than with iron, as they say. Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.
But verily when you ignite the gold cautery in fire, it is not known to you when it is ignited according to the quantity that you wish, because of the redness of gold: and when it is proper for it to be cold, and if you add it to the top of the ignition, it melts in the fire, and turns into leaves. Why does the craftsman fall from that in occupation: and therefore we make the cautery with iron with us more quickly and closer, from the right to the operation.
And I have already arranged this Chapter in the Cautery, according to chapters: and I have arranged them from the head down to the feet: that you may easily find what you seek out of it.
رأس  رأس
Here is the confirmation of cauterization for the lord of humidity and холодности on the head: which are two causes of salt, and a multitude of flux of humors from the head to the parts of eyes and ears, and a multitude of sleep, and pain of teeth, and pain of throat: and generally all sickness, which happens from coldness, such as paralysis, and salt, and convulsions, and strokes, and similar things from sickness.
The method of cauterization is, that you prescript to the sick: that he may be drained out in the first place with a solution medicine, which purifies the head, three nights, or four, according to what requires the virtue of the nurse, and his age, and custom.
Then prescript to him, that he make his head radiant with a razor. Then make him sit between your hands square, so that he has placed his hands on his chest.
Then place the root of your palm on the root of his nose between his eyes. So then whatever your middle finger touches, mark that place with fire.
Then the fire cautery: which has this form.
Then place the wound on the marked spot with the caustice, descent, so that your hands are slowly constricted, and you rotate it. Then quickly put your hand on it, and look at the place.
That if you see already detected from the bone amount of salt, or amount of garlic, then quickly put your hand. And if not, repeat your hand with the iron, or with another from him if it is cold: until you see the bones that I told you.
Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and dip it into the cotton ball, and place it on the spot: and let go for three days.
Then place over the wound cotton dipped in butter, and let it go on the spot, until the fire scar is destroyed. Then care for that with the four-ingredient ointment, until healed.
I have already said, that while the wound remains open, it will emit pus: why is better and more beneficial to be cleaned.
And some of them said, that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone: and hold the cautery, until a certain hardness of bone is burned.
Then it is sharpened after that which has been burned from the bone, then oiled.
And others say that the cautery should be applied to the last place, until it impresses on the bone an impression of a forking, so that the bone is made as the form of a fork: or with an instrument that women put in a little vessel of ink: and they estimate, that from this place emit vapours of the head's smell, and the open wound should be left for a long time.
Then oil, until it is hardened.
But I do not know these two kinds of cautery at all if they are not used by some people out of fear.
Then let go of it, for me it is better with the health of it.
For the head is weakened by the solution of its natural continuity: as we have testified in the other members: and above all when the head is weak and feeble in nature: and the species of the cautery is first of all more preserved and better with me, and I use it: so operate when it is healthy.
Of the way of cauterizing the head, when it is in pain throughout all the head.
When in the whole head there happens to be a chronic pain: and it is prolonged in a person who is ill, and uses honey, and broths, and head-purges, and oils, and employment with the hand. And especially if it has been cauterized once by one that we have described, and gives no benefit from those: then consider. For if the head is strong of its natural creation, and is not weak, and finds a cold sensation severe: then cauterize with another cautery below it a little. Then cauterize itself on all the horns of its head with its own cautery, and let not the skin be drawn off, and let a quantity be revealed from the bone, which we have described. And cauterize itself with one cautery in the backend of its head, in the place which is called a vas; and it is a place in which is placed a flowing [one]: and wash your hair well in this, and do not reveal the bone. For the weak one finds, on account of that severe pain, and is separated from the pain of the other parts of the head.
And I will call this Cautery in its place: and it must be that it is a cautery, whereby the horns of the head are cauterized, and the backend of the head, subtler by a cautery, whereby the middle of the head is cauterized.
Head IV.
When a pain and swelling occurs in the part of the head, or the pain extends to the eye, and the head is washed with medications that clear it, and the remaining treatment is given, as I have said in the division of illnesses, and this does not include everything, then cauterization in it is according to two methods: either cauterization with an acute medicine burning; or with iron.
But cauterization with an acute medicine burning is, if you take a tooth of another person, and chop it up, and cut off the ends from the two sides. Then cut the place of pain at the time with a phlebotome on the side, until it becomes in it a place under the skin, where the knot is captured.
Then introduce it into him under the skin, until it is hidden: then tie it over it with a little knot of constricting thread, and let go of it for fifteen hours, and then dissolve it, and take out one more, and let go for two days, or three: then put on it a cotton pad immersed in butter, until a pus place forms: then care for the wound with ointment until it heals.
And if you want to do this with certain medicines that burn, which I wrote in the twelfth book, On Burning Medications.
But cauterization with iron is according to this method: The fire cauterization, whose form is this one:
And it is called a 'clauis'; because the form of the head is like the form of a 'clauis', in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small eminence.
Then put the iron on the place, and hold your hand: and you turn the iron slowly with speed; and let be the amount that burns due to the thickness of the skin, like half of it. And you turn your hand so that it does not burn any artery that is below, and happens to run blood.
Then dip the cotton pad in saline water, and put it on the place, and let go for three days: then dip the cotton pad in butter: then care for with ointment until it heals.
And if you see, cauterize this half-headache with extreme knife-slashing cauterization second Cauterio. And do not heal the arterial incision in this half-headache, but properly old.
§ The mode of cauterizing in ancient half-headache.
When you treat a headache, with this that we have said from the previous cure, and that we have said in the divisions of ailments, and there is no cure: and you see from sickness that it is not sufficient for him what we have said from the first cauterization with medicine, or with cauterization with fire, then it is necessary to use the fire of cauterization by a knife, until it becomes white after the marks on the place of pain with a line, whose length is half a finger, or almost like that: and set your hand down with force, and squeeze it until you touch the artery, and reach all the way to the jaw.
However, it is necessary for you, so that you cauterize the continuation of the jaw, which moves during chewing, so as not to be damaged on the side, or the nerve that moves it, from which a spasm occurs.
And be over guard, and care about the flow of blood of the artery, which has been cut off. For there is a fear in the disconnection, and especially to him who does not know that which he does, and is not studious, nor expert: and dismisses the operation with the first.
And I come with a reminder of the regimen of the flow of blood from the artery according to its way, and in its place in this book.
That if you see from sickness that this cauterization is not sufficient for him, and you see the body tolerating cauterization in the middle of the head, as we have told, heal the wound, until it heals.
And if you see, administer the cauterization, which we have said in the chapter on extracting the artery with a cauterizer having two knives. For cauterization is better and more helpful in this regard.
The way to cauterize ear pain.
When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and is cured with hot things, and the remaining cure as we have said in the division, and the pain does not disappear, then cauterization with fire: and this is what is called a point, whose form is this.
Then the points with it after its igniting around the whole ear, as it resolves: or around each side, if the pain is simultaneous in both sides. And lengthen it with the cautery a little from the root of the ear, after you have marked the places with the causticum: and the quantity of the cautery is ten points in all the ear, and almost the same.
Then cure the place, until it is healed.
The way to cauterize in torture.
Chapter VII.
Torrence which is cured with cauterization, is not excepting species which occur from the mucus, according to what we have said in the divisions of diseases.
And distant cauterization of the species which occurs from drying, and spasm of a nerve.
When you cure this species of torture with hyssop, and the headpurges, and gargarisms, and your cure does not help, then you should cauterize the sick three times: one near the root of the ear, and a second a little lower than its place, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
And put your cautery on the opposite side of the weak part. Since softening does not occur, unless in the part which appears healthy.
And the form of the cautery is, so that it cauterizes itself with the cautery in the direct extremity of the upper ear at the top of the head a little bit: and another in the time: whose length should be according to the length of the thumb. And place your hand with the cautery, until half the thickness of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of cautery, and it is a kind from the knife, whose form is mentioned above: verily, however, it is not much more subtle than that, as you see; and it is necessary that the knife be slightly less bulky.
Then take care of the place with it where it preceded: until it heals.
§ On the method of cauterizing in ancient apoplexia.
When apoplexia is old, and take care of it with what we have said, and your medicine does not benefit him, and the sick person has no fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on all the horns of his head, and a cautery in the middle of his head, as we have said, and a cautery at the back of his head, according to what preceded: and the mode of cauterizing is according to what preceded.
Also cauterize with the cautery on the mouth of the stomach: and it is more last.
Then take care of it with what followed.
CHAPTER IX.
It is necessary that he drink a great deal of wine in the first hour of sickness, and pills to clean the brain.
Then shave the whole head, and put on the back of his head an unguent made from sage described in the book about unguents: and put it on him sometimes.
This, however, is the method of cauterizing: and make it according to the same order which we have said there.
But if he heals by that, it is good. But if not: then do three cauteries on the back of his head, which descend from the upper part of the head to the lower part of the eye: and put a little bulkiness between each cautery.
Then take care of the cauterization with what preceded.
But if you want to add something, and the sick person can bear that: then do a cautery in the middle. If you want to add it: then cauterize himself on two horns.
Then take care of the wound, until it heals: and then apply olive oil according to the above form, which was mentioned before.
De mode cauterizando in paralisi, et mollificatione.
Chapters: 10. On cauterizing and softening with respect to paralysis.
It is necessary that you should proceed in the purification of the head with fire, and with what we have said.
Then wash the head with milk; then cauterize himself with the cautery in the middle of the head, and with the cautery on all the horns of the head, and with the cautery on the posterior part, and with three cauteries on the three bends of the neck.
But if you are not able to endure the purification of the body in many cases, and if you are weak at endurance, and the disease is strong: then cauterize himself with four cauteries on the bends of the back, and the last one with a cautery, until it burns through his skin a lot, and wash your hand. Then take care of the wound, until it heals: and then apply olive oil in this way.
On the mode cauterizing in epilepsy.
The epileptic person should not be cauterized unless his epilepsy is due to phlegm.
Therefore it is necessary that you should purify his brain first with fire, and with the other cure which we have mentioned in the division: when the disease is strong, or endurance is weak in the reception of medicines.
But if he is a boy who does not endure medicines, then administer gargarisms and chewing which purify the brain before those days with many good foods.
Then wash the head of the boy; then cauterize himself with one cautery in the middle of his head, according to the above mode: and with another cautery on the back of his head, and over all the horns of his head. If he is strong and has endurance, then cauterize himself with the cauteries which we have mentioned in having paralysis and softening of the body on the bends of the neck, and on the bends of the back: and let the olive oil be applied according to the above mode.
If however the boy is ill, then put a subtle cautery, in this way.
§ On the mode of cauterizing in melancholy.
When the cause of melancholy is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, then cauterize him with cauterium, which we have said in having paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of hidden conditions leading to melancholy, and his body is weak and damp, then give him in a drink what will clean his brain, according to what preceded in division: Then scrub his head, and then make after a careless fashion from linen, like a circle.
Then put it in the middle of the head: and the sick man, sitting, should hold himself at a distance from all sides.
Then present the liniment. And it is worthy of being made from old butter. And heat him over a moderate fire, the amount that he can bear when he enters it. Then evaporate him in the middle of his head in a circle, and let him go until he is cold.
Do this to the sick one once a week, with the rest of his treatment, until he is healed.
Or if you want, cauterize him by making small dots on his body, except that you hold your hand with the cautery: but let it smell.
This species of cautery moistens the brain with its quality.
Then put over him a damp cloth immersed in butter, or in chicken fat.
§ On the mode of cauterizing in descending water to the eye.
Head XIII.
When you perceive the beginning of water in the eye by the signs which I have spoken of in division, then begin and drink up the sick person, with what will clean his head.
And keep him away from all humors, and make him sit in a bath, on a few days' fast.
Then you shall order him to shave his head, and to cauterize himself in the middle of his head. Then you shall order him to cauterize himself on both temples with two cauterizations, if the infection is in the descent of water into both eyes at the same time: or from one side, if the infection is in water in one eye: and cut off with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the skin: and let the cauterization be long in width of the temples: and let it be careful of the flow of blood.
If you see anything of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and in the cutting off of them, and in the caution about the flow of blood.
And when he is cauterized in his beard, between two bones, with two cauterizations at the end.
The way of cauterizing in ancient tears.
When the tears of the eyes are ancient, perseverant, and are on the veins, and the arteries that are on the outside of the head, it is certain that it is from the excess of cold, phlegmatic humor: then cauterize with the same cautery that I mentioned in the descent of water, cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauterizations on both temples, and two cauterizations in the beard between two bones. And if you don't mind adding a little more, then cauterize him on all sides, carefully in the eye, at the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
The way of cauterizing in the naso-pharyngeal Foetor.
When you are treating it, with the same medicine that I mentioned in its division, and it does not benefit from medicine: then be quick, and give him three cups of milk-and-sour soup over three nights: then shave his head, and cauterize himself with a cautery in the middle, with an oil-cauterization. Then cauterize him with two claues of cauterium, over two eyebrows under hair a little.
And guard the artery, lest you strike it.
And this is the form of the cautery claues.
The mode of cauterizing in softening the eyelids:
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by sickness or moisture: then cauterize the eyelid with one clauis of cautery, with this cautery of the moon.
And if the eye is affected with a pimple: then cauterize him with two claues of cautery, in all parts: and they are stretched from both sides: and let the length of every cautery be according to the length of the eyelid: and do not move your hand with the cautery after it has been applied, but according to the quantity that is burned, thirdly, palpebrae inter se.
The mode of cauterizing the eyelid when the hair are turned towards the eye, pricking it:
The cautery is in two ways: either with fire: or with burning medicine.
In the cautery, if it is with fire, command the patient before it, so that he loses his hair, if he is of those who clean them, until they are lengthened and made even. If it pricks him by his root: then squeeze the eyes of the patient with witty, so that they do not move, until they are closed.
When they are then closed and made even, put the head of the patient in your lap: and then sign it on the eyelids of his eyes with encausticum, a sign that it is according to the figure of the leaf of myrrh: and let the beginning of the sign be near the hair.
Then put a cotton wisp dipped in albumen or in silken yarn on the eye.
Then fire to the cautery, whose form is this.
Then he cauterizes on top of the figure, which you have marked little by little on many pieces, until the surface of the skin is burned, which is like a figure of a bay tree leaf, all apparent in itself.
And the mark of your work is health: if you squeeze the eyelids of the eye and make the hair grow near the eye when you cut it.
So bless your hand then: and dismiss them from the tribes after a few days.
Then put on top of the wound honey with butter, until the scar is eradicated. Then care for the wound with ointment, until it heals.
That if any of the hairs return after an hour, and softens the eyelid: then repeat the cauterization on that place, as you did in the first instance.
But if the hairs are in the lower part: then cauterize it until it returns to its natural place: and adjust so that the eye hairs do not sting.
It is as you order to the sick person, that he should let go of his hair, until it grows long and even. Make in the shape of a bay tree leaf out of paper.
Then take from the known soap, and from the non-imbibed stone of a pound or so: then dry it all at once with good shaking, and make it with haste, so that it does not freeze. Then from this itself on the paper which you made as a bay tree leaf shape, and place it on the eyelid of one eye or two. And place under the eye Cotum imbibed in albumen of egg: and let the head of the patient lie in your lap.
And place your finger index on the medicine, and press it slightly on the wound. And you make him frown whenever he feels the medicine's tingling: for its tingling is like fire.
While he persevered in this which he found out by the tingling of the medicine, then dismiss the medicine, and frown it with your finger. When the wound has ceased bleeding, then remove the medicine, and wash the eye with water.
And consider then, if you see the eyelid raised up, as it were, on account of heat, or on account of incision, it is well: and if not, then repeat again upon the same place from the medicine, in which it does not impress, and does not harm, until your operation is accomplished, and the eye is contracted.
Then put on the eye, with butter, until the skin of the wound has been dried up. Then take care of the eye with a diaphanous ointment, or with another, until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, when you are performing the operation, to keep the last guard, that nothing of the medicine may fall into the eye.
That if the eyelid is softened after days, and fights with some hair in the eye, then repeat again the medicine upon that place, which is softened from the eyelid itself, as you did in the beginning. Then take care of the eye, until it is healed.
And this is the form of the balm of Myrrha.
And you should know that the eyes of men differ from each other in size and shape. Therefore, according to this, let your consideration be: and let not the straightness of that eye be concealed, which is the object of this art.
The mode of cauterizing in the naso-lacrimal fistula.
When you are treating the fistula, with regard to what we have said about the various kinds of diseases, and your treatment is not successful: then you should cauterize it in this way.
Direct the patient to place his head in your lap, and hold it between your hands so that it does not move or shake with its own head.
Then put on the cow dung infused with alums or psyllium mucus upon the eye: and then set fire to the cautery, of which form I have spoken.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit cauterium: et si vis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si vis sit sursum sic tenta.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit cauterium: et si vis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si vis sit sursum sic tenta. Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.
Then express the tube, if it is open, and remove the pus from it, and dry it up: and if it is not open, then open it, and remove the pus from it.
Then put on then over it the cautery, which is set well alight.
And hold with it your hand somewhat near to the cautery from the eye, towards the nose side, so that your hand does not move or shake: and you place the cautery in the fat of the eye, and destroy it.
If then you see any pus at first of your cautery up to the mouth, it will be good. And if not: then apply again the cautery once or twice, if you can bear it: and let go that trio days.
Then put on a poultice with butter, and heal it with a drying ointment, until it is healed up.
That if it remains longer than forty days and is not healed: then put on over it a sharp corrosive medicine, until the mouth appears: and trim it according to what comes out of its chapter.
And there is another way of the cautery of the tube, which some said first. Then turn to the tube place, and find it: then put into it a small hole, i.e., a thin cannula, whose shape is this. And pour into it a quantity of liquid lead, and hold your hand with the cannula firmly, so that the sick person does not move at all, so that he does not run away, or let the liquid lead come to his eye.
It is necessary that you put on an ointment of eye cotum infused in albumen, or in water.
Lead indeed burns the place of the fistula, and it cures with a marvelous cure.
If the fistula is cured, along with what we have said from the Cânon, and the cure, is good. And if not, then it is necessary to administer a hole of the nose, and reduce the fistula to the course of the nose, according to which it comes in its own place.
Mode of cauterizing in fissures of the lips.
Often a fissure occurs in the lip, which is called a pilus, and especially in the lips of boys.
When you are curing these fissures, along with what we have said in the division of diseases, and there is no cure, then a small spark of fire, cut with a knife, according to this form.
And let it be placed according to the subtlety of the knife.
Then place the ignited piece quickly in the pits of the fissures, until it reaches the depth of the fissures.
Then cure the piece with cerate, until it is cured.
Mode of cauterizing in the fistula of the mouth.
If there is one in the parts of the mouth, which are called fissures, especially in the subambulatorio of the mouth, which begins to grow old, and especially in boys, with that emission, which either walks or throws itself, then place a small spark of fire, cut with a knife, in the pit: And let it burn, and break out, and then dry up, and run pus, and form a fistula: Then cure that, and there is no cure for it, then you must place the fires of cauterization according to the quantity, which it takes into the fistula. Then introduce the ignited piece into the pit of the fistula, and hold your hand, until it reaches the depth of its last part: And make it once or twice.
Then the care of himself after that, as far as we said about curing oneself.
If therefore the pus is cut off and he heals, it will be good. And if not, then it is necessary to remove the place, and take away the rotten bone according to what will come out in his head.
De mode of cauterizing in gingivae, and with teeth softened.
When the gum is softened through moisture, and the teeth are loose, and the disease is with medicines, and does not give: then put the head of the patient on your lap.
Then the fire-cauterium, whose shape comes after these things, so that you put the Cannula on the tooth: and introduce the ignited cautery with haste: and hold your hand somewhat, until the sick one feels the heat of the fire already reaching the root of the tooth.
And wipe your hand: then repeat the cautery a few times, according to what you want.
Then fill the mouth of the patient with salt water, and hold it for an hour: and spits it out.
For the teeth motion is secured, and the gum which is softened is tightened, and the moisture of the corruption is dried.
The mode of cauterizing in toothache.
When the pain of the tooth is through cold, or there is coldness within, or itching, and the disease does not give with medicines: then the fire-cauterium is in itself according to two ways: either with butter-cauterium: or with fire-cauterium.
The cautery of the latter is as follows: to take butter fat, and heat it up, and make it bubble, and pour it into an ear-ring or a probe. Then take a cotton-wool, and moisten it with the butter, and put it on the tip of the finger. Then dip the finger into the melted butter: and hold the finger quickly on the painful tooth, and hold it until it begins to burn: then repeat it a few times, until the power of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, submerge the thread, or wrap it in cold butter, and place it on the tooth that hurts; and place iron that has been heated on top of it, until the fire penetrates to the depth of the tooth cavity.
But if you want to cauterize it with fire, so that you can see towards the windpipe, or towards the iron pipe. And sit in his body some grease, so that the keenness of the fire does not reach the mouth of the sick person.
Then take hold of the cauterizing fire, whose form has come; and place it on that tooth: and hold your hand, until the cauterization cools down.
Do this sometimes, for the pain will be relieved, or do it on the same day, or on another day.
And it is necessary to press the cauterization into the impression, so that it fills the sick person's mouth with good butter, and holds it for an hour: then let him spit it out.
This is the form of the cauterization.
Cauterize with any part of the body as much as possible: and this is the form of the tube.
The mode of cauterizing in strumlies.
When the strumlies are in the phlegm, and from cold liquids, and do not submit to the digestion through medicines, and wish to speed up their digestion: then take hold of the carefully prepared fire, whose form is this.
It has two open ends, so that the smoke from the fire comes out of one end of cauterization: and place the burning iron on the sore once, and again if you can tolerate it, until it reaches the depth of the sore.
That if the sore is small: then place the cauterization according to the quantity of the sore.
Then let him be away for three days, and place cold butter over the sore, until the burning fire is relieved.
Then take care of the tooth with dental ointment, until it heals in the form of a tube.
In the case of a hoarse voice due to chronic cough and difficulty swallowing.
When there is a buildup of secretions above the lung canal, and especially when this is accompanied by a cold complexion, then it is necessary to drain the sick person with medicines as soon as possible.
Then cauterize the throat at the root of the cough in a depressed place: and be cautious, so that you do not apply the cautery to the throat or skin without something to protect it.
Then cauterize the throat with another cautery at the joint of the neck in the last place of the spine, lastly: and let the cautery be a nail-claws, according to the manner, which precedes.
Then take care with him who preceded, until he is healed.
The method for cauterizing in lung diseases and coughs:
When cough and lung disease are caused by cold humidities, and the sick person does not have a fever or tuberculosis, and the illness is old: then cauterize the throat with two cauters above the jaw in depressed places, gently, carefully. And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between two breasts: and let the cautery be a tube, according to the manner which preceded.
And if you wish to make your cauterization by pricking with the cautery, which is called a Punctio, whose form preceded in the pricking of the pains of the ears: and let there be pricks from twenty to almost thirty.
Then take care with him who preceded, until he is healed.
And now let there be a cautery having three branches: according to this form. Why does the cauterization with him allay when you do with him three cauterizations.
Head:
When the assistant's head has become wet due to its dislocation, and it does not return to its place within an hour of its displacement, unless it is accustomed to that return; and then it is displaced by a slight movement, which we have already testified to that, then it is necessary to reduce the dislocation as soon as possible. Then the sick person is turned over onto his back, or onto a sound side. Then massage the skin, which is inside the thumb of your left hand: and if it has come loose from within.
Then take the cautery, which has two points. Whose shape is this.
Then cauterize the skin, until it penetrates to another side, and the figure of the cauterization is made with four cauteries.
And when the cauterization is made with a cautery having three points, why is the figure of the cauterization then six smaller cauteries: and the points are according to the delicacy of the tendon.
And this is the form of the cautery having three points.
And when one of these is added in this way, why are there then eight cauteries.
Then place on the cautery fine ashes with salt. Then make the sick one rest until he or she is completely still, so that no limb moves at any time, until comforted.
And if the dislocation is to the top, and it rarely happens, then cauterize him on the shoulder with a claw cautery, or with many points by puncturing.
For the joint is secured, and moisture is dried up: and the sick one is healed.
The way to cauterize the stomach.
When things happen in the stomach that are cold and wet, until they have taken the stomach out from under its skin, and the secretions increase to it, and the methods of treatment become many and uneffective: then let the sick person be turned over onto his back, and extend his or her legs, and stretch his or her hands. Then cauterize with three cauteries, with a claw cautery the size of a finger at the bottom of the breastbone, and two cauteries below on each side, making a triangular figure. And lengthen between the two so that they do not join together when they form pus.
And let the depth of the incision be two-thirds the thickness of the skin.
And let the form of the incision be according to this shape without addition: and if the eye is to be cauterized with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this shape: and let the cautery which is made thus be one according to the shape of a circle according to this shape.
And let the stomach be cauterized by touching it where it is to be touched by this cautery: and it is so, as to the quantity, which you want with a caustice: then cauterize it with the same cautery; then care for it with the cure which preceded until it is healed.
§ On the way of cauterizing the cold part.
When it happens in the liver that there is pain from cold and moisture, or from a thick wind, until it emerges from its skin by natural exit of excess fluid, and the sick person is cared for with what we have said, and does not benefit in him: then it is necessary that the sick person lie down on his back on his skin, and sign with the caustice three cauteries according to this shape, and the same quantity above the lowerスパ, from where the man's bed reaches: and let there be a space which is what is between every cautery according to the thickness of a finger: and let the cautery be according to the length of the body straight: and do not squeeze your hand much with the caustice.
And let the quantity which is to be burned from the thickness of the skin, half of its quantity without addition: and let the sick person stand on his feet.
If he is not standing, then let him lie down, who has already extended his legs and raised his arms.
This is the form of the caustice.
And it is also possible for you, when you have a small knife with you, that you cauterize this caustice with a knife, when you are with subtlety and wisdom in the art.
And guard yourself, so that you do not proceed in the cauterization, and burn the thickness of the skin all at once, since it burns the whole body, and arrives at the intestines: for the skin is there subtle, so you know that one.
To cauterize the aploms of the liver.
If an exit is present and you want to know whether it is an aploma of the liver or of its membrane (peritoneum), then if it is in the liver, you will notice that the pain is weak and there is no sharp pain; and if it is on the membrane of the liver, the pain is very sharp: and you will see that the doctors' treatment has weakened them.
Then the patient should lie on his back. Then, with a caustic, draw out the shape of the aploma  (if it is in the liver): and then light the caustic with fire so that it is absorbed by radiation. And this is its form. And cauterize it with one caustic, until the skin is all burned up and reaches the nipple   (liver), then take care of the patient's cure for exitulatory wounds, until he is healed.
And it is not necessary that this caustic be used only by those who have extended their studies in the art of medicine: and since, through this procedure, some illnesses have sometimes been cured with experience  , then one should dare to perform such an operation.
However, if you want to let go of it, in my opinion it is better not to do so.
On the method of cauterizing in the pleurisy.
The ancients said that with root of aristolochia caustics applied to the pleurisy  (cold pleurisy) in this way: And it is as follows: when you receive the dry root of aristolochia   (long root that can be found in it), and make it as large as a finger   (long, thick root): Then immerse it in oil: and set it on fire. Then cauterize it with one caustic in it that is between the rib and the neck    (furcula), and two small ones slightly below the angle towards the side that is under the beard.
And two cauterizings also in him, which is between the fifth and sixth ribs falling back a little: and a cauterizing another in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach. And three cauterizings from behind: one in him that is between two blades; and two cauterizings from the two sides of the chest, lower cauterizing which is between two blades.
And it is not necessary that you should compress your hand with the cautery, but let it be in the open skin smelling.
And some ancient men said that from men who use a cautery of similar iron radius: and set it on fire, and put it in him that is between ribs until it comes to the same as the apostema, and the pus comes out: as we have said in the apostema of the liver.
But in this piercing with the cautery there is fear, that either the weak one dies at once, or a fistula happens to the place, which is not healed.
§ On the way of cauterizing the Spleen Head XXXII.
When you are curing the disease of the spleen, with him that we have said in the division of diseases, and your cure does not give, then cautery is in it according to three ways, which are all right.
Of which one is that you make three cauterizings, or four lining according to the length of the spleen according to the figure of the Epatis cauteries, whose precursor was the figure.
And let there be a quantity of roughness between every cautery as much as a finger's breadth, or more little.
And let there be a way of the cautery, which we have said in the cauterizing of the liver equally.
And do not compress your hand with the cautery: and let the sick one be lying on his back.
And the way of another cauterizing is: that it has two hot wires, which we have said in the chapter on shoulder dislocation: and let go of the skin, which is in the direct spleen, where the cubitus goes to the left nurse: and let your lift up go up according to the width of the body, so that the cauterizings fall according to the length of the body.
Then introduce two hot irons strongly, until you pierce with them the skin from one side: then remove the iron; so there are four cauterizations.
And if you wish to cauterize with another iron having three irons, too.
Then take care that the cauterization is done after having sent away the pus for many days: for each part which has been treated before, takes more time to heal.
De mode cauterizing in Hydropsis.
The cautery does not fall in Hydropsis unless it is properly elevated.
When you treat a Hydropic patient with the modes of treatment which we have spoken of in connection with division, and when there is no healing, then you should cauterize the umbilicus four times, one cautery above the stomach, one above the liver, one above the spleen, two behind the spine between the vertebrae, one on the right side at the base of the heart, and one on the left side at the base of the stomach: and the depth of the cautery should be proportionate to the thickness of the skin.
Then remove the open cautery so that it can discharge pus after a long time.
And do not leave the sick person unhealed after cauterization, because there are two purposes to be served: and he will quickly recover with the help of God.
The form of the cautery when the abdomen is cauterized, should be a tube: second, because it precedes in form; and its shape when the back is cauterized, should be an oval, because it precedes in form.
De mode cauterizing of the Feet and Legs.
When they are bed-ridden and filled with yellow water, you should cauterize the back of the foot in the space between the auricular and the lateral bone, which is under the thumb: and stretch your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then stretch your hand again, and do not turn the cautery at all.
For this reason water should be yellow, and the cautery should be of this shape.
Then, two cauterys should be made on the two legs, and a knife-like cautery should be made at the end of each cautery: and one cautery should be made along the length of the leg, one under the knee, and the other below it, about halfway down the leg: and two cauterys should be made on all the hip: and do not leave the open cautery without care for a long time, so that it heals over from it some water: then take care of himself with the rest that we have said.
The way to cauterize in the solution of the belly.
Chapter XXXV.
When this solution of the belly has weakened the protective powers and digestive power which are in the stomach and intestines: and cure it with the methods of curing, and it does not heal: and you will see that it tolerates the cauterization of great power, then cauterize it itself with a large cautery over its own stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circular cautery and four subtile cauteries around the navel, and a cautery above the liver with an edge: and a cautery above the loins with one or two cauteries.
And if you see moisture emerging and the body tolerating it, then cauterize it itself with a cautery over the chest, and a cautery over all the pelvis: and perhaps you should add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach.
For this cure is successful, whose power does not fail.
The way to cauterize Hemorrhoids.
Chapter XXXVII.
When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, or one, and they are of thick humors, cold, or corrupt humors, and the cure with that which we have said in the division, and it does not produce a result: then cauterize three cauteries on the lower part of the back under an egg-shaped triangle, and a cautery below the navel almost like two fingers.
And if you think that his stomach is cold and his food is not digested, and you see a pale face, then cauterize him over the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded: and cauterize over his spleen, and another over his liver, with a cautery clamped; and let go the cautery opened at some time: then take care of him until he is healed.
Chapter XXVII.
When you are cutting off the patient's organ, then you set fire to the cautery so that it burns by radiation. Then introduce the patient' s organ that has been cut off, and with your last hand, before the cautery reaches the opening of the stomach from which blood flows, once or twice.
If then there are many organs, then cauterize each one separately, as we have described. Then take care of them while he puts the ointment on them, until they are healed.
And if you cauterize him with a large cautery over his throat, it is more final in its effect.
The mode of cauterizing the fistula in the anus.
Chapter XXVIII.
When the patient does not submit to the incision and operation that we have described in his place, and shudders at it, perhaps he will be healed with the cautery.
When then happens to someone that there is a fistula, and it has become old, pus flows out of it, and corrupted moisture. It is therefore fitting that you should test it with a subtle attempt. Then know the depth of its extent with your attempt.
Then set fire to the cautery, which is like radiation. Then introduce yourself with the burning end in the fistula and measure the quantity in which it enters by the clamp.
And repeat the cautery on it, until all the corrupted bodies are burnt out, once, or twice, or three times, according to the need.
And I will keep you safe from the heat of the sun, if there is one, or from the great blood vessels: or if a fistula has opened into the body of the bladder, or into the body of the intestine, then I will keep you safe from these places everywhere.
And do not make this unless a fistula is in a fleshy place: and think, for it does not pierce.
Then care for the place until it has healed.
But if the place is sealed, and the materials have been cut away from it, and it remains like this for a long time: then you shall know that it has now healed completely.
And if it is not cut away from it by the materials, then you shall know that it is penetrating, or its opening is deep within it, or almost like it from among those: of which there is a memory in its own place.
The way to cauterize Renes.
When it happens in the kidneys that pain comes from cold, or from gross wind, and it lingers because of that, then you should cauterize the same above the skin on top of the kidneys, cautery on each kidney with cautery of the claw, whose reminder came first.
And perhaps we cauterized that within itself second time in itself almeidatum. Why are there three lines? So they will be more last in the bonding.
The way to cauterize the Vesica.
When it happens in the Vesica that weakness, and softening from cold rain and moisture, until it does not retain the weak urine, then cauterize it in the lower part of the supply on top of the Vesica, where the hairs begin to interweave, and cautery from the right supply, and another from its left: and let the length of that cauterization be according to the measure of the thumb knuckle: and cauterize it with cautery on the lower back, or two cauteries if you can bear it: and let it follow the reminder of the previous cauterization with the claw.
If the wound is deep, cauterize the matrix.
When cold and moisture occur in the womb, and it is forbidden by this means from impregnation, and her menstrual fluids are corrupted, and their procreation is delayed, and she experiences pain at the arrival of her visitors, then it should be cauterized with three cauterizations around the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the vagina, and a cauterization below the back on the skin, or two cauterizations: and let the cautery sit.
De modo cauterizandi matricem.
When the mucous membranes exude moisture towards the vagina, and it becomes a cause of exit from its place: and its sign is that the skin prolongs on one side when they face each other: and the site of the dislocation is found in it vacant.
Therefore it should be that the sick one is cauterized over the vagina with a similar circle of the caustic: after which you mark with the caustic around the opening, as it turns: and that it falls in the middle of the circle.
That if this caustic is not present with you, then you should cauterize it with three caustics, with a large oily caustic: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the quantity of its thickness of the skin of all.
Then care for the one, until he is healed.
The mode of cauterizing in sciatica:
When pain occurs in the vagina, and it is a cause of its coldness and moisture: and the sick one is cured with it, as we have said in the division, and the cure does not benefit him, and it becomes old: then it should be that you remove the sickness from gross humors with foetid pills, or with artificial pills, and similar. Then he cauterizes it.
And the method of cauterization in it is according to two ways: either with medicines that are applied, or with fire.
Either with fire, which is according to many ways.
Of which one is, that he cauterizes over a piece of salt of his own body with three triangular cautery tools, according to this form. And make them a good depth, or a bad one. And there is a space that is between each cautery of the quantity of the finger's thickness: and let the cautery be oil.
When it is made a cautery in the middle on top of the head of his own body. Why are there four cautery tools?
And if you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose preceding form was in the cauterization of dislocation of his own body, one: so that the circle contains all the body.
And burn the thickness of the skin of all.
This is the method of cauterization in the sciatic nerve when the pain adheres to his own body, and does not extend until the hip and the leg.
But if it extends until the hip and the leg, then he cauterizes himself with two cautery tools on top of the hip, in the place where the pain injures, in which there is a pain, and his own cautery tool on top of the nail of the little finger slightly: and let the cautery be scissor-like.
And make the depth of the cauterization according to the depth of the thickness of the skin.
That if the injured person complains that the pain extends almost to the toes, then he cauterizes himself there with a point cautery tool, three, four, or more, if he likes it.
And if the injured person complains that there is pain under the knee towards the leg, then he cauterizes himself there with a scissor-like cautery tool.
And cause yourself in all your cauterization, so that you do not end with a cautery tool that burns the nerves, or a large artery, and does not hurt the patient with it on top of a bad injury, or a contraction.
And verily I have seen one and the other, of those who cauterized above the knuckle, and ultimately stayed in cauterization, and the leg was inflated until the tumor attached to the foot, and it was perforate all over, and all weight was corrupt: then a solution of the eye happened, and death after that.
That if there is pain in two parts at the same time, cauterize each one according to this way.
And some wise ones have said in cauterization of the anchus, whose cauterization is this mode. Make a similar replica out of iron, whose diameter is half the size of the palm: and let it be at the opening of its nail according to the thickness of the finger nail, or less than that: and within that third replica sit a third replica.
And let there be space that is between each replica according to the quantity of the knuckle nail: and let the replicas open on two sides: and let their height be almost like a knot, or two knots: and make them handles out of iron crookedly adapted in the replicas.
Then let it be heated in fire, until it rusts, and let sparks come out: then let it be placed on a paste of the anchus laid down on the sound side. Then cauterize him with three round cauterizations in one stream.
Then let him go after three days. Then smear it with butter: and let the nail open be left for many days. Then care for the man with ointment, until he is healed.
Says Albucasis, with this kind of cauterization of the son, we are little used, because of the look of fear: and therefore, because we find few who wait over the man.
However, there is from good cauterizations to him who suffers, and he finds with him the place of his wound.
But the cauterium is with the medicines that burn, so that you make two replicas having a hole in the wrist, in which descends a pin of his door out of iron, or steel, length of walls: whose height are two knots, or almost like them.
And there should be a space that is between the two quantities of the thickness of the finger, and they are opened from below and above: and there should be what contains itself adjacently, according to this form.
Then put it on top of the pillow on which the sick person lies on the sound side. And compress your hand hard against the pillow on which the sick person is lying on the sound side. Then tie between the two circles of warm water, which is heated with fire slightly, and hold it for a time: and let the sick person feel the tingling, and his own warmth, because he finds the tingling like fire, until he is calm.
Then clean your hand with the instrument and wash off all the hot water with sweet water: then leave it for three days.
And put on top of it the butter, until the blackness of the burn comes off: and leave it for a few days, and let the pus run out of it. For this is the last of healing.
Then care for that with ointment, until it heals.
If the pain extends to the hip or the leg: make him a rest in it that contains water, according to what you have done in the width equally.
And this is the mode of hot water: and I have already written it in the book on rectifying medicines. Take alkaline and burning not extinct on one side, wash both, and put them in a new bowl whose bottom part is pierced with a small hole, according to the amount that enters it: and put under the bowl another one that drips: and pour over the alkaline and the ash with sweet water, which immerses each one by the finger: then you compress them with your hand good compression: and set aside the bowl, until the sharp water in the bottom part of the dripping bowl has gone.
Then gather all the water together and pour it over another ash: and wait, until it renews itself.
For then it will be sharp-wittedness which is mighty, which is administered in many operations of medicine, and in the cauterization of the remaining members. Since it will effect the operation of fire itself.
And from medicines are, with which they cauterize the anus, also as a poultice, and oak galls, and lead with soap, so that both are mixed.
And Galen himself relating, said about a man of an ancient cure, which he was cured of the pain of the anus and sciatica: and he magnified that it is mighty. And he said, I do not prefer another cure, and because he was cured with one juice until he told, that perhaps he entered a hot bath, and came out of it already healthy.
And it is, to be taken from the oil of sesame: and if sesamum is not found, it is taken as it is, fresh: and it is boiled a lot with some fat, and placed on the anus, where there is pain, or in the crotch, or in the thigh: and it is tied on, and left for a quantity of three hours, or per quantity that the sick person feels the pain of sitting down because of heat. Then put him into a bath.
And when his body becomes wet with sweat, put him on the ground. For the pain has subsided, and he is healed.
And you should know that it is not necessary to use any kind of application with these medicines unless after the body has been evacuated.
And Dioscorides who said, that when the sheep dung is applied to the sciatic nerve with fire, it brings him relief: and it becomes a wound in this way. Take wool, and soak it with old oil, and place it on a deep place, which is between the thumb of the foot, and between the fire, and it is closer to the fire.
Then take sheep dung as it is, and light it on fire, until it becomes a coal.
Then put the flesh on the wool, and let it go, until it is extinguished. Then do this again. Do not cease to do this, until the sense has settled on the middle as far as the navel, and the pain has rested.
And this mode of cauterization is called vaccinum cautery.
[¶] On cauterization for back pain.
When pain occurs on the back from various causes, or from injury, or from excessive evacuation, and similar cases, only use the cold-water infusion: and cauterization should not be done, unless alone in this species, which is done by using cold water.
Therefore, after the evacuation of the wound with foul pills and similar things, let three lines be drawn on the back where the pain is, according to the width of the palm, having five marks with caustice in each line, or more according to the quantity that comes from the tolerance of the nurse's power: and let cauterization be done with the caustic puncture.
And if you want, cauterize three or four times with the middle claw-shaped caustic, in this form.
[¶] On the method of cauterizing in gangrene of the gibbus.
This illness often occurs in young infants.
And the sign of this disease in children is: which happens to him a stricture in the air passage during raising and movement: and swelling in the last spine of the back and its knots, which has already begun to emerge above the remaining spines.
Therefore, when you see this, and want to do it, then cauterize it with the caustic that is a circle according to this form.
And take the cautery over the whole spine evenly: and if you want to cauterize around the spine with the claw-shaped caustic twice or three times: and let the marks be close together.
Then care for the place, until it heals with it as we have said.
And do not, let alone administer cauterization to the deformity, which is made in a spasm of a nerve.
§ The mode of cauterizing in podagra, and pain in joint-swellings.
When the pains of joint-swellings arise from cold fluids that flow into any limb of the body, then, according to the custom of physicians, they name this disease Podagra by itself.
So when Podagra of a cold cause is to be cured with certain methods, and if the pains do not disappear, then let them be cauterized to remove those pains.
And it is, that the cauterization of it is after evacuation in the circumcision of the feet, with many cauterizations: and let the cauterization be made with olive oil.
And if you will bear to touch a spot on the face of the foot, then do so with the cautery. That if the pains rise up to the knees, or other joint-swellings, and this often happens, then cauterize that spot over every knee with three cauterizations, or four from all sides, with this same cautery of Caelium.
But if you need many of these cauterizations, then cauterize that spot. And do not submerge your hand with the cautery, but rather let the fire be concentrated only on the skin's thickness.
But if the pains rise up to the knees and back: then administer that which we have said about the cautery in our chapter.
That if the pains are in the hands only, then touch spots around a fire, as two lines spread out.
But if any of the pains remain in the fingers, then touch those spots, over every knuckle a spot, and over the palm of the hand.
But if the pains arise after days in the shoulders, or arms, then cauterize both sides completely.
And not does the sick person recover from good management, from receiving medicines. For if the regime is made good, and the phlegm is evacuated, the sick person will be healed with the help of God by this cauldron.
Mode of cauterizing in ruptures.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the intestine goes down, or the ball [of the testicle] comes near to the testicle: then you should instruct the sick person to abstain from food on his own day. And let him use laxatives, so that the feces come out of his belly.
Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and instruct him to hold his breath until he goes out, or shows his balls, or the intestine.
Then let you reduce the person with your fingers, and mark him with the cauldron under the rupture over the spine of the pelvis, with a mark whose extreme is similar to the half of a circle to the upper part of the body.
Then set fire to the cauldron, which has this shape, until it becomes white, and let it throw up sparks. Then let you reduce the intestine, or the ball to its concavity. Then let the servant put his hand on the place so that he does not come out of the intestine: and you have already opened between the legs of the patient, and placed under him a pillow, and one serving on his back, and another holding his chest, who holds the hands.
Then let you place the cauldron on the person with the mark, with the hand holding the cauldron standing upright. And hold him, until you have reduced the jaw: or repeat with another blow, if you are not successful with the first one up to the mouth.
And carefully observe from the exit of the intestine during the time of your cauterization, that you do not burn him, and let it pass through him to the sick person or death, or great evil.
And know that when you are not successful with the cauldron in closing the mouth, your operation does not bring forth fruit.
It is appropriate that the caustic be delicate for infants, according to their measure.
Then the care with the other ointments, until it heals.
And let the patient lie on his back for forty days, until the wound is closed.
And it is necessary that you give him food according to the length of his recovery time, which softens his stomach: so that he does not evacuate the intestines by straining and diarrhea.
Then when he wants to get up after forty days, then administer a loosely made ligature, and let him hold it for another forty days.
And he should not work, and should not be satisfied with food and drink, and should not have hot drinks.
For when he uses this regimen, he recovers with whole healing.
And I will speak about the cure of wounds with incisions in its own chapter.
When, however, ruptures occur in the rest of the stomach, and they are incipient and do not add to each other, then cauterize his rupture with a round caustic according to its quantity: and let it be so burned from then on as the third part of it. Then care for him, following what I have said: and do not add to it.
And some first say: let the rupture be cauterized with a triangular caustic, according to this form.
Afterwards, it is marked with encaustum, and a line that is across the width in the back upper rupture, and another line to the bottom. And place your hand in the middle with the caustic closed.
But the first caustic is easier and better.
The mode of cauterizing in pains because of injury, or percussion.
Chapter LVIII.
When it happens in some member by injury or percussion: and that pain persisting for a long time, and not responding to treatment with medicines: then it is necessary that it be cauterized with a pointed caustic.
And let there be a cautery for every limb according to its size, and its perfection, and its weakness, and its virtue, and its location of torsion, and the pain it causes.
If therefore is healed by the first cauterization, it is well. If not: then repeat over the same cauterization.
Since of these diseases is used to rotate, so that they change from one member to that which approaches it. Why should those things be carried out with a cauterization, until the sick is healed?
On the way of cauterizing in leprous disease.
But lepra when and as long as they are healed by a strong cauterization. And especially the kind of lepra which is made through putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: so that when you are cauterizing, consider the leg.
If however lepra is not able to be healed and you have treated it with the same cauterization, as we have said in the division, and it has not fallen off, and stands still: and you wait over the sick one, that corruption embraces his whole complexion: then cauterize him on the head with five cauterizations: one in the middle of the hairline, and a second lower down towards the front at the end of the hair, and two above the two horns, and one behind the ear next to the nape of the neck.
And last, with a little finger slightly touched by the fire, until it prints in the mouth a deep impression, and the membranes are dislocated from it: so that the expiration of large vapors from it is eased, and cauterize also with the same fire on the spleen, according to what has preceded.
But if lepra is already spread over the sick one, and appears clearly: then it is necessary to cauterize with these cauterizations which we have said in the head, and a cauterization on the tip of the nose, and two cauterizations on each cheek, and two on the tips of the neck, and six on the back, and one large on the achilles tendons near the heels, and one behind it: and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the knees, and two on the breasts of his chest, and one above it: and two on each hand, and two on each foot, and one on the tips of their toes.
And let not the nerves which are above the heel bone burn thee.
And when the wound is cauterized with a cauldron over the shin bone, and with another over the stomach, and with another over the spine.
And know that the more you add cauterium, the more it is an aid, and gives strength.
And know that a sick person does not find pain in the cauterium, as he finds it when he is well: for his body is already stuporified.
And let the cauldron be of proper size and proportion according to the member and joints: according to which it preceedeth in appearance from the tools of the arsenal.
Then take care of the cauldron with flour of herbs with honey, and with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
§ On the mode of cauterizing in stupor.
[1] When a member is stuporified and is treated with medicines, oils, plasters, and is not healed, then cauterize the stuporified member with the cauldron, according to which the magnitude of the member is increased, or its smallness.
And let your cauldron rest in the thickness of the skin a little. Then take care of it with ointment, until it is healed.
And when the cauldron is used for a certain stupor that happens to the hand, and to the foot, in the vertebrae of the back at the exit of the nerves that move that member: and the stupor vanishes.
But it does not preceed for that one, unless he is wise in anatomy of members, and the exit of the nerves that move the body.
[1]  Caput: nonne quod caput superum est, et super pedem, et super os sacrum? aut nonne super os cubiti? aut super os ulnarum? aut super os trapezii? aut super os clavorum? aut super os radiatum?
When ancient Albucasis is dismembered and there is nothing in him of the arts of medicine, then cauterize him with a deep cautery, according to the thickness of his skin, until his flesh turns white, and his color changes.
Then care for him with herb powder, and lentil oil with rose, and leaves of arnoside, and pigeon's blood, and hyndigo's blood: let each part be a piece, these things shall be mixed and laid on a cloth, and shall adhere to the place until it is healed.
The way of cauterizing in cancer.
When cancer is beginning, and you wish to stop its spread: then cauterize him with a circular cautery according to the shape of his face as it has turned.
But the wise have said that he should be cauterized with a final cautery in the middle.
But I do not see that thing: for I am afraid that it will ulcerate: and I have seen it sometimes.
And it is better that he should be cauterized around his face with a circle, as we have said: or with many cautery tools.
The way of cauterizing in adubelas.
When anyone has adubelas, and it is delayed in its maturation, or because it is doing something unnecessary to it, or because of age and weakness, when it lacks a little blood, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of Adubelati: then cauterize him around his face with a few small cautery tools by piercing. Then let go of her. For she will hasten in its maturation.
But if you wish to pierce her with a cautery, then take this kind of fire cautery.
And lay the cautery on top of Adubelati until it penetrates the skin: and let the cautery follow him who is ill, that he may bring relief to the course of blood.
Then the care is for himself until he is healed.
The way of cauterizing a corroding evil.
Chapter LIIII.
The corrodent is not anything but corruption in a walking member, and it corrupts itself: as fire devours dry wood.
If you see a corrodent in a place where the cautery with fire is applied, then many cauteries, small and great, will burn there, according as it fits that place where the corrodent is.
Then cauterize him in every part until you have eradicated the whole corruption, and leave nothing of it within.
Then leave him for three days, and put sulfur tratum with oil on the places that have been cauterized until all the scabs have been eradicated, and all corruption.
Then the care for him is with the application of fat-forming unction.
If you see that after three days meat is born with a healthy birth, in which there is no corruption, it is good.
And if not: then apply the cautery repeatedly to what remains of the corrupted places.
And the corrodent is sometimes healed with sharp medicine. For it rises again in the place of the cauterization.
However, the cautery with fire is quicker in its action; and I have indeed already said that the application of sharp medicine is a division of the cauterization: so take it then whenever you can bear it.
The way of cauterizing in Clauis and Verucis.
Chapter LV.
This affliction often occurs in the lower parts of the feet; and it is a gross, filtered, infection that affects the foot.
And there are two ways of applying the cauterization: cauterization with fire, and cauterization with hot water.
As for the application of fire, so that it is similar to the spark of a small torch: let it be made from iron according to how much it contains a clauum (a drop) on all sides: and let it be below the edge.
Then lay the burned flesh down upon a slab of stone. Then, with the cauldron, turn your hand around the edge of the slab until the cauldron reaches the depth of the slab; and let it rest for three days, until the pus begins to come out. Then, set a piece of plaster on the flesh with soft strips, crushed with salt; and let it lie upon the flesh during the night. For it will itself be removed from its roots.
Then, care for the place with a generous ointment of meat, until it is healed.
If they are not turned, and often happen on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet; then administer to them a cauldron with hot water: and there is, as if you take a tube of brass, or iron, or a quill feather: and lay it down upon a slab, or an athorl. Then pour into the tube a small quantity of hot water: hold your hand over it, and turn it slightly so that the edge of the tube is pressed into the root of the slab, and there is hot water ready to flow down to the root of the slab: and let the sick person wait a little while on the sting of the hot water.
Then let go of the flesh, for the slab will be removed with its roots.
Do so with one at a time, until you have finished with all that are in the body.
Then care for them after they are removed, with that same ointment which generates meat.
The mode of cauterizing in a tremor:
When it happens to anyone, a tremor from cold in a nerve, or from a quartan fever, or any other: then it is necessary that he cauterize the flesh four times, or five on top of the spine, and between every rib with cauterization, and in his heart with cauterization, and on his stomach.
A tremor is quieted by an oiled cauterization, and the health of an illness of cold is speeded by a cauterization with oil.
In the manner of cauterization by Al-Baitar.
Head LXVII.
When also are expelled in the body by Al-Baitar pus, that is, pustules, which are produced from gross corrupted materials.
Therefore it is necessary that at first when they appear they should be cauterized all over the head with a fine cauldron of Myrtle wood, whose extremity is heated with fire. Or when a long root of Aristolochia. Or when a cauldron of lentil.
And when they are cauterized the putrefied matter, at first according to this method: and do not increase: and breaks off their superfluity, and heals from them.
However, it is necessary that that be done after evacuation with bleeding.
In the manner of cauterization in the flux of blood from an artery in the forearm.
Often happens the flow of blood from an artery, which has been cut at the wrist, which happens externally, or at an incised pustule, or a member cauterized, and similar to them: and it becomes difficult to remove it.
So when this happens to anyone, then with your hand properly at the opening of the artery, and put your thumb over it: and tighten it very much, until the blood is obstructed under your thumb, and does not emerge from it anything.
Then put in fire a small oil cauldron, and a great number of them: and blow over it until they glow brightly.
Then take from them one, or small, or large, according to the wrist and the place where the artery is broken, and put the cauldron over it, then quickly remove your finger: and hold the cauldron, until the blood is cut off.
If if should be removed with the hand that is bent from the opening of the artery, and extinguished the cauldron, then take another cauldron quickly, from those which are prepared in fire.
Therefore, you shall not continue to do that which is after this, until the blood is separated.
And beware: do not burn the hair that is there, and let another evil occur on the sick one.
And know: when blood flows from an artery, then it is not possible to cut it off; especially when the artery is large, unless it is four hands wide. Or when cutting with a knife, as we have said. Or when extraction, when it has not been extracted. For when it is extracted, its extremities are stretched out, and the blood is separated. Or is tied up with a strong ligature. Or are placed on the sick person by virtue of their property, of which it is necessary to separate blood, and is tied up with a constricting bandage.
But whoever performs this cutting with a ligature, and constriction with a bandage, or with the positioning of burning things and similar things, does not give him a clear explanation, unless rarely.
But if this should happen to someone, and there is no present doctor or medicine: then he should begin with the positioning of the index finger on the opening of his wound, as we have told you, and constriction with force, until blood comes out from the upper part of the wound, and is applied to the artery. And do not remove the finger, always wash it above the wound with cold running water until the blood has congealed and thickened, and has been separated.
While this is being done, he should consider what is needed from a knife, or from medicine.

(Lib. chirurg. Al.)
Before I begin that, you should know that this is a very frightening thing, which is why it is discussed in the first chapter of the book on cauterization.
And because of this, you should be very cautious, since many times during the procedure described in this chapter, there is a lot of bleeding, with which one falls into death when opening the vein, or cutting on an abscess, or opening an exit for the bowel, or healing a wound, or removing an arrow, or cutting on a stone, and similar things: from all of these, fear and tremor set in, and many times death occurs.
And I warn you so that this does not happen to you when there is hesitation, for sometimes those who practice this art fall by the wayside with the modes of human weakness and the modes of disease. For from them is one who becomes angry with his own sickness, and he is careless about his death: due to his impatience that he finds in his sickness and the length of his evil. And when the sickness is from fear which signifies death.
And from them is one who gives you a gift, and promises you with it, hoping for health, but his sickness is destructive.
Therefore you should not consent to him who comes to you from them, whose mode is such. And be very cautious on your part, greater than your desire and your greediness. And do not assume anything about anyone from them, unless after having certain knowledge that confirms to you the arrival of something worthy and praiseworthy.
And so that you may heal all your sick patients, by prognosis and indication from that to which healing arrives suitably.
For in it there is for you an aid in acquiring fame and glory, and memory and praise.
May God inspire you, O son, with his understanding, and may he not take away from you guidance and inspiration: for that is in his hands.
And I have also ordered this chapter distinguishing by chapters, according to which preceded in the chapter of cauterization from the nose to the feet: so that you may be relieved of what you seek from it, and where you need it.
§ On the Cure of Water Which Aggregates in the Heads of Boys.
Chapter I.
You should know that this illness often occurs in boys at the time of birth: or when the midwife tightens the boy's head without levity.
And whenever it happens also for an obscure cause which is not known.
And I have also not seen this illness in anyone else but in boys, and all of them who had it were dying, for that reason I have decided to leave the operation alone in it.
And I have also seen a boy among them whose head was filled with water, and his head increased in size every day until he could not sit on himself, because of the size of his head: and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture, or it aggregates between the skin and the jaw: or it aggregates under the bone above the sinus.
And the operation on him, if it is moisture between the skin and the jaw, and there is a little apostema, then you should find in the middle of the head one crease in width: and the length of the crease is almost like two knots, until the moisture runs out.
And this is the form of the needle.
But if the moisture is more increased and the apostema is larger, then place two creases, according to this form.
And if the moisture is under the bone, and there is a sign of it which you see open at all parts of the head: and water is depressed when you compress it with your hand towards the inside, and it does not hide itself from you: then you should find in the middle of the head three creases, according to this manner.
And after making an incision, take out all the moisture. Then tightly bandage the fissures with rags and powder. Then dip it in wine and oil until the fifth day.
Then loosen the ligaments, and treat the tendon with linen bandages and ointment.
And do not stop tightening the head with equality. And feed the sick on dry food with little moisture, until the member is comfortable and healed.
Another type of incision is when you consider where the build-up of blood appears, and the collection of water.
For when it is deeper in the occipital, or in the scalp, or on the right or left side.
So then with the incision where you see the build-up of blood and the filling of water: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
And be careful not to hit an artery, or cause a flow of blood, and the sick person dies from that flow with the evacuation of moisture.
Of the incisions on the arteries that are behind the ears.
Head 2.
When a catarrh happens to the eyes, or to the chest, and it does not respond to medicinal treatment: then the last resort is to make an incision in these two arteries.
It is necessary that you make the incision when the sick person's head is swollen. Then clean the place with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear. Then the sick person should bend their neck and tie it with any cloth they have. Then consider where the pulse is thumping. And the places are those that are behind the ears depressed: and rarely hidden, unless in some people.
Then mark them with cautery on both sides: and make an incision on each one with a scalpel so that it reaches to the bone: and let it be made at the base of the skull.
And if you wish, insert a scalpel under the artery, and make an incision towards the top with another incision.
And the length of the incision is as much as two fingers joined together.
Nam when the new wound is incised, blood exits with a pulsatile flow, which climbs to the inside with a frequent leap.
But if the artery does not appear to the touch, then one should measure from the navel the amount of space of three fingers' width. Then mark with charred wax, and find until the mouth.
And what should be emitted from the blood, is six ounces and perhaps you emit more or less from it. All of this depends on the quantity that appears to you from the urethra and the filling of its artery.
Then consider toward the kidney. Then if there is any residue at the mouth of the siffar [a kind of tube or pipe], then incise it so that it does not cause a hot swelling: then tighten the kidney with linen threads.
Then take care of himself with ointment, until he is healed.
Regarding the extraction of arteries, which are in the temporal region.
Chapter III.
When it happens to a man that he has an old headache, or acute catarrah because of the humidities and acrimonious quality, and heat in the grooves of the temporal bones, or old soda, irritating, and things like these: then we are skilled in the methods of medical treatment, and do not provide this: then we have mastered the extraction of arteries from the temporal region, or cauterization of the arteries as mentioned.
And the mode of operation in extracting them is this: let the sick person shave the hair that is in the temporal region, and expose to view the artery that appears in the temporal bone. For this will be shown to you from its pulse, and it rarely hides unless in a few people, or when there is a coldness of the body.
If it hides from you, then the sick person should tie his own head with any fabric of his: then cover the place with a rough cloth. Or warm the place with hot water, until a visible appearance appears to you. Then take the needle, which I had made a little before. Then skin the meat with it easily, until you reach the artery. Then insert the hook into it, and extract it from above, until you have extracted it from the skin, and make it ooze with blood from the tunics that are under it on all sides.
If, however, the artery is thin: then wrap the end of the hook around it. Then cut from that side according to how long the ends of it are extended, and bring them together, and do not let the blood flow. For if it is not cut, and if it does not separate, the blood will not rise deeply.
Then make it ooze with blood up to six ounces, until three.
That if the artery is large: then it should be tied to it with double thread, strong, and silk: or with hakhod strings, so that it does not adhere to putrefaction before consolidation of the wound, and blood flows.
Then cut off the excess, which is between the two ligaments. Make it do that at that time, or after another hour.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery until the tip, with a knife-edge: until the ends of it have been cut, and it has stayed in place of that work.
And this work is better if he does not have a fever, or if his skin is warm. For the cautery is made of those things that remain to finish the moistures. So it is better to fasten it.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries, that the place be filled with old lard: and they are placed on top of the wound at a distance from the center, which has been made up.
And after the dressing has been applied with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with liniments, until it heals.
That if, while you are working, blood flows from the artery: then proceed to cut it off with a cautery, or fill the place with a poultice: and grasp your hand firmly, until the blood has stopped flowing. If there is nothing of them present with you now, then place your finger on the spot, until the blood congeals. And moisten the spot with cold water, until the pain subsides, and tighten it according to what is necessary.
And from that which is lighter and easier to be extracted, that is, as the cautery has two tweezers: let the sharpness of the two tweezers be like an almond. However, they are much less sharp than the two tweezers. Since if they are sharp, like the two tweezers, it is fitting that both have coldness: and they do not strike flesh with speed. And since there is a little bulkiness in them, heat from fire is held within them, and flesh is cut quickly: so with this work it is better in every way, lighter, and easier to do.
And this is the form of the cautery.
And set a space that is the quantity of bulkiness of the finger between the two tweezers, after you have marked the two spots with the cautery: and lay both on brightly, until they reach the mouth, and strike exactly in the two spots: so that what is between the extremities of it may be lengthened. Since they do not consolidate deeply with this cautery.
Chapter IV.
The care for the course of sharp, burning, and painful tears from the eyes.
When there are persistent tears, and the course of the tears comes from the veins on the back of the head: and does not provide any medical cure with medicines, and his eyes turn red, and he feels a crawling sensation in his forehead, as if it were ants crawling: and his eyelids become warmed by the sharpness of the tears: then the ancient people used this operation to cure them, and called the cure Ense.
And is, as you command, for the sick person to shave the hair on his forehead. Then cut three slits in the forehead equidistant according to the length of the forehead: and let the length of the slit be almost that of two fingers, and one slit sit equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second sit according to the length almost a little more than the movement of the mandibles, and the third sit on the other side: and so as not to cut the arteries that are in the two sides: and extend your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the space of every incision be the quantity of three joined fingers: and let there be for you a sponge fragment prepared, or many dried cloth with which to dry blood.
Then introduce the spoon-shaped ends of two sharp instruments, whose subsequent form is described. From the incision that is from the temporal part, up to the second incision: and scrape with it all the skin that is between the two incisions, with oil, which is on the bone. Then also make this from the middle incision up to the second incision. Then take this spoon-shaped one out, and introduce into the first incision again another instrument called a sharp chisel, from one side soft, not acute from the other side. And this is its form.
And put its sharp side opposite the annexed flesh with skin, and its soft side opposite the bone: and push it until it reaches the middle slit: and cut off with it all that comes down from the head to the eyes: except that which continues the incision up to what appears from the skin.
Then also make this in the middle slit up to another slit.
And when an equal amount of blood has run out, express the places from the fragment of coagulated blood.
Then put in each slit a black thread from dried meat, and put on them wicks soaked in wine, oil, or vinegar. And check so that it does not happen that the wound becomes hot.
And on the third day dissolve the ligaments, and administer a strong infusion with warm water. Then this ointment cure, and the other remedies used to heal wounds, until they are healed.
Head.
¶ On the treatment of acute eye injuries and cataracts from within the head.
When any acute, sharp, or severe cataract occurs, and the eyes are weakened, pale, and their appearance is declining: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hair falls out from them, and there is a sharp pain in the depth of the head, followed by a cough: then remove these accidents, for those materials do not come except from many causes.
And the best treatment for them is this. And it is as you command to shave the sick person's forehead. Then cut into it a fissure in the middle of the forehead, or slightly to the sides from end to end, and begin to cut down to the bone: and lengthen your hand away from the jawbones that move during mastication: until when it has touched the bone: and you will dry out all the blood with a sponge.
Then separate the two lips of the fissure with roasted old cloth or with linen strips. Then tighten from above with wool: and immerse the wool in wine and oil so that a hot blister does not occur.
And when you dissolve it, and you will see that the hot blister is about to come out: then you must break the jaw, until a small piece of flesh begins to come out.
Then take care of the patient with the drying treatment which causes flesh to grow: just as if you were to take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony: and prepare an ointment from it, and administer it for the birth of flesh in these wounds.
Head.
On the treatment that falls into gold.
Everything that falls into gold is of one of four species: or mineral stone, or something similar to it, such as iron, and rust: or it is from a plant, such as wheat, and beans: or it is a liquid thing, such as water, and vinegar, and things like them: or some animal.
When, therefore, the stone falls into the ear, or if there is a kind of stone not added to it and does not grow in the ear, expose the ear alone to the sun: but if you see a stone, then distil into the ear some oil of chamomile, or saffron. Then administer the extraction of it and make it snort with the prepared one, and cover the nose at the approach of sneezing, after you have put on the circumcision of the ear swabs, or wool, and extend the ear to the top.
For this treatment is frequently carried out with this care.
But if it does not go away, then administer the extraction of it with a gentle gesture, which is called a subtle pizigarol: whose form is this one.
If it goes away with the gesture, it is good.
And if not, then administer the extraction of it with a subtle, slightly curved hook.
But if it does not go away with this treatment, then make a pipe of brass and introduce the end of the pipe into the hole in the ear much, and cover what is around the pipe with melted wax with oil so that there is no wind except through the pipe: then extract it with your strong breath.
For this treatment is frequently carried out by those who know how to treat these cases. But if it does not go away like this: then take from the helkalimbat, or from the water, that is, prepared gluten with which they are bound, and put the whole thing on the tip after you have dried the ear with a towel placed awkwardly: then introduce it into the hole of the ear with ease, after you have dried your ear.
But if it does not go away with all that we have mentioned, then approach to cut off, before a hot apoplexy or spasm occurs.
And the way to open the fracture is so that blood flows out of it according to the measure of its strength. Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear to the top, and find a small crack at the base of the ear in the place where it is depressed: and if the crack has a round shape, until you reach the stone: then remove it with that thing which is possible for you from the instruments.
And then, at your hour, with speed, sue the wound and care for it until it heals.
That if the rain falls on an ear from one grain, which grows and swells: then administer its extraction.
But if it does not obey you to the exit, then take a small, fine spoon, according to this form.
And administer with it the ablation of its species from the grain that falls in the ear, and do not do that, when you think, that that grain is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, until you put many waftures on it: then extract it with a hook, or with a subtle hand, or with suction, as we have said, for the extraction of it is soothing.
But in water which is poured into the ear, it is necessary that he should use sneezing with condiments in the beginning: and already it fills the ear with some cooked old: and it lies on that ear where there is water. But if it comes out through that, it is good.
And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, small, soft, and heat them with fire enough, and introduce one of them into the ear of the sick: and let it salivate on the sole of his foot from that part, and beat it against another stone in the ear. So therefore should not stop doing that with stones and pebbles, until all the water comes out.
And already the water comes out so that you take it from the pyrop or from the yew branch, and introduce its end into the ear: and light up its other end with fire, until it is well burned. Then repeat the yew branch, and do it many times, until all the water comes out: and extract it with a tube according to what has been said in the stone.
In the extraction, but if the animal is small that enters into it, like a flea, and similar to him, care for it as I said in division.
But if it is a large body which appears to the sense: then administer extraction to it with gestures and hooks: and its matter is easier than all those that are held in the ear.
But in the extraction of the wisp from the ear, when you are treating it with the same care that we have mentioned in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and your cure is not successful: then you must examine the ear under the sun. But if something appears there from the wisps, then extract it with gestures or with fine hooks.
But if nothing appears there, then take a tube of this shape, stiff below and wide above: and insert the fine end into the ear according to the quantity that it tolerates it weak: and then suck up with it a strong suction. Do this many times, until all the wisps come out.
But if they do not obey you to the exit, then cover around the tube with wax, as I have said in the stone.
That if they do not come out with it that we have mentioned: then administer the distillations which the old people have experienced in the infection of wisps: and you will find it in the treatise on distillations.
And let your efflux be like oil and medicines that you pour into the ear with this instrument, the shape of which is depicted here. As you see make it out of silver or brass, below stiff, in which sits a small hole, above wide.
Let it be made so that what is inside the tube is driven away, let it be made of brass which is cast unevenly. And if you want to make it out of lead, take radium, and wet the end of it with a solution which is slowly boiled: then pour oil, or broth, or what you want from these medicines into the tube: and let it be in the ear: then insert radium with the cot which is slightly warmed: and throw it out with your hand by moderate compression, until it drives out oil in the concavity of hearing, and feels weak inside: and that which is infunded into the ear, may now be heated with fire a little: and let not be anything that distills in it coldly: for medicines do not tolerate this.
Chapter VII. On the treatment of head injuries.
On the treatment of ear injuries.
And sometimes some children come out of their mothers' wombs not pierced.
And it has also happened to some men that there is an injury in the ear from a sword, or flesh born in it.
And this injury, when it happens to be in the deep cavity of the ear, which does not respond to warming: and sometimes it happens to the external cavity a little, and it responds to warming.
So that which happens in the deep cavity of the ear, and which does not respond to sight, is difficult to heal in many situations.
And in that which responds to warming, it is necessary that you place golden ointment on the ear, and examine it: then if you see an apparent wound, open it with a sharp stick whose shape is as follows: let there be a small sharpness at the end, and its other part should be round: and let the rest of the stick be soft on both sides: so that it does not hurt the ear.
If then the injury is from flesh born in the ear's meatus: then hold it with a fine hook, and cut it with ease of cutting, until all the flesh is removed.
If the injury is in the deep cavity of the ear: then take a fine ray of light, wood, and heat it slightly with fire: then put it on the ear's meatus.
If then you feel that the injury is with it, that it causes a weighty hearing: try to heal its wound with ease: and be careful not to hurt the ear nerves.
Then place in the ear wax according to the quantity of the width of the cavity which you have opened with Egyptian ointment: leave it for several days, until you are safe regarding the wound's healing.
Or take wax, and pour it into rosewater, and powder it on the ear: and use it.
If then you see the ear already blistered: then it is necessary that you remove wax from it, and let it be with other wax which you have made with rosewater until it cools down: then take care of the ear as long as it heals.
But if there is a flow of blood: then dip the sponge, or cloth into cold water and put it on the wound; and use the remainder of the cure, which cuts off the expected flow of blood in the treatise on distillation.
A Cure for Eyelid Inflammation:
CHAPTER VIII.
of the disease called Althelis which occur in the eyelids of the eye, when they are moist and also dry.
Therefore, you should hold them with tweezers: or with an implement having a point, and push them from their roots. Then put three drops of the remedy on the affected places.
But if any blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lens cautery.
And cauterize them, it is better after an incision. For often they return when some remain in their roots. And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned up, and do not return.
A Cure for Eyelid Inflammation:
CHAPTER IX.
Often occurs in the eyelids something that is absorbed Crandin in its strength, and hardness, and on account of which it is called Grando; and is a gathering of coarse moisture in the upper lid, and lower lid.
Operation with them is, that you consider then, if it is a Grando coming from the eyelid, which appears on the eyelid, and move to all parts, and its remedy is easy.
So find then a crease across the width. Then scrape it off from all parts with ease, until it bleeds. Then hang it by a thread, and cut it off.
But if you are not prepared to cut it off without an incision slightly deeper, then hurts the disease in some way.
If the crease is large: then gather it with a stitch: and cure it, until it heals.
And if she is old, let there not be evil in it for you. For the bones, they will restore her, and make her flesh grow again.
And if there is a growth inside the ear towards the inside, then upside down the eyelid, and suspend the knot with a hook: except that you cut it and press it from all parts.
That if the eyelid is elongated by cutting, that does not harm it in any way.
Then wash the eye after the cut with salty water: and take care of the place where it is infected until the wound heals.
§ Of the care of the eyelids.
Head X.
The axirne is a fat that grows on the eyelids of young people: and it often happens to them; and it makes their eyes ugly, and they get cataracts in the morning, and they cannot see the light of the sun, because the tears go towards them, and because of this the sight goes away from them, and they always lie with their faces down, and on top of them sleep, and their eyelids are moist, which have now been inflated by swelling: and the appearance of axirne is obvious to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel the axrine between them.
And the way that it works is that he puts the sick head in your lap.
Then take a piece of linen cloth, and prepare it with a knot, and make from it a circle according to the amount that contains axrine on all sides. Then put him on it, and press him with your fingers from all parts, so that the axrine is gathered in the middle of the circle.
Then find in the middle of his moisture with a piece of string at an angle, and there is not a larger crack than that which is made in venesection in the deep.
Or you must find the whole skin, until you reach axrine, for axrine often proceeds from a crack in many different ways: because axrine is often white when it has been broken.
So then take it out with a cloth that you have impregnated between your fingers towards the outside; and you turn your hand to the right and left until it disperses, and be careful not to add to the crack so as not to reach with the spoon to the eye and hurt it.
If you do not see the axil at the beginning of the crack, then you add to the crack a little bit with ease until the axil proceeds. Then take it out, as we have said.
Then dip the cloth in vinegar and water and place it on the spot, and tighten it with flour.
And there are those who rub salt, and put it in the crack, so that what remains of it is liquified by that moisture left from it.
Then care for it until it heals.
If, however, a sore occurs in the place of a warm blister, then care for it with wet plasters, until it heals.
As for the modes of Ataxmir eyes, that is, when the eyelids become soft to the eye, so that it rubs as one should not.
Chapter XI.
When they grow in the eyelids hair added beyond the course under natural hairs, and antedate: then they are hurtful to the eye, and cause diseases such as frequent tears, and the palpitations of the eyelids, and the whiteness, until it is the cause of the destruction of the eye.
And Ataxmir eyes are treated according to four ways. Or with a caustic and fire. Or with acute medicine, according to which it is said in the chapter on cauterization: Or treated with Ataxmir by incising and suturing. Or with a cane, as I call it.
It should be placed so that you put the head of the nurse on your lap. Then turn the eye of the hand with your left hand.
If it is turned well, that is good. And if not: introduce it then into that which is on the lower part of the eyelid, and make it penetrate with a thread from above, and let that be near the very hairs themselves, that is, near the edge of the eyelid, in which the hairs grow; and draw the thread upward with the eyelid, and turn it around.
And afterwards feel within the inner part of the eyelid under the hairs added with a thread incident from the greater tear to the smaller tear.
And afterwards draw out the thread, and put a small bit of cotton or cloth under the eyelid: and then mark on the eyelid with encaustic, which is like the figure of a leaf of myrrh.
However, it should be made according to the quantity and elevation of the eyelid: for that is varied in men.
For from these some need so that it should incident out of the eyelid according to the quantity, which is softened by the eyelid.
And afterwards find with a thread on top of the two lines which you have marked, and begin from the greater tear to the smaller tear, and let there be a groove one near the natural hairs, as is the thickness of a radius.
And afterwards introduce an awl into one or two angles of the skin. And then scrape that whole thing. And then gather together with a stitch the two lips, with an awl and thread of fine wool: and wipe away the blood, and let whatever excess hang from the hairs on top of the two eyelids, with some things invisible, if you wish to do that: and if not, you don't need to worry.
And then let go of the stitch and thread up to three days or four: afterwards take care of that.
And if you want, let go of the awl without a stitch, and take care of that which dries up and shrinks. For the eyelid rises at the seal of the wound and gathering thereof: but the future is better.
Such a way of caring for it, Ataxmir taught in the ancient texts.
Yet there is anxiety about the sick person, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
And another mode is in Ataxmir also: and it is, as signs on the eyelid figure, which is like a figment of a bay tree, as we have related.
Then wipe the eyelids with three separate or joined hooks, according to this form which follows, then cut off what exceeds with small knives, according to this form, with an equal incision.
But if you are not able to hold the hook, and it does not fit: then take an acute point where there is a filament, and insert it in the middle of the figure: and insert another filament near the larger tear, and a third filament near the smaller tear: and join the filaments between your fingers with an equal measurement.
Then wipe your hand with an equal wiping: and wipe the skin over where the mark is in the patch, as we have related.
Then join together two lips of the wound with a suture: and take care of it until it heals.
But if there happens to be a hematoma at your incision, or a fissure: but that hematoma with caesarian, and those similar things, from an ointment sitting on it.
And when sometimes the eyelids also turn out because of his hairs.
It is necessary that you use in this what we have said about the incision: but the suture of the two is more artificial. Of the care of Ataxmir with knives.
And is, as turning out the eyelids, and splitting the fissure which is within, according to what we have related. Then with art make two knives, or two thin pieces of wood: of which length is according to the length of the eyelids, and width of them less than a toothpick: and you have already cut at both ends where you hold the hooks.
Then join each one with subtlety on that which exceeds from the eyelid of the eye, and tightly tighten the two knives from both sides with a strong tightening, and leave it for a few days. For the skin is strict, it kills and corrupts and decays until it falls of itself.
If then it is delayed, then cut it with scissors. Then take care of the wound, until it heals.
When then it has consolidated, remove the sutures: and do not prick the hairs.
And this is the form of two cans, which you shall make according to this figure, and their quantity in length and width.
Head XII.
§ On the raising of the hairs pricking in the eye with an aiguille.
The operation in that is, that you take an aiguille fine, and insert it into the eye with a silk thread fine, and tie it. Then you aggregate the ends thereof, and knot each with a small knot well: and make the length of the threads an inch.
Then compose on the eye another thread fine under it, and knot the ends thereof if you will: and make the length of the threads an inch.
Then lay the sick head in your bosom, and bring it near to the sun, that the operation may be declared: for it is an operation slight, or minute.
Then insert the aiguille with the alinxotated in the root of the eyelid, and make it penetrate into the eyelid faster, until you draw it out over the natural hair.
Then draw the hair up to above the alinxotated: and insert into the alinxotated that hair: if one, or two, or three, not more.
Then draw your hand with it, until the hair comes out with the alinxotated on the eyelid with the natural hair.
But if the alinxotated is drawn out, and no hair comes out with it: draw the alinxotated to the lower part, with the thread which you have composed in it, until the alinxotated comes out of the upper orifice, and turn away its sight: for then draw the alinxotated, and the hair also: and both together, and close the eye: and let go of it closed two days, or three, until the hair has adherent to its place, and has grown on the eye.
If the hair is short, then either join it with a long strand of natural hair, and cut it off with him; or let it be, until it grows longer, and then cut it off.
Chapter XIII: On the treatment of a wound in the eye.
When this happens to the eye, it is called the Leporina.
And this Al-Kafasi can be either natural or accidental.
So the accidental one is caused by the healing of a wound, or its sectioning, or cauterization, and similar things to these.
And the mode of operation in this is, that you should find her consolidation, and that you separate her lips, and place in it what is between them from linen, and bind her, until she heals.
And it is not necessary that you use in her treatment those things which dry and constrict: for if you do so, Al-Kafasi will be worse than it was before: but it is advisable to use in it those things which soften, such as foeniculum; and dip it with water, in which has been boiled aloe, seed of linseed; and unguent with daclone, which is liquid when mixed with some oils; and wrap it up with linen thread, and treat it with it.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you should guard against all artifice, so that it does not harden, according to its former form.
And this operation which we have described is no other than a certain correction of Al-Kafasi, so that it does not return to its former form at all.
On the treatment of Al-Kafasi that occurs in the lower eyelid, and is a wrinkling or contraction upward toward the right and left.
Chapter XVIII: On the treatment of a wound in the lip.
This Al-Kafasi that occurs below is the one which is truly called Al-Kafasi. And it is either natural or accidental.
And an accidental wound, or a rift, or a cautery, and those like them.
And the way of the operation in it is, that you take an acorn, in which there is a double filament, and you dip it into the flesh, and you make it penetrate from the left tear to the right tear, until the filament reaches the two extremities of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh towards the top with a sharp tool, and cut it with a chisel from the side. If then the figure of the eyelid returns according to what is necessary, it is good.
And if not, take a radium, and put it in the rift, and turn it with it the eyelid: and find two rifts on the inner side of the eyelid, and the ends of the two rifts are from two angles of incision, until they meet and the figure is made thus: and when they aggregate, the figure is this figure, and it is a Greek letter.
Then remove that flesh by its quantity, which is the acute lower side of it, from there that follows the eyelid. Then aggregate the separated parts: join them with wool thread.
Then take care of them with what I have said, on medicines that soothe and liniments, until they are healed.
And if the Alcazars have occurred from a rift, and a stitch, or a cauterization: then you should find a flat rift under the eyelashes, also according to what has preceded. Then separate between the two lips with a liniment, according to what we have said.
And the summary of the speech on the care of Alcazars, when it is above, or below, it is, that it runs in it an operation, according to how it is prepared from the form of Alcazar.
For it is many different shapes: and the prudent craftsman prepares his mind with any way that is possible for him, until he returns the figure to a natural shape, or close to it, and himself is infirm, according to what suits him from operation and instruments in many dispositions.
De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.
On the adhesions of the eyelid to the conjunctiva, or cornea.
When this consolidation occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid is consolidated with the whiteness of the eye, and prevents itself from its natural operations.
Therefore, it is necessary that you insert the tip of a radium under the eyelid, and raise it up; or that you extend it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a very thin chisel, which does not cut with the sharpness of the incision of the chisel, but rather is somewhat blunt: so that the sick person is not disturbed in his operations, and moves the chisel, and hurts his eye with its sharpness: and let your incision be almost like taking away something from him, until when he returns the eyelid to its natural form, and heals the adhesion entirely.
Then, at that time, pour into the eye the saline water, with water washed: or distil into it from a sieved substance, from dissolved zinc with water.
Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a liniment; and put on the eye wool dipped in albus (whey): and after three days use the sieved substance, and with consolidates, until it heals.
On the incision of the nail and the eminence of the flesh of tears.
De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum:
You should know that the nail is second in two ways. Or it is a nerve: and it is similar to a hard chisel, thin. Or it is not a nerve, similar to frozen moisture of white color: which when it touches the iron, or the chisel takes hold of it, tears off, and does not stick to it.
And of both kinds do not begin, unless from the greater tear, until they are gradually added, so that it covers the sight, and stops up the light, and prevents the movement of the eye.
And the way to operate on it is: so that the sick person puts his head in your lap. Then open his eyes and close his eyelids with your hand. Then take a hook with a little spring and extend it upward. Then take a needle, and insert it into the eye with a pin or a hook: and make a knot at the end of the thread strongly, and fasten it to the middle of the nail slightly: and pierce it with a sharp needle, and bind the thread to the nail, and extend it upward: and scrub with hair of the side of the nail which follows the pupil, as if you were holding it with the hair until it reaches its rearmost part.
Then cut the remnant in the root of the lacrimal bone with a fine scalpel or with a few chisels: and let go of the natural lacrimal tissue, so that it does not run as a result of the incision.
And sometimes when the nail is only extended with a hook: or with thread, as we have said. Then scrub it with a soft scalpel, which has this shape.
And let the scraper not touch the horny tunic, so that there is no break, and do not pierce the pupil.
Then after the incision, pour into the eye some crushed salt, or made from a paste of zinc, and let it rest until another day. Then take care of the eye with what is necessary, until it heals.
If the nail is not nerved, and you cannot insert an acu into it, nor fix a hook to it, then often treat this nail-disease with medicines, and it heals like that of a narrh in division.
If you are going to cut it, then open the eye with care, and take a sharp scalpel, gentle of keenness, in this form. And scrape the nail from above with subtlety. If you see that the nail is becoming thinner and tighter, and it impressions into it, then distil from your own urine in the eye made from a paste of zinc, or of red ochre, or of ground salt: and blur the eye until another day.
Then cut again over that, until he has completely removed it. Unless there is a heat apostema in your eye: for then you shall let go of that itself, and take care of the apostema, until it is healed.
Then again operate on that with a razor, until it is healed.
Except for the lustrous flesh of the eyelid, if it hurts a lot in the eye with a great harm, let it hang with a hook and cut off from that part of it: and do not make the last incision, so that the course of tears does not run.
Then put a little rub on the tear canal, or made with ochre, until it is healed.
Regarding the incisions of Algardenic and the flesh that has come out in the eye.
Chapter 17.
It grows when some of the eyes of men have red flesh, whether it is applied or superimposed, until it covers the pupil, or approaches or tightens over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids toward the outside: and it becomes like the blush on the cheeks.
And the operation on that is also that he puts a sick head in your lap. Then open his eyes and take all that flesh with a hook suitable for it: and hold it with one clamp, or gesturing.
Then cut the flesh first, until all of it has finished with the scalpel. And cause it not to be a matter of operation before the eye: and let your cutting be made from that which you cut, or with a chisel, which we have spoken in the incision of a nail: or with small hooks, with which Asbel is bound, according to which his form will come after this chapter.
When your cutting has been completed and all the Algardenici has been removed, then fill his eye with a crushed salt: or distill into it red powder, and similar things from corrosive medicines: and put on the eye a woolen cloth with alum, so that it is protected from the heat of the apostema.
If anything remains of the algirdas and warm blood reigns over you, and a warm poultice is applied: then let go of the eye, and care for himself with it while the poultice sits.
Then bandage him again with the operation, until he is well.
And do likewise for the flesh that has entered the eye from this kind of accident.
However, it is necessary that the cure of a weak eye from its natural or accidental way be done with iron: and do not put your hand in any of these operations until you have recovered your sight, for that member is tolerant of that operation.
Collection of Sebaceous from an eye.
Head XVIII.
Sebel are little red bumps that grow on the eye, which prevent the operation of vision: and weaken the eye with the passage of days.
Therefore, first, you must consider, if the eye in which Sebel is, is strong, and has no other sickness than Sebel: then pluck out Sebel from it.
And is, as you order the sick person, to put his head in your bosom.
Then hang those bumps with a single hook, or two according to your prudence: and let the hook be of subtle thickness, according to this form, or that there be two hooks placed in one body, according to this form.
Then pluck out those bumps with subtle hooks, with subtlety, and wipe away the blood at hour after hour, until you have removed those bumps from the eye, and they are resolved: and do not leave the eye with the ends of a spindle.
And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be steadfast in your operation greatly: so that you do not fall except those bumps.
And when you have exhausted it, then distill into the eye red or pink juice: so that its own acuteness eats up what remains of Sebel.
But if you are not able to collect that whole object in that hour, then patch the eye with that, which soothes the eye's pain; and leave it for a few days, until its pain is abated; and keep away from any heat: and then apply again to it according to the same mode, until it is healed.
And this is the method of the fork.
¶ On reducing arıs to the nose.
Head 19.
Namendi et ex parte maxilli, ut in hac tabula subiecit.
And if it does not heal, then there is no art in it: unless you find the pus which is in it from its birth, and scrape out all the moisture which is in it, until the hole is discovered.
But when the hole is discovered, and you see corruption or blackening in it, then carve it out with an instrument, whose form is this.
And it is called the chisel of the head.
Let it be made of iron, and let the head be round like a chisel, that it may be dotted with the file's dots, or with the aliskirm's dots, fine dots: and place the object on the spot of the bone's corruption.
Then roll the object between your fingers, and press your hand upon it gently, until you know that that corruption is now smooth: and do it sometimes.
Then restore the spot with dried-up styptic.
But if that spot hardens, and a piece of flesh is formed in it, and the wound heals over: and remains for forty days, and does not return to bleeding, and does not ooze out, then you shall know that he is now healed.
And if not, then there is no art in it, unless you reduce the tube to the nose, according to this form.
And it is, so that you can remove the second bone with iron, or with acute medicine: and when the bone is detected, then take a twig according to this form, whose end is a sharp one, triangular: and let its wood be extended into a pyramid up to the end, as you see.
Then place that over the bone itself; and let it be close to the lacrimal; and extend your hand a little from the eye. Then rotate your hand with the skull, until it penetrates the bone and feels weak; by this means you shall perceive when he is coming out of it, while holding his own hand on his nose.
Therefore then restore the place with the dry medicines that you have mentioned to him.
When then does the flesh grow and the place harden: at that time the matter which is pouring out to the exterior returns to the nose: so it is easier on him who has been weakened.
De reductione eminentiae oculi.
The Reduction of Ocular eminence.
When the eye emerges with all its parts and does not cause injury to the vision or decrease in it: then you should loosen the affected part: afterwards you should bleed him: after that, place the windy ones on the skin without scraping, but with a vacuum.
Then place over the eye a liniment made from acacia, and aloe, and incense, and ox-blood-wort. Then tighten the eye slightly above the plaster with powdered things.
And the method of the powdery things is this: that you take soft cloths, many, and double all of them together; make them of a number; then place them one on top of the other, according to the quantity which the eye requires: then tighten them strongly above them with a hard cloth.
And again place the windy ones without scraping.
Then remove the windy ones, and release the eye, tightening it during the day and night.
If then the ligature again softens, you should tighten it much; afterwards remove the ligature after a day and night, as we have said.
If then you see that the eye has already been re-closed with new liniment, this is good: and if not, then again place the plaster, and powdery things, and tightening, and windy ones, until it is healed.
¶ On the Incision of the King's Tunics.
De incisionieVuaetunicae.
When a rupture occurs in the King's tunic, then let it be cut and removed outside the eyelids like a grain of wheat, and let it be fed in the form of a man because of that, and let it be incised: then the operation is, according to what I say: and it is, so that you introduce an aiguille in the root of the King from below towards above.
Then introduce another one in which there is a double thread from the part of the eye, and let it penetrate: then let go of the first one according to its disposition.
Then incise the place of the double thread, and bind with it the side of the King around the acu: and tighten it much.
Then extract it now, and place over the eye wool steeped in alum on the membrane: then let go of it, until the thread falls with the King.
Then care for the eye with it, which comforts itself, until the wound heals.
And when the King is tightened from all sides with a circle of cloth, so that the eye adds a great prominence.
Then is pierced with a sharp stylus, which reaches to the depth of the eye, and runs the alum-moisture, and goes down the eye, and enters immediately: then tighten it, until it heals.
De cure for the King's eye.
De cura Vuaem Alcoitati.
This illness which is called the King' eye, is not otherwise than a grit that gathers in the eye, similar to water that has fallen down, and it is not itself.
And the mode of operation in it is, so that you make the sick sit on a prepared seat, or directly facing.
Then take his head with your hands from the two parts, and move it so that you feel the grit coming to the lower eyes. Then fix it, and let it not fall down, and clear the light: and let the sick person see things as they are: and if it does not fall down below, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the sap is not prepared with him as we have said, then make the sick sit between your hands. Then take a thin needle and find it with him just above the granular layer a little toward the edge of the connective tissue that joins the corneal layer on the crown, until the sap comes out.
When it has come out, then distil into the eye a warm water in which you have mixed honey: or wheat grass and honey: and then let it be cared for with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
Of the care of the water that has come into the eye, or cataract.
Chapter XXIII
We have already spoken about the kinds of water, and what is fitting for the spoken word that reveals and explains, then take it again according to health.
Then you should make the sick person sit between your hands square, opposite the light, near the sun; and bind the eye that has the water, and tighten it well: then shut the palpebra of the eye with your right hand, if the water is in the left eye, or with your left hand, if the water is in the right eye.
Then take with your right hand almagre, if the eye is on the left; or with your left hand, if the eye is on the right.
Then put the end of the almagre next to the crown by its thickness on the apparent lachrymal skin of the eye; then push the almagre with force: and you should rub it with your hand, until it enters into the eye's membrane: and you shall feel that the almagre has already reached the watery part.
And it is fitting that the length of the almagre to the depth be a measure of the space from the pupil to the end of the darkness: and the crown of the eye is there. You will see them in the same pupil with a bright sight of the corneal layer, because of its transparency.
Then put the almagre until it is in the place where the water is. Then press the lower one side with a force of one, after another.
If then water has descended at once, then at once the sick man sees that which opens his visum at once, and almagra in his eye.
Then you rest a little. If then water has descended, then lay it down second, except that the almagra should come out.
When then is fixed, and does not rise: then draw out the almagra with ease: and you unroll your hand little by little.
Then dissolve in water some of the clear salt of the gem: and wash with it the inner eye. Then put outside the whole stuppum, or a wool infused with rose-oil and with albus; and bind it with it the healthy eye.
But we and those who are of our time, put on him ground pepper mixed with albus.
That if he does not obey you the almagra for the entry into the eye because of its hardness, since it is of a man, whose eye is very hard: then you should take a staff, which is called Alberid, whose this is form.
Then open with it the same connection only, and not at the last your hand in the hole: and is there is no other than to make a way for the almagra a soft place.
Then introduce the almagra, according to what we have said.
And near the end of your work, is prepared for the sick man an awkward bed, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark house: and let be forbidden all movements, and coughing: and put his food which he may heal nature: and should not move his head to the right, or at all.
And sit a ligature according to its disposition until the third day.
Then solve it in that dark house, and test his vision: and let him see things. Then reduce the ligaments until the seventh day.
And it is not necessary that he should do this during the time of cure, or immediately after the incisions are made: but it is necessary that he should keep it away: for water rises quickly through a wrinkled surface.
But if a fever should come on: then it is necessary that you should keep his eye open until the seventh day: and straightened out let him be with him who watches over his eye while he sleeps: then absolve his flow of urine, and put it on the face of his mouth where it flows under him for some days, while he remains in that dark house.
Then let him go out of the house gradually, and let him walk about in his rooms.
And know that a student is not to be trusted with regard to the sight sometimes: for then he may dare to speak about the operation.
And already has come to us some of those from Al-Ayyaram who said that it was done in Al-Ayyaram a hole through which water is drawn up.
But truly I have not seen anyone in the land of the Arabs who did this thing: nor is it written about it in any of the old books: and it may be that it is new.
And these are the forms of eyes from the wound, so that they stand on her who does not know them.
Let them be made of pure brass: and let their ends be with this same subtle triangle, and the sharp end.
Head XXXXIV.
Regarding the cure for a birthmark on the nose.
When they are born in the nose various meats, from which something is mixed that resembles a scorpion with many feet: and from this is the flesh of cancer, peaty, of dull color: and from this is that dull flesh, not peaty in color.
So then from these meats that are dull, not deceitful, and not cancerous, you should make him sit with his hands opposite the sun, and open his nostrils, and insert hooks into those meats: then draw them out towards the outside, and cut off whatever you have held with a sharp, fine knife, until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
If something remains after the cut, for which it is not possible to close: then cut it with a slender instrument easily, until nothing remains of it. If, however, blood controls you, or if a feverish ecstasy occurs: then resist it with what is necessary; or if it is a malign apostema, then approach it by cauterizing it, until the blood is cut off and all flesh is removed.
Then let it be poured into the nose after incision with vinegar, or water, or wine. But if the nose is opened, and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then you shall know that he is already well.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you shall know that flesh has been born within the upper bones of the nose, to which the incision instrument does not reach.
Then let you insert a thread of linen which has some thickness, and mark in it many knots; and place between each knot the quantity of a finger, or less: and let him bring his sick person so that he holds one end of the thread in his nose with a beam, or with whatever is possible for him to do after he has made himself similar to a nose hook: and let him pull his odor at the other end until it reaches his throat, and let him come out over his tongue.
And many times this boy of yours in school makes the nose hook similar: and it is an easy thing for him who wants to do it.
Then let you place the two ends of the thread, one end that comes out over the nose, and the other that remains in the nose. Then let you tie a knot in the thread to secure the flesh with the knots in the thread. Let him do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Then let you pull out the thread: and put in the nose after the blood has stopped flowing that liquid which you imbibed in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment corrodes all that remained of the flesh.
Then place in the end of the matter a cannula of lead, for several days, until it heals.
If, however, the cure is slow, use the cautery.
For making a nosepiece, when oil is distilled with other medicines in the nose, make it of silver or brass; that it be like a little lamp, open like a shell-fish: and its aperture also.
And if you wish to make a closed cannula, like a reed.
And the shell of the instrument for making a nosepiece be full, and well-closed: which has a handle at the end, that you may hold it, when you heat oil in it, or what you wish to put into it, and fluid substances.
Head 25.
Often, in the extreme of the nose, the Thezul [blood] is born and becomes large, and grows greater with the days, until it looks like a mass.
And because of this, you should cut off all of it when it first appears, and tear out all of it. Then place on the spot, or the cauterizing, or the burning medicine that stands in its place.
If, however, the cutting fails to be effective until it has become large, then examine it, if it is hard, and of a dull color, and of little smell: then do not touch it with iron: for it is a cancerous growth.
Often, when the wind blows upon the nose, and a sore comes upon the flesh, and there grows up from it a great evil growth.
And if the sore is not of a violent touch, is not of a dull color, and you see that the cutting may be possible throughout all of it, then wash it with a warm water, and cut it off without fear or dread: and cure the place along with it, when it has dried up and shrunk, until it heals.
Chapitre XXVI.
On sewing up the nose, lips, and ears.
Tu scis quia quando accidit solutionis continuitatis in una harum cartilagineam, parum convenit in ea operatione, nisi in quibusdam homine.
Il faut donc, lorsque cela arrive à quelqu'un, de considérer s'il s'agit d'une lésion récente avec du sang : alors, coudre la plaie avec des points de suture, puis prendre soin de la blessure jusqu'à ce qu'elle guérisse.
Et s'il y a une rupture de la continuité entre les lèvres, et qu'une partie saine reste séparée: alors il faut retirer toute la partie visible de la peau, jusqu'à ce qu'elle saigne à nouveau. Puis coudre les deux lèvres ensemble, les serrer et les appliquer avec de la poudre de dragon rouge et de l'encens broyé: poser sur la poudre un morceau d'embossement de diafinique, et un autre morceau d'embossement consolidé: et laisser ainsi le patient ligoté pendant deux jours, ou trois. Puis dissoudre le bandage, et changer la medicamentation: et laisser ainsi le patient jusqu'à ce que les fils se détachent d'eux-mêmes. Alors prenez soin du patient avec de l'onguent, jusqu'à ce qu'il guérir.
La méthode de la suture est de rassembler la solution de continuité, ou avec les os, comme nous l'avons mentionné dans la suture de l'œil: ou de rassembler la solution avec un fil, comme je vous ai enseigné.
Chapitre XXVII.
La mode de l'extraction des nœuds des lèvres
Il arrive souvent à plusieurs hommes d'avoir dans le centre des lèvres une dureté semblable à de petits grains d'herbe: et certains plus petits, et d'autres plus gros.
Il faut donc ouvrir les lèvres, trouver tous les nœuds et les suspendre avec une pince, puis faire tomber le patient de tout côté.
Puis remplir la place ainsi incisée avec du gingembre broyé, trois fois, jusqu'à ce que le sang soit absorbé.
Then the wound is washed with vinegar, and the place is cleaned with it until the sores heal.
CAPUT XXXVIII.
Now if there is a sore on the skin, incise it and clean it with vinegar.
A frequent wound that arises on the gum is what the ancients call abluss.
It should be suspended from a hook; or you should hold it with tweezers and cut it near its root and let the blood flow, or let the blood run.
Then put on the wound a powder of saltpetre, or other powders that dry up, to wither it away.
That if that flesh returns after treatment, for it often does, cut it again and caustice it; because it will not return after the caustic.
CAPUT XXIX.
Now regarding the cutting of teeth with iron.
When the teeth are gathered together on the surface from within and from the outside, and between the gums there are sharp tissues, and sometimes they corrode and turn yellow, causing the teeth to rot through that corruption that reaches the gum, until finally they fall out.
Then it is necessary that you sit the sick person between your hands and set his head in your lap, and rasp away the rotten part and the tooth on which you see the gums, and make it like sand: until there is nothing left of it, and likewise do with regard to blackening, yellowing, turning citrines, and any other disease until they are cleansed.
But if that which is in them from the beginning of the cutting away is removed, it is good: but if not, then cut them again on the second day and on the third, until you have finished your work in them with regard to the rasping.
And you should know that the tooth keeps the rasp for a long time in different shapes and forms: moreover, that the rasp with which it is shaved from below is different from the rasp with which it is shaved between the teeth, according to the different shapes.
And these forms of razors are prepared for you, which you see.
Head 30.
¶ On the extraction of pain from teeth.
It is necessary that you cure the tooth from its pain with all skill, and be hasty in its eradication. It is not that the tooth is to be supplied when eradicated: for it is substantial: until such time as there is no excuse for the eradication of it, then it is necessary that, when it is considered, it is made firm and certified with you, pain-suffering teeth.
For many times the pain deceives the sick person, and he thinks that it is in the tooth and eradicates it: then the pain does not retreat, until the tooth that is ill is eradicated.
For we have now seen this from the operation of blood-letting.
And when the pain-suffering teeth are certified with you, then it is necessary that you sacrifice the surrounding flesh of the tooth with the spatulum, in which there is some strength, until it is healed completely: and then move it with your fingers or with subtle forceps little by little, until it is cut.
Then at that place then make deep wounds with good position, and the head of the wound between your knees: which you have held firmly so that it does not move: and then pull out the tooth after its straightness, so that you do not break it.
If then it does not come out, then take one of its instruments and push it under it from all sides with ease, and try to move it, as you did at first.
If then the tooth is pierced or corroded: then it is necessary that you fill that cavity with cloth: and tighten it with a small radius of forceps, so that it does not break at the time of your clamping on top of it with forceps.
And it is necessary that you do carefully the sacrifice in the surrounding flesh of the gum completely.
And guard your strength so that you do not break it, and a part of it remains, and returns to the sick one from its greater evil at first.
And be careful, do not do what the phlebotomators do, when they are in a hurry and their boldness leads them to eradicate it, except that they administer what we have said.
For often they bring upon men great diseases, of which it is harder to break than to eradicate, and they leave all the roots of them, or some of their parts: or else they take it out with some of the bones of the mandible: as we have often been witness to this.
Then let it be rinsed after its eradication with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
What if a flow of blood should come from the place (for often it happens): then wipe some of the soil off, and fill it with it: and if it does not do you any good, cauterize it, if it does not give you any soil.
The form of the forceps is slight, so that it may pass into the first place, are long at the end, short in the handle, large, so as not to double themselves when pressed upon the tooth: they are as you see the large handles, until when you press them together, they do not hurt themselves, nor double themselves: the short ends, and are made of iron forged, or of a bent bar of iron, straight at the ends: and in their ends are teeth, some of which enter into certain things, and press with a constricting squeeze, strong.
And when the ends are made as the form of the ear, which is called the ciconia, and they are made of a very strong squeeze.
Chapter XXXI.
Of the eradication of teeth, and extraction of fractures of the mandible bones.
When a part remains after the eradication of a tooth that is broken, then you should place the cot over the place with butter for one day, or two days, until it softens: and then introduce to it the algar or forceps, whose ends are made like the ear, which is called the ciconia. The form of this forceps is as follows.
The extremities of them made as a lemon inside: or like a garlic.
But if he does not obey you at the exit with these pincers, then it is necessary to bring about a cure on the root, and to peel off the whole flesh, and to insert an instrument which is called a small hook, the shape of which is this: .
Let the end be short, but thick enough: and let it not be soaked in, lest it break. But having made a cut in the skin with this instrument, and having removed the hair with a razor, you should then take a hook and tie it to the bone of the foot with a string; and you
But if the root comes out by means of it, it is good: but if not, then you should help with these other instruments, whose shapes are these.
The shape of the first end is triangular, in which there is some thickness.
The shape of the second end is also triangular, but thin.
And with other instruments and tools that have preceded in the shaving of the teeth.
Also sit the hook with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, of the shape of a triangular end bent, so that it does not break; and let it not be soaked in, lest it break. But having made a cut in the skin with this instrument, you should then take a small hook
And you should know that there are many instruments for the teeth: and likewise the other instruments do not count, and the skilled craftsman discovers by himself the instrument, according to which is his operation and the disease itself.
For from the diseases of the teeth are due to a variety of instruments that the ancient did not say, due to the diversity of their kinds.
But if the jaw is broken from the mandible, or from any other bone of the mouth, or is rotten: then examine above it in its own place with what is suitable for him from instruments and pincers which I have mentioned in extracting the root, and help with these movements, whose form is this.
Let it be somewhat thick at first, so that it is drawn tight, or held with it and the jaw does not move and waken, until it comes out: and restore the place with suitable medicines for it.
If there is putrid pus in bone, then cut away the bone from its putridity, and cure it until healed.
Chapter 32. On the locking of the teeth on others.
Of the locking of the teeth on others.
When the teeth do not have their natural course, but become fouled by the form of the jaw; and especially when it happens in women and girls, that is, weans.
Therefore you should consider. For if the tooth is born after another tooth and does not fit, neither can its locking nor grinding; then eradicate it: and if it is joined with another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, whose shape is as follows.
It is like a small chisel, and is made of iron, and has a sharp end.
And your cut should be deep, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that it does not disturb another tooth.
But if it is exposed by its own grinding: then grind it with a chisel made of iron, the shape of which is as follows.
It should all be made of iron, and the handle of its small point should be smooth, like a chisel; with which the tooth is gradually ground little by little over several days with ease, so that it does not disturb other teeth, and falls out: then make the tooth soft at the end, and cut it with some rasps.
That if it is a tooth that breaks off part of it and hurts the tongue: then it should be ground as well, until its sharpness is gone, and made smooth: and then it should be pressed against the tongue, and not hurt it, or corrupt speech.
Chapter 33. On the retention of golden fillings in teeth.
Of retaining teeth with gold fillings.
When there is a knock and shock on the anterior teeth by percussion, or by accident: and the sick cannot hold onto it, and the treatment with stringency of medicines does not improve; then they are made into fillings with gold wire: for silver turns yellow, and rots after some days; but gold never changes.
And let there be a thread of average thickness in subtility and coarseness according to the amount it takes between teeth.
And the shape of retention is so that you take a thread and stick it in between two healthy teeth: then you sew with its two ends the thread between the teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the next healthy tooth on the other side. Then repeat the operation on the other side from which you started: and tightly hold your hand with care and wisdom, until it does not move at all: and let your constriction be where you tighten the thread, near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not wiggle.
Then cut off the ends of the thread that are surplus with your scissors: and gather both together, and twist them together, and hide them between a healthy tooth and a tooth that is loose, so that it does not hurt the tongue: then let go so that it relaxes.
But if it relaxes or cuts, tighten them with another thread and keep them steady with it for a full time.
And this is the shape of teeth, and the form of retention of two healthy teeth and two teeth that are loose, as you see it.
And sometimes one tooth moves back, or two teeth after a fall and a movement in their places, and remain as we have described, and does not do this except the artisan be prudent and skilled.
And sometimes a bone is broken by a blow: and it becomes like the shape of a tooth, and is placed in its place, from which it is secure, and is tightened, as we have said: and remains there, and holds fast with it for a long time.
Chapter 34
Sometimes this ligament that is under the tongue is either natural, with which a man is born, or accidental, from a wound that has already healed.
And the operation in it is so that you open the jaw of the patient at its head in your throat, and push the tongue forward: then cut this nerve ligament across, until it is separated from the tongue's attachment.
If there is something of stiffness and hardness in it, and if it comes from the consolidation of the wound: then produce an awl into it, and find it through its breadth, until you strike the ligaments, and loose the nodule.
And beware, lest there be a tear in the deep flesh, and you strike the artery there, and cause a flow of blood.
Then dip it in the water of incision with rose-water, or with vinegar, or with cold water.
Then put under the tongue a piece of linen that holds the sick one all night: lest it consolidate again.
But if there is a flow of blood, then put on the place a lump of powder. But if you hurt yourself with blood, then cauterize the place with a scorching iron, which is suitable for it: then take care of yourself with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
Chapter XXXV
When there comes under the tongue a swelling that absorbs a small wart, preventing the tongue from its natural function: and perhaps it grows so much that it fills the mouth.
And the operation is such that, like opening an oven in the sun, you open the mouth: and consider the swelling.
But if you see that it is of a dark color, or black, or hard, and to which the sick person does not have any sensation: then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it declines to whiteness, and has moisture: then produce an awl into it, and cut it with a sharp chisel, and free it from all parts. If you hurt yourself with blood during your operation, then put on the place a lump of powder, until the blood is absorbed: and then return to your operation, until you remove it with its complement.
Then dip it in vinegar and salt: and take care of yourself with the rest of the cure that is appropriate for it, until it heals.
¶ On the treatment of two amygdales.
Caput XXXVI.
When, however, there occur in the throat swelling, that is to say, glands which resemble angina and occur due to inflammation: and these are called two Amygdales: when you take into consideration the treatment with respect to those which we have spoken of in the division, and they do not heal, then consider.
If, however, there is a firm swelling, of a reddish hue, and with little sense of smell: then do not touch the swelling with iron.
And if its colour is reddish, and its root is thick: then do not touch it with iron, fearing a flow of blood, and leave it aside until it has healed. Then either you will pierce it: or it will burst by itself.
And if its colour is white, and it is round, and its root is thin: then you must cut into the swelling.
And the operation in it is such that you should consider before the operation, whether the swelling of its own accord has become calm and complete, or is about to decrease somewhat: then therefore let the sick person sit in front of the sun, and place his head in your lap: and open his mouth, and let him take hold of the tongue with his hands, and stroke it with an instrument, whose form this is.
Let it be made of silver, or of brass, which is thin like a knife.
When you have thus pressed it with the instrument and shown it to you, falling on its side: then take a hook, and fasten it in the amygdala, and draw it out as far as you can, pulling some of the skin with it.
Then cut it with the instrument, which has this form: this is what follows. It is taken by forceps: however its extremities are curved, so that the opening of each of them is in a sharp angle: therefore the care is that it should be out of iron, or of a kind of glue imbibed.
But if this instrument is not present, then cut it with a chisel, which has this form. Sit the acute one from one part, not acute from the other part.
And after you cut one of the amygdales, cut the other second according to this same form of incision.
Then after the incision, gargle the sick person with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
But if there is a flow of blood, gargle with water in which the bark of the willow has been boiled: or with leaves of myrtle and similar ones from astringent plants, until the flow of blood stops: then take care of the wound, until it heals.
And when ever there arise in the throat any other pustules besides the two amygdales. Then cut them second according to what I said in the incision of the two amygdales equally.
And I have already cured a woman from an aposteme that was born between her throat, which made it difficult to breathe, and very weak, which almost closed her throat; and the woman breathed through my nostrils, and she had already stopped eating and drinking water; and she was about to die, if she had remained one day longer, or two days.
And the pustule only rose so high that it made two protuberances come out on the nose.
So I hurried, and fixed one of my hooks into one of them. Then I pulled him out, and a big piece came out with it.
Then I cut off where it was caught in the nostril hole.
Then I made him go out from the other nostril hole.
Then I opened her mouth, and pressed her tongue; then I fixed the hook into where it was caught; then I cut off part of it, and only a little blood came out: so the throat of the woman is entirely well, and immediately she began to drink water, and after that, to eat.
I did not cease to press upon it for a long time; and the blister succeeded to the place which I pressed upon, until it was prolonged too much and with that one.
I therefore made use of artifice, and cauterized the blister between the lips.
It stood still from the addition; then I walked away on one side, and did not know what God did with it after me.
Of the Blister on the Arm.
THE END OF CHAPTER XXXVI
When the catarrh has come down to the sleeve and has blistered and is long, then it is called the perpendicular; and if it is on the lower part thick, round, then it is called a blister.
When the treatment with it, which I have spoken of in the division, has failed; and you see that the blister has become cool from it, and is thin: then you should press upon it.
And that which has been added to it is round and not its length, and is bloody or dark in color or black, and has no sensation: then you should cut off the blister. For fear is in the blister on the sick.
Therefore when you see it the second time according to the manner which I have spoken of from whiteness and length, that you should make the sick sit in the sun; and press her tongue with an instrument, the precedent description of which: then fix a hook in the sleeve, and pull it down: and cut off it with one or two instruments which I have spoken of in the incision of the two eyelids.
And you should not press upon it, unless it is added over a natural term without addition.
For if you press upon it more, you will wound the voice and speech.
Then after incision use that which I have spoken of in the incision of the two eyelids: and take care of it, until it is healed.
But if the sick one trembles from the incision; then you should use artifice in its cauterization without fear and concern.
And the mode of cauterization is not with her, except with sharp water: and it is, that you put the head of the nurse in your bosom. Then press his tongue with the instrument which we have said. Then take from the water which I told you in the chapter of cauterizing, and dip it with her not extinct calamus, and put it not thick, nor thin, and fill it with this instrument, whose this is the shape.
Sit to extremities of her in which the medicine is placed cauterized, as cauterized cochlear.
And place the instrument with the medicine over its wound: and let the sick lie lying on his side, so that runs the salve from his mouth by internal medicine, so that does not fall out of it to his throat anything, and hurts him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine. And you from the first on her wound a half of a portion of the medicine for an hour, until you see her now discolored, and let sit the medication of the medicine.
And if you will take a bath, and wet your body on the edge of the radius, and pour the bath with the medicine, and insert the radius with the bath into a cannula from above, until it adheres the bath to the wound.
Do this often times, until you get the result that you will of cauterizing your own. Then let go of her: for she herself dries and falls after three days, or four.
That if you will endure to wash the medicine, repeat her: and after cauterization wash her around with a new cotton wetted in butter, and clean up with it what is from around her of the medicine: and let sit with cold water.
And heal outside with embrocations, and inside with gargles, until healed.
This then species of cure is more salutary than incisions and more distant from fear.
And when she is cured a ulcer with her who is finer than the cauterization and incision: for he cures with a smoke, in this way. Sumac, and hyssop, and oregano, and rut, and myrrh, and chamomile, and abrotanum, and similar plants from herbs; and all of them be gathered together, or some of them in a pot, and immersed with vinegar and boiled: and the whole be stirred with a decanter: and there be left an opening in the middle of the vessel, above which an instrument be placed according to this mode.
Let it be made of silver or brass; and the end, in which is the graver, be inserted into the opening of the tube to the nose, until the steam ascends to the eye-lid, and much darkness ensue.
Then let it be frequently moved over it, until it is thoroughly dried.
And beware: do not perform this cure at the first approach of apoplexy. Indeed, for this adds to apoplexy; and thou shouldst not perform it unless at the decline of apoplexy from heat.
But if you do not have this instrument with you, then take a tube, and fit a stopcock to the end of it, so that it may not burn the nose; for the bark prevents the steam from burning the nose; and this is good curing with health.
As to the extraction of spines and bones from the throat.
Chapter XXXIX.
Often a bone or spine adheres in the throat, or a fish-spine, or something else.
Then thou shouldst draw forth what appears thereon, which is the object that causes the difficulty, when you press the tongue with an instrument against the light and show it to thyself; because it will be seen on the tongue.
And that which is not manifest to thee and is hidden in the throat, thou shouldst make a sick person fast before any food is digested in the stomach. Forsooth, what attached may go forth through the sweat.
Or the sick man shall swallow a straw of wheat, or a leaf of lettuce, or he shall swallow a dry cracker; or he shall take a dry sea-sponge, and tie it with a string, then shall swallow it: and bind also that which he has taken in a string. And so, when it has come to the place where there are bones, or a jaw, and is extracted, then he goes away.
But if he does not go out with it as we have said: then use the instrument of lead in this form.
Let it be larger than the radius by a little, and at its end let there be a curve, which he can insert into his throat with ease: and let him hold his own head raised up.
And he should guard against touching his epiglottis, so that it does not cause him to cough, and drives out with it the bone, or the spine, or inserts it himself with his own hand.
But if the sick person inserts it, that is better: because of his knowledge about the part of the body concerned: and he pushes it down, or pulls up his hand with the instrument upwards, all this according to the quantity that has been prepared for him, until it comes out.
On the extraction of blood from the nose.
Chapter XXXIX On drawing blood from the nose.
When you are treating with medicines and the blood does not come out, then consider the throat in front of the sun, or behind it, after you have touched your tongue with the instrument that I have told you about.
But if your yawn falls on the leech, then extract it with a small hook, or with subtle gestures.
That if it is not possible with them: then take a narrow tube and insert it into the throat as far as the throat: and then insert into the tube an iron that has been heated red hot with fire. Make it do this many times: and let the sick person refrain from drinking water all day.
Then let him take a full cup of cold water, and open his mouth there: and let him put his mouth on it, and let him not swallow anything from it: and let him move his hand with the water. For the leech immediately falls when it feels the water.
But if it does not go out with him that we have described, then suffumigate the sick with herbs, or with a tube as an instrument that we have described in the suffumigation of the uula.
Do this many times, because it will decrease on its own.
And the method of operation in suffumigation is, so that you take an olla in which there are prunes with fire: and the olla be covered with a cover, in which there is a hole: and the end of the instrument be placed in that hole.
Then throw the suffumigation and let the sick put his mouth at the end of the cannula, and close his mouth, so that the suffumigation does not go out, until you know that the suffumigation has reached the blood-vessel. For the sucking-in will cease immediately.
If it does not cease, then repeat the suffumigation many times.
And let the sick suffer thirst, and eat salt and other things, and do not drink water.
Therefore it is necessary that he go out with this regimen.
And this is the form of the instrument from which the sucking-in is taken from the throat when it falls on top of the uisus.
It is similar to pincers, as you see: unless because of its slenderness it enters into the throat. And the end of it is similar to an ear, which is called a cicogna, in which there is a sharpness of the point: and when it embraces anything, does not let go at all.
Regarding the opening of the aphemates, and their division, and care in general.
Chapter 40.
There are many species of aphemates, and many ways of remembering them, namely one, and one in this book: and they differ in the perforation of them, and in the division of themselves into two kinds.
Of which one is a species of aphemate in itself, and on account of its encompassing moist things.
And a second method is because of the places where it occurs from the body.
Since the apoplexy occurs in the head, it is different from the apoplexy that occurs in the anus; and since the apoplexy occurs in a soft place, it is different from the apoplexy that occurs at the joints; and each of them has its own judgment based on the operation.
And of the apoplexies there are some that do not need to be pierced unless they have been maturated with blood and its complement; and of them are those that need to be pierced when they are raw and do not mature according to the complement.
As for the apoplexies that are near joints.
Since the apoplexy occurs when it is near a joint and is prolonged until what is in its surroundings may have been putrefied, perhaps the ligaments or the nerves of that joint are corroded; so this is the cause of the closer contraction of that member.
Or it is an apoplexy in a main limb; since if you delay piercing it until it has matured, it will damage or hurt it or the main limb through which it passes.
Or it is near a limb, so pierce it when it is immature: and you do not need to pierce a crude apoplexy that has not been completely digested, unless it is near a limb, so that it does not putrefy deeply, and it extends toward the inner parts, and becomes a fistula, or forms a hole in its end which does not heal.
You need to know the time of piercing the apoplexy that has matured according to its complement; and it is during a sedative pain, a decrease in fever, a decrease in redness, a pulse beat, and an acuteness of head pain for the apoplexy; and the rest of the signs.
And you need to make the same piercing in the lower place of the apoplexy, and it is more severe: and the piercing should be flowing along the length of the body, if the apoplexies are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in the places of the ligaments, and the strings, and the nerves, and the arteries, and up to the last in all equal places, where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.
When, however, the hematoma is in fatty places: then it is better that you should abandon the perforation of it, until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to the supplement.
For if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus extends from it, and it is full of dirt and dirt, and perhaps it hardens its lips, and its depth.
And some hematomas are perforate according to the width of the body when necessary: or according to that by which the limb is in need.
And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small hematomas and a wide perforation in large hematomas: or sections according to the similarity of the size of the hematoma.
And there are hematomas from which the skin should be sutured: and it happens when it has already been done like a cloth, and it has reached the end, because it is already dead: such as that happened to many, as the itching, and boils.
And among them are those who separate by cutting with three angles. And among them is that from which the cut appears like a fig leaf.
As the hematoma of the groin.
And among them are those in which a round section is administered, and a lunar section: and similar ones from sections.
That, however, to which there is no head, such as are the soft surface hematomas, it is necessary that you perforate it with a superficial perforation, or simply a flat one.
And it is necessary that, when the hematoma is large and has already gathered a lot of blood, you perforate it so that it does not go out and expel all the blood at once: but extract a part from it. Then bandage the hematoma until the next day. Then extract some of the puss again.
Make it many times according to the progression, until it comes out: especially if the person is weak of power, or a woman who is pregnant, or a young boy, or an old man decrepitous: for the animal spirit resolves from the animal with the exit of the blood: and perhaps the sick one dies, and you do not perceive it.
Therefore cause great care in this chapter.
And after your piercing, from which you have made a hole, it is necessary that you should remove the grit: and consider. But if there is small grit in the post-hole, or it is a flat cut, then administer linen paste from flax, or ancient cotton. And if there is a great post-hole, and many cracks have been made by the piercing, then you should introduce linen into all the cracks until they are completely closed up.
And if you have cut off a part of the skin in the post-hole, or have worn it around the edge: then you should fill it with ancient cotton, or as when the cloth is smooth, or is brushed with linen floc: and press it firmly until the third day.
Then throw it away, and take care of that with you which you need to use ointment, until it is healed.
But if a flow of blood should happen in the hour of your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar, after which a cloth is dipped in it: and lay it down often on the place where the blood flows.
But if the blood flow persists, then you should administer a regimen and cure, and powders, which I have described in many places of this book, and from division.
But if it is in the time of winter, and the post-hole is full of cold air: then you should fill it with wine and hot oil: and lay it down.
And if it is in the summer, and the places are fleshy: then you should fill them with water, and oil, or with wine and oil, and all that cold thing. Until the third day, as we have said, then you should remove the post, and wipe it clean, and administer to it what is proper to its cure, until it is healed.
This is therefore what is necessary to know from the treatment of post-holes in general.
Accordingly, I have already spoken about all forms of apoplexy, and how they affect the brain specifically.
Head 31.
§ On the sections of the apophelies that occur on the scalp of the head.
Apophelies that occur on the scalp of the head are small, and they are of two kinds: nodules, which are surrounded by a sheath, resembling little birds' nests.
And there are many species of them.
Of these there are some that are small; and those that contain a sort of moisture similar to mud; and those that contain a sort of moisture similar to hair and scabs; and some that are like stones, and of the same kind are the hard ones.
And in the sectioning of all of them, there is no fear of their extraction, provided that you do not make a contradiction in the arteries when you are sectioning them.
And the operation in their sectioning is such that you should try it with an instrument whose shape comes after these, which is called the Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
For if that is what contains moisture, then make the sectioning of it according to length in a lateral direction: in this way.
And begin with the sectioning from line B to line G. And when the moisture is emptied, then remove the skin that contains it, and do not leave anything of it inside.
For many times if you leave something of it, it will return.
Then immerse the cotton in Egyptian ointment if it is present, and if not, in water and salt; and fill it with oil, and leave it until the next day. For this will corrode whatever remains of the skin.
Then repeat the application of Egyptian ointment a second and third time, and if you find it tolerable, trust that nothing remains of the skin, then the care with the ointment is enough, until it heals over.
For if the apoplexy contains a round nodule, then make it dry according to this form, having a cross-shaped section; and throw the hooks between the two sections, and scrape off the skin entirely: and put your skill into practice when you extract the sheath that contains the nodule.
But if the artery causes you discomfort, then do what I will tell you after.
And also do the same in an apoplexy, if it is a stone, from the section, and the cure the same, as we have said.
And the section over an apoplexy of a stone is easier: for there is little blood and moisture. And sometimes some of these apoplexies which are in the head in certain men, in whom there is no moisture within.
That is: for I followed over an apoplexy in the head of a young woman, and I found an apoplexy like a solid stone and hard, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if anyone struck it with a blow, he wounded himself.
In others, however, of the accidents of apoplexies in the head, except those apoplexies which happen in the heads of boys, and at the roots of the ears, all of them are superficial sections.
Or put a hole in them always from their lower part, that the course of blood may be directed towards the lower side.
Then take care of them with that which is suitable to them from the cure.
Regarding the section of the strophuli in the neck.
Chapter XXIV.
These apoplexies often happen in the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin: and sometimes they happen in the whole body.
And over those which happen from them in the neck, there is one general one and many: and they are generated from a single source; and every strophula from them is within its own tunic, as we have said.
And the kinds of these strophuli are many. For from them there are blisters: and from them there are those which contain moisture: and from them there are the evil ones, which do not submit to the cure.
In that which you see from them a good disposition when touched, whose manifest is its close nearness to the color of the skin, and it moves to all parts, and it is not joined to the nerves of the neck, nor to the guide-fibers, nor to any artery, nor is it deep: let it be separated from that superficial section from the upper part towards the lower part of the body along a line, b. up to the line, g. and scrape it off from all parts: and extend two skin-lips with a hook, or with many hooks, if you can bear it, as we have said in connection with the apoplexies in the head, and take them out slowly.
And it is with great care so that a new wound does not occur, or a nerve.
And let the knife be not acute so as to cut deeply: that it may not give you your hand with an incision, or disturb the sick, and you fall down, for it is not necessary.
But if you cut a vein or an artery, or prevents you from the operation, then place in the wound a dry piece of wood, or some powder that stops the blood, and tighten the wound, and let go of it until the sharpness subsides from the wound, and the wound softens: or it begins to rot.
For the blood is stopped by the poultice; so return to your operation, until you are finished.
Then inquire with your index finger, if there is anything left of the staphylids or other little things: so cut them and clean them.
For if there is a large staphyle in the root: then it should not be cut by the staphylite from its root: but it should be bound with a strong double thread, and let go until it falls by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old cow dung, which you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment. Then care for the wound.
If the staphyle is whole, then you should gather two sides of the wound: and clean it immediately, as soon as you see that there is no excess.
But if you see that there is excess because of the size of the staphyle, then you should look to cut its root and pull it out: and administer the stitch that we have mentioned.
And those staphyle that contain moisture, pierce them with a superficial hole: so as to show you the site of maturity of it: and place the hole from that which follows below the body, as we have said.
Then administer, after the piercing, the licor with ointment, and similar things, so that it may corrode whatever remains of corruption, until such time as you see the wound already cleaned up: then care for the wound with a genera-tive car-nate ointment, until it is healed.
¶ On the section of the epiglottis from an accident inside the throat.
¶ On the section of the epiglottis from an accident inside the throat.
The ancient ones described this section of the epiglottis, and no one in our land has done it, who can do it: and this is the writing of their words.
In those who have a synanche, the section of the epiglottis should be removed: for it is not done by it: therefore, because all the tonsils and lungs are dormant.
In those who have a hot swelling in the mouth, or in the throat, or in the two Almonds, when there is no disease in the canal, it is necessary to use the section of the epiglottis, in order to escape the loss which happens from the pre-condensation.
Therefore, when we want to cut that [epiglottis], let us cut it with a small knife under the circle of the epiglottis, or four, with a small section across the width, in that which is between the two circles by measure, that it be a section in the sifac, not in the cartilage: and this place is convenient for the section, because it is separated from the flesh, and the blood vessels are far away from it.
That if the doctor is shy, then it is necessary to extend the skin of the throat with a hook. Then he should find the skin, until he reaches when it goes into the canal: he should tie the blood vessels, if he sees any of them.
Then let him cut the sifac that we have mentioned: and it is shown on the section of the canal from the phlegm which comes out of it, when it stops [the flow], and from the loss of voice by the abruption.
And let go of the knot at some time.
When therefore the hour comes when there is a fear of pre-condensation, let the two lips of the wound of the skin be gathered together, and let it itself be cut alone without the cartilage.
Then administer the medicines which make meat grow, until it is healed.
He said: "Albucasis. Inquired Albucasis.
And that which I saw through myself is that a slave took a knife and put it in her throat and struck it with it on a part of the lung canal.
And I was called to cure her, and I found that she was snoring, as is the snore of the dead.
So I took off the bandage, and I found blood which had come out from the small wound. So I was confused that she had not cut a vein nor an artery, and wind came out from the wound.
So I sewed up the wound, and I cared for him until he was well: and nothing happened to the slave except that her voice became hoarse: and she recovered her health after a few days.
So therefore I say: that there is no fear in the section of Epiglottis.
Regarding the section of the Gut:
Head 44.
This condition called Hernia Gutturis is a large hernia, of the color of the body: and it is common in women.
And it has two forms: either it is natural: or it is accidental.
Certainly, there is no talent.
On the other hand, it is accidental and has two forms, one of which is similar to the nodules of the lungs, and the other... And the other form is similar to a hernia that is caused by an enlargement of an artery. And there is a fear in it, and it should not be assumed that it should be made with iron unless it is small: and you test it, and investigate it with intrusion. If then the swelling is a similar thick knot, and it is not suspended with any veins: then dry out the swelling, as they dry out knots: and draw out the swelling with what holds it in the container, if it is in a container: and if not, then examine all of it. Then take care of the place with what needs to be done from the cure, until it heals.
CHAPTER XLV.
§ On Sectioning Above Kinds of Knots.
There are many kinds of knots, and I have already spoken about them in a general way: it is necessary for me to speak here of the difference between Knots and Swelling, since there is some doubt about them.
I say then that when Swelling is hot, and feverish, and sharp pains are severe, until the excess fluid runs out, and decay is complete: for then the fever and heat subside.
But when Knot is not hot, nor feverish, nor are there pains, and it holds them in the skin sacs of its own flesh, which is like a sack to them, and has the color of the body: and they are like beans, and resemble a mat, and are greater or smaller.
And they are in two kinds: either they are fat: or they hold moisture. And the colors of moisture are many, as I have said in a general way.
It is necessary then, when you are treating a Knot, that you examine it and inquire into it by means of the instrument called Intromissum, according to the shape of it in the chapter which follows this.
And the method of inquiry into swelled parts, and all Knots, is that you take this instrument, and insert it into the moistened place in which the swelling is: and you move your fingers slowly with it, until you are sure that the instrument has entered the skin. Then bring the last hand of yours according to the size of the swelling.
Then take out Intromissum, and look at what comes out with it into the opening.
If then a running moisture is discharged, let it be of any color: then make him dry by the superficial incision, as I said in the other pustules.
And if there is no discharge of moisture in the wound with an incision, then you will know that it is thick: so dry above the wound with a cross-shaped section, according to this form, as I have taught you: and suspend the body with hooks, and scrub the skin from all parts with ease: and guard the wound with a towel if you can over it, so that you draw out what is healthy with a knot.
If the skin is broken during the operation, and it is not possible to draw out what is healthy, because this often happens, then draw it out in pieces until there remains nothing of it.
For if there remains a little or a lot of it, the knot will come back according to many accounts.
That if it should pinch you, and there remains a little of it: then fill the incision with some acute corrosive powder: and tighten the ligature, and place it on top of the spot that sits next to the pustule, and take care of the wound with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
And if there is a large knot, then cut it in two places, and take care of the flesh that has grown with it.
If then there is a reverse shape that pulses or does not pulse: then approach it, and fill the place to be incised with fresh, dry earth, and leave it tied for two days, or three, until the ligature putrefies, and the swelling subsides: then return to cutting out what remains of the knot.
Chapter LVI.
Regarding instruments from outside for cutting and piercing.
Of the three types of incision, there are three forms.
For from these there is a large one, and from these there is a middle one, and from these there is a small one.
Let there be made of iron four square ends, so that they may push into the pustule from the outside.
And these are the forms of incisions, and no, that is to say, perforations: and one of them is called béris, that is, perforans: and there are three species.
From these, indeed, is the great one, and the middle, and the little.
Convezione, that they be investigated by these openings, and exits, and sutures, and abscesses from him since it is among them from the bones.
And others are round, and smooth, and soft, as the large aiguille with which they are sutured, from citron indeed, or from bronze, or from iron, or from silver.
And better of them are those that are made from citron.
And are also the incisions of black lead, which are convenient that they be investigated by these openings, whose reflections are soft, so that they reflect with their softness to those reflections.
And again there are three species. For from these are long, from these are middle, and from these are short, according to the quantity of the width of the fistula and the strictness of its.
Shape of the vulturine, and there are many species.
For from these are simple, that is to say, with one curvature: and there are three species as you see, Great, Middle, and Small.
And from these are vulturine blind: and there are three species.
And from these have two curvatures, and there are three species: and from these have three curvatures, and there are three species: and all of these are necessary in their place.
And these are the forms of scalpels, with which they cut and scald nods, and openings: and there are three species: for from these is the great one, and the middle, and the little.
Their extremities with which is made the section are acute, other extremities are not acute: and they do not put so much, unless it is done with them that there is a iuuementum in the scalding of nods at the fear of an incision of flesh, or nerve: and to cure per it through them that sickens, and finds some quietness from the drying out than it finds in the scald of openings.
These are made of air, and they are similar to the ray of light, from which alcohol is formed, and at its end there is a hidden, thin, invisible line: it runs to the inside and outside when you look at it, just as you see.
The form of the needle that is hidden between the fingers near the hole of the blisters: and it is not felt by the nurses: and there are three kinds, large, medium, and small.
The forms of the wind pipe with which blood flow is cut off: and they are three species, large, medium, and small.
Let them be made of air, or yellow, round, about the same length, as you see: and let them be in terms of thinness.
And let these be the kinds of wind pipes in you, large and small: so that you cut off blood with speed at need, and then when there is no medicine present with you.
However, do not use them to cut off blood anywhere in the body, and do not use them except in the fleshy places: such as the legs of the reptiles, and the hips, and the wrists of the arms, and the nipples, and the palms of the hands, and the thighs, and similar to these, from the fleshy parts of the reptile, moist.
And sometimes they become small tools like the knuckle of the fist, according to their form: from which blood is cut off when it flows from a phlebotomy place, or at a wound on a vein, or an artery: and sometimes they are made round, according to this shape.
Chapter LVII.
The care of the nipples of men, which are like the nipples of women:
When certain men's nipples fill up when they begin to sleep until they resemble women's nipples: and the blisters remain full of milk.
Whoever therefore hates that thing, let him cut off the whole nipple with a lunar saw, according to this form from the line, b, to the line, g: and then scrape the callous skin all over. Afterwards fill the wound with incarnated medicine. Then join together the two lips of the wound with sutures, and care for it until it is healed.
If however the nipple turns downward to the lower side, and becomes soft because of its size, as happens to women: then it is necessary that two similar lunar shapes be found on either side of its two upper sides, each held by the other at their ends until they meet in one line, like this form from a line, b. on the line, g. Then remove the skin which is between the two lips, and cut off the nipple, and administer what we have said about sutures and powders, which is necessary for healing, until it is healed.
If however you do not meet the incision which it is necessary to make on him, because of nursing unease, or because of bleeding: then it is necessary that you fill the wound with corroding submerged ointment, and leave it alone until it has corroded what remained of the nipple. Then care for it, until it is healed.
Perforation in a wart, which happens under the nipple.
Chapter LXVIII.
These warts which happen under the nipple are of the hard species of warts, which contain blisters, and from these come those which contain moisture.
Since however these are of the species which contain moisture, it is necessary that they be cut with a lunar section, according to this form, from a line, b. to a line, g. When therefore all that is in the wart has been drained, then fill it with aged ointment, and leave it alone until another day.
Then remove the aged ointment, and care for it with the suitable ointment, until it is healed.
If however the wart is of the species of nodules of warts, then cut over it, as we said above, in a section of warts equal to each other.
If, however, the fracture is extended in this way so that it discharges pus, then administer cautery to it, as we have said above, since it is premised.
ヘッドXLVIII。
§ On the Section of Abscesses Which Occurs Because of an Artery and a Vein.
When an artery is broken and the skin that is above it is hardened, then sometimes much infection occurs from there; and also with veins, so that infection and swelling occur from them.
And the signs by which it is known that an abscess and swelling are because of an artery and a vein, are as follows. Because, when an abscess is because of an artery, it is long, gathered in the depths of the body: and when the swelling of the digits of your hand feels like it has a whirring sound,
And that which is because of a vein is round, clearly visible on the body.
And the section on this abscess is an error, and especially if it is under the armpits, and in the groin, and in the neck, and in many other places of the body; and it is great indeed. Therefore, so that its care is removed with iron, and that from it too, in the extremities or in the head, so that it is removed.
On this, then, which is because of swelling from an artery opening, find on the skin in length. Then open the section with a hook, then expose the artery: and free it from the tunics, until it is discovered.
Then introduce under it a sharp tool, and let it penetrate to the side opposite: and tie the artery with a double knot in two places, as I taught you in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temple.
Then poke the place that is between the two ligaments with a needle, until blood comes out of it all, and dissolve the abscess.
Then administer the cure which generates pus, until the ligaments are broken: then treat that with oils fitting for it, until it heals.
If it is an apostema due to the sectioning of a vein, then you should hold your hand as much as possible without hurting yourself from the apostema with the skin. Then introduce an acorn under the spot where you held your hand and let it pierce: and let it enter to the depth of two threads, until you draw it out from the other side. Then bind the aposteme with good ligature: according to what I told you in the ligature of uvea, from both parts with both extremities of thread.
If you are to pull out a thread, then introduce another acorn with another thread under the aposteme throughout the incision of the ace: press, and squeeze your threads in four places.
Then dry up the aposteme in the middle of itself until it comes out what is inside: then cut off the surplus skin, and let go what is bound from it.
Then put on top a little wool that you immersed in wine, and oil. Then administer the cure, which is done with ligatures and ointments, until it heals.
Head.
The aposteme that happens from twisting of the nerves.
As has happened with the artery and vein, so it has happened with the nerves: which has happened from hitting or from excessive work, and similar: and it often happens to them in places of support, or calcanei, and in any place where joints move: and it is a gray apostema.
Its color resembles the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain: and when it is squeezed with a pulsation, it feels in it a similar stupor.
And this apostema is not agregatum in the depth of the body, but it lies under the skin, and moves all parts, and does not stick to the front, or before, or behind.
So whatever is in the joints, should not be moved with a iron. Perhaps, however, it happens contraction.
In that place, however, which is on the head, or on the forehead, find flesh with a hammerhead. If then there is a small hematoma, then hold it with forceps and cut it off from the root.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a hook and scrape it off: then take it away, and gather the wound with a stitch: and care for it, until it is healed.
Chapter LII.
§ On the removal of hematomas, which occur in the abdomen.
Some people often have little spots in their stomachs and other parts of their bodies that are called ringworms by some, because they resemble worms.
Their roots are small, but their heads are thick, and their lips are large. And some of them are small; and some of them grow very large.
And I have already seen a man, and there were two ringworms in his abdomen, which were more like other things than fungi: there was no difference between them, they were white, had small roots, and their lips projected, and always had moisture flowing from them.
Then cut them open, and you will find in the weight of one almost X pounds and 8 ounces, and in the other almost VI pounds; and the operation on them is, that you should consider then, if they are sickly and moist, and the color of the ringworms is white, moist, with small roots: then cut them open with a hammerhead, and let there be before your eyes cauterization by fire.
For often much blood is expelled in the section; therefore, if blood overpowers you, then cauterize it.
That if you see a sick and frightened man overcome by the cut with an iron knife, then take a piece of copper wire that is bent, and tie it with it: for this method has been described above, and let it go for two days.
Then add to the tightness of the copper wire. Therefore do not cease to bind up lead, whenever it impresses on the flesh, until it is cut off, and falls away by itself without labor.
But if the lump is large at the root, then there is something of fear and worry in its incision: especially because it is in the belly.
However, it is possible that you cut off half of it. Then cauterize it so that it does not return.
Then take care of the wound so that it heals well.
And do not consider that the lump which is of a dark color, has few senses, and a fatty appearance: for it is an apostemic cancer: and I come to mind when I remember Cancer after this.
Head II.
§ On the treatment of prominent umbilicus.
Emblem of umbilicus from many causes. Or from a breach of the skin which is on the belly: and it comes out of it as an inchworm, or from the intestines, according to what happens in the other ruptures. Or from blood which flows from a vein, or from an artery, according to what has been said above. Or from a coarctation of the windpipe in it.
But if it is from a breach of the skin which is clean, and it emerges slowly: then it is the color of an apostle like the color of the body: and it is soft, without pain: and it shows various shapes. And if it is from an exit of the intestines, then its location is with what we have described, and it becomes more varied in its shape. But when you press it with your fingers, it hides: then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it magnifies much at the entrance of hair, and sounds harsh.
But if it is because of moisture, it is soft, then it does not hide when pressed with your hand, and does not constrict, and is not added to.
That if it is because of blood, then with these signs an aposteme appears towards blackening from the root.
But if it is born of flesh: then it is a hard apotheosis, coarse, tough, and it figures according to one quantity.
But if it is because of the wind: then his touch is soft.
And the operation in that is, when you consider then, if the umbilical eminence is because of blood of an artery or vein or wind: then you should prohibit him from the cure of it. For in that is fear and fear, as I taught you in the chapter, where I said that apotheoses are because of the artery and the vein.
That if the umbilical eminence is because of the intestines or liver: then you should prescribe to the sick person that he keep his breath and stand erect. Then signs with the caustum around the navel of all. Then prescribe to him that he lie on his back between your hands. Then with a sponge wet with water around the navel on the place that you marked with the caustic. Then extend the middle apotheosis to the upper part with a large hook. Then bind him strongly around with thread, or with a silk cord that is strong: and let the knot of the binding be relaxed.
Then open the middle apotheosis that you have extended above the ligament. But if you find him already captured by the ligament: then remove the relaxed one, and stick your finger into him, and push the intestines toward the inner side of the navel: and if you find the liver: then take him with a hook, and cut off the excess.
But if it is the opposite for you: an artery or vein: then bind him closely. Then return to your operation. And take two pins, and stick two strong wires into them: and stick two pins around the mark that you made around the apotheosis in the form of a cross, which you make to pierce through.
Then tighten the apotheosis in four places on the pins: and if you want to, remove the pins, and let the place remain until the flesh that is extended putrifies: and it will fall by itself: or cut it off when it becomes thin and putrid.
Then the care of himself with the ointment until he is healed.
If the umbilical cord is embedded in the flesh or in moisture: then you should let the abscess drain as we have said. And extract the blood or moisture that has entered it.
Then the care of himself with the ointment until he is healed.
CHAPTER LIII: The Care of Cancer.
DE: Curas cancri sunt multae et variarum, sicut et tota cura morbis.
DE CURE CANCRI: De cure of cancer are many and varied, as also is the way to cure it with medicine: and guard against cura it with iron, lest it ulcerate: and we have spoken of how cancer is generated in the womb, and of the need for caution in curing it.
And the ancients say that sometimes cancer can be eradicated when it is in a place where it can be completely removed: like cancer in the breast or the thigh and similar places from a member located to extract all of it: especially when it is only beginning to bud.
When, however, it has taken deep root and is great, it is not necessary to approach it closely.
For I could not cure myself of it, nor did I see anyone else who had been cured of it.
And the operation upon him, when he is located as we have said, is, as it were, to follow on and dissolve illness from black cholera sometimes. Then let blood from himself if it is evidently filled with blood.
Then prepare the sick with a preparation in which he is located during an operation.
Then cast in cancer hooks that belong to him. Then close up the whole part of it with ointment after a scrutiny, until no part remains of its roots: and let blood flow, and do not sever it quickly, but express the places, and wipe away the grosser blood entirely by hand or with whatever means is possible at the place.
But if it makes you contrary by flowing gross blood from an incision of an artery or a vein: then causticate a vein until the blood is severed. Then, the care for himself with the other cure, until he is healed.
§ On the treatment of hydrops.
Head XLIV. I have already spoken at length about the different types of hydrops and how water is concentrated: the signs of each type, and its treatment with medicines.
And those that are cured by iron, there is no need to add any explanation about the type of hydrops: and it does not come close to the iron for the case of ear-droops: nor for the case of low-salty body (hyposality): for this is a deadly thing.
When you have already treated the ear-droops with these medicines and your treatment has not been successful: then reflect. For if the person is already weak or there is another infirmity besides hydrops: such as if he has a cough, or a watery urine, and things like that: then be careful not to treat him with iron: for there is a fear of that.
But if you see a person with an exuberant vigor, and there is no other disease besides hydrops: and he is not a boy or an old man: then the mode of treatment in him is, so that you stand between his hands and have him express his breath with his hand, driving the water to the lower part of the pineal.
Then take a bent spikelet, shaped like this: Set two acute-ended parts, one long, and the other acute-ended, like a spikelet. However, in it there is something that slowly becomes shorter: so that you do not pass him over to the inside during the operation up to the intestines, and do not harm him.
Then reflect. For if the generation of hydrops is from a part of the intestines, then it should be extended with a section three fingers wide, directed downwardly beyond the pineal.
But if the generation of hydrops is due to liver illness: then your section should be on the left side from the navel three fingers wide.
And if the cause is due to the spleen, then the incision should be made on the right side: and it is also not necessary that the incision should be made on the left side where the sick person used to lie, so that excess fluid does not collect in that weak place.
Then pierce through with the instrument all the skin. Then introduce into it the incision, and with your hand and the spatula between the skin, and squeeze, as if you were to wash it off: and let the quantity which is washed off be a quantity of nail, or about that place.
Then pierce the sponge, until the spatula reaches a vacant place: and this is a place of water. Then take out the thing, and introduce into the pore the instrument, which has this form. And it is similar to a tube: it is made of silver, or brass, or gold, smooth, rounded: and at its lower part there is a small pore, and on its sides there are three pores, two from one side, and one from the other side: and its end should be cut, according to the way of cutting the calamus, as you see: at its upper end there is an armlet.
For when the instrument reaches the water, it immediately rises on the instrument, and thus washes out a medium quantity of water in an hour.
For if you wash out from it more than is necessary, perhaps in an hour the sick person dies by a resolution of his animal spirit: or happens to him a fainting fit which approaches death.
But wash out from it according to the strength of its power, and according to what you tell you about the dispositions of the nurse by its pulse, and by its goodness.
Then take out the instrument, and retain the water.
That is, because it retains immediately on account of the skin which retains the pore which is above the sponge: of which I have told you, that you should make the incision according to that mode.
Then repeat the instrument on the other side, if you see the sick person able to bear that one: and take out also from the water a small quantity.
Keep this day without fear and guard yourself from error until there is little left of the water.
But if you are ill and leave much of the water behind: then care for yourself with hot sand, and sweating much in a bath and sun, and wait for thirst: and care for yourself with dried doctors, until health returns: and cauterize over the stomach, and liver, and spleen after extraction of water: second to that tell in it what preceded.
On the treatment of children who are born with genitals that are not punctured.
Head 51:
When any child exits the womb of its mother and the baby's penis is not punctured, or has a narrow opening, or is in an wrong place.
Then the child should be helped with a needle and sharp string immediately after birth, according to this form:
Then put a small clip on the opening from a lead pencil, and tie it up: and hold it for three days, or four.
When he wants to urinate, let him move, and go away. Then reduce the child.
And if you don't put the lead on, soon it is possible that the urine which flows over the place doesn't let the child be closed off.
But the child whose opening is narrow, is helped with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it grows larger.
But those who have an opening in an wrong place are hurt. That is, because from the child who is born, the opening is at the end of the penis: so it can' hold its urine until it raises its penis by hand to the top. And there is no generation for him, therefore his semen can' reach the womb in straightness: and it is a foul disease.
And the way of operation in that is, so that the sick lies on his back. Then extend the child' penis with your left hand by a strong extension: and cut the head of the penis from a place that is right, with an awl, or sharp string: just as you would cut a stick, or as you would slice something, so that it comes to resemble the shape of the penis: and so let the opening fall in the middle, according to what should be.
And let there be no flow of blood for you during your operation. For this often happens. So he did not do the incision with me when it cut off the blood, and the wound was healed until it was healthy.
Regarding the things that happen in the prepuce and the head of the penis, and corruption, redness, and adhesions.
The head.
For these things often happen in the penis, and there is an eminence of flesh that is not pleasant.
And from it this other is malicious, and this other is not malicious.
So you should hang the non-malicious one with a fine hook, and cut it off, until you have completely washed it. Then put on top of it a cloth dipped in Egyptian ointment. Then take care of the penis after that with dye-finine ointment until it is healthy.
If the malady of the penis is of a foul color, then you should administer cauterization after the incision and rasping of it.
If, however, the malady of the penis is caught between the foreskin and is a part of it inside and a part of it outside: then you should remove the part of it that is inside until it is well consolidated, and then take care of the penis outside: for when you take care of it at the same time, the foreskin does not heal unless it is pierced.
And these things also happen in the testicles, and in the prepuce, blackness and corruption. So you should put together everything that has already been discolored, and what you want to corrupt, or what has already been corrupted.
Then rub on top of the penis after that with honey that has already been crushed with flour of a fine grater and herbs of a three-fold sifter.
Then take care of it with the remainder of the cure, until it is healthy.
If, however, a flow of blood occurs, then administer cauterization with lunar cauterization, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.
For if it corrodes the head of the shaft, and destroys all of it in an hour: then you should put a plumb-line cannula into it beforehand so that the sick one can spit on it.
But if it is attached to the foreskin of the penis and this attachment does not happen unless the foreskin is healthy, and circumcision is not required on it: and when the attachment happens because of a wound or an ulcer: then you should cut it off with an dull awl until it dissolves the ligamenents and frees the head of the penis from all sides.
For if it is difficult to distinguish it finely: then you should cut off some part of the head of the penis and from the foreskin. For because when the foreskin is thin, it may poke through its thinness quickly.
Then separate between the foreskin and the head of the penis with a soft linen cloth, which has already been soaked in cold water so that it does not stick again.
Then treat it with wine of strap: until it hardens.
Chapter LVII.
On the purification of infants and treatment when they accidentally make a mistake.
Circumcision is not a cure for continence, as are other wounds: but because it is the result of our work and its use is beneficial to boys on their own, we must mark this operation as superior and introduce a lighter one that leads to health.
I say, that the ancient did not speak of circumcision in any of their books: because they do not use it in their laws, and is only what we have acquired through experience.
For I discovered most of the arts, and using bloodletting, circumcision with scissors, and tweezers: and they use leeches, binding with thread, and cutting with awls.
And I have already tested all these methods and found no better way of cleaning with forceps and string than with a ligature.
For when cleaning with tweezers, the skin often falls off. For the skin of the prepuce has two layers; so perhaps one layer of skin may be cut, and the other layer left intact; but then the other layer might be cut too, and pain result. And when cleaning with an instrument called an alefacium, that is, a finger, as surgeons do, the incision at the tip of the male member is not secure; for it may well enter a hole.
In cleaning with a nail, perhaps you will injure the flesh, and ruin your operation; and the skin of the boy is short by nature, and often develops in this way without needing to be cleaned; I have seen this myself.
But in cleaning with forceps and string, I have found by experience that this is good; for the forceps are of a proportion to make an incision: indeed, the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below. But when you press your hand, two sharp points result, and they make one incision at a time in one place; and there results a similar shape, holding the skin of the penis from all sides, so that no mistake is made at all.
And the way of your operation is your own, that you may estimate, especially if he is among those who understand little; for you do not make an incision unless you bind the string to his penis only: and let him go until another day.
Then let him be glad and rejoice in every way as much as is possible for you to do so; for he receives his understanding. Then let him stand between your hands which are ready to prepare him, and not sitting; and hide the forceps in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that he does not see them at all, nor any of the instruments.
Then put your hand on his penis and blow into the skin and pull it up until the head of the penis comes out. Then clean it from that which is gathered in it of filthiness.
Then tie the marked place with a double knot. Then tie the lower part with about the same amount as the second ligature. Then take with your index and thumb and hold the place of the lower ligature with good holding, and cut between the two ligatures. Then wipe the skin quickly upwards, and pull out the head of the penis. Then let the blood run slowly (for it is better) and put the powder from above: and on top of the powder a cloth in which is spread an undergarment that has been soaked in rosewater and shaken with oil of roses. Recent good: and let it be on itself until another day: and take care of the rest with cure, until it heals.
The shape of the forceps for cleaning is this.
The two ends should be straight and the two curves should meet: let not the branch of the claw come out: and the length of the two curves should be equal to the length of the two hand-holds.
An error however falling in cleaning is: for it may miss all the skin, or a part of it at the cut.
Therefore you should, that you stretch it out from your own hour with your finger before the inspection of the place: and cut it second by equality.
If you cannot hold it with your finger, then take it with the forceps, and cut it.
But if they have gone by three days, and what remains under the inflated penis has healed of its own accord, then let it go, until it has healed well, and cut it second by that which is prepared for you: and wash yourself from the head of the penis. For that will not harm him.
Therefore that cure with him which hardens the knot from pus, which we have described in the book about pus: and if it incises the skin above the measure and projects upward, it does not hurt him, but also that one.
Therefore that cure with him which hardens the knot from pus, which we have described, until it is healed.
The head (L VIII).
§ On the extraction of the hernia retained in the urinary bladder.
Retentio of the urine in the bladder, happens from a plaster made, from a stone, or from congealed blood, or from pus, or from flesh born, and similar things from which we have spoken about the ways of cure in division.
And if the hernia does not heal, and you see that the retention is because of a stone, which is now in the neck of the bladder: then it should be so that he is healed on his knees. Then they put together his feet over his back, and he extends his abdomen from the upper part of his back, and the sick one strangles his desire as much as is possible for him. It is calculated then with the neck of the bladder to expel the stone to the rear: why is the hernia healed.
That if it does not heal with him whom we have described, and the disease is strong on the sick person: then you should administer the extraction of it with an instrument, which is called a syringe, whose form is as follows: Let it be of silver, and let it be fine, smooth, and pointed like the feather of an bird in subtility of its radius, long according to the similarity of the palm of a hand and half its length: to which is a thin cannula in the head of it.
And the mode of exit of the hernia through it is, that you take a doubled thread, and ties at its end wool or cotton with a good knot: and introduce the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe: and cut with pincers if there is any excess of wool from the thread, in truth introduce into the cannula with vehemence, like raising.
Then inject the syringe with oil, or with butter, and with alum: and let the sick person sit down on the seat, and wet his mouth with oil, with olive oil, and with warm water.
Then introduce the syringe into the penis with ease, until it reaches the base of the penis.
Then double the above over the navel.
Then push the syringe into it until it reaches the bladder, and let him feel that he has already arrived at the goal of urination: and this should not be done according to this order, unless because the meatus, in which you inject, is tortuous.
Then extend the thread with wool gradually. For the thread follows the wool.
Then withdraw it, and let the thread run through the urethra: and again introduce the syringe, and do not cease to do this, until the bladder is emptied, and the sick person feels relief.
This is a description of the quality of cleansing the bladder with a clepsydra.
Chapter LIX.
When there is an ulcer in the bladder, or blood congeals in it, or pus is constricted in it, and water and medicines are to be distilled into it: then let it be done with the instrument called a clepsydra, which has this form.
It is closed, that is, shut. And there are three holes in it, two on one side, and one on the other, as you see them.
And the place where it is placed, which propels it, is according to the quantity that it obtains by itself without addition, until when it is taken away with it there is something drawn from the moisture: and when it is propelled, it expels it far away: second because it makes a clepsydra pour out naphtha, that is, Greek fire in battles on the field.
When you pour out the waters into the bladder, introduce the extreme of the clepsydra into the water, and draw it along with what propels it upwards, for the water is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra.
Then introduce its extremity into the penis, as we have described in the syringe. Then push moisture along with it, since that's what pushes it - because moisture reaches the skin immediately, so he feels it.
Form a thin clot so that the urethra is clotted.
Let it be made of silver, or of copper; its head should be high, similar to the almond, and under it a pocket in which there is a ligament.
Then take the penis of a ram, and place moisture in it, so that you can urinate with a clot. Then tie it between two pockets with a strong knot with double thread: and heat it with the help of fire, adding more moisture.
Then introduce the end of the clot into the penis, then tighten your hand on the urethra with a tight compression as it comes down, until he feels it - that's when the moisture has already reached the skin.
But if you do not have a present urethra, then take a piece of parchment, and make it into a circle, and pierce it from all its roundness. Then introduce a strong thread in the holes, as they rotate. Then gather the circle together, as is gathered by an umbrella: once you have put it together into a circle  - you can then urinate with it, and with oils, and water.
Then tie it in the instrument: and do with it as you did with the urethra from expression with your hand, until the moisture has reached the skin.
Head LXX.
The extraction of a stone.
We have already spoken in the division of the species of the stone, and its treatment with medicines: and I have mentioned the difference between a stone that is generated in the kidneys, and the urethra, and their signs in all: and I have spoken of the stone that is generated in the bladder  - which is my own case - and that which is generated in the penis: I am now speaking of it with manifest explanation and abbreviation.
I tell you, the stone that is generated in the urinary bladder happens often to boys.
And from the signs of it is that the urine goes out of the bladder similar to water in its subtlety: and there appears in it white sand, and it grates the weak penis, and labors with it, and often hangs. Then it stands up, and goes out with it the anus in many of them.
And the healing is easy for boys from that age until they reach fourteen years. And it is difficult in the elderly. But in youths it is medium, because it is between that one: and the healing of which stone is bigger is easier: and if it is weak, it is turned away from that illness.
When we have come to the healing, it is necessary first that we clean up the weak one with the cloister, which removes all the dung that is in his intestines: for he sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone at inquiry.
Then let the weak one be taken with his feet, and be shaken, and move towards below: that the stone may come down to the depths of the urinary bladder, or sometimes may come out from its high place.
Then let him sit between your hands, and his hands are under his hips, so that the whole bladder turns towards below:
Then inquire about him, and touch him from outside.
If you then feel the stone in space, then lean right away with the incision above it.
If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you must wipe the finger of the index with oil from the left hand, if it is a weak boy: or the middle finger if it is a full youth: and introduce him into some part of his, and inquire about the stone until it rests under your finger: and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Then press on top of him with your finger and push him towards the outside against the place where you want to make the incision: and order one minister that he should close the bladder by his hand, and order another minister that he should stretch out the testicles by his right hand towards above: and with the other hand, move away the skin which is under the testicles in the part where the section is.
Then introduce the spatulum, which is of this shape. And find in it what is between the anus and the testicles, and not in the middle, to the left of the birth canal: and let the section be made on top of it, and your finger should be in the anus: and let the section be made transverse, so that it is wide outward and tight inward, according to the quantity that it is possible for the stone to exit from it without being larger.
Perhaps your finger, which is in the anus at the time of the section, will compress the stone, and will come out without difficulty.
And you know that from the stone are angles and edges, so it is difficult for it to come out because of them.
And from it is soft, similar to a gland, and round: and its exit is easy.
So add to the fracture of those who have angles and edges.
If it does not come out in this way, then you should make an incision on top of it: or you should tighten it with a twisted gesture, the end of which is like the Moon, which tightens above the stone and does not rotate from it: or you should introduce under it a thin instrument, with a curved end.
If you cannot do this above, then slightly widen the opening. If something from the blood makes you feel faint, cut it off with a scalpel.
But if the stone is larger than one, then push into the first big opening towards the throat. Then make a cut on top of it. Then push a little behind it, and do the same if there are more than two.
If it is very large, then ignorance is how to cut above the section with a large incision. Since it has happened to a man of the two things mentioned above, or that he dies, or that his urine frequently distills: then, because the site does not consolidate at all.
But administer its expulsion until it comes out, or you make a fracture of its piece with tweezers, until you cut it off hastily.
When you have thus completed your operation, then fill the wound with thure, and aloe, and dragon's blood: and tighten it, and lay a cloth infused with oil and wine over it, or with rose-water, and cold water: that the apostema may be dried up by the heat.
Then re-bandage the injured part on his neck, and do not loosen the ligature until the third day. When you have thus loosened him, wet the place with much oil.
Then cure the wound with the ointment of dalフィンicon, and with the ointment of basilicon, until it is healed.
But if in the wound there is a hot pus, and it is corroded, and similar things: for instance, if blood congeals in the bladder, and urine is prohibited from it; and it is known by the exit of blood with urine. Then introduce your hand into the wound, and extract the blood. For if it remains, it invites corruption of the bladder, and decay of its parts.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt: and oppose to it all kinds of things which are proper to the cure, until it is healed.
And it is necessary during the whole course of the cure, that two hips should be tied up, and the joints made rigid, because medicines laid on the part are not so effective.
That if the stone is small, and lies in the meatus of the urethra, and gets fixed there, and prevents the passage of urine: then cure the patient with it, as soon as you arrive at dissection. For many times, after dissection, you will have to put up with this treatment, for I have already tried it out.
And take the Perforatorium from iron, which has this form: triangular extremities, acute, fixed in a piece of wood.
Then take a thread, and tie it to the penis under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the piercing iron into the penis with ease, until it reaches the stone; and remove the piercing iron from your hand on the stone little by little: and examine his piercings, until you make him penetrate from the other side.
Urinate then immediately so that it is clean.
Then press your hand upon that which remains of the stone on the outside of the penis. For it is broken and passes away with the urine, and the wound is healed when the sick one urinates.
But if this treatment has not been prepared for you because of something that prevents it: then bind a cord under the stone, and a different cord above the stone. Then dry up on the stone in the penis between the two ligatures. Then remove it. Afterwards, remove any blood that has been frozen in the wound.
And it is not necessary to bind the cord under the stone unless you want to return to skin; and the other cord above, unless when the cord is released after the stone has come out, does it return to its place, and close the wound, as we have said. For this reason it is necessary for you, when binding the upper cord, to raise the skin so that it returns to its place, and closes the wound, as we have said.
Chapter LXI: On the Extraction of the Stone from Women's Urinary Bladder.
The extraction of the stone in women.
Stones are not formed much in women.
But if a stone should occur in any of them, the treatment is difficult and is prevented through many means.
One of these is: that a woman may be a virgin.
And the second is: for you do not examine a woman who takes hold of herself by the hand when she is chaste, or those who have husbands.
And the third is: for you do not examine a woman who knows this art well, especially the hand operation.
And fourth is distance from the stone; why does it require deep incisions, and there is fear in them.
That if necessity compels to that, then you should take a female physician who is well-versed in: and it is found rarely.
If however you are desperate for it, then ask a skilled, subtle physician, and present a woman who is well-versed in the business of women, or a woman who has an interest in this art part: so make her present, and especially to him, that he may do all that you command him out of inquiry about the stone.
In first place that is, so as to look if the woman is a virgin: then it is necessary that she should put her finger into her and seek the stone.
If however he finds it, she should put it under her finger, and then command the obstetrician, so that he puts his own finger into the woman's vulva, and inquires about the stone, after he has placed his left hand on her loins, and presses her with good pressure.
If however he finds the stone, then it is necessary that she should move it gradually from the opening of the vulva to the lower part with her whole power, until he reaches it with it up to the root of the hip.
Then she should cut over it at the opposition of the middle opening of the vulva up to the root of the hip, from whichever side it is prepared for her, and feels the stone in that part: and her finger should not move away from the stone, holding it under: and let there be a small incision first. Then she should introduce her hand over that cut.
Then she should introduce her hand over that cut. If however she feels the stone, then let her add to the incision a quantity proportionate that the stone goes out from it.
And you should know that there are many species of stones. For this is one small, and one large, soft and hard, long, and round having branches.
You therefore know his kind, so that it may be made clear to you through this what you see.
If therefore the blood annoys you, then add to the place three times a day, and hold for an hour, until the blood is dried up.
Then get ready for your operation while the stone is being removed: and prepare the instruments I have mentioned for removing the stone from the ureter, so that you can use them during your operation.
If the blood annoys you, and you know that the flow of blood is from the artery that has been cut: then put powder on the place, and press it down with a compress: do not change that; and let go of the stone, and do not pull out yourself. For perhaps the woman will die if she is weak. Then take care of the wound.
When therefore the sharpness of the pain has passed and the place is putrefied, then get ready for your operation, until the stone is removed.
Chapter LII.
§ On cutting through the hernial sac with water.
Water is not present, except for a gathering of moisture in the sac of the spermatic cord, which is covered by skin: and is called sifac.
And when it is in its own pouch, which nature has provided for it between the skin: and that is another thing, and it is called the spermatic cord, because it is covered by white skin, as I have said: and it does not form except rarely.
And the generation of this branch comes from the weakness that happens to the testes: why this substance is discharged towards them. And when it occurs from a blow on the testes.
And this moisture has many colors. Or indeed its color is changed to yellow, or it is red like blood, or brown, black, or white like water, and that which is more so-called:
And the signs by which it can be known where the gathering of water is, are these. If you are on the left side of the abdomen or as we have said, then the swollen area is round in shape and about the same length as the testicle; it does not show outside because moisture holds it in place from all sides.
And if there is moisture in the pouch itself, then the swollen area is round with a part that shows; and therefore a man may guess because it is another one.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the scrotum, then it falls.
When you want to know the color of the moisture, then feel the color of the moisture in the swollen area with your finger inserted into a square, whose shape precedes it. According to this, when you go out and walk around the inserted part, judge it as being between itself.
When we came to the cure with an iron, then you should instruct the sick person to have blood let if it is possible for him, and you will see the body full of blood.
Then he was laid on his back on a high place and many blankets were put under him.
Then you should sit on his left side and instruct the minister to sit on his right side, who will extend his arm to the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the side of the urethra.
Then take a wide blade and dry the skin of the testicles from the middle along its length, up to near the chest: and make a section according to the equidistant line that divides the skin of the testicles, until it reaches the scrotum encompassing it; and observe the scar and pay attention or gently remove it, so as not to separate it: and sit with the scar that you separate from him, from the part that hangs with the skin more: and carefully examine with the scar according to the quantity that is possible for you.
Then pierce the scrotum full of water with a wide water perforation and remove all the water.
Then separate the two lips of the section with a hook, and extend the scrotum upward, and do not touch the skin encompassing the testicles: and cut the scrotum however you can cut it, either completely or in part, especially its side that is subtle. If you are not skilled in incising, no security is to be found in the incision, unless water is added.
But if, in the course of your operation, you proceed from within the cut made by yourself at the time of your operation: then, when you have finished the section, reduce the wound. Then gather together the two lips of skin of the testicles with a suture.
Then take care of the wound as you would with other wounds, until it heals.
That if any part of the wound should become corrupted with a red color from another cause, then you should use the ligature which is called a suspender, fearing the flow of blood.
Then cut off the testicle with the suspender and remove it: then take care of it as we have said.
But if water is added to the two parts, then you should know that there are two branches: therefore dry one half according to what you have done to the other half equally.
And if it is equal to you, so that there is a single operation, then proceed: then wash away the blood. And introduce a woollen cloth dipped in oil, or oiled oil: and place another dry woollen cloth which you have dipped in wine and oil over the two testicles, and press it down: and put the double cloth on top of it, and smooth it out: and tie it on top with six sutures, according to this form.
Then the two cloths are taken off, and they are made red, and filled with carmine, according to this similarity: and the ends which are pressed together by a cot, or wet wool, should be gathered with a ligature in the lumbar regions of the arms: and one end should take hold over some part up to the back, and the other should take hold to the region of the pelvis: and the two ends should touch the two hips below, and the other two ends should touch the two inguinal regions, and the whole should be gathered together with a ligature in the lumbar regions of the arms.
And when this artificial thread is used with a cautery at the place of section by iron: and it is, so that you may take a thin knife-edge cautery, and cut off the skin of the testicles with it: and it is lit up, according to which we have spoken: until such time as it is detected by the white fluid containing water: then take the cautery, according to this form.
The Greek letter is assimilated.
Then pierce with it that piece of skin, and it will be blistered, until the whole moisture has gone away.
Then extend that skin flap with a hook, and scrape it with a fine hot scalpel, and cut it as well as you can, until you have completely removed it.
And let the meat cure from the outside, so that it is not touched by the fire.
And know that this operation is healthier, and has a longer duration away from the flow of blood, and is better than the operation with cutting.
But if it causes you a contrario in the hour of cutting, or in the hour of cauterizing, a warm blister, or a flow of blood, or anything else: then you should do what helps to ease that opposite effect on you from that cure which is suitable for it, as has been said.
But if he is a timid man, and does not expect this operation, because of its horror: then administer the piercing as I describe it above, and that is all.
When you are certain of yourself through that which we have said about the meanings, that the ramie is watery: then you should make the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Then pierce the blister on the lower part of his body with a chisel-shaped instrument: and place the piercing according to the length of his body, and make the opening wide, until all the moisture has run.
Then place a cloth over the spot, and bind him, and let him go to run off with the remaining water: then care for the wound, until the blister is healed.
But if there is an opposite effect of the exit of water at the time you pierce it: and that is not to be done except for this reason, because the white cloth causes an opposite effect in the hole of the wound, and prevents the exit of water: then you should insert a feather into the wound, or an instrument from which the water of the blister flows out, whose shape has preceded it: or add something to the operation of the wound.
And you should know that water returns, and is gathered after six months, or about them. But when it is gathered then it returns according to the same mode, and the sick person will spend his days then.
Chapter LIII.
[On the care of the ram's flesh.]
You should know that in this section on the ram, there is a fear that leads to peril in many dispositions. Therefore I return to you his dismissal, that he may be healed from her.
And I am recalling the operation on her, and the type of wound.
I say, that many wounds occur in the bodies, from which the testicles are made: and it comes from many causes, namely.
Or from acute profuse sweating, or sharp, which runs to the testicles. Or from a blow.
And the color of the wound is according to the color of the body, and it does not find pain: and the wound is gray.
And perhaps it is a stone wound, whose color is dark, and it has no feeling.
And sometimes it comes from the blockage of arteries, and their swelling: as I have already recalled: or from the swelling of the veins.
That which comes from these [blockages] of arteries is recognized by the disposition of the wound, when you press your own fingers. And you do not need to touch it completely.
That is true that which comes from the swelling of the veins does not disperse anything from it by pressing with fingers.
And also possible is that this form comes to the section, and to the other flesh: and it is, as cutting off the skin of the testicles. Then extend your hand up, and pull it out with a hook or something: and free the suspenders from the water, and tie the rope: and cut the suspenders after you have freed the [testicles] from any part of them.
But if the set of the skin is joined with those flesh, then you need to pull the skin out and cut it:
And if there is an adhesion between something in the syphilis, or in the thing that is between the pores: then it should be necessary to free all that adhesion, and cut it with a round incision.
But if there is a birth of flesh in the place where there was an adhesion that was behind: then it should be necessary to cut all of that, and take out the flesh, as we said.
When your operation is complete, then fill a wound with wool soaked in rose oil, and vinegar: then take care of it with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
Chapter LII.
Regarding the care of the vine, which is with the grapevine.
It is useful to put a little poultice on the testicles, similar to a blister, with softening of the testicles: and it becomes difficult on an unhealthy person's movement and exercise, and walking.
And in the cure of this disease there is a fear, because of the previous memory of it.
But it should be said, that we will speak about the operation in her according to what the first did.
I say, then, that you should have the sick person sit on an elevated seat. Then push down the suspensorium of the testicles to the lower side. Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the hairs that are near the scrotum: and let another person hold them, and stretch them out with a strong extension.
Then cut with a sharp chisel-shaped knife across the testicles in a straight direction of the scrotum, until the pores are detected.
Then scrape off all parts, as we have said to you in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temporal regions.
Then fix in them a knot where there is a double filament, and tie the thread in the first places where the grapes are: and tie it again in the last of them. Then dry them off in a straight middle section according to the length of the body, and take out what is gathered from the corrupt dampness.
Then the care of the wound with the cure of the other wounds, in which to grow healthy, that fall the clothes that nourish one testicle. It is not therefore wrong through that.
But if it happens to all the wounds, then it is necessary that they are taken out for this reason from testicles with the wounds: so that they do not shut off their nourishment because of the incision, and do not scar or heal, and are not a nuisance to them.
Chapter LVI.
[On the care of intestinal worms.]
The end of this worm is from the section which happens in the broad surface on the gut in the part of the groin from the middle of the testicle.
Why do the intestines come out of that break to one testicle? And this break is either from the fissure or from the extension thereof.
And these two kinds of causes arise from many causes. Or from a blow. Or from a twist. Or from a cry. Or from the weight of something heavy and similar.
And a sign, when it is from the extension of the fissure. This is what happens gradually over a long period of time and does not happen suddenly; it is a swelling towards the inside: for this reason the fissure compresses the intestines.
And the sign of it when it is from the section of the fissure, because it causes a sudden painful sensation at its beginning: and it is a swelling different, visible under the skin nearby; and that is because of the exit of the intestine, and the course of its movement to the outside of the fissure.
And when it comes out with the intestine twitching: and this is called the intestinal worm, and twitching: and sometimes it happens with a wind.
And sometimes it runs in the intestine dung, and holds itself there: and it brings with it a kind of disease; for it causes a painful sensation especially when it is pressed.
And in the treatment of the disease of this species with iron there is a fear: why it should be prevented from happening to her.
And the mode of operation is, that you instruct the sick person to reduce the intestine by his hand to the inside of his wound, if he obeys re-entry. Then let him lie on his back between your hands: and wash her legs.
Then extend the skin that follows the skin to the top, and dry the whole skin of the testicles by its length. Then fix in two lips of the incision hooks, according to which you are inclined to open the incision with them: and the section sit according to quantity, that it is possible, that he comes out from her.
Then scrape the syphac, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when it is touched, it detaches the syphac white, firm from all part: then insert your index finger into it that follows the testicle, in that which is between the syphac white, which is under the skin , and between the second syphac, and with it completely break the adhesion which is in the rear side of it.
Then move with your right hand to the inside of the skin of the testicles: and with this extend the syphac white to the top, with your left hand: and wash the testes with the syphac to the side of the incision: and order the minister, that he extends the testes to the top: and you break the adhesion, which is behind complete solution.
And seek your fingers, that there is nothing there of the intestine uncoiled in the syphac or hard. If then there is anything from it: then push him towards the lower navel.
Then take the acume, in which sits the thick thread, made of ten threads: and insert it among the posterior syphac, that is, the tunic, which is under the skin of the testicles which follows the incision: then cut the extremities which protrude from the thread, until there are four threads. Then join some of theirs with a figure which is in the form of a cross: and bind them together with alsifach, of which we have spoken, because it is a strong ligature under the skin of the testicles, until no water can be sent to them, which nourishes them, so that nothing happens from there to an apoplexy of heat. And place another ligature second after the first one, distant from it by two fingers. And after these two ligatures let go of alsifach, which is under the skin of the testicles, a quantity the size of a finger: and cut off all the remainder according to its roundness, and take out one.
Then dry it in the lower part of the skin of the testicles, from which runs blood and pus: as we have told you before.
Then administer wool immersed in oil, and put it on a twig: and administer the ligature which we have told you about. And when the alsifach, of which we have spoken, is cauterized with white wax after its incision, keeping an eye on the flow of blood. This often happens. And let go of the ligature, until it falls down by itself.
But if this delay happens, then immerse it with warm water: and place over it that which we have spoken, until it falls down.
Then care for the twig with the remainder of the wound's cure, until it is cured.
Chapter LVI.
¶ Of Ramie water.
In this Ramie water, no one dared to touch it with iron for its cure.
And first of all they said that it was done as we have told you about the ramie which is with Vinegar. That is, so that the wounds are bound with ease below: then dry in the middle, and care for afterwards what opens them up, until the wounds fall down: and care for the twig, according to what we have said, until it is healed.
Head LVII.
On the dissection that was done in the groin.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and there is an outlet, and nothing comes out of the intestines: and if anything does come out, it is little, and it returns again at all times: in truth, if time passes with it, a fissure is added to the sifach, until the intestines go down into the sifach.
And what has happened by an extension of the sifach, which is in the groin, as we have said. That is, because the sifach extends; then it softens, and the place breaks open, and something comes out.
And its cure is with a cautery, as has gone before in its account.
And when it is cured with a iron, according to this way: and it is, so that he lies sick on his back between your hands. Then dry the place of the rupture, where it has broken open and comes out, by cutting across its width, according to the length of three fingers.
Then tighten the bandage, and, what is under the skin, until, when it is touched, there comes out white stuff from the sifach, which is under the skin that follows itself.
Then take a ray, and put it on the place that comes out of the sifach, and press it into the depth of the groin.
Then, on each side of the place that comes out of the sifach, put two places together with a stitch between them; then remove the end of the ray.
And do not stretch the sifach at all, and do not stretch one, or anything else, as I have taught you to know about the cure of the intestinal ramification.
Then its cure is with a wound-care. And when you stretch the thread, clean it out, and restore the wound, until it hardens.
The sifach is drawn in, and no place of rupture is added.
And the cautery is better in this place: for it is nearer to salvation.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.
If the skin of the testicles is tough, soften it with a hot poultice.
Often the skin of the testicles softens in certain men because the flesh that is between them softens and its appearance becomes better.
Therefore it is necessary for him who asks to cure himself, that he lie on his back, and cover all the skin that has been softened with the natural skin.
Then he will collect two lips with a stitch: and if need be, first the superfluity of the softened skin will be cut off three or four stitches, and a firm stitch.
Then he will cut between the stitches.
Then take care of the cure of the remaining wound, until it is healed, and let the threads fall off.
Caput LXIX.
¶ Of Castration.
You should know that castration is excommunicated in our law: and because of it I will remember it in my book here: and its remembrance is not necessary except for two reasons.
The first is, that it may be in the knowledge of a medical doctor when he is questioned about it: and that he may know how to cure it when it happens to him.
The other reason is that we often lack castration of certain animals, for our benefit through it, such as sheep, horses, and cats, and similar animals.
I say then, that castration is made in two ways. Either by friction. Or by a slit and a cut.
In that which is done by friction, the course of the operation is this: that we make the animal sit in hot water, until his testicles become soft and lax, and hang down: then we will press them with our hand, until they close up and do not appear under the touch.
In castration however by a slit and a cut, it is necessary that you hold the animal, and with your left hand press the skin of his testicles.
Then tie the ligatures together and cut through all of them at once until the two blades come out: then cut them after you have scraped both of them so that there is nothing left except for a thin piece of skin which is on top of the wound.
And this method of castration is better than that which is done by scraping; for scratching may leave something of the testes behind, so that the animal desires to have sex.
Then take care of the wound, until it heals.
Head.
As for the treatment of hermaphroditism, there are two methods:
Hermaphrodite is from the testicles according to two ways. The penis is one of them, because it appears to be so in that it follows a gap or is on the skin of the testicles, being between the two testes, shaped like a vagina of a woman, in which there are hairs: and sometimes it runs urine from what is in the skin of the testicles.
But in women there is only one member and it is like a woman's vagina on top of the pubic bone like a small penis, sticking out towards the outside: of which one is like a penis of a man, and two are like two testes.
And the treatment of the three sexes, the two of the testicles, and the one of the woman, is this: for you must cut off the flesh attached until the impression goes away. Then take care of the remaining wounds in the curing process.
But as for the second sex of men, from which urine comes out and is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation or cure at all.
Head.
As for the cutting of the hernia and the protruding flesh in women's genitals:
Hernia should perhaps be added to the natural place until it is satisfied and its appearance is ugly: and sometimes it becomes so large in some women that it reaches up to the area of intercourse and comes close to having sex with a man.
You should therefore have the tendinosa hand, or with a hook, and fall on it; and do not end in the incision, especially in the deep root: so that there is no flow of blood.
Then you should take care of the wound with cure, until it is healed.
But the midriff is more precious than life; that which is born in the womb of the mother, until it fills itself up: and perhaps it goes out on the outside according to the likeness of a tail: and because of this some call disease that has a tail. So you should cut it as we cut the tendinosa, and take care of it, until it is healed.
On the cure of the hernia of a woman who has not been pierced.
Chapter LII. Head.
Alratica is, whether it is a hernia of a woman who has not been pierced, or whether there is a small hole. And it is either natural, or accidental.
Accidental is from an illness that preceded it: and that itself is either born of flesh that has been added, or if it is thin, or if it is wedged in: and it is in the deep of the womb, or in its sides, or in its upper part, or in its lower part: and it forbids coitus and impregnation, and birth, and perhaps it forbids menstruation.
And the knowledge of it is acquired by the examination of the obstetrical aspects, if the pregnancy is apparent near at hand.
But if it is not apparent, then ask about it with your fingers, or with a ray.
If the pregnancy is from a small hole, and it is near to the two lips: then bring them together, and loosen it.
And it is, as you place it on the two lips dry.
Then put your fingers of both hands together, and let the woman lie on her back with her legs spread wide. Then extend the two lips with force, until the small hole is loosened, and the pregnancy opens.
Then take a piece of cloth, and soak it in oil, and place it over the site; and let a woman move it every day so that the site does not stiffen by other means.
If however the wound is deep, thick: then one should let the wound separate itself with a smooth blade similar to a myrtle leaf.
If however the wound is of putrid flesh: then hang it with a hook, and cut it: and have with you medicines that will stop the flow of blood without causing pain, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and let it congeal with white glue.
Then administer a large silver tube so that the fracture does not heal quickly, hold it for several days: and administer wolfsbane dried in linen, then treat the rest with the usual treatment until it heals.
And when a child is born in the womb of its mother, the birth of flesh: it should therefore be cut according to this mode: while there is no scrofula, for scrofula is not caused by contact with iron at all.
Chapter LIII.
Regarding the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athahelil, and both or red rub on any woman's vulva.
Hemorrhoids are an opening of the anal orifice, until it bleeds a lot regularly.
When however they become chronic hemorrhoids, they are painful: and I have already spoken in the division of their types and their signs: and I will say here which receive treatment and which do not.
I therefore say that hemorrhoids that are in the opening of the womb, and do not appear to be painful: then there is no cure for them with iron.
But which of those [hemorrhoids] are in the opening of the womb above, where the sense is lost, they are the ones that heal.
It is therefore necessary for the woman to enter a cold house. Then extend Athahelil with forceps, or with a rough cloth, and cut them off at their roots.
Then the powder shall be applied upon the wound of the blood-flow from one hole incised without torture: as the acacia, and the blood of the dragon, and the thistle, and similar to them.
Then he will put his feet against the wall at an hour's time. Then he will put it in cold water.
If the blood-flow persisting: then make her sit in a decoction of sumach, and of the corn-grain, and of the crow's-feet, and of like things.
Then take barley-flour, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice with it on her back.
If therefore is shed the blood with it, then is good: and if not, then make adhere to her back the water-soaked things, and the nettle- leaves, without having it scarified.
Then take a wool, and dip it in the juice of tarthar, or of the tongue-worm, or of the gnats' wings, that is to say, in the wine of Pontus, and make adhere to her loins.
When therefore has it rested the poultice, then take care of the place with the unguent, until it is healed.
Albarth verily is similar to red-beets in shape, and has a rough aspect.
Then you shall cut what appears out of it, according as I said in the book, equitately: and take care of itself, until it is healed.
Chapter LXXIV.
On the issue of an outlet which occurs in the womb.
Occur in the womb many poultices, as cancer, and the stone-poultice, and ulcers, and blisters, and milking, that is to say, herpes, blister-foot, and fistula, and hemorrhoids, and sores, and thrashes, and poultices hot.
And I have said already all these diseases and their species, and their signs, and their cures in a division: it is necessary that I should say in this book of the hot poultice which occurs in the womb when it is from poultices that gather blood, and with an iron to know how its opening is made.
You should therefore consider. Then if the pain of the wound is acute in its beginning and there is a sharp pulse, fever and heat, and you see it red: if it falls on top of it, then do not suit with his perforation: and care for him with it as much as he can on maturation, until when it rests, the acuteness of the accidents.
Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a chair that will support her two seats, and lie down or lean against her back, and put her feet on the side of the foot: and are her hips expanded, and she puts her arms under her knees, and binds each one with a rope corresponding to him.
Then the midwife should sit on the right side of the bed, and administer the instrument with which the opening of the womb is opened.
And it is necessary that when you administer this instrument, you fasten the string of the womb with the rope deeply: so that it does not enter into the instrument more than the depth of the womb, and hurts the sick.
But if the instrument is more than the depth, then it is necessary that you put the pulleys on top of the depth of the womb: so as to prevent the entry of the whole instrument into the depth of the womb: and it is necessary that you put the string, which runs in the instrument from the side above, and hold it, and rotate the string, until the depth of the womb is opened.
When it appears that it is coming out, and is touched by the hand, and is soft and small: then it is necessary that you separate it from the head with a spatula blunt edge.
When it is emptied of its content, then it is necessary that you put the chisel of iron immersed in oil rose: or in olive oil, in which there is some stiffness: and put the iron, and extract a piece in the depth of the womb.
And put outside on top of the womb, and over the woolen fleece clean immersed in water, in which it is boiled salt.
Then he should be dressed with ointment suitable for it, for two days until it heals.
And sometimes when the wound and the knot have been washed away, so that it swells up with water and honey: then with water in which a bulb of lily root or long aristolochia has been boiled: then he should return to the ointment.
If the knot is hidden within the womb, then one should refrain from treating it with fire, indeed care for it itself along with it as we have said in division.
Chapter LXVII.
Doctrines on Obstetrics, how they treat embryos within the womb, according to an unnatural exit.
It is necessary for the obstetrician to recognize in the first place the figure of a natural birth.
From the signs then it is apparent that when you see a woman compressing herself towards the lower parts, and desiring to smell air, and being relieved on her when the birth of an embryo approaches, then you know that this birth is according to a natural figure, and its exit is above her head, and second in order with it: or suspended, or hanging by the umbilical cord.
When then you see these signs, then one should compress her belly, that the embryo may descend quickly.
For when it has come to rest on its head, this second one comes with it, and is cleansed from it by a good purification of secretions.
But if this is not the case, that is, if this second one is not present, then it is an unnatural birth, one which should be regretted.
For when an embryo has come out on its feet, and the body of it has come out before the head of it, and its feet and hands one or two, or the head and hands of it: or has come out in a twist, and figures like these, which are not to be regretted.
It is therefore necessary for the obstetrician to be prudent and careful in all these matters, and to guard himself against error and deception: and I am showing you every figure from them, and how the faculty of it functions, and pointing out on it.
When the fetus has come out of his mother's womb by its own natural power, and it is heavy upon the woman, and her parto is difficult, and she is already weak: then make her sit down on a chair, or let the women support her: and pour over her the juice of foenugraea, and with wet oils.
Then the Obstetrician shall introduce his finger between her small fingers, and shall find with it the second child, and shall dry it with his nail, until he has taken what is in her from moisture: and he shall press the woman's belly, until the child goes down.
If it does not go down, then the woman should be made to lie in a bath of foenugraa juice with Sisam oil.
Then order her to compress herself after the bath, and let her sneeze with a stopwatch, and hold her nose and mouth for an hour. For the child will come out immediately.
If two hands of the child come out first, then it should be reduced with ease little by little. If it does not yield in the entrance, then place the woman on a chair, and lift her feet up: then bring the chair down to the ground: and let the woman hold herself so that she does not fall with the shock.
If the hands do not come out, and the child dies: then cut them open, and take out what remains of the child: and tie her hand with a cloth, and take it out with equality: for he will come out.
The exit of the child is at its feet. When the child comes out at its feet, then it should be made to go up: and gradually turn the child around: then make it even.
Then take one of its feet, and slowly extend it.
When they have come out as far as the hips, then order her to compress herself, and let her sneeze with a stopwatch: for she will come out if God wills it.
And if he does not go out with that which we have mentioned, then bring back the fetus little by little until you put it in its natural form. For he will go out then when the exit is easy.
If it is forbidden to go out with all that we have mentioned: then take from the mucilaginous aloe, and from the sesame oil, and from the dissolved gum: and strike it all together in a good mortar: and then rub it with the hand of a woman, and her lower part. Then make her sit in warm water until she has hyperpnea.
When you see therefore that her lower parts are already warmed, then make him put on the myrrh: and let him lie. When therefore he has held the sief for an hour, then make her sit on a chair. Then make her sneeze: and squeeze her mouth and nose: and press the lower part of her womb with a gentle compression. For fire will come out immediately.
The exit of the fetus over the knees and hands. When it has gone out according to this form, then put your hands slowly. Then the woman shall rise up on her neck, and let her feet hang down to the lower part: and she herself shall lie on a bed, and shall spread her hands. Then squeeze her above the navel little by little. Then draw out what is under her feet from the pubic hair, until it is prepared in the lower part. If the fetus does not go out, then take her feet, and move them with a violent movement. Then squeeze what is above the navel little by little, until the fetus ascends to the upper parts. Then put your hands on it, and make it even little by little: and command the woman, that she squeeze, until the fetus goes out.
The exit of the fetus hanging laterally from the hands. Let it be drawn out in reducing your hands. But if he cannot reduce her, then let him send for a woman, and let her walk.
But if she cannot walk, then let her lie on a bed: and strike her thighs violently.
Then apply the ointment you have prepared from mucus.
That if she catches fire, then let her sit on a chair. Then study the reducing of the hand, and fix it in the natural position: and command the woman to sneeze, and tell her to compress herself until she has gone outside.
Exit the child from the neck of its mother, with open arms, and it is facing towards her back. It should be that the midwife hold the baby's hand, then turn it gradually, and smooth it with ease.
But when it is even, then put it on the poultice which we have prepared from oil and mucus.
Then command her to move slowly. But when you have done this, then let her sit on a chair, and tell her to lean to the right. Then command her to compress herself: and make her sneeze with a handkerchief.
Exit the prepared child on the side. When it came out through the opening of its mother in this way with the second, then cut the second with your fingernail, until it is discharged from moisture.
But if it hangs over the face of the baby, and its neck, then cut it from the navel: lest it should be retained, and die.
Then push the baby inside, until you put it in its proper place: and command the woman to compress herself at times: for himself shall come out from the exit lightly.
Exit the twins, or a multiple birth. You should know that twins are often born: and sometimes three, and four. Indeed, this is strange, and seldom occurs.
Indeed, this is strange, and seldom occurs. It is a thing out of nature, and they do not live entirely within the skin: but they contain them, though they multiply, by two ones: and they are separated by a slit, distinguishing between them a tied navel of each one.
And when they come out, they come out easily like a baby coming out of a natural exit, and they come out with a loud exit, as we have told you.
That if some of them are difficult at birth, and they reach to that which we have said from the figures of unnatural things, then take care of them as we have told you: and let it sit on a soft cloth, and make what it makes with ease and tardiness, and create itself according to all the figure with that which is prepared by the inventor leading towards salvation.
Remembrance that it forms in the womb out of embryos, and they are aborted.
When one is formed in the womb, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and more than ten: and already proven to me that a woman has emitted seven, and another eleven, all of them formed.
That which was done by the measurement of the glorious sage.
This then, all of it, it is necessary that it should be in the knowledge of obstetrics. Perhaps, indeed, it will come to that which is similar to that: oppose it, then, with that which is necessary:
Chapter LXVII.
Regarding the extraction of a dead fetus.
When you care about the dead fetus with that which I said in the division from medication, and does not come out, and force yourself to use the operation with the hand, then it is necessary for you to consider.
If then the woman is of sound health and is not with any of the accidents from which she fears losing herself: then it is necessary that she should lie down on a bed, on her back, and should have her head наклон된 to the bottom, and her legs raised: and the servant should hold her from two sides, or tie her to the bed, so that her body is not taken out during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the bone of the mother with wet oils and mucilage of althaea, and fenugreek, and linseed meal.
Then the midwife shall wet her hands with these oils and mucilages: then she shall insert herself into the mother with ease. Then she shall seek out the place where the umbilical cord is attached to the fetus, and the suitable places for that.
Consider therefore then, if the fetus is ready to descend over its head: then insert the hooks into his eyes, or his neck, or his mouth, or his palate, or under his beard, or in his chest, or in close places by the ribs, and under its nipples.
If however the descent is over its feet, then in the ridge, and in the middle of its ribs.
And it is necessary that she hold the hook with her right hand: and place a ring on it in that which is between the fingers of her left hand: and insert herself with ease, and fix the hook in some of those places which we have mentioned, until she has reached the loose part.
Then she shall fix another hook opposite to it, or a third, if she is able to: so that there is an equal tension, and it does not lean towards one side.
Then it shall be extended with an equal extension, and not an extension according to the only straight line, but let it move on all sides, so that the exit is eased: as happens when a tooth is being extracted.
And it is necessary in that which is between that, so that the extension is softened. That if a part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife insert some fingers with oil and turn them from the part which is retained, so that they release it.
If then a part of the fetus is going out, then the hooks shall be moved to a higher place: do this until the entire fetus has come out.
If then a hand goes out before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it by contraction: then it is necessary that a cloth be spread over it. Then extract it until it is all out, cut it or in the joint of the plant, or on the bed: and so you should do in the other hand and in the two feet.
If, however, the head of the fetus is large, or if it has suffered a rupture during delivery, or if there is water in its head: then one should insert between the fingers the Spatulimile spinosa [a type of spoon], and find out with it the head, and extract the water; or tear off with the instrument called Almisdac [a type of scalpel]: whose form arrives with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter that follows.
Similarly, if the fetus is of a large head nature, then one should separate the hair with oil: or extract him out with the Misdach [a type of instrument], as we have said. Then pull out the bones with forceps.
If it is the head that comes out, and there is a rupture at the fork  [i.e., the neck]: then find out, until the moisture that is in the chest is poured out.
If it is not complicated, and does not submit to the exit: then cut the head prematurely, according to what is possible for you.
If the lower part of the body is aphmomated, or if there is water in it: then you should open it up, until the moisture comes out from it.
If, however, the fetus is above his own feet, then the attraction of it is easy, and its direction to the mouth of the mother is light.
If it is ruptured at the navel, or at the chest: then you should extract him out with a cloth that you have wrapped around your hand: and find out the navel, or the chest, until what is in them comes out.
If other limbs are taken away, and then the head returns: then insert the left hand of the midwife. If, however, the mouth of the mother is open, then insert your hand into the depth of the womb, and ask with it the head, and pull it out with your fingers up to the mouth of the womb: and then insert one hook, or two hooks, and pull him out with it.
If the jaw is clamped, because of the heat that has been caused to it: then he should not work on it, but rather at that time administer an infusion of wet, thick things; and administer plasters; and let him sit in water which softens and moistens.
If the fetus is on the side, then it is possible that it will be evened out; then he should administer what we have said about the single fetus.
If this is not possible, then he should cut short and pull out.
And you should not leave anything at all inside for the second time.
So when you have finished your operation, then administer what we have said about hot apostems that occur in the wombs.
If blood flows, then he should go down into the waters of stifness, and administer the remaining cure.
And I myself have already seen a woman, in whose womb a dead fetus was; and then she was impregnated with another force, and after that a different dead fetus was also. Then after a long time an apostema occurred for her in the navel, and it swelled up, until it opened up: and it began to discharge pus.
So I was called to her cure, and I treated her for a long time; and the wound was not healed.
Then I put on the wound some strong plasters of attraction; and she came out from her place, with her jaw. Then a few days went by for her, and she came out with another jaw. So I was amazed from there, because there is no jaw in the womb.
I thought that they were bones of a dead fetus.
So I questioned the wound, and I pulled out many bones, while there was a woman in better dispositions; and she has been thus for a long time, and she comes out from her place with little pus.
And I do not make this strange, unless there is knowledge and help for it, which the healer of the art uses with his hand in the cure.
¶ De forma instrumentorum necessarium in extractione foetus.
The shapes of the instruments necessary for extracting a fetus.
Here is the figure of the twist that opens the womb:
Here is the figure of the strigentor, which are equal in length to the books, with two twists at each end of two beams. However, this twist should be made slightly thinner than the strigentor: and in order that it may be made, let it be of ebony or of basswood.
And the width of each beam should be as wide as two fingers; and the edge of each of these two beams is as wide as a finger, and their length is the palm and half; and there are two pieces in the middle of the two beams, which have been already fixed on both sides, whose length is half a palm and slightly more: and the width of either is almost two fingers, or slightly less.
And these two pieces are inserted into the mouth of the womb, so that they open with them when you twist the two twists.
Here is another figure similar to it, but thinner and lighter.
Let it be made of ebony wood or basswood, according to the similarity of the forceps. However, at the end of it there are two pieces, as you see here above; and the length of each of these pieces is almost a palm; and the width of either is two fingers.
When you want to open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, her feet hanging down from the bed, and open what is between her thighs. Then insert these two pieces joined together into the womb; and you should hold the lower end of the instrument between her thighs. Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with the forceps, evenly according to the quantity that you want from the opening of the womb's mouth; until the Obstetrix does what she wants.
Here is the figure of the other twist, which the ancient sayers called the propelling one, by which the fetus is propelled:
Form of al-Misdad, who is healing the great head: and he makes it like a plier, which has teeth on the end, as you see.
And when it is made round, as a plier, according to this form, as you see, which has teeth like serrated teeth, so that it cuts and presses.
Form of One-spined Winch.
Form of Two-spined Winch.
Form of Scissor having two extremities to cut off the head.
Form of two scissoring arms which also hold and support.
This instruments all are used, and the more they multiply in their kind, and are prepared by the artisan, the faster they are in their work, and the higher among men because of their quantity.
Therefore do not despise these instruments, although they are made by you, who are prepared, while they are used by others because of their efficiency and convenience. For there is no excuse for their necessity.
Head 78.
On the Extraction of the Second.
When the Second is retained after delivery, then you should take care that it does not retain its weak position, so that it can breathe easily. Then you shall make her sneeze with a device, and tightly grip your hand upon its nose. If then she exits through this, it is good.
If not: then take a staff, and pierce through the lid with it; and place in it herbs opening up the nose, such as yarrow, chamomile, fennel, mint, saffron, and marshmallow, and caraway; take any of these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them with water, and put them by fire.
Then place an arrow of willow (bough) over the hole of the pot, and a second end within the nose; and let her hold it until the steam from the opening of the nose has dried up.
Then I make her sneeze, as we have said. For the second time she will come out with ease.
But if after this cure she still remains and does not go out: then direct the obstetrician to dip his hand in sesame oil, or mucilaginous aloe. Then he enters into the vagina, and asks her if she feels any pain. But when he has found her, then he takes her and extends her little by little.
But if she is attached deep within the uterus, then he enters his hand, following what we have described, until he finds the Secundina, and slowly pulls her out according to the right direction so that the matrix does not get caught on the strong pull: it should be, so that it can be changed easily from the left and right sides: then the quantity of the pull is added. She herself will obey then, and move away, and free herself from the adhesion.
But if the os of the uterus is constricted, as we have already described: take care of her with sneezing, and after the medicine with herbs.
But if she does not go out with all that we have described, then be careful not to tire yourself out by insisting on her during the process of extraction.
But it is necessary that when she goes out from the os of the uterus, there are some ligaments attached to the woman's loins. Then sterilize her with a four-fold ointment. For this reason it will decay her after a few days, and dissolve, and go out.
But when it decays, an evil smell rises from it to the stomach and head, and injures that one with sickness. But it is necessary so that suitable suffumigations be administered to it.
Some of the ancient ones have already experienced suffumigation with mustard and dried fig.
Form a tool for suffumigating the woman during the retention of the Secundina and during the periods.
Let the skin be similar to that of a fowl or a goat; and let the edge be placed wide upon the fire; and let the smoke be placed above plums; hold it, until that smoke is consumed; and let another be held.
Head LXXIX.
On the Treatment of an Unbroken Anus.
Many boys are born with their anuses intact, and these have been affected by the subtle sirocco of Syphus. Therefore, the midwife should pierce that sirocco with her finger; and if she is not able to do so, let her pierce it herself with a sharp Spatulim; and let her take care not to touch the serpent.
Then put thereon wool wet in wine and oil. Then heal that wound with ointment, until it is healed.
But if you suspect that it is being affected by the wine and oil, then put a lead pipe in the hole for many days, and let it be removed when the boy wishes to defecate.
And sometimes the anus is affected by wine or oil from congestion of the wound or pus. Therefore let that consolidation be removed, and then heal it with the above-mentioned things, as I have said in the treatment of an absent anus with lead pipe and oil.
Head LXXX.
On the Treatment of Fistulas Which Occur in the Lower Parts.
A fistula which occurs in the lower parts are a protuberance and grossness near the anus: or in the space of one part: and is a single fistula, or several.
Therefore when that protuberance is old, it opens, and from it runs a watery white discharge, or subtle pus.
And when some of these fistulas are penetrating. Therefore the penetrating ones are known by that which issues from defecation and windiness, when a person with diarrhea uses it; and perhaps it issues from them without wind.
And some of these fistulas are, when they penetrate into the space up to the skin, and up to the edge of the pubic bone. And they are penetrating from them up to the joint of the hip, and up to the node of the tail.
But from that which is recognized The penetrating fistula up to the anus, and also from the non-penetrating one, that is, when you insert your index finger into the anus: and insert a thin tentulum in the fistula out of iron or brass: when there is no curvature.
That if in that there is a curve: then insert into it a thin tentulum or a small piece of wool from the hair of the horse, until you feel the tentulum, or a small arrow in your finger.
That if you do not feel it within, and there proceeds from the opening nothing of discharge, nor is it hot or cold as I have said: then you will know that it is not a penetrating one: therefore turn your attention to cure.
And when the fistula is penetrating up to the scrotum, or up to the meatus of the urine: then the meaning of it is the discharge of urine from it, and its prohibition from this so that the place becomes hardened with medicines.
But if it is penetrating up to the joint of the hip, or up to the mouth of the hip: then the sign of it is, that it should reach the tentulum up to there, if there is no curvature up to the mouth: and the finding of pain in the surrounding part, and that it discharges pus from it at all times: and that it does not dry up in it with the medication, nor becomes hardened with unguent.
And in these fistulas there is no cure at all: and the cure of them is a labor and vain toil from foolish doctors, over whom is created.
But in that which is not penetrating, and is not old, there is hope for a cure with a bandage: for I tell you, and have already proved it: and it is, so that the sick man lies between your hands on his back: and wipe the legs of him up to above his hips, and his hips are bent towards his belly. Then introduce the lead, or air, if it is in a winding fistula, until you know where the thread goes.
If, however, he feels it weak around a certain part, then it is necessary that you introduce your index finger into the part.
If, however, you feel that the thread has already entered your finger without touching it, and between your finger and the skin: then you know for certain that it is penetrating: so don't worry about it, because it is not a cure of his, as we have said.
They said, however, that he heals in some people by meat, and from the treatment of which he hopes to be cured, i.e., as it happened before, introduce the brand new fire into the fistula according to its length, and introduce the same fire into the fistula until it reaches a certain part. Then repeat that again twice or three times until you know that all the added and filtered meat is like a feather of an owl's wing.
Then the cure of that with a liniment of oil, until those meats come out, which have been burned: and then the cure of that with an ointment which generates meat and consolidates it.
If he heals, then it is good.
And if not, then he does not heal with any other cure ever.
And if the thread comes out, and does not come to your finger, which is in the anus, and is between the thread and a certain skin: and you see the fistula in that part which follows the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you will see that it dries up what is in the fistula, until it is dried where the end of the thread is, and the thread is released and falls.
Then clean those filtered meats which are like feather of an owl' wings so that nothing remains of them.
If, however, he overcomes you with blood, and dissolves between you and the operation - let those meats go: then it is better that it happens, and a faster cure, cauterize it with fire, or with sharp medication.
For cautery is of good habits when it gathers with fire, and gives heat to the flesh, and cuts off blood, and dries up moisture.
Then that care with liniments of the butter in oil, or with rags torn, until the place expels pus, and the flesh dried up goes out.
Then that care when the wound with consolidated ointments, producing hard flesh: and are the medicines in which are staphylitis and drying out.
For when they are healing, then already are cured: and do not make an iteration.
But if the Fistula has come to deep place of the anus, and is elongated from the superfluity of the body: then introduce your finger into the anus, and ask him.
But if you feel trying, and between you, and among him is a weapon of the sharp one, or flesh, and is near penetration: then is not the operation in that, unless after a second time trust and hope.
That is, for it is administered in him one of two ways: or as it cauterizes itself, as we said: or as it severs away, until the consequence of its concavity, so that it becomes possible to you to introduce a liniment, and from near. And do not proceed much with the section, that you do not fall upon a contending part of an anus, and happens on the ill-timed end of the excretion without will. But do it with care, lest you should hurt some part of the body: and make a cut to see whether it is able to bear the cutting. Then that care with him which we have said.
Perhaps is healed: or prolongs him the wound, and cleanses it after he has dried up it until near of an anus, as we have said, or with a trying, or with another acuter instrument. Then cleanse those flesh that are filthy in the section, until where you can with the examination.
Then try a restoration of all the wounds with the section, and a hole that consolidates above: and remains a Fistula open in the interior part of an anus, and is lighter over the ill-timed.
And sometimes a fistula is followed in this way: and that is when you push a probe into the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and margin of the anus; then take hold of the extreme end of the punctured one, which is like a needle, that is, the corium, in this form. And push into it a thread of thread with five threads, and around it. Then push a probe with a thread into the fistula, until you get a congealed mass.
If then it is penetrating into the inner margin of the anus near, then take out the thread from that hole: so that you push your finger into the anus, and pull out the end of the thread, and bring the two ends together at once: and tighten them well, until those flesh that are between the two ends of the thread fall off, and then care for the wound, until it heals over, and is well.
If, however, the opening of the fistula does not penetrate: then make it penetrate in any way you can, unless it is in a deep place. For it is not good for you, that you should make it because of the snake, and do not hit yourself.
Then do with it as we have said, until it is well.
The form of the spike which is found in the fistula, whose sharpness is sharp enough, and one side is not sharp, so that it does not hit that which is not necessary, as you see.
Chapter LIII.
Regarding the suture of hemorrhoids, from which runs blood from their incision: and care for the sores.
There are hemorrhoids in two ways. Or, indeed, they are inside the anus, like carbon charcoal, or plums: or almost like grain. And some of them are small, and some are large: and blood runs from them always, and is one, and they are many. And they are outside of the body, and at the extremities thereof.
Indeed those which are outside of the body, are for the most part few in quantity of humidity, from which runs yellow water, or a little blood by steady course: and they are according to the color of the body.
And the cure which is within the body, is, as you prescribe to the sick person that he should strain himself: and it is to be expressed, until it comes out of the anus, and appears to you as a kind of wax. Therefore therefore hang them with a hook: or hold them with your nail. Then cut them where they grow in their roots.
If they do not hold themselves with hooks, because of their humidity and their own softness: then grasp them with a sharp cloth, or with a twine made of a double-twined thread, and draw them out with your fingers. Then cut them, and sprinkle over them after the incision some warm powders, that they may stand in their place of cautery. Or cauterize them according to what has gone before in the chapter on cauterization. Then cure them with the remaining cure, until they are healed.
That if the anus does not yield to coming out, then use enemas on the sick person, in which there is a small mordency, that it may moisten with him who is in the anus, and obeisce to coming out quickly, when it comes out with the sick person.
If however the warts are taken out from the anus, then their condition is lighter, easier: and it is that you take them with your nail, or that you take them with a hook, and cut them off. Then cure them with the above-mentioned method until they are healed.
And who repels the cutting with iron, then it is necessary that you administer a suture to them according to this manner. Take a thread covered with wax, and insert it into the wound. Then draw the warts towards the top, and make the thread penetrate with a needle into the root on the other side: and turn the two ends of the thread round, in the lower part of the needle, and let them cross each other: and tighten the warts with a strong twist. Then take the thread and remove it from outside.
Then place a bandage on all of them except one; and do not tie your own, so that it will run free from any excess blood.
Then place a cloth soaked in rosewater or milk on top of it and place the wound thereon; and instruct the sick person to rest. Then remove the bandage when he has fallen asleep.
When therefore the wounds have fallen off, take care of them with ointment and with the rest of the cure, until they are healed.
The Care of Fractures. For often accidents happen from dried up faeces and natural constriction.
When therefore they are a little dry and there is no medicine to them; then it should be rubbed with the dung of swallows or with your own finger, until they are moistened, and the upper skin which prevents them from healing taken off. Then take care of them, until they are healed as much as is necessary.
If however they do not heal; then rub them again with a more vigorous rub than before, until they bleed profusely, and then take care of them until they are healed.
The Cure of Scurvy, whether in sailors or not; and of sore throats, and of flies.
Chapter LIII.
You should know that scurvy is a small round knot like the color of the body, similar to a clăuus on the head; and it appears throughout the whole body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes; and causes pain when walking.
Then it should be cut off what is at the root of the claw-like shape, and held with pliers or a pin, and rooted out from its root.
Then take care of that; and if you have a caustic, treat it as it is described in your own chapter.
But of the sore one there is only a small eminence, rough, filthy, round, rising from the surface of the body. And many times accidents happen to the hands of boys.
And the treatment for this is that you stretch the tendon, and hit it with your fist: or you tie it with silk thread: or you pull it with a hair, until it falls off. And if it is a vein, you cauterize it with fire, or with sharp medicine: and these veins that are turned in, and not turned in with an instrument that I call a 'tool', are eradicated.
But a bug that is also a small eminentia that is filtered, thick, on the surface of the body, waddling into the depth deeply: and when it comes to be cold, it feels in it a similar stinging of a bug, and becomes all over the body: and much of it is made in the hands.
And the treatment for this is that you take a tube from a goose feather, or a strong quail's feather: and you put the tube on the bug, until it holds a circle of the tube on its parts. Then you roll your hand with the tube, until you separate what is in the circumferent of the bug: and you put it in the depth of the flesh, and you eradicate the bug from its root.
And if the vein, make this with a tube of air, or iron, according to this form.
Let the tube be placed on the surface of the vein at a sublimital point, drawing a dull noise that облегчает the appreciation of the finger and its revolution.
And if you want to cauterize the bug according to what was said above, in the cauterizing of Athelil in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter 83.
§ On the forms of instruments that are used to administer poultices in illnesses of the hen, and for the solution of the eye, and for the colon.
When the poultice is made of silver, or of gold-plating, or of brass, or of hammered brass.
And when it is made of these small instruments, and of great ones, according to those in which they are administered.
And thus that which is given to the care of boys' lungs, let it be thin; and of those who are weak or painful, let their steam be as well.
And thus the large enema.
Make the canna, that is, the upper part in which it is tied uter, wide according to this manner: and let there be a distinction so that it is tied as you see, and the lower extremity which enters into an anum, be dull, that is, not open, soft, greatly, drawing towards subtility: and on one side of it there are two holes, and on the other side a hole.
And let the width of the hole be according to the thickness of the rays, and the thicker the smaller, and let uter in which are placed medicines from animal matter: or from paper piece, which is according to the form of a small aspirator: whose root is a palm one.
And let many holes be pierced through as it revolves, and let the space which is between each hole be the width of a finger. Then introduce into those holes a strong thread from raw silk, which is from ten threads, or about them, and bind it with the uter like an aspirator. And when this uter has been put into it, let it be pulled up in the canna between two distinctions with strong constriction. Then let the enema be made with it.
And this is the shape of the uter here depicted, and of the holes.
The quality of making enemas with it is this: that you fill the uter or the uesica with medicine which has been heated according to the tolerance of the nurse: and let it not be hot greatly, or cold greatly.
Then let the sick person lie on his back, and raise his legs upward: and place below him a thump, that is, a mattress over which men lie, or a blanket.
Then dip the extremity of the enema in oil, or in albus ovilis, or in mucilaginous foenugraeum, or similar. Then introduce yourself into the anus with ease. Then let the assistant take hold of him with both hands and express it out with a strong thrust until all that is in the clitoris has come out into the intestine.
Then remove the clitoris and lift up his weak legs against the wall.
If the medicine makes him want to defecate, then hold on as long as you can. And if he sleeps all night with it, it is more difficult to treat.
But if you clean him out with a solution of the urinary tract and push forward his defecation: then repeat the clisterization until he is healed.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful pustules in the anus, then sit in a mild bath, lube up gently, and express the clitoris with the fingers of the hand, letting it out slowly.
And this is the form of a soft clister that sits on top of which there is a tight skin.
Chapter LXXXII
I have already said in the division of the treatment of wounds which belonged to the book, and I say here the cure of these with the hand, and with the second aid.
I say, then, that wounds differ according to that by which they are made, and according to the place on which the wound falls.
Thus, the wounds that are often made, are like the impact of stones: or a cut of a knife, or a blow with a lance, or a piece of wood, or an arrow: and similar things from many other things.
But wounds that are made according to the places of the body are, such as a wound that falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the hip: and similar ones from the limbs.
And I am telling about the cure of certain wounds, that I may put forward the reasoning and rule for the remaining wounds.
And I shall begin with simple wounds of the head; because the memory of the compositors will come at the beginning of chapter three.
I say this. When it happens in the head, a simple wound, and there is no fracture of bone: consider then, if it is from a rock-throw, or similar, and has already broken the skin only a little: and it is a great wound, and fear for the consequences of gangrene of the heat: then approach, and perform cephalic phlebotomy immediately: and do not delay that: and draw out from it according to the quantity of its virtue: if there is nothing prohibitive against phlebotomy, especially if the blood which flows from the wound is few. And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part.
And let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the wounded part. And let the sick one beware of over-indulgence in wine and rich food.
But if anything prohibes moderation, then he should retreat from meat, and approach not to wine.
And place over the wound if it happens that there is a hot aposteme, infused oil in rose water alone, or with wine in which there is stliction.
But if you are secure from a hot aposteme, then place over the wound if it is recent with its own blood, and has not changed its air, the powder which I shall describe later: and if it has already changed its air, then place over it some ointment, until it heals.
But if the wound is large, or from an incision of a knife, and similar: and if its edges do not come together by means of powder, then join them together with sutures, according to what I shall describe later concerning the suturing of wounds of the legs.
But if the wound has already touched bone, and hangs, and there is no retention of it, unless in a small suspension: then incision. Then care for the wound with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh at a place of skin, and command the sick person to eat food in which there is coarseness, such as are heads of meat, and cooked wheat, until it is like a pulse: and that also.
If pus has set in and there is no attachment of the bone: then incise the whole putrefied part and throw it away: then take care of that.
But if there is an artery in these wounds or a vein from which blood flows: and it is not cut by medicines, then inquire about the artery. If therefore you have sewed her up without cutting her, then dry her with Spumil, or tie her up. That if necessity compels you to do this which I have said, then cauterize it, until blood is cut off.
But if these wounds are small and simple, then the matter of them is easy, light: so that you put dust on them: for they become hardened before they change.
The way of the powder for burnings. Take a part of olive oil, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of burnt limestone: mix them all up well, and sift them: and fill them with powder, and bind them with good binding, until they adhere to the wound well, and are congealed with blood.
Then tie it up well from above with powder, and let it go, and do not take it off until it has healed, so that it does not open. For the medicine will not drive it out until it is cured.
And when it has done this by itself, for you do not have olive oil or dragon' blood, the same operation is made in many large wounds, when they are put on and bound, and their own blood which does not change the air.
That if it has been somewhat altered by the air, especially when it is in summer time, then this powder's intention is not in position: so take care of it with that which I have said, so that you put on it some digestible ointment: or put on it a dust made from barley flour, made with water and honey, until pus is discharged. Then take care of those left over with cure, until they are healed.
If it should happen that there is a fracture of the bone and it is small, then extract it with the Gestra: and I will already say that I am treating the fractures of the head, because what follows is about to come.
§ On injuries of the neck.
If an injury has occurred in the neck, then there is no difference in its treatment if it is on one side or the other, and there is also no difference in treating a single injury of the head.
But if an incision has already been made on the nerve of the neck or an artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in its treatment unless it is used to produce a stinging sensation, like pepper, and bleeding, and similar things. For nerves are harmful, and hurt them.
And do not put anything cold on a wound at all: for the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuance is with the brain, which is a superior member: and let whatever is used in treatment be of the nature of lye, like lye mixed with sweet water sometimes infused with oil, or with rosewater oil, and turpentine, when it is rinsed also with sweet water: and also mineral stones, according to this method, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer a stitch: or cover its edges with powder. Then take care of the wound, until it heals.
But if the injury is deep, or has occurred in a hollow on the lower part of it where pus has already gathered, then pierce it in a depressed place there.
If it should happen that an incision has been made on the nerve of an artery and the blood flow is followed: then separate it, or dry it, and tie it: or burn it if necessity demands to do so.
But if the injury has been made by a spine of the guitar, or by all of it, and the skin seems to be sound: then join the skin with a stitch over the neck of the guitar, and do not touch the guitar, but make the wound even, and bring it back into its natural shape. Then tighten him with a ligature and let go for a few days. Then care for the wound with ointment until it heals over.
But if the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then probe it: if there are any bone fragments in it, take them all out, or what you can: and if it is not ready (to heal), let it go until the bone rotten, and its exit is freed.
If the bone is fresh, then powder it with a powder that you knead into it. But if it goes into the nerve and becomes a fistula: then care for it with what is written in his own chapter.
De the surgery of the ulnar nerve.
If there is an impression from a lance or a knife: and the wounds are deep, then examine it carefully. But if from the ulnar a pus comes out, and when it drains from it the patient is weak, then you should know that the bone is deadly.
If it is not deep and is fresh with its own blood: then do not put powder in it from the first hour, nor tighten it so that the blood does not stay in its depth, and run back to the heart, and cause weakness: but put an attractable ointment in it, and loosen it by day.
But if the ointment is not present with you, then put a clean rag on the wound to soak up what comes out of it from the moisture: and let the patient sleep on the bone so that it runs what is collected in it.
But if the wound has passed the three days or more, and there is no spasm of the limbs, nor a bad tremor of the heart, nor constriction in breathing, and its other symptoms are good: then you should know that the bone is healthy. Then care for it with ease, and with the rest of the cure, until it heals over.
If indeed the healing of it is excused, and it has been opened always, then you shall know that it has already become a Fistula. The cure of that itself from its own chapter.
And if there is a scar from an incision with a knife, or it is simple on the surface of the chest, or on the back; then the cure of that itself with what preceded from stitchery, if it is large: or with dust, if it is small.
But if it has already made an impression on the bone, and has cut it out from there with a splinter: then inquire about the fracture, and approach to remove that splinter, if it is separated. But if they are not separated, then dismiss them, until the bone rotten, for the extraction of them is eased.
But as regards the remaining wounds and accidents in the remaining limbs, the judgment in their cure is the judgment which I have mentioned.
Regarding the wounds of the belly, and the exit of the intestine, and the emergence of them.
The disruption which happens in the belly is great, medium, and small.
So from a great disruption, and when the intestine has come out, or the number of intestines.
Why does that happen, and what is the stitchery of them more vigorous and difficult?
And a small disruption also becomes difficult from another mode. This follows, that the reduction of them is more difficult if you do not approach to their entry into their place directly: for when it swells up, it opens, and increases: why does the entry of it become difficult?
Therefore this follows, that a medium disruption is the best: for when it is not difficult to reduce the intestine, as it is difficult in these two species.
Know that the stitchery of the belly is according to four ways.
Two common stitches meet in a stitch of the belly, and in a stitch of the remaining wounds of the body: and two other stitches properly communicate with the remaining wounds of the body. Indeed, they are more proper with the stitch of the wrist; and I tell you one way or another with explanation and demonstration.
I say then, for when the wrist is small and has come away a little from the body, and there is something of the intestine out of it, and it is difficult to reduce it; then it is on account of two or three things. Or because the wound is small, as we have said: Or because there is swelling in the intestine from cold air.
When then is it so? Then you should warm the wound, so that you dip a sponge or a wet cloth in warm water alone. Or you should put it in squill water and hyssop and pepper and stir it with the intestine, until the swelling goes down.
When then does this liquid make the wrist better; and it is better than water alone in resolving inflammation.
When you see the swelling has already resolved, then moisten the intestine with the astringent water in which it was steeped, or make it stronger. For by that means the entrance into it is eased when it is small.
But if the return of the joint after this cure is slow, then find a little cut with the instrument with which they tear the hemorrhoids.
And the first cure is better when it is prepared, whether it be cutting or not; and there is no constraint to do it after necessity and want of the instrument.
Let one part of it be sharp and the other not, and the end a little less acute than the middle; and let it be somewhat like the saw, as you see it.
When then is it prolonged and the intestine goes into it; then let there be a return of it to its own place according to its nature, if possible to that; for it is better.
But when then is the wound wide at the lower part of the wrist; then you should lay him on his back and raise his legs. And if it is in the superior part of the uterus, then put its head and let its chest be higher than its inferior.
And likewise if the disruption is in one of two parts of the uterus, then put your intention and always keep this in mind so that the part where the wound is located is higher than the other.
And thus it should be, so that you will prepare those who are wounded in large wounds and in medium wounds.
But in small wounds, put it according to what is prepared for you.
Then make sure that the faithful minister who holds the entire disruption in his hand is present between your hands: and bring its lips together. Then have someone who follows the thread piece by piece: and this is the common way of sewing one piece.
And it is as you take it, or count it according to the quantity of the width of the wound. Then release from the end of the disruption by a finger's length, that is to say, grasp: and fix now one beyond which you introduce the thread in two ends of the skin, with two ends of sifac that are under the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have already brought together two ends of the skin, and two ends of sifac: and there are four orders.
Then tighten with double thread around the accus a few times from both sides at the same time, until the two lips of the wound are brought together by the decreasing aggregation.
Then release the bulk with your finger too, and fix in it now another one: then make it straight with the thread, as you did with the first one. So therefore do not cease to do this with him while you are holding on to the accus until you have completed the whole constriction of the wound.
And there are accus media between the bulk and the subtility: for the accus subtile very quickly incised the flesh: and the grosses are difficult to enter into the skin: therefore it is necessary that they be of medium subtility and bulkiness.
And it is not appropriate that the needle should be inserted into both ends of the skin which is close: so that the flesh does not quickly be wounded, and the wound does not open before its consolidation, and also does not be stretched with the suture, so that the wound does not be prevented from consolidation.
Then cut the end of the needle so that it does not hurt the patient when he sleeps: and put feathers from cloth on both sides, which hold the ends of the needle: and let them go until you know that the wound has been consolidated.
And this kind of stitch with needles is much more convenient for small wounds. Since it suffices in the stitching of them with one, or two, or around them.
But the second common stitch is, so that you add the four ends: the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of the thread in one line, with a needle in which the filament is equal in thinness and thickness.
Then when you pierce with the needle the four ends, draw it back from the part from which you began, so that the thread hangs from the upper part of the wound: so that there is a stitch, as when clothes are sewn together, and put between every stitch the thickness of the little finger.
This kind of stitch is known to men.
And with this kind of stitch I sewed my own wound, which had happened to a man in his abdomen, who was wounded with a knife, and there was a break in the skin of a hand's width: and there came out from within about two hands' length from the mid-gut, and there was a break in the middle of the belly.
Then I reduced it after he had stood still for twenty-two hours.
So the wound was consolidated in the space which had been for about 15 days: and I nursed him, and he recovered: and he lived many years, restored to his own health.
And the physicians judged that he would not recover.
And it came to pass through a miracle that I did not heal him with the ointment. For I was in a place where the ointment was not found, and there was none of the medicines. I then put on the wound a wet cloth twice a day, and I kept washing it with honey water until it was healed.
Two kinds of sutures I will name according to the report of the teaching.
And it is, as you begin with the sharp suture: and you insert it from the outside toward the inside part.
When the needle enters into the skin, and goes down into a fold according to the length and breadth of all the body: let go of the end of the sutures that you have inserted from outside, and make it penetrate into the other end from inside toward outside in the other extreme.
When you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate according to this in the same extreme end that goes from outside toward inside: and let go of the end of the sutures that you have inserted from outside, and make it penetrate into the other end from inside toward outside in the other extreme. When you have made it penetrate like this at the same extreme end that goes from outside toward inside, and let go of the end of the sutures that you have inserted from outside, and make it penetrate into the other end from inside toward outside: and make it penetrate with your penetration when you make it penetrate in the end that goes from inside toward outside, and make it penetrate with your penetration until it has penetrated all of it.
Then also from this same later side, and with the other end that is from outside, and pull out of the skin where it has penetrated: and let go of the end of the sutures that you have pulled out from the skin.
Then also reduce it in that skin, and with the other end that is from outside, and join together this end of the skin that you have pulled out: and make that end of the sutures that you have joined come together with the skin; and make that one end move, and the other stay still until they are all connected according to that example.
And the top of this suture is as you join the skin together: so that its end that comes from one side goes with the skin; and so that you let go of its other end go on the other side until it is completed.
Second kind of suture, which he called his own, as said Galen.
This speech was related as follows, that they sutured it in the second way, similar to which some physicians do so that they collect all parts according to nature: and they apply one end of the suture to one end of it, and the other end of the suture to the other end. And this is what I tell you.
It is necessary that you fasten this at the end of Mirach close to you from the external side, and cause it to penetrate into the internal part alone: and you dismiss the two ends of the suture. Then reverse the knot, and cause it to penetrate from the external side to the internal part in the two ends of the suture, that is to say, on both sides.
Then reverse both, and also cause them to penetrate from the inside to the outside in the two ends of the suture, that is to say, on both sides: and you reverse both ends of the suture towards the opposite side.
And this mode of suturing is better than the common easy one, and it is a suture whose predecessor's remembrance precedes it.
This is therefore the speech of Galen as well.
And said some: The suture of the hand with two finger bones. That is, so that you put one thread in both bones: and begin with the insertion of the bone, from where it is with you, and cause it to penetrate as far as the other side, following the suture of those who are equal by nature.
And you should know that when the fracture is in the middle of the hand: then the suture of it is more difficult than that of the other places of the hand.
However, the judgment of surgery of wounds is a judgment of the other wounds.
That is, because when you have obtained a wound fresh with its blood, before it rusts itself: and reduce the bowels, and their own flesh, and fit the flesh: then put it on the powder of incisions.
If a wound has been affected by air: then put on the body some ointment, which are present with you, until it makes pus; and let the strands fall, and the sifacs become firm, and the mirach. Then take care of that one as is the treatment for other wounds, until it heals.
But if you do not have with you the medicines, then put on it at once, so that it begins to emit pus, and change it with new one: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.
For you do not need other medication for various wounds, but when the wounds are simple.
But if you are in a time, when a wound communicates with a main member in the injury, then it is necessary that you should dip wool in oil of moderate warmth, or in rosewater oil: and put on it around places which are between the hips, and under the armpits.
That if it feels pain, or punctures, or corruption in his intestines (for this often happens), then take a clister with wine, black, hot: especially if putridity has already set in the intestines, and a penetrating issue has reached the peritonium.
And you should know that what is from the large intestine is easier to heal: and that which is from the small one, is more difficult to heal.
But the intestine which is called Jejunum, does not accept healing from a wound that has happened in it at all: and it is because of its multitude, being from wounds, and size of them, and because of the softness of its body, and closeness of its nerves' nature.
But if the wound that proceeds from an injury is sharp, and you gain it gradually: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
But if it has passed away from it a space, and it has already been made bright, or dark: then you should tighten it with a thread above the place which is darkened from it, so that blood does not flow out. In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.
For this reason, the tendons and arteries are in the zone. Then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place two ends of thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside itself: so that it is lifted away from you by its attraction, and extracted from the zone of the wound, and the pus of the wound is released.
Remember the wound that happened in the intestine.
When the injury occurred in the intestine, and it was small: then it is possible for some people to be restored: indeed, I saw one who was injured in his abdomen with a lance thrust, and there was an arrow in his stomach, and the arrowhead was old: and a fistula was made, and fluid came out of it, and windiness.
Then I applied the cure, until I was not confident in his recovery: and I did not hesitate to examine him, until he was healed, and the site was consolidated.
After I saw the place now consolidated, I feared for the sick, that a bad accident would happen to him in his abdomen: and it did not happen to him from that bad accident. And he remained in better health, eating and drinking, enjoying sex, and entering a bath, and exercising in his exercises.
And some experimenters said, because when it happened in the intestine an arrow, and it was small: then it should be tied according to this method. And it is, so that you get big ant heads. Then gather the two lips of the wound, and place one ant with an open mouth on the two lips of the wound. So when he holds it over it, and tightens his mouth, cut off its head, because it clings to it, and does not let go.
Then place one ant next to the first, and do not stop doing that with the ant after the second quantity of wound.
Then reduce the injury, and apply the arrow. For these reasons, the remaining heads attached to the intestine are removed until the intestine is empty and cured, and it does not harm the sick person.
And now it is possible that the intestine be tied as well with a thin thread: which having been removed from the animal's intestine, is attached to it after it has been introduced into the lump.
And it is, that you take the end of this thread out of the intestine, and much of the flesh be removed. Then tie this thread's end at the edge, with a thin thread wrapped around it. Then introduce this thread into the lump, and along with it the intestine. Then reduce the mass to a rupture.
And this method of sewing with a needle and thread is no more than a second opinion and a matter of trust and hope.
You know that the hole is great and wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines: then it is not a simple matter, nor is its cure complete.
Regarding the care for Zuchamen and Fistulas.
You know that every wound, or old ulcer when it has healed over and become a scar, and does not heal properly, and always discharges pus, and does not close: then it is called universally a fistula wherever it may be in the body, and we call it a Zuchamen.
And a fistula is, according to its nature, a filtered, hard, white nodule: which has no pain, but a wrinkled skin; and because of it, some call it Risati, that is, a tail.
And it is in certain hours moist, emitting pus. And perhaps it splits the moisture in certain hours. And when this moisture is much, and little: and thick, and thin.
And I have already preceded in the division, then when I said wounds, that every wound which does not heal, and does not form flesh within it, is not anything except because of a new cause.
One is because of the scarcity of blood in the body, or because of its malice, or because there is hard flesh between it and over its lips, which prevents the birth of flesh, or because it is full of noise and filth, or because the wound in itself is putrid and the matter that is emitted from it is of bad quality, or because the medicine is incompatible with its cure, or because corruption falling in the region is a kind of plague, or through the nature of the region, as happened in Caesar Augustus, where the digestion of ailments is difficult and healing of abscesses by nature is delayed, or because it has only one jaw, or because its number of bones is small.
And I have already shown you all the causes and signs of these, and their treatments with medicines divided up: and it is necessary here that I should tell you about the treatment of the fistula and the zucca, which is done by a surgical operation with the hand.
So you know that the fistula happens in all parts of the body. For from them are the fistulas that reach the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or the intestines, or urinary bladder, or any of the ribs, or any of the spine vertebrae, or any of the joints of the body by composition: like the hands and feet: and from them are those that reach the vicinity of the main member, and its alike.
Which, then, of these fistulas is of the nature that it is difficult to cure, and does not respond to treatment, and is a source of trouble and ignorance: for example, those that come from the ears, or the eyes.
If it is from a fistula whose depth does not reach these places that I have mentioned: and you hope and trust in its cure, and seek to understand it, then take some trypsin or iron, if the fistula tends towards straightness, and examine it with it.
But if in the fistula there is a curve, then investigate it with a thin plumb. For because of its soothing nature, lead is beneficial for the relief of pain and for healing wounds and sore spots.
If the fistula has multiple openings, it is not possible for you to indicate it with a probe when attempting. Therefore, let the clister be used from its own opening and not from another opening.
For because of the moisture that comes out with the clister, it passes through other openings and runs out from them.
Then inquire after the manner in which it is possible for you to recognize that there is an opening, a nerve, and that the fistula is distant or near: or that there is one fistula whose openings are many, and that it lies over all of it with great strength of your hand; when you question it, as you ask about a sick person, and by the discovery of pain at compression with your hand on the place, and similar indications and causes of accident.
Then, when you stand still with true station, then probe towards cure according to confidence: and is it, that you consider then, if there is a fistula that appears near, or in a place of salutary distance from the joint, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places that I have told you about: then dry up the fistula according to what has been stated before, and take away whatever is in it from filtration, and corrupted flesh that arises in its opening out of flesh, or blood, and similar things: and cure it until it heals.
If, however, the fistula is of a deep depth and is in a straight line: then it should be separated from it as much as possible. Then cleanse it from all of its corrupted flesh.
Then administer lead melted in acute medicines: and insert it into the fistula that you have held with a wire: do this often, until the acid medicine corrodes all of what remains in the fistula's concavity from corruption.
Then restore it with an ointment that generates healthy flesh, until it heals.
If indeed it is not healed by that [remedy], then cauterize it according to what we have narrated.
If indeed the cause is a fistula and it is certified in your presence [that]: then examine that person, and dry that person according to what I have told you: if it does not stop him from anything of new birth, or nerve, or main member, as we have said.
If indeed you find an opening, and there is some corrosion therein, and it is black: then scrape it, until that corruption is completely removed. Then care for that person with what makes the flesh grow on that person, until that person is healed.
That if it does not heal, and it spews out pus as it did before: then you should know that you have not completely eradicated the corruption.
So examine it again [by applying] a second time, and carefully feel its pulse, and clean it with your last bit of strength.
Then restore that person. If indeed it is healed, it is good: and if not, then you should know that that corruption is in the depths of the body, which you have not achieved. So it is not within your power to heal it, unless you let nature take its course with it.
That if the corruption is in the small opening of the throat, and it is possible for you, attract that person with subtle hooks which are suitable for that person.
That if there are many bones, then carefully feel all of them, and do not let go of any of them with your strength.
If indeed it gives you a contrary feeling from any moisture, and there is no fear or mistake in cutting them: then cut those moistures and the flesh, if there is any, and free the bones.
If indeed you are not prepared to remove the bones from your own time, then place on a rotisserie what will decay that person: and let go of that person, until it decays what is around those bones from flesh and moisture.
And keep the fracture in place so that it doesn't heal improperly. And tighten the incision as much as you can manage in your operation. With a hammer and chisel, if possible, cut the bone as much as you can manage in your operation. If not, use sulfur treed with oil: or soaked in Egyptian ointment, or some other ointment made of gold.
For when those particular humors rot and the bones separate from them, it is a relief to remove them, and their attraction to each other.
But if it is a large bone, such as the femur or ilium, and that which is rotten is a part of it, then saw off the last piece until the blackness and corruption are removed. Then restore the bone.
But if what is rotten in it is a large part, and the corruption has reached the bone marrow, then you must cut off the bone, and incise all of it up to the place where the corruption ends: then take care of the bone, until it heals properly.
And I will tell you about the surgery that happened to a man on his thigh, so that it may be an example and help for your operation.
He was a young man of about thirty years of age, to whom there occurred a pain in his thigh, because something moved within him, that is, from the inside, until it reached the leg, and there appeared a great swelling; and he had no external cause.
So, when his time came with the error of the doctors, until the swelling was opened, and many materials entered with him. And his treatment was delayed until his leg was wrapped up, and many openings were made in him: all of which discharged pus, and the body's humors.
So he had treatment by a multitude of doctors for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of hands, until I was called in, and I saw his leg, and the materials that were flowing out of its openings at a great rate: also, all of his body was covered with a yellow color, and his skin had become very thin.
I therefore attempted to enter one of the openings of the mouth, and the attempt reached the mouth.
Then I examined all the openings thoroughly: and I found them to reach up to themselves on each side from all parts of the thigh.
Then I turned away, and followed along one of the openings, until I detected a part of the bone: and I found it to be corrupt: which was already corrupt, and deteriorated, and putrid, and pierced, as far as it penetrated into the marrow.
Then I sharpened what had been detected by me, and made it ready from corrupt bone.
And I took away what was not in the bone except that corruption, which I cut off and sharpened. And I had already eradicated it.
Then I placed the repair of the wound with long-drying medicines. And it was not consolidated.
Then I attempted again, and detected on the bone above the first detection: and I found a continuous corruption with the bone, and sharpened what seemed right to me from that corruption as well.
Then I tried to repair it. And it was not restored.
Then I detected on the same thing again, and did not cease to pierce the bone in detail, and tried to repair it: and it was not repaired until I pierced from the bone a little palm, and took that out with its marrow.
Then I repaired it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated, and healed: and this iteration in the operation of it, and its cutting, would not have been necessary except for the weakness of the nurse, and her lack of tolerance, and my fear over it from death: because it happened to him at all times from the bad syncope of discharge.
He was therefore healed with a whole healing: and flesh grew in the place of the bone, and a good disposition came to his body, and his strength returned: and he recovered in his dispositions: and he did not feel any opposition when walking at all.
But if the jaw is突出 and already broken: then one should bind it up, in this way: that you take a ligament, and tie it firmly at the end of the prominent bone: and instruct someone who will hold it upwards: and put another ligament, from a thicker wool, on the first ligature. Then bind the flesh up over the bone which is on either side of the jaw: and extend its end so that you can pull the flesh downward: and you shall cover the flesh over the place which you wish to bind, so as not to cut the flesh with the saw.
Place a board or board below the bone on either side: for when you do this, it is not forbidden to cut the corrupt flesh.
And it should be that the binding is a little over the corrupted place, so as not to appear on the appearance of the bone; and does not appeal to its own force, but forces itself with the force of another binding.
If the bone is corrupted and not prominent, then a portion of it remains with another part: corruption is in its middle or in some part of it; then you shall cover all the flesh from every part. Then place the board below.
Then bind that first part from which the corruption proceeds, until it continues to be bound on the other side; and let the binding be of about the same length from corruption as we said above.
If the corruption is in the joint, then cut that joint which is corrupted, and bind the bone where it continues on the other side.
But if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is nothing of genius in that; there is only an injury.
If the corruption is in the hand or foot shaft: then the matter is very difficult. But you should inquire how the corruption appears to you. And cut it and clean it up according to whatever arrangement you can make, and with whatever genius it rectifies itself to you: when it does not do you any harm by cutting the vein or nerve.
And you shall know that the incisor and serrated saws are many for cutting these bones, according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and subtlety and magnitude and perfection and hardness and their rarity. Therefore, it is necessary that you prepare an instrument suitable for each kind of operation.
And you shall know, these operations require a long study on the instrument with which you work. And the knowledge of these ways will be a testimony to your understanding of the manner of sickness; for then you will already have found through yourself that which suits him from among the instruments for every illness.
And I am confirming to you, at the end of this chapter, the number of instruments which you place as examples on which you operate, and which you have tried out on other patients.
The form of another saw.
The form of the razors joined together. Let the head of this razor be shaped like a star-shaped clavulus; and its points be shaped like the points of an אלישטפיגי (elishtefigi).
And it does not fit, unless it rubs with the head of joined razors when it is worn; for it has a large and broad lip.
The form of the larger razor.
The form of the wide razor.
The form of the razor in which is a concave curve.
The form of another thin razor.
The form of the razor with its curved extreme end.
The form of a small, thin razor for the tip of the finger.
This is similar to a chisel and its edge is like a saw: it is displayed in many places from the chiseling of bones.
Form of the chisel which is suitable for its chiseling that which is pierced out from the bones.
Its edge is triangular, its extremes are acute.
Fit from India. And likewise it is necessary that all which we have said of the chisel, and of the chisel, and of the saw.
Of incisions extremes, and sawing bones.
The extremes putrefy, or for an extrinsic cause, or an intrinsic one.
When therefore the patient was cured by the cure of medicines, and does not confer the cure: and you see corruption to affect a member, which does not recur any injury: then it is necessary that you should cut off that part where the consequences of corruption, so the sick one may be taken away from death, or from the malice which is greater defect of member.
And the sign which has happened to that is, that the member is disgraced, until it is cured: that fire has burned it itself, or has putrefied after its color: until that corruption has affected that part, which follows that member, and creeps into all the body.
Therefore, with incisions, and likewise if the cause of corruption is from percussion of some venenosos: such as scorpioni sea, and vipers, and weasels, and similar ones.
If therefore corruption, or percussion is in the extreme of a finger, then cut off the finger, and not leave any space for corruption, so that it may affect to the remaining hand.
And likewise if has happened in the hand, then cut off it from the root of a chisel, and not leave any space for corruption, until it takes up to the chisel of the forearm.
And if it has penetrated into it, then cut off the forearm at the elbow joint.
But if corruption has passed over it, and you see that it is swollen around the hip: then in that is death by the nurse. And to administer apart from that cure, is the quantity of virtue.
And likewise do with the foot, when corruption appears in the toe, then cut it at the root of a knot: and if it enters into the shin, then cut the whole foot. But if it ascends up to the knee, then cut the leg at the joint of the knee.
That which if corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no art in it, except cutting off, and leave the sick to death.
And the mode of incising a limb, or of stretching it out, is that you should tie the ligament below, which you would cut: and tie another ligament above the place. And extend one minister of a ligament to the lower: and extend another minister of a ligament upwards to the top. And thou shalt separate the flesh which is between these two ligaments, with a broad chisel, until thou shalt discover all the bone. Then cut it, or stretch it out.
And it is necessary that you should put a cloth of linen between all the parts, and let not the chisel touch the sound place: and cut to the sick with added woe, and let not be cold poultice.
But if there should happen to flow the blood inward while you work, then cauterize the place quickly: or put on it some powder that binds the blood. Then return to your own medicating, until it is complete.
Then bind the wounded limb with a fitting ligament, and take care of it, until it heals.
And I tell you what happened to the man in his foot, this same thing that I tell you.
That is, because it happened to the man in his black foot, when it was scorched like the fire of burning: and that corruption first began in his toe, until it came into the whole foot.
The wound was found to be well after he saw the corruption enter into a limb with its movement, which he discovered from pain and its heat; and it struck him at the joint, and was healed.
And after a long time had passed, that corruption again occurred to him in the same way in the index finger of his hand.
Then he came to me, and I tried to restore that excess with him when I put on his hand from the medicines after purifying his body: and the excess did not recur, and it began to hurt in another finger: until the corruption began to enter into a hand.
He called on me to cut off his hand: and I would not do it, hoping from myself regarding the recurrence of that excess: and I was afraid even for himself regarding the death of his hand at the cutting. For the strength of the arm was above the loss.
Afterwards he was disappointed about me, and turned to his own land; and he came back to me on the subject, for he wished it well, and struck off his whole hand; and he was healed.
And I did not bring this account unless it be an aid to that which falls regarding this kind of disease: and to show what it means, and according as it is applied.
On the treatment of gangrene, and on the quality of cauterisation with medicines.
When gangrene occurs in some fleshy limb, and space is prolonged for the poultice, until it draws together: then it bursts, or pierces, and that which is in it comes out, leaving a hollow place like a wound: and the skin over it looks like thin cloth: and does not spread to the extreme of corruption, neither does it enter into the mouth, the nose, or the ligaments: it deserves to be called Sinus: but does not bear the name Fistula: however, if it is prolonged in space, until it impresses corruption in some of these limbs, then it is called Fistula, or a bore.
And the cure is, that you should strike off that skin all at once like a garment; and especially when it has been thinned and made like a cloth; and trust that it will not adhere to the place on account of its decay.
But if you expect that the skin will adhere and that that corruption will not follow from it in the end: and if there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, then cure it with myrrh: and this is what you should consider as regard the sinews.
Then if it is large, and the pus that issues from it is very foul: then prepare it with the Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, oil, and resin, parts in equal quantities, mixed together in a vessel; and let it boil over fire until the medicine turns red: and let it come to be of the consistence of honey.
Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and prepare it with the myrrh, and string the opening of it, and let the medicine enter into it to the quantity of two hours' duration.
Then extract that medicine with the expression; let it be for several days, until the sinews are clean and the smell is gone.
And when you prepare it with water of ash, when this medicine is not present with you: and this is what you should do, that you take the ash of oak or of elm-wood: and pour it on the water. Then stir it, and prepare it with the myrrh, until you are certain that the sinews are clean.
If the patient is not tolerant of the Egyptian medicine or water of ash, then prepare it with water and honey, to which has been added a little crushed resin. Or prepare it with honey and wine, because of the property of honey to clean and wash away: and the wine makes the sinews adhere, especially when there is an abundance of styptic and drying in the wine.
How you do that sometimes, and trust that the corruption of the sin has already been removed: then wash him with water with what he does to give birth to flesh in it.
And is, so you get from an emplastro dyafinicon: and dissolve it with olive oil, and wine tonic: or wash him with some medicines, and other ointments, whose properties I have written in the treatise of ointments.
That if the orifice of the sinus is tight, in which the cannula of the clister does not enter: then increase it with a little iron: or put in it licorium soaked in ointment Egyptian, or in basilicon ointment, until it increases.
And similarly if the orifice is also wide, then add the lips with a stitch: and let go from it the amount that is mixed with the clister without adding anything to it.
And similarly if the orifice from which the pus runs is raised upward: then dry it up in a lower place that is in it, so that the pus runs out of it downwardly: for when the pus is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being born in it.
That if it is not possible for you to dry the sinus completely around its lower part according to what you want: then try, so that you prepare the member with a preparation that runs out of it with ease according to which it is prepared for you. Try, so that nothing of the pus is retained in it at all: and take medicines that are put on a sign, suitable to that which you want. And spread them out over the cloth of linen. And let the cloth be of such a quantity that it communicates with all the sinus. Then cut with forceps on the direct hole of the sinus orifice, a slightly larger hole. Then spread from the ointment soft on another cloth, according to the quantity of the hole: and put it on him in a distant position from the sinus orifice, so that the exit of pus from it is facilitated: and do not take off the large cloth, until after some days a piece.
And yet who is above the orifice of the sinus, is he whom you stir at all times, that he may go out what has gathered in him from pus: and know that, for this which runs out of it virus, is much, or little: or digested, or indigested.
And when you consider this place again of the sinus itself, does the lord feel pain in it, or is there no pain in it? And does he feel a plug in it, or not?
So when your medication extends thus far, and you see the material that has come out above the sinus orifice, then know that the sinus is now fastening itself, or approaching the fastening: so then dissolve it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you dissolve the wound, then change the cloth to another, and renew the ointment.
But if the virus comes out of the sinus after a long space, do not despair concerning its fastening, for the healing of it approaches, because there are people who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and from them there are who act in the contrary way.
But if it comes out after many days of pus that is not digested, then know that the sinus does not fasten itself.
But if the fastening of the sinus is delayed, and its duration is prolonged: then add to the drying up of medicines, truly let the doctors make them, so that they are in their substance moist, and in their virtue dry: just as the unguent of daphenicon, when added thereto of an excess of addition out of zеги.
And from the greatest part also, when it is cured, it is, that you take the unguent of daphenicon, and dissolve it with oil of rose, and rub it on the old wound to an equal degree in its substance.
Then put on the ointment with it, and use it.
And this same action does this to you, when the unguent of daphenicon is not present with you, when you heat it up, until it thickens, and you use it. Take myrrh and aloe and olive oil; let it be thoroughly mixed with the dust, and spread over honey when it is still warm on fire. Then wrap a cloth over the wound and tie it tightly around the سین; and cover with honey what you have made to be a poultice, until it has thickened: and apply the dust on the wound, and wrap it again in the cloth, and tie it tightly.
And when you have administered to him long-stemmed aristaeus, and the roots of sky-lily, and it is a lily; and grass-root, and daisy. Use them simple, or gathered, as they are, and the sifting of themselves: and apply the dust on honey which you have poured out, and use it.
That if the disease of the Sinus is prolonged, and does not heal by this cure: then you shall know that there is corruption in his depths; or it begins to make an impression on bones, or on other hard members of the body, or on ligaments: then you should resort to the cure of Fistulas, as has been aforesaid.
Of the cure of the finger with a panaritis, and of an rubbed nail, and of incision of the finger, added with section.
Panaritis is a swelling that arises under the nail of the thumb or of any other finger, and perhaps it may arise in the other fingers also.
When then the disease of this has been prolonged, and the cure of it has been neglected, and has become a sore with a warm moisture; or it is corrupted, and discharges pus, until it corrodes the nail's root: and perhaps it may be corrupted altogether, and perhaps it may reach the mouth, until it has an odour unclean: and makes the end of the finger large, and makes its color dark.
When then you resort to the cure of it, with that which we have said in the division, and your cure does not bring relief: then you must cut off the whole superfluity that remains from the nail. Then cauterize the nail after that. Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.
For if the bone is healthy and the nail also, and the nails too tight to the flesh within, and it begins to hurt: then you should put a small amount of radium under the angle of the nail that hurts the flesh, and press it upwards: and cut the flesh easily, and place on top of what remains of the flesh from burning medicines, rusts until it is completely moved away. Then care for that with the nail, until it heals.
If, however, the corruption has already begun to press on the bone, then you should cut that bone out and remove it: for it never heals while it remains in it.
If you see the corruption and the rust entering into a finger, then cut it at one of its joints, according to what has been said above about its reminder. Then care for that injury, until it heals.
If, however, the nail has been worn away or hit: and there is a very painful pain in it, then you should let blood from it first. Then dry the nail with a sharp spatulium across from above to the tip.
And guard it, so that the cut does not go into the flesh below the nail, for you would cause a very painful pain to arise on the sick person, and it would be a cause of the birth of flesh added in place.
Then care for that place with the seat that causes pains.
The finger, however, added which is born in some hands of men, perhaps is fleshy all over: and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail in it: and the birth of some of its joints or knuckles may be in the joint of the ligature, or in some of the joints of the finger. So then who is born in some joints of the finger does not move: and who is born at the knuckle of the finger, perhaps moves.
Therefore he who has this fleshly part, the incision into him is easy. Which is, that you may incise him at his root with a spatula-shaped blade.
But of him whose birth is in the root of the joint, the cure is difficult. Therefore abstain from incising him.
But in that one who is born in the digit at the last of the joints, then you should incise him in the first flesh round up to the mouth. Then close the mouth with one of those blades that are convenient for closing it. Then care for him, until he is healed.
But the consolidation that happens in the digits back to back, often occurs or from the birth of man, namely, he is born with it, or from the consolidation of the wound, or from the burning of fire, and similar things.
Therefore it should be that you separate this consolidation, until the digits return to their natural shape. Then place between them a twig, or rags soaked in rose oil: so that they do not heal quickly, and separate them: or place between them a thin lead plate, until the site heals as it should.
And likewise if there is consolidation in some digits with the palm, then dry that consolidation, according to which it is prepared and convenient for the shape of the limb.
The Vice of Incision:
Veins that are swollen and full of melancholic fluid occur in many parts of the body: and many of them come to an end in the legs, especially in the legs of those who move about a lot, and those who carry burdens.
Therefore it should be that you administer a strong discharge of the body from black cholera by some means of exhaling.
Then take the patient's blood with a large bowl.
The cure of these veins with iron is according to two methods. One is, so that they are heated and the black blood is drawn out. The other way is that you should cut off the vein and take it out entirely.
The dissection is done this way according to this method. First, wrap the leg with hot water until the thick, foul blood dissolves. Then tighten the tourniquet on the leg from the top of the hip to the bottom of the knee while it is bandaged. Then dry off one, two, or three wide sections of the vein.
Then cut off, that is to say, extract the blood in your hand from the lower part of the leg up to the top, and from the upper part it should be taken by the phlebotomist before it becomes weak. Then dry off the nail down to the bottom: until you see enough blood come out and how much strength the vein has left.
Then tie it up: and tell him to refrain from foods that cause black cholesterol: and repeatedly drain and bleed the vein when they are full, and if it hurts the sick person.
The elevation is done this way according to this method. Rub the leg with a hard object if there are many hairs in it. Then put the leg into a bath: or wrap it with hot water in the leg, until it reddens and the veins swell: or exercise it strongly if there is no bath present, until it warms up.
Then dry off the skin along the vein in length: or at the end of the leg near the knee, or at the bottom part near the heel.
Then open the skin with a hook, and scrape off the vein from all parts until you feel it: and at its appearance, you will see it red to black in color. When you have taken it out of the skin, you will see it white as a cord.
Then insert a hook under it, until it is fully extracted from the skin: hang it with a blind hook, soft.
Then dry off another wide section next to that section with three fingers. Then peel off the wound from the upper part of the skin, until it appears. Then wash it with water as you have done, and hang it with a hook as you did at first.
Then dry another piece of skin, or more pieces if you are able to do so. Then wash it, and make the cut at the heel.
Then remove it to the section that is above it.
And do this, until you remove it from the upper section; or with higher sections all around, until when it is completely out: then cut it off.
But if it does not obey you when you try to remove and wash it: then insert a sharp tool with a double edge, and tie it, and remove it; or insert beneath it a Ray of iron: and rotate your hand around all parts, until it is completely out. And be careful not to cut. For if it cuts, it is difficult for you to wash it well, and it enters into the wound that has become injured.
So then when you remove it all: then place it on a wound place that has been dipped in wine and oil, or oil only; and take care of the wound, until it heals.
Which if it is contracted, has a curvature to the sides that has an edge to the parts, and is not like what we said concerning the straightness: then you must find on all parts of its curvature, and the locations of its edge.
Then hang it with a hook until you have washed it all; and be careful when you cut into the section that is above it, or wound it up: for it will be difficult for you to wash it well on yourself, or remove it. So then keep your caution.
The shape of the wound when it heals.
The shape of the hook.
It is not a curvature like the other hook, nor does it have acute extremities, so as to not wound the skin; and it has a slow bend, soft: for if it were slight, it would cut the skin with its subtleness: but it has too much grossness, as we said.
On the extraction of veins from the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs on warm ground, as in Al-Izzi's land and in Arab lands, and in dry, hot lands with little softness, that is, where grass does not grow nor do trees spring up.
And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from putrefaction which occurs under the skin, as it occurs within the bodies of snakes and worms and lice, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
And the sign of the beginning of this vein is a sharp inflammation in the leg. Then the spot becomes sore and swollen. Then the vein begins to emerge from the site of the swelling, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
When this end appears, then you should wrap a lead wire around it, whose weight shall be of a drachm and a half, to the nodule; and remove the lead wire from the leg.
Whenever it emerges anything from it towards the outside, wrap that too in the lead, and mark that. If it should last a long time, then you shall cut a part of it, and wrap the remainder. And you shall not cut its root before it has completely emerged. For if you should cut it, it will wither, and go into the flesh: and it will cause pustules to form, and putrefaction in the spot, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore it should be handled gently, and extracted gradually, until it has completely emerged from its root, and there remains nothing of it within the body: and from this vein emerge some men, who are, according to its length, five hands and ten fingers long. And now I have come to you, for it has reached the age of twenty years.
If, however, you should cut yourself in the course of your treatment: then you shall introduce a needle into its opening, and pierce it with a long needle, along with the body, until all that is in it is discharged from the matter: and administer the medicine of the place with remedies over several days. Then the care is with the cure of ulcers.
And this indeed The vein has branches when it is many, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and many openings are found, and a branch goes out from every opening.
Then the care of it, as we have said in the division, and with what precedes.
De the section on worms that are born under the skin, and it is called The trouble of the cow.
This trouble is called in some place with us The trouble of the cow: because often it happens to cows, and there is one only, which is born between the skin and the flesh.
And it was seen in the whole body, ascending and descending: and it was shown by sense during its walking with its limb from one limb to another, until it stops wherever it stops in the skin, and a branch goes out.
And its generation is from the corruption of some earth. As happen worms and snakes, that is, earthworms, and roundworms in the belly.
And they are afraid of its evil. Because when it goes up in the body and ascends to the head, and reaches a place: then perhaps it opens within, and goes out, and destroys an eye: and this happens often.
But when you are to cure it, and to take it out, then it does not happen to it but during its walking, and the appearance of its sense.
Therefore let you bind what is above it, and what is below it with strong constriction by a ligature. Then dry up on the top of it, and take it out.
That if it penetrates into the flesh, and not into itself: then put on the place a cautery with fire, until it dies.
And greater than what is feared, is its corruption, which corrupts an eye, as we have said.
If you see it [the wound] having already reached the head near the eye, then tighten the brow above it with a good constriction. Then dry above it, and remove it.
And it is necessary that the sick one should use self-purification of his body, with medicines that dissolve bad putrid humors.
And he should beware of foods that generate putrefaction.
[On sectioning on disease] of Naker.
This disease is called in our language Naker, and it is a pain that happens in some member; then it passes from one member to another.
And I have already seen him, according as I report to you. I was called to a sick woman in some wounds. And she held out her arm, and I saw an inflammation in the armpit in the axillary vein.
And after an hour had passed, I saw one inflammation go down with a torch, like the burning of the flesh, ascending at her shoulder faster than it can be: so that it is like flowing silver, when it runs from place to place.
Then the pain departed from that place, and was fixed in her shoulder.
Then after an hour it moved, and ran over the rest of the body until it reached another arm.
Then she reported to me that it was moving all over her whole body, according as I saw it.
I was therefore amazed at the speed of its movement from one member to another. And I myself have never seen such a disease with my eyes before, moving in this way. However, I have seen many who have experienced pain from one member to another: and I have never seen it with my eyes, like what I saw in the woman.
And I do not think that it was, except that the woman was of those who are found among the wounds of dried-up breasts: hence this sense of windiness is apparent.
It is necessary that they should not appear according to this reason in those who are delicious and wet bodies, of secret wounds.
But when you are curing it and the patient feels this pain, then if it is visible to you with the eye, as we said, then bind it above it and under it quickly: and dry it above it until it comes out that windiness: and cauterize the place.
But if you do not see the place with your eyes: then cure it with the excretion of the body, and with what it expels windiness, and make them red with foul pills, and pills of serapine, and others.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows differ according to their species, and according to the places in which they are lodged in the body.
But there is a great difference between them: for some have large hooks, and some are sharp; and some are conic, and some are flat. And of these there are three angles. And of these there are tongues. And of these there are stars.
But those that fall into members of the body are of two ways. For example, the members are conic from the main member, such as the brain, and the heart, and the liver, and the lung, and the kidneys, and the intestines, and the bladder, and similar to them. But when it falls into any of these members and you see to you signs of death, which I will tell you after, then you should extract the arrow from them, because death follows it in many dispositions. But when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep in the member, then pull it out, and cure the wound.
For from the signs of a brain when it falls into it an arrow and penetrates the bone, and emerges from above the brain, there follow these: for they happen from this a bloody fainting, and blindness, and dizziness, and blushing in the eyes, and swelling, and stiffness in the tongue, and spasm, and confusion of thought, and loss of memory. And perhaps blood will flow from the nose, or ears. And perhaps a speech will be cut off, and a beast will be destroyed. And blood will flow from the wound's place, white like gruel. And will emerge from it similar to meat water.
If then you see these signs, then refrain from cure, and draw out the arrow if not blood has flowed.
The signs of an arrow that has entered the heart, are: for it is near the left nipple: and it feels as if fixed on a hard thing, not on a soft one. And perhaps the arrow has a movement similar to a pulse: and black blood flows from the wound. And follows that cold of extremities, and cold sweat, and fainting. So know, that death has come by certain means.
And the sign of an arrow that has wounded the lung, is: the flow from the wound of frothy blood: and the veins that follow the neck, run away, and change their color to pale. And he breathes out great, deep sighs: and seeks the cold air.
That if the arrow has entered the breast-bone, which is within the chest: then it is near the back ribs: and it becomes a great sighing with painful grumbling, and groaning: and all the shoulder muscles quiver.
And if the arrow has entered into the stomach, then perhaps blood flows from the wound by something indigestible in food.
And if the arrow has entered into the belly and is fixed there: then blood flows from the wound by stool, or bile, or gut that has already been broken. There is therefore no hope for his cure, nor for drawing out the arrow.
That if the arrow has entered into the bladder, and it flows out urine: and proceeds from it something toward the outside, and its pain is stronger on the sick: then know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.
And I tell you that I saw such arrows exist, as you mean by that arrow on your cure.
That is, because a man fell an arrow in his lacrimal eye, at the root of his nose. I therefore took it out from him on the other side, under the adipose of his ear: and he was healed, and nothing happened to him in his eye.
And I pulled out another arrow from the Jew, which had fallen in his adipose of his eye under his lower eyelid: and the arrow was now hidden, and I could not get at it except by its sharp end, when it was sticking in its wood: and it was an arrow of a Turkish bow, with a soft iron point, and there were no feathers.
So the Jew was healed, and nothing happened to his eye.
And I pulled out another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
And it was an Arab arrow, and that one had ears. So I followed it with two pins: and now it was submerged in his throat. So I was careful with it, until I pulled it out: and the Christian was healed.
And I pulled out another arrow that had fallen in his abdomen: and we thought, that he would die of it.
So then after he had passed forty days, and nothing was changed in him of his sickness, I followed the arrow: and I devised to myself concerning it, and pulled it out: and he was healed, and nothing happened to him.
And I saw a man on whom an arrow had fallen in his back, and the wound was healed over it. After seven years, he drew the arrow from the root of his hip.
And I saw a woman to whom an arrow had fallen into her belly, and a bone was set upon her, and the arrow remained within her: and there was no change in any of her members, and she found no harm in any of her natural operations.
And I saw another man to whom an arrow had fallen into his face, and a bone was set upon him, and the arrow remained, not causing him much pain: and there were many similar cases.
And I drew out the arrow from the prince of the king, which had fallen into his nose and had already turned towards the right side somewhat: and the arrow was entirely concealed.
So they called me to cure him after the loss of the arrow for three days. And I found the arrow-bone very stiff.
So I examined it with a delicate attempt, and I did not feel it: and he himself felt a prick and pain under his right ear. So I hoped that it was from the end of the arrow.
So I plastered the place where there was the attracting and curative force of the arrow, confiding to him that it would heal, so that the mark of the arrow might appear to me as if it were being taken off: and no accident happened in that place suggesting that the arrow was still there.
So I kept up the plaster for many days: and no accident happened, and the bone was set during that time: and he remained weak from the drawing out of it for a space of days, until one day he felt an arrow in his nose. And he told me about that.
And he told me about that. So I put an acute medicine on that bone, for many days, until it was healed over: and when I tried him, I felt a slight pain of the arrow still attached to the bone.
Then, when the wound had healed over by means of that acute medicine, it seemed to me that the tip of the arrow became visible; and about four months elapsed with that time.
Then, when the wound had increased and seemed to me that it was possible for me to insert my fingers into it and move them and not respond to exit: then I did not stop gently, and devised means for her with the means of inventiveness, until one day I succeeded in doing so with a certain angle of unevenly made forks, according to which their form became visible at the end of the chapter, and I removed it. Then I restored the limb.
And the doctors say that cartilage is not restored. So I restored it, and the limb was consolidated, and the disease was healed with complete health: and he did not hurt at all.
And I tell you the quality of extraction of certain arrows: that you set up that rule and meaning about it which I did not say.
For parts of this art and their distinctions do not understand themselves with a narration; nor does this book understand, and the careful artisan compares little to much: and when it is far from what is present, he understands a new operation, and a new instrument when extraneous things of this art happen.
I say, that arrows do not come out of the body from which they are fixed except according to two ways. Or by attraction from a place from which it entered. Or by the opposite side of another part.
And that which goes out from where it entered, or is an arrow proceeding in a fleshly place; and is attracted, and goes out.
That if it does not obey to exit within the time in which it falls: then it is necessary that you leave it a few days, until it rotten the flesh which is around it: and its attraction is eased, and its exit.
And likewise if it is fixed in a bone, and does not obey to you to exit, then leave it too for a few days: and again go out with its attraction and movement every day, until it goes out.
If he does not obey you at the exit after a few days, then it is necessary that you perform on him around the sagitta in the bone from all parts with thin terrae, until the sagitta are increased. Then attract it and take it out.
If however the sagitta has already gone into hiding in a place in the body, and is hidden and concealed from sensation: then seek it out with care. If you feel it, then attract it with some instruments which are suitable for attracting it.
If you cannot bring it out because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the sagitta in the deep, and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vessel: then find it out, until the wound is increased, and it is possible to take out the sagitta.
That if they have ears to which it is attached, then free the flesh firmly held on them from all parts, with any device which you can: and devise, if it cannot be brought out by means of the ears in a fracture, and turning of them, until it comes away.
And when you are extracting the arrow of the shaft, in whatever place it is, then use your hand with forceps to all parts until you make it bleed: and the subtlest subtlety, so that the shaft does not break, and it becomes difficult for you to attract it, and its extraction.
That if you cannot get above it in one hour, then let go of it for a few days, until what is around it putrefies. Then repeat it: for indeed if the flow of blood annoys you, then administer what we have said in its chapter: and guard your skill from the incision of the vein, or nerve, or chordae.
And administer skill in every way as possible to the healing of the arrow: and let it be with ease, and tranquillity, or tardiness, and firmness, as I tell you.
And it is necessary that when you draw out the arrow, you make it so that it is weakened according to the figure, according to which it was with the shaft at the site of the arrow. For it is more sure. But if this is not possible for you, then administer what is possible for you from figures.
But the arrow which has come out from the opposite part, or which is already proceeding out of it to the outside: or which makes a protuberance at the extreme end of the shaft by feeling from the upper part of the skin nearby, and you see it prominent: so cut off over it, and let the section be according to the quantity that they hold in it with forceps.
Then attract it: for she becomes easy to come out by herself.
But if it is retained in the bone, then turn your hand according to its roundness, until it presses the shaft into the bone, and lengthens itself towards it: and then draw it out.
And if not: let go of it for a few days: and then repeat it, until it comes out.
That if the wood of the shaft is in it, then push it with that.
If however the wood has fallen and you want to give it an impulse of movement: then introduce the instrument into it, so that the impulse is transmitted to the end of the arrowhead: and then push it with the same impulse.
If however the arrow is tumbled, then push it with the instrument that enters into it. For the arrow is relieved by that.
That if the arrow is poisoned, then it should be, so that all the flesh is conveyed, in which is venenum: if it is possible for you to do that. Then take care of it with what belongs to that.
That if the arrow is falling into the chest, or into the belly, or into the urethra, or into the side: and it is close to that which you feel with your touch, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and caute ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.
Then take care of the wound, if you see it, and take care of that, until it is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps, with which the arrows are extracted.
May their ends be similar to the point of the awl, which is made like a needle: when they grasp onto the arrow, they do not let it go.
And there are many kinds of them, big and small, medium and small, according to the size of the arrow, and the width of the wound, and the constriction.
Form of the impelling concaues.
And form of the impelling surd.
This is the end of the surd like a rayon, so that the entrance of it into the tumbled arrow can be facilitated, and it can be pushed with it.
Regarding the phlebotomy of veins.
Uenae phlebotomandae, quarum cucurrit consuetudo in corpore, sunt triginta.
The veins that run along the arms, which are usually ten; of these there are eight on each arm: two pulse veins behind the ears, called the two herbs; and two arteries that appear at the two wrists; and two veins that go to the two tears of the eyes, which are called the looking-out veins; and the vein that is prepared in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the end of the nose. And two arteries, which are in the neck. And two veins that are in the upper lip of the mouth. And two veins that are in the lower lip. These are the veins that are called algecirich. And two veins that are under the tongue.
But the veins that are phlebotomized in the arms, there are five veins in each arm.
One of them is the cephalica vein, and it comes from the lateral side of the skull: and it is called the common vein of the head. And the fusca. And the middle vein, which is composed of the basilica ramus and the cephalic ramus: and it is called the general vein of the body. And the basilica, which is placed on the internal side: and it is also called the titillicaris. And it is called the general vein of the hand. And the tendon of the bicep, which is placed on the back of the hand: and it is that one which appears above the thumb by a visible contraction; and it is that one which phlebotomizes, and it is that one which appears above the pollicis by the appearance of a knot.
And the salutella: and it is a vein that is between the ring finger and the little finger: and there are two branches.
In the leg and in the foot there are three veins. One of them is that which is under the thumb, curvated from the lateral side: and it comes from the internal side. And the second is the safena; and its place is near the heel, on the internal side. And young Nosse: and its location is near the heel from the lateral forest.
And in the other leg there are three similar veins.
§ On the venepuncture of two veins after ears.
The phlebotomy of the two veins that are after ears, it is an oath to ancient catarrhs and hemorrhoids and sahafats and bad head ulcers.
And the quality of venepuncture is according to what I tell you. And it is, so that he washes his head: and he rubs the back of his head in the location of two veins with a rough cloth for good friction. Then he tightens his neck with a cloth, until the two veins appear. And their locations are after ears in two depressed places of the head. So ask them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse of their ears under your finger, there are signs with cautery.
Then take a cautery knife, and he who is said to be Incidens. Then introduce yourself under one vein into the cut, until the phlebotomist reaches the mouth. Then wipe your hand with the vein and the cut on top, and cut the vein with a cutting wound. And the length of the incision is the amount of two fingers that are intertwined, or about that: and you make it come out with blood as much as you wish.
Then tighten it with a cloth, and let it go, until it heals.
And already preceded in the beginning of the book of incision of ears, and their cauterization.
The two arteries that are in two times of venepuncture, it is an oath to ancient hemorrhoids: and the pulse of the heart, and the beating of the wings, and the course of the effluents of acute things toward the eyes.
And the quality of venepuncture of them is according to what I tell you. The neck of a string is very weak, until two veins appear clearly by their own sensation; and let them be palpitating under your finger. Then indeed the signs with caustics.
Then, on the skin above the vein with your index finger, and introduce a phlebotome below it, and squeeze the vein upwards. And cut it, as you did in the other two veins: and make the blood flow according to the amount of your need.
Then dissolve the tourniquet and place your finger on a vein for an hour. Then put a bandage and pulleys on it, and tighten it strongly from above by constriction: and remove it, until it heals.
And already the memory of them, and their incision, and their extraction at the beginning of the book.
The treatment for the phlebotomy of the veins of the face is after the phlebotomy of the head, to the old diseases of the face: and to the headache, and redness: and to bad ulcers.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is, according to what I tell you. Bind up the neck with a bandage, until a vein appears. Then take the instrument which is called a fossorial.
Then place the sharp point which is in the head of the fossorial on the vein, and strike it against the string with a comb or some other thing: and let the blood flow according to the amount that you want. Then dissolve the prick with the milk-maiden, and tighten it, until it heals.
And sometimes it opens with the phlebotome on its side. However, you should not use this treatment, that it be an acute phlebotomy, as the other phlebotomies, but rather a lateral phlebotomy. And use this phlebotomy according to the turnings: because the mouth is near: and perhaps in it the phlebotomy may break when it is thin.
The instrument for the two veins that are in the two lacrimal glands of the two eyes, is to the eye from scabies and redness: and poultice in an eye, and face ailments.
And the quality of phlebotomy of them is that it should tighten the neck of him who has the fever with a poultice. Then phlebotomy for her: and you stand over his head.
And make phlebotomy according to the crossing at little length, with a little phlebotomist, for in that place there is no flesh. If then the phlebotomist is thin of the end, perhaps it will break.
Then make the blood flow as much as you need. And place over them a cloth, and tighten them for a night, and loose them.
The veins of the nose phlebotomy, is conferring to an acute fever, and a running nosebleed, and face ailments, such as hemianemia, and redness that happens on the face: especially when it is old.
And the quality of phlebotomy of it is that it should tighten the neck of him who has the fever. Then take the nose of him by your left hand, and take a little phlebotomist, long: and tighten it in the middle of his nose, between that which distinguishes the nose according to its length. Since the nose does not seem clear there, and since blood begins to flow immediately:
And it is necessary that you hold your hand with the phlebotomist a little bit: and make the blood flow according to your need. Then tighten it for a night. For it itself is restored quickly.
The instrument for the two veins of the throat phlebotomy is to the constriction of an evil wind, and the beginning of leprous sores, and melancholic ailments, and impetigo and bad ulcers, and corrupting ones, that is, herpetic diseases.
And what is the quality of tourniquet [phlebotomy] so that it tightens the injured person under both his neck with the ligament: and let the artisan stand over the head of the injured person, and let the injured person sit on a chair.
Then tie the tourniquet about one-third the length of the injured person's leg; it should be as wide as the width of the arm. Then remove a quantity of blood at a temperature that is suitable, or according to what you see from necessity for that purpose. Then do the same with the other leg.
Then loosen the ligaments, and tighten two strands of yarn in the middle: so that the injured person does not slip away. And leave it until morning. The wound will heal.
This is the end of the section on phlebotomy in Albucasis' text. However, the phlebotomy of Al-Ghafir (or Albucasis) is that it goes to the alcohol in the mouth and corrupts the gums: and bad ulcers on the gums, and cracks on the lips, and bad ulcers also on the nose, and around it.
And what is the quality of tourniquet that you make an injured person sit before you: and tighten his neck with a scarf. Then turn the person'a mouth around, and look at the two veins: one is on the right side of the person'a mouth, and the other is on the left side: and the indication of both is by the color of amber. And this is true: because there are small veins around them that are black. Then cut one of the incisions so that it cuts through both the veins.
But if there is any doubt about you, and you do not know which of them it is: then go to the larger incision, and make known its indubitable nature.
And do the same to the two veins that are in the upper lip: and it is very true that custom follows with him: and cut the two veins that are in the lower lip.
This is the end of the section on phlebotomy under the tongue after phlebotomy at the base of the skull. Of two veins that are under the tongue of phlebotomy, which is, that phlebotomy of the head is to the pre-conditions which are in the throat, and sickness of the larynx, and sickness of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomy is that he should sit sick between your hands before the sun: and he should lick his tongue, and look under his tongue on one side, and under his tongue on the other side: and the color of both shall be turned into blackness.
So phlebotomy both: and guard, that you do not put your hand on them when you phlebotomize them. For under them are the arteries, and perhaps it happens that the flow of blood comes out from those arteries.
But the three veins that are phlebotomized in a bed, there are where phlebotomy ran custom in all men.
And phlebotomy of them is made after two ways. Or with a phlebotome and myrrh on the side: or oiled to the softness of the decline: or cutting with a phlebotome and is Anisesic. And this is his form.
And of them are species broad, and subtle according to the width of veins and the shape of phlebotomy with myrrh sit broad, as you see. And it convines to the opening of veins occluded, full, coming out, appearing, thick, and those which contain gross blood, turbulent.
And this phlebotomist is of lesser width, and more subtle at the extremities.
And it convines to the phlebotomy of veins which are subtle, which contain subtile citrinum blood.
But the Basilica which is one of the three veins phlebotomy is a juggle: For it draws blood out of sickness which is under the throat and the neck, from that which goes to the chest, and the phlebotomist takes it, because he guardeth, and sits over the fear from her: for under her is an artery. If he should make a mistake and add bloodletting to the puncture, he would cut the artery and cause the flow of blood. For this reason, when puncturing with bloodletting, one should not cut the artery: instead, it should be done with the help of a scalpel.
That if the Basilica does not appear with a manifest appearance, then one should go and remove it from its place and change it to another or seek out some of its branches: or perform bloodletting at its site. For this is made manifest, and one should cut it with a scalpel of Alne, as we have said.
If you wish to perform bloodletting on this, then one should touch the branch of the arm before the brachial artery is closed, so that you feel the pulse. Then mark the place with a caustice, and afterwards the arm, and cut the vein with a scalpel of Alne, as we have said. And be careful that the incision does not fall into the space from the site of the artery.
And when you see that the ligament has been tightened, and the inflammation at the place that you have marked with a caustic, then this inflammation is the inflammation of the artery: so keep it away from it.
That if you see blood rise at bloodletting, like a boy's urine, and it is pale blood, red in color: then you know that it is from the artery's blood. Then therefore bring your hand to the site and place your finger on it for a long time, and then remove your finger. If then blood is cut off (for it is often cut off) then tighten the arm and let it go: and be careful not to move him at all: and set him on his feet with trepidation.
And let him not murmur for a few days, until he is healed.
If then the blood does not cut off and hurts you: and there is no medicine present for you at that moment, then cut the artery if it appears to you. The extremities of it are cut off, and the blood is cut off.
Or take the fascia of the fistula, and find it: take one half and bind it firmly on the site of the stricature as it descends with the ligament and powder until another day.
Then if blood is cut off, it is good. And if not: then the care of it with what memory remains of the place from which the powder-flushing blood was cut off: and the cutting off of its blood is not difficult in many dispositions, on account of the small wound, and possibility of the ligament from the arm.
The phlebotomy of the vein of the fistula is a method that draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; since it is composed of the branch of the Basilica and the branch of the Cephalica, as we have said.
And it belongs to the phlebotome to make it over the fear from its phlebotomy, for under it is the nerve. If then he adds in the puncture of the phlebotomy, and finds the nerve, it happens to him that stupor, and difficult is its cure, and perhaps it does not cure completely.
And this nerve appears many times to sensation. But if it is hidden in some men, and is slight, and does not show itself: then you should put your phlebotomy so that the phlebotome makes it with the Alethe, and remove the nerves with your strength.
That if the vein is between two nerves, then find a vein in length.
The head vein. The phlebotomy of the veins of the head is a method that draws blood from the head, and confers it to the ailments of the eyes.
And let there be in this vein of your own, if you will, so that the phlebotome makes it with the oil-phlebotomy, or with the myrrh-phlebotomy: for this is the saviour of all veins, because it is not under an artery, nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis. Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum Trium qua sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica. Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comotionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quandopruocate conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quadraginta annos. Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum. Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.
But if anyone wishes to perform phlebotomy in any way: it is necessary that he should clean his intestines before phlebotomy with a mild enema, if there is much feces retained therein: so that the waste matter from the intestines does not attract the gut by phlebotomy and harm the main organs.
And let the patient not be tied up, that is, nausea: and let him not be drunk, nor let him be so drunk that he cannot move himself from them. And let him not be sick with water on him.
And let phlebotomy be performed again after diarrhea, hunger, flow of blood, increase of sexual activity, toil, exercise, vigils, fasting, and all that dissolves virtue from the physical body or animal.
Then consider the subtleties of the humors before that, if the blood is thick with food and drink and medicine: if it is possible to do so.
Then let him take a bath, if he does not object to anything: or let him exercise himself in some way, so that the blood is refined.
And let him place phlebotomy in his chest on the third day, as we have said: and be careful so that his chest is emptied of all animal accidents on that day: such as pain, anger, fear: and all bodily accidents, such as labor, punishment, excesses, and those like them.
And let him make his own things present that he might have the custom of men from the aroma, and fragrance, and feast, and similar things by quantity of possibility.
Then the phlebotomist sits on a stool, which is higher than the phlebotomy place: then he takes his arm out, and rubs it with his own hand twice, or three times. Then he tightens the ligature with the thongs, and twists it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for when it is unequal, or because of an excess in the constriction, then it prevents the course of blood: or in its softening, then also it prevents the course of blood.
Then, after the tourniquet has been tightened, the person should hold their hands still while the blood is being clamped and let go, until the veins are swollen and feeling is restored.
Then, the phlebotomist will clean the venipuncture site with a little oil, his own, ancient.
Then he will lay his finger, of his left hand, on the vein at the spot where he intends to perform venipuncture, slightly: so that the vein is not scared and the sound of the puncture is soft. For it is from the veins that blood flows like a string being struck when a puncture is performed: and it is from those veins that has full blood flow: and when you place the syringe on it, it is squeezed under the syringe, and the syringe operator is deceived, and the syringe does not open the vein: and if it does open it, it is tight: so that, therefore, it is necessary that the syringe operator tighten his grip, and be vigilant in these matters at all times.
Then he will set down the syringe. If then a vein does open from one drop of blood, then it is good. And if not, then repeat the same drop of blood under that place a little, or above it with some haste: if the spot does not bleed.
That if it does not bleed, nor feels weak, then send him away for a day, or two days: and do not tighten the ligature. Perhaps, indeed, it attracts the blood because of the heat. And let him not enter a bath.
Then he should delay the venipuncture, if he is fond of it.
That if the opening is small, or blood runs slightly: and wait that there be not a quantity of blood that leaves the body as much as a gooseberry: then repeat the phlebotomy at the same place with care, and add a little to the procedure.
And do this with some haste, before the spot bleeds: for, indeed, the spot that bleeds is at fault, when a person is bleeding a lot during the procedure.
If you see that he has already made a mistake, then do not continue to operate on him at all; for nothing is excusable in your eyes. And put something on top of the wound from the fat of an animal: for it softens the course of the blood. And it is better in this place than oil itself, and than any other oil.
And similarly administer oil to all your bloodletting, except when the course of the blood is forbidden; and they make it with myrrh when put from one of them on the spot.
For the blood is thinned and made fluid when it is thick.
If such a great aposteme should happen to occur in a place, for many times it happens, especially if one who is not phlebotomized is affected at that point or there is a small opening of the wound, then bind and put on top of the spot a sponge infused with water and salt, slightly warmed: and tighten it for an hour: for it is resolved.
And you should, in order to do that which has been done after the exit of blood from his own wound with its complement, or from another wound:
That if anything remains in the place after a few days of blackness or of fogginess, it does not harm that; and if there is a swelling, put on top of the wound some oil, or of myrrh dissolved: or something of the juice of mint, that is, of calamus or similar to it.
And very often apostemes and eminences occur with bloodletting at the Basilica.
So put your hand on top of it; then if you feel a soft swelling when you press your hand on top of it, then that eminence is bad. Take care, so that you put on top of it something of what we have said. For perhaps blood will flow from it of the artery.
But put on it something with which there is a stop to the flow, so that the spot may heal. Then take care of the wound with the rest of the cure, until it heals over.
It is fitting that every man should draw blood from another according to the quantity of his virtue. And that which appears in a vibrant color above the blood.
For if the blood is black, then let him be sent out until he turns red: and likewise, if you see him thick: then send him out until it thins out: and likewise, if it is sharp, until the sharpness is taken away from it.
And it is fitting for him who is full, strong, and resistant to the extraction of blood by one act, so that the phlebotomy of the vein is enlarged, and he becomes a phlebotomist on the back: and in him who is weak, it is the opposite.
And it is fitting that he should draw himself out in the vices, and that a tight hole be made: and better is it when administered in the phlebotomy of the vein, that it is a transverse section, not a puncture.
And this mode of phlebotomy is safer from the flow of blood, and from the incising of the nerve: and it is more praiseworthy, and healthier than phlebotomy by width and length.
And to him who is accustomed to syncope at phlebotomy, it is fitting that he should eat light before phlebotomy with water of grain crushed: or secernentinum, if it is warm: and let him draw blood from him in six vices, or four.
And if the complexion is chilly, then let him take before phlebotomy bread infused in syrupy moly, or in syrupy de melle seasoned with spices, or in syrupy seasoned with odorous substances.
That if syncope should happen at phlebotomy, and it is a cause of the exit of blood many: then let him take in a vessel water of meat, and syrupy odorous: and let him apply aromaticity with algalia, and stretch his chest when he uses it: and let him use the rest that we have spoken of in the division in the chapter on syncope from evacuation.
Whoever wishes to let his arm go and let his blood out little by little according to the quantity of his virtue in continuous days, let him know that it is fitting for him to draw blood from another according to the quantity of his virtue.
Whoever wishes to bandage his arm and stop the flow of his blood, let him do so after the second day, and his body is strong. Then he should do this after seven hours or nine from his first phlebotomy.
However, whoever wishes to draw blood from his body towards the opposite side of the part that sways away: it is necessary that this be done on the second day or the third.
In whose body there is already much blood heated and quickened, and causes a fever to occur: it is necessary that he leave this blood flowing in one direction, and extract from him a great quantity: and increase the opening until asyncopy occurs: after you have maintained all the conditions of phlebotomy: and put your hand over his pulse at the course of the blood, so that death does not occur at the place of syncopy. Indeed many times it happens when the phlebotomizer does not know, and falls by negligence.
And it is not necessary when you wish to bandage an arm, and stop the flow of blood on the second day, that the orifice of the vein has already been closed, and make it difficult for the blood to exit, so that it rushes upon him with a sudden movement, and quickly curls over and extends. For this is an evil thing, let go of him until the second day, until he is phlebotomized.
Or remove with the sharpness of phlebotomy that which has coagulated blood in the orifice of the vein, and put on him some dissolved salt in water. And place on him something of the tartar emulsion or sage, and place on him a soft compression until blood flows out.
If, however, the vein has already been seared, then let go of it, and do not tie it up, until it is seared.
That if necessity compels to stop the flow of blood on the second day, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize him above that place, or in an arm another vein.
But the tendon of the arm is phlebotomized at the place of the purple, and of the basilica, if they are not found, and are hidden, because it is composed from them.
And what is the quality of phlebotomy, so that the sick person may put his hand into warm water until it turns red, and appears new to the eye.
Then let him be tied with a little constriction in the middle. Then let the phlebotomy be made according to the cross-section gradually, not according to the length and not according to the length; and let it be an open space wide and let your phlebotomy be like that, which you make across the wrist a little.
If the blood flows out, then repeat the hand into warm water and let the blood run into the water until you have a need to stop it.
But if you are in summer days, then you are excused from repeating the hand into warm water. Indeed, much depends on how long the blood runs in warm water during the cold season.
And this kind of phlebotomy is safer for all kinds of wounds because it does not cause a pulsating wound or nerve injury.
But phlebotomy certainly saves the hands of the right side, which is suitable for patients with liver diseases.
And what is the quality of phlebotomy, so that you tie the hand with a little string and not the hand itself after you have put it into warm water until it bends, and appears very much to the sense. Then let the phlebotomy be made by crossing it. And if you cut it all, it will not harm that at all.
And preserve your hand after phlebotomy. For under her are the nerves of the fingers stripped from the flesh.
Then repeat the hand to warm water and let the blood run in it. For if you do not repeat the hand in warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the wound and stop the flow.
But when you extract a quantity of blood according to need, then put oil and salt on the wound: so that it does not quickly solidify.
And it is also necessary that you should make the same incision on every branch which is broken.
The proper way to make a ligature for a vein is with your left hand, since it is concerned with the spleen; and you should do the same for its phlebotomy, as you did for the second one.
But the ligature for the veins is to be used for ailments which are in the lower part of the body, such as those of the mother, and retaining the monthly flow, and ailments of the kidneys and old ulcers of the hips and legs, and similar ailments from illnesses.
And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that he should put his sick foot into hot water; and make friction on it until the blood comes out, and tie above the incision of the foot with a strap. And the site of the veins is at the heel, which appears towards the thumb; and there are many branches emanating from it on the face of the foot.
So it is to be phlebotomized in a larger branch of it, or at the heel in its aggregate; for it is better and healthier.
For if you phlebotomize it on the face of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are under it on the face of the foot.
And place your phlebotomy where you want to incise it across, as if you do not wish to incision it; and let the phlebotomist be ready.
But if the flow of blood is prohibited, then turn his foot around in hot water; and let the blood not run into it until it has come out.
That if the vein is cut in the first place, then it should remain with the phlebotomy to the upper ones for a while, since the site is healthier, and do not be afraid of injury from it when you are drawing blood, as we have said.
And likewise with the saphenous vein of the other foot equally.
But the site of the sciatic veins, as we have said, is at the heel on the side of the forest.
And the treatment of hemorrhoids is to cut off the tender parts, when it is due to warm blood.
And the quality of phlebotomy is that it should be done in a hot bath, and it should be strained: and tighten his legs from the sides of the anus up to the heel four fingers, with a thin long thread: for this does not appear except for that.
When, therefore, it appears, then phlebotomize her according to whatever skill you have, or according to the turn of events: and it is better, or as if you were to cut her with an incision, or separate her by a section. For the place of her is salutary, and herself is hidden much in many men.
For the place of her is salutary, and herself is hidden much in many men. That if you do not draw her out, and does not appear to the sense at all: then phlebotomize some of her branches, and that is which appears on the back of the foot, and towards the earlobe: and from the nerves, and let run a quantity of blood as you wish.
Then untie it loosely, and place on the spot of phlebotomy skin, and tighten the spot. For quickly he is healed.
Of Ventilation, and quality of use.
Ventilations are made from horns, and from air, and from heat.
And the ventilation is made according to two ways. When with scarification, and extraction of blood: and another is ventilation without scarification.
And this ventilation which is without scarification, is according to two ways. Or indeed is when fire. Or is without fire.
And the ventilations which are administered with scarification and extraction of blood are four times places in the body. Of which one is Ventilation of the Scalp, and it is last of the head: and Al-Khel, and is middle of the neck: and ventilation of the two cheeks, and are two laminae of the neck from two parts at once: and ventilation of the mind, and is under the mandible in the lower mouth: and ventilation of the two spatulas: and ventilation of the two achilles at the end of the tail: and ventilation of the two fires, and are middle of the two arms: and ventilation of the two legs: and ventilation of the two cheeks.
For indeed you shall not draw blood from small veins that are scattered in the flesh, and because of this there is no power in them, as is the case with him from phlebotomy. And it is not necessary that venesection should be performed whether with fire or without fire, in any sickness that is produced by the accumulation, until the whole body has been emptied.
That if necessity compels to venesection on account of sickness or custom, we should administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at its end, and at its middle, and at whatever time it may be.
That is, for there is a man who, when the blood multiplies in him, until he requires its extraction by venesection, finds in his head a headache, and fainting.
And there is one who finds accumulation and reddening on his face, in his head, and on his neck. And there is one who finds itching on his face, in his forehead, darkness, and dullness in his eyes.
And there is one who scratches the place where he received venesection. And there is one whose laughter multiplies. And there is one who finds the taste of blood in his mouth: or he swallows it with his tongue, and spits it out. And there is one whose sleep multiplies. And there is one who sees in his sleep blood and reddening, and slain men, and plagues, and things similar to those.
When then shall we perform venesection when we see anything of this, and especially if it is in the middle of the third month: let us do so after two or three hours have elapsed since midday.
And the caution regarding venesection is: for it brings headache to the head, and it runs into the eyes. However, it is necessary that it should be after the whole body has been emptied.
And this venesection is by place in relation to phlebotomy of the head.
And it is not fitting that he who has a cold complexional complexion should use it, or in whom there is catarrh. For it makes him very weak.
And for that reason it is not fitting that they who are old should use them, and in whom there are diseases of the head due to cold.
But whoever uses this frequently, forgetfulness will be born on him.
And for that reason it is necessary that you follow the instructions of Ventosatori, so that he puts his hand with a gentle breeze towards the lower part, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosation or Alkehel, is the place of phlebotomy of Fusca, and of the phlebotomy of Basilica, and for that reason it confers ash, and constriction of anhelatus, and fissures of the instrument of anhelatus, and cough, and filling.
And it is necessary that it be driven by a gentle breeze of Alkehel somewhat, because if it is put downwardly, it generates weakness in the heart, and in the stomach.
The ventosation however confers pain to the accidental injuries in the head, and to the eyes, and to the headaches, and to the perforations, and to the pain in the roots of the teeth; and it is the place of phlebotomy of Basilica.
And it is necessary that you follow the instructions of Ventosatori, so that he does not hold his hand with scarification: lest he strike an artery, and cause a flow of blood.
But the ventosation under the chin, confers alcohol in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar ailments that are in the mouth: and it is the place of phlebotomy of Alihehrich, which are in the two lips.
But the ventosation of the spatula, confers to the alchafach, which is made by a replexion, and by a heat.
The ventosation of the internal parts however, confers a juementum of phlebotomy of the three veins, of Basilica, and of Fusca, and of Cephalica: for itself it attracts blood from all those small veins that are in the flesh: and these small veins attract the grosser veins from them, until the attraction reaches the three veins.
It is fitting that you instruct Ventosator not to make too many incisions, for the place is bare of flesh, and beneath it are nerves and arteries.
But the vents that venose on the perineum bring hemorrhoids of the anus and ulcers of the lower parts.
And you should instruct Ventosator to make a large vent and to use metal, for the place requires strong suction, and perhaps the fine vents might break: and let there be a large scarification.
But the vents of the legs diminish by a visible amount: for they draw blood from all the body, and bring on old pains in the kidneys and ligaments and blisters: they induce menstruation, and bring hemorrhoids and a twinging pain: and stand in the place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and of the alhorcobene.
However, they weaken the body very much, and bring about syncope in many people.
And the duration of the alhorcobene is close to that of the two vents of the legs.
The quality of the position of the vents is that you should place the vent in the first place in a hollow place, and suck with moderate suction: and do not prolong the position of the vents, but put them quickly, and move them quickly so that the humors go to the place by way of gleichness: and do not cease to repeat that and continue, until you see the place already red and swollen, and a rubedo of blood appears: then therefore scarify, and repeat suction slowly. Then consider in the disposition of the bodies.
For he who is of tender flesh and rare porridge, should scarify himself once only, not more: lest the place ulcerate.
And instruct Ventosator to make the scarification wider and deeper: and temper suction in ease, and speed, and moving sway.
For if there is grossness of blood, then you should scarify yourself twice. In fact, with the first incision, the road to the subtle blood is opened and it is washed out; and with the second, the precise extraction of thick blood.
If indeed the blood is foul, then let a third incision be made so that the last result is achieved.
And finally, when we want to extract blood little by little or only a bit at a time, one incision is enough for us. That if we want multiple extractions of blood, then we make several incisions.
And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it must be made, that an extensive incision is made; and the equal depth of the incision, is the depth of the skin.
What is that which needs to be administered from oils in relation to the ventilation of winds, and what causes the wind-chill?
IN that which has a thick, hard, dark skin and its pores are closed, it is necessary to oil the areas of ventilation with open, soothing, and melting oils: if it is in the time of summer, such as is the oil of almond, or the oil of olive, or the oil of apricot seeds, or the oil of cucumber seed.
And if it is in the time of winter, then olive oil, or lotus oil, or chamomile oil, or sarzine oil: and similar ones.
If indeed there is a cold excess, then olive oil, or bitter almond oil, or balsa-root oil, or alburnum oil, or annerose oil: and similar ones.
If indeed the wind-chill has large pores and tender flesh, then it is necessary to prevent the use of oil, and these areas should be washed after ventilation with rosy water, or cold water, or sun water, or cucumber water, or portulaca water: and similar ones.
This is for the one whose blood has a lot of moisture, washes the winds with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and with sumac: and similar ones.
Whoseever the swellings are great, he shall wash his ventosas with old wine, or with water of samzuc, or with decoction of anis, or with chamomile; and these are similar.
And it is necessary that the ventosas should be bathed in a bath, or in a pan of a bath; and it is also necessary that he should administer after going out from the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
And it is not necessary that anyone should sleep after the ventosas.
What is that which it is necessary that he be treated before the ventosas? And what is that which it is necessary that he be treated after the ventosas?
And after that, you shall consider first of all: then if the one who is treated is cholerical, and the sharpness and inflammation of his blood are great: then he should take something that will cool him down, such as granatum muscatum; also lettuce with vinegar and leeks, and secandubain, and juleb: and these are similar.
And put away from him the foods that cause itching, and all kinds of meat that he should eat, and prepared foods with honey: and these are similar.
And whoever has a cold complexio, he shall take in a drink syrup of honey, or of almy, or alssecandubain made from seeds; and he shall take medium strong wine, which is between new and old: and it should be commanded that he eat in moderation. And put away from him the foods that cause itching, and all kinds of meat, and birds, that is, many birds: and let him eat quail that are raised in a cage.
And it is necessary that the drink of the day of the ventosas and the phlebotomy be greater than the food: and it is necessary that a certain man should take in a drink some kind of toryac alfaroch, or medicine made from musk, that is, granatum muscatum, or alselsith before the ventosas; and before the phlebotomy, or after: so that the principal members may be strengthened, and the blood be softened. And it is not necessary for them to take it out of a hot vessel.
¶ About Ventosis without scarification. But the venose that are without scarification, are venose that are placed on the liver, and the spleen, and the podagra, and on the stomach, and the umbilical region, and the places of the bowels, and the skin of the anus: for these limbs do not suffer from scarification applied to them.
And it is not questioned about them, except by the attack of blood from one member to another member: as we place the venose on the breasts in the disease of flux of blood from the nose. And we use them, so that we may remove cold venosity that has entered into a member: as we place the venose on the stomach and the umbilical region. For itself it tightens the limb, and warms it, and takes away the pain because it has resolved that venosity.
Also, we place them on the kidneys when a deposit occurs there, or a stone. For by its own attraction it perhaps opens the deposit, or removes the stone from its place.
And likewise, when it is placed on the liver and the spleen, to resist venosity that is coming into them from both sides.
And these Venose are administered with a little cut only. And they are sometimes administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of warm water in pleural diseases: and that is, so that the venose may be filled, and great, with hot water alone, or with water in which have been boiled herbs that are fitting for it.
Form of Venose administered with fire.
Let the width of its opening be two fingers wide, according to which form we have made it: and let the quantity of it in the depth be half a palm: and let it sit on the outside of the member that is about the middle of it, a small hole, according to the quantity that is put into it: let it be made of copper, or brass, with a margin that is broad, soft, equal, smooth: so that it may not hurt the member at its position on top of it: and let there be a wire across the middle of it, made of copper, or iron, where a candle is placed with fire.
And now this good wine is great, greater than we have told, and less little, according to the health and age of him who drinks it.
For winds are good for young men, and other things make a man weak, as wind does for young men, and as bulk of body does.
The quality of this wine when put on fire on the member is, as if you light a candle with fire from linen that is out of place, or a small candle made from wax: and set it on the middle of the back which is in the middle of the wind: so that the heat of the fire may surround the lower part of the wind, so that the body does not burn.
Then put on the member: and let the finger be placed over the hole that I have said, until we hold the wind: while we are holding it, let us take away the finger, and the vapor shall come out through that hole, and the wind shall immediately be released.
Then set fire to the linen according to its shape, and repeat doing so if you are able to endure it.
In the wind, however, which is administered while sick with pleurisy with water, there is neither a transverse member nor a hole: and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and put on the member alone.
This is its form.
And this wind is the better when it is greater, as it takes a lot of water, for it is better.
Regarding the suspension of blood-sugar.
Blood-sugar are not administered in many, unless the member is impossible to hold wind because of its smallness, such as a lip or gums, and similar things. Or in a naked member, stripped of flesh, such as a finger, or nose, and similar things.
And the quality for using them is: that you might come from blood-sugar which are in sweet waters, pure from corruption.
Then they are dismissed day and night in sweet water, until they are hungry, and there is nothing left in their stomachs. Then the body is drained first with phlebotomy, and then with ventosis. Then wash the member with nurses' water until it turns red. Then place a poultice on top of the wound.
When it is well-filled and the discharge is heavy, and there is a possibility of suction at the site with ventosis, then it is more effective to dress the wound: otherwise, then wash the area with vinegar. Then with lot of water, and rub it, and express it.
If the flow of blood is prolonged after the application of sanguine sugar, and it remains sticky: then put a linen cloth in cold water, and place it on top, until the stickiness goes away.
If the blood increases, then sprinkle on top of the wound ground turmeric or eggshells, and similar things from astringents: until the blood is absorbed.
Or place on top of the area half-parts of scraped herbs: and leave them, until the herbs adhere to the area, since the blood is absorbed.
And it is necessary if it is needed to repeat the application of sanguine sugar, change them when possible.
If sanguine sugar is prohibited by suspension, then wash the area with recent blood. Or set it aside for a time, until something of the blood has come out. Then place them on top, because they themselves, when they feel some of the blood, adhere immediately.
When you want to remove them, sprinkle on top of them something of ground aloe or salt or ash, and they fall immediately.
This chapter is also frequently necessary in the art of Medicine, and it includes the restoration of a fracture, and the dislocation of accidents in bones.
Know ye sons, that ye have here a stout and sturdy chapter of the art of Surgery and Plaster, which is taken from an ancient book, neither read nor seen by you, nor any of the doctors or apothecaries of your time, who have never read the ancient book from which it is extracted, nor read one word thereof.
And for this reason, this method is fitting, because it is a secret of the sciences known on our land. And I was never good in it at all, and I did not attain to it except because of the length of reading the ancient books, and study on their intelligence, until I drew out the science from them.
Then I adhered to experiment and study with the length of my life.
And I have already described for you from it in this chapter all the science that contains my knowledge: and with regard to experiment which I abbreviated to you, after I shortened it to you, and freed it from extension, and shortened it by abstraction, and showed it at the end of depreciation: and I formed in it many forms out of forms of instruments that are administered in it, when it is out of depreciation addition, as I did in two preceding chapters.
Chapter II.
It is necessary that we say in the prologue of this chapter, that the speech and chapters are considered at which the craftsman is thought in the first place on its veracity: namely that you, and who are willing, know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
I say then, that when it happens to anyone fracture, or dislocation, or torsion, or fall: then you have to be prepared first in phlebotomandum him and soluendum it, or both at the same time: if it does not prohibit something, like weakness of virtue: or is he who happened anything from those boys: or an old man decrepitus: or is the time of vehemence heat, or vehemence cold.
Then he is satisfied with his food, and cold foods, and meat of birds, and hair: and prohibits wine, and fatty meats, and what fills the blood vessels: and prohibits all food that fills the blood vessels. When you have recovered from your heat and are no longer in a state of fever, and you have not poured out any matter onto the member, then return to your usual regime first with those who used to do so.
When the broken jaw therefore begins to be healed, then it is necessary that the sick person eat food that is nourishing, thick, dark-colored, and rich in substances: as food made from wheat flour mixed with water, and rice, and beans, and legs of beef, and entrails, and birds, and fresh fish; and strong wine, and similar things. For this regime, when the blood clotting from the break is faster and better.
And know that broken bones, when they are in the first age of decrepitude and old age, cannot continue and solidify according to their nature forever, because of the drying up of their members: and they solidify and continue what is in the end of lightness, like the bones of young boys.
However, nature fills a broken bone with something similar to glue on all sides, in which there is richness and it clings and binds itself together, until it is joined together from one side, and is tied together from one side, until it has come to the end of strength and solidity, as it was at first, until it does not prevent its operations: and for this reason it is necessary that you place nourishing food in the sick person's diet, in which there are riches, and richness, and richness, as we have said.
And know that the types of breaks are various, according to the diversity of the members: for a break in the leg is different from a break in the skull: and a break in the breastbone is different from a break in the spine: and likewise all the other members differ from each other: and I come with a reminder of all the types of breaks exposed in their own chapter, distinct from the rest. And the species of bone break also differ from one another.
For that reason his fracture is arcuate, aside from what happens to him with stars. And when his fracture is according to the length of the bone: and there are fractures of his sagittais, that is, stars, and additions coming from, as they are in the calamus, when it is grasped with the knife for writing. And not coming from: and there is a fracture with ulna and dislocation in the head: and there is a fracture a small crack.
And every kind of art, or special instrument in restoring him, according to which comes his remembrance, separated in its places.
And from that it is known the fracture of the bone, is its flexibility, and eminence: and appearance of it to sense, and sound when you compress it with your hand.
When therefore it is not in place the flexibility appears, and sound at the touch of your hand when you press the bone with vibration, and there does not come a great pain from it: then it is not broken there, but possible that there is flexibility, or a small crack: so you do not need to move him with your hand and compression at all, but put on it with care from doctors, whose memory comes from after the time that it suits the place: then tighten gently.
And you shall know that the place when it is arcuate, and split in two, aside from what happens to him with stars, yet all part of it moves apart from its other: then it is necessary for you, that you begin at your hour from now to straighten it, making even it before it happens to him the apostema heat.
If then it happens to him the apostema heat, then let you leave him days a few, until he rests the apostema. Then even him according to whatever way can from length and ingenium.
And you shall know that the restoration of it, and its making even, is easier than of the bones, in which happen stars.
Then tighten him, according to which comes your remembrance of him.
If there are fractures in the bones, then it is necessary to extend this broken member from two parts, if the hand is involved, or the foot: or with your own hand, if the member is small: or with two ropes, or a rope and a hand.
And let your position be such that you place the member on a place equal to its natural position, until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then take care, so that you can bring back these additions with all ingenuity, and according to any form that you can in your places: and let it be careful according to your strength, so that no pain happens over the weak one through your operation, nor through neglect: and let it be careful according to your strength, that you apply one two bones with his partner, according to better forms.
And it is necessary at that hour, that you try and touch it with your own hand. If then you see anything different there, straighten it out, and make it equal according to the quantity of your strength.
And take care that the extension is gentle, and the pressure strong, as many do with dull-witted people. For often happen through their operation itself a warm apoplexy, or a contraction in the member: for we have already seen this from their operations many times.
Then connect after the equality, and the setting of the operation, and the tightening of its member, and rest, and peace: and warn the weak one about it. And let the member be careful not to move it in the hour of their weakness, and its sleep during its resolution, and agitation, and its defecation, and all its movements at the last power of itself. And so that it is careful, so that the position of the member does not remain in a position from which pain follows. That is, because when it feels the pain of the member's position, or injury: then it should be moved, so that you change its position from that with which he does not feel pain.
And take care with him, so that that position of his is equal and straight: lest there come about in the limb a deviation, when it is restored.
And the quality of the stricture of the broken member is, according to which narow.
You should know that broken limbs differ in their fracture, and in their size, and in their form.
Which of these are small, such as the arm, and the finger, and the foot, and similar to them, then it is fit that there be an involution of soft cloth, thin. Which however of these are thick, such as the hip, and the shin, it is fit that there be in them a involution of broad, hard cloth.
Since the broad ligament connects the large member, and tightens it from all parts with an equal tension, so that it does not become affected by a bruise.
Then begin after you have drained off your liniment suitable for that place, in soft cloth over the site of the fracture. Then begin to involute the ligament over the site of the fracture three or four times, as much as the limb deserves: and tighten your hand with the ligament a little.
Then move with it to the upper part from the site of the fracture, and tighten less than your own tension that you tightened the broken place: and tighten as much as that tension. Then lengthen yourself with the involution a little from the site of the fracture, and soften your tension slowly, until you have taken away from the place a great deal.
Then take another poultice, and involute it again over the broken place. Then move with the involution to the lower part from the fracture. And let your operation be in the involvement and softening of it, as we said in the first superior involution.
Then put between the involutions soft cloth or cloth, with which to make equal any deviation of the fracture, if there is a deviation in it: and if not, do not put anything in it.
Then I carefully removed the old one and put on a new one. Then immediately place equal-sized stars over the incisions if there is no swelling or heat.
If there is however swelling or a blister: then place over it what sits [there], and remove the swelling: and let it go for a few days. Then tie the stars tightly over it.
And let the stars be made from the mid-section of a cane that is flat and shaped wisely: or let them be made from wood from which are made sieve-like cribs, which are made from pine, or splinters, that is, palm branches, or from tar: and let the width of each star be, according to this form, and this figure.
However, it is necessary that the star which is placed over [the wound] should be somewhat larger and wider than the others: and the length of the star should be according to what is suitable for the member in size and shape.
Then tie the stars together with another thread, according to the first stricture of the same form. Then tie it from above with diagonal threads, according to what we have said about the stricture: and let it be, so that your stricture is over the site of the fracture more: and as much as the length from the fracture increases, so does the stricture decrease.
And it should be that the middle threads in thickness and fineness are made of soft linen.
Because if the threads are thick, such that from them hanging on the outside of the member with the thread from the chord made of twisted linen there is a great mistake: for it falls when out of its quality.
And again, fine threads do not agree: because you would not achieve what you want by means of the stricture with them.
And it is not necessary that there be less than a finger's space between one star and another.
Because if a weak person is left lying under the stars after the stricture in healthy places: then place soft straw, or red wool, under them until there is no injury from it.
When there is a fracture with the ulna, and there is a disruption in the skin, I will speak of it in the second chapter due to its uniqueness.
And you should know that not every broken limb needs to be held with splints from the first day. That is, because the limb is large when it is broken, it should not be put on a splint above the joint, except after five days or seven or more, according to your security from the onset of gangrene.
And this is the way that ancient people used to splint, which are placed above the fracture and dislocation.
The common shortened way of splinting, for restoring fractures, suitable for many complexions, especially for women and children; since it is not affected by heat or cold.
And it is so that you take from the flour that is to be ground, and there is a flour that hangs on the walls of the mill when it is moved by the mill; and put it together as it is, except for the sifting of it with alba; and place its coating not thick, nor thin. Then use it.
The other way of splinting, for restoring fractures, dislocations, and twists. Take also myrrh, acacia, and sandalwood, and mastic, and molasses; and the juice of all these, and aloes of both sexes, each XX drachms, and alethin, XX drachms, to be boiled with alba; or with alethin if the complexion is hot. Then use this splint. For it is a good composition, quickly healing broken bones, and suitable for many people.
The other way of splinting, which also confers with fractures and twists. Take also mastic, and myrrh, and alethin alba, of all these XX drachms of each, and acacia XVI drachms, and bolus Armenian XVI drachms; they are to be well kneaded together, and sifted, and mixed with water, or with alba; and let them be administered.
The mode of poultices for bandages, and for bones separated from their places; it calms the pain, the injury, the cutting of the bone, and the fracture. Take wool wetted with oil and immersed in vinegar and oil-decocted; and place it on the spot.
And this poultice has no power of restoration, but it is good for calming hot abscesses; and it drives away the pains on its own.
The mode of poultice, which restores a broken bone. Take leaves of fig tree that are sound, and leaves of wild papaw; and dry them all, and make a poultice of both.
The mode of a shortened poultice, administered at the restoration of a fracture of the bone; and when you wish to resolve a hot abscess. Take roots of marshmallow and of chamomile and of wild flower, and of herb-grain, all in equal parts; dry them all, and make them into a poultice with wine, unless it is a member that needs to be warmed.
If it needs to be warmed, then make it with water of coriander seeds moistened, or with water, and use it.
The mode of a stronger poultice for the resolution, which is different from this one, when the abscess becomes hard to be restored. Take roots of marshmallow and of flax seed and of mullein and of mealy-seed and of sweet marjoram and of chamomile, all in equal parts; dry them all, and make them into a poultice with water of willow, or with sweet water, or with wine. All this depends on the heat of the member, and on the calm of its heat.
Hippocrates, however, in his book did not say that a broken member should be placed on poultice made of ashes and oil; no other: and he related, that it should be between coarseness and tenderness.
But Galen, however, used to place on a broken member, at the restoration of it, things that dry up heat, such as myrrh and aloe and olive oil, and similar things from those which we have related.
The method of making plasters for injury and pain. Take mugg, and chickpea, and hair of man's incisorous teeth, or feather of bird's wing, and amber, and equal parts of salt: they are to be ground, and sifted, and made into a plaster; and let it be made from these.
But the quantity according to what is necessary, that the ligature remain, and then dissolve, you are to consider then, if it does not happen to the sick man pain, nor itchiness, nor moves the broken bone from its place: then do not dissolve it over many days. If it should happen to him in the place itchiness severe, or disturbing pain, or swelling: then approach, and dissolve at the hour itself, and take away the plaster from him: and receive a linen cloth, or sea sponge, wet with lenitive: and dip it in tepid water, and wash with it the place, until the itchiness is calmed, and the pain subsides.
If it should happen to him in the place itchiness severe, or disturbing pain, or swelling: then approach, and dissolve at the hour itself, and take away the plaster from him: and receive a linen cloth, or sea sponge, wet with lenitive: and dip it in tepid water, and wash with it the place, until the itchiness is calmed, and the pain subsides. Then let go of the member to rest for one hour. Then put over it the succous cloth, dipped in vinegar and oil, or oil infused: and bandage over it at nightfall, so that he be safe from heat, and the swelling of the member subsides, and the pain of him moves away.
Then again you are to bind it with a loose ligature, and make the plaster thin: and do not bind him with your own constriction first, and fine things, until he is healed.
If you see, that the swelling, and redness, and pain, and inflation, and all accidents are now completely gone away, and the plaster and ligature do not irritate, then again you are to do as you did before, equally.
If it does not happen to the member any of those things which we said, then do not dissolve it over three days, or four, or five, or seven. And when that is dismissed after twenty days all of it, according to what appears to you from the dissolving of the member, as we said, until at times it seems to adhere to the fracture, and the coagulation of meat comes close to it: add also then to the ligature more than your first ligature all over: and add also in the swelling of food, according to what preceded its memory.
If you see the place of fracture already drying up and becoming weaker than necessary: then you should know that nourishment is forbidden to reach it. So wrap it up with warm water wherever there is a crack, and let it rest for three days, and then relieve the swelling slightly.
By this operation, therefore, the member runs to nutrition and heals quickly.
But that which do the dull restorers from a fracture member, if not restored first, and second because it should be, and restored according to the tortuosity, is an error of their operation, and a great fear: and if it were right, the ancients in their books would say so, and operate with it.
And I did not see anywhere of theirs in that at all, and better is not to do that.
§ On the making of an accident in the head.
There are various kinds of fractures, and many forms of them: and their causes are distinct.
For from a fracture there is one which is made by impact, and impact carries the bone off entirely as far as it reaches to the syphac, which is under the bone, such as it does in wood: and for that reason this kind of fracture is called the axial fracture.
Or a certain bone is hit by an edge and hits the face of it, and does not penetrate with its cut to the very end of it: and this kind of fracture is called the Kalaan fracture, that is, an absolute sliding.
And this is a break between two fractures, or great, or small.
And there is one fracture that is a crush, or a grinding: and its cause is impact with a stone, or falling on a stone, or the like.
And this fracture is also one that pierces, which is coming close to a pannus, which is under the bone: or is in the face of the bone: and this is also one of those two fractures between which is small or great.
And from fracture is, which is hidden in bone in subtility hair: and is small crack, and for that it is named this kind of fracture Capillaris.
And from these is fracture, which happens by accident, or by hitting a stone, and similar ones that make the layer of bone go inside, and makes a hole: such as happens in the caldarium of air when it happens to him a hit, and some of them are made inside.
And indeed much is this thing in heads of damp bones, as are the heads of boys.
And these species of fracture are separated by the age of the body, and I come to remind myself of all this thing in its place.
And we know all these species of fracture by examination on them, and with their research, and by removing the corrupted meat that is on them.
And indeed this species of fracture is recognized by the fact that it is found on the bone, and is scrubbed off, and put on it with caustic: for the fracture appears black.
In cure of the fracture, you should consider first the nursing injuries: then if you see from these injuries what means a clear meaning over fear, such as black eye, and spread, and loss of mind, and cutting of voice, and syncope, and acute fever, and outlet of eyes, and redness of them, and similar to them from these injuries in many dispositions, without doubt he will not heal: and if you see non-terrifying injuries to him, and hope for his health: then begin to treat him.
What is, if it has come to you wounded first with injury: and this is in the days of winter, then you should try to remove the bone before the day of the twelfth.
And if it is in the days of summer, then you should try to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone from a flap, and these injuries we have described.
If the fracture of the bone has reached the membrane touching the brain, and is with a little and attraction: then it is necessary that you should break the part torn up, and crushed, as I will tell you.
And it is that you should shave the head of the wounded person: and detect on the bone in any way possible to you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is leprous on the sick.
That if it happens to you in the detection of the bone that a flow of blood or hot pus: then oppose it with that which is necessary. And it is that you should fill the place with cloths steeped in wine, and rosin oil: and make the wound quiet, until the pus is dried up, and are secure from the flow of blood. Then begin in the cure of the bone, and removal thereof.
And that is to be done according to two ways.
One way is that you should break the bone with a sharp chisel: and this is the form thereof.
Then take another Incisory behind the first one by as much as you will: and this is the form thereof.
Then also take another Incisory wider than the second one: and this is the form thereof.
And the second way is that you have with you a number of chisels different: some of them are wider than others, and some of them are shorter: and they are at the extremities of their sharpness, and are of iron, or of brass: and use ease in striking on the chisel, so that it does not hit the head, and hurts itself.
But if the bone is strong and hard: then it is necessary that you should bore around it before administering the chisels with lead which are called lead-plums: and they are not so named except because they do not pass beyond the end of the bone to the flesh behind it: for that is the end round over it, under its acute head, similar to a margin, and a little circle prevents its plunging down into, and penetrating the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.
And it is fitting that you should receive from these terbri a great number, each of which corresponds to the quantity of the thickness of bone, until the present one is present for all the head terebrum: whose acute quantity in length and brevity lies according to the quantity of the thickness of its skull. And this is the form of the three species of terbri, or trepanas.
The quality of piercing around the fractured bone, is that: you should place the terebrum on the bone, and rotate it with your fingers, until you know that the bone has been penetrated. Then change the terebrum to another place and put what is between all the holes of the quantity of thickness, or around it.
Then cut with the incisors what is between all the holes from the bone, and make it finer than you can on it at the end of lightness, as we have said, until you eradicate the bone, or with your hand, or with some other instrument that you have prepared for it: such as tenaculum, and subtile forpi.
And it is necessary, so that you should be cautious of any kind of touch, not to let the terebrum or any of the incisors touch anything sharp.
When you have thus circled the bone by piercing it, and separated it from the syringomyelia, if it is continuous with it, and you extract it, then you should shave, and make equal the extremities of it that remain in the bone with another similar incisory instrument. However, it is necessary that it be small and fine with other incisors.
That if there remains anything of the bones little, and fragile: then take it with ease, with what is with you of instruments. Then be careful of the screw after that with oil and grease which we have said.
And another mode of the operation is easy, far from fear: which Galen said, and praised himself greatly: and this is his saying. Necessarily it is necessary for you, first of all, that you begin to lift up the bone's part from the place where the fracture is more intense and more obvious: until, when you have lifted up that part, and have placed under it this lens-shaped incisor, whose this is the form.
And the lens-shaped part, smooth does not hurt anything; and the sharp sides of it, when it moves on its two sides along the length, as you see: so that the lens-shaped part is placed on the sifon, facing the sharp side into the bone.
Then hit over the incisor on a part with a small mallet, until you hit all the bone with ease, as it turns out: and you are safe from panic, because there is no accident in it, which you really fear.
And if the medicant is not a fool of men, and more ignorant of his own: and if he were not asleep, then if there remained something attached to the bone from the pannicle in some places, it would hit itself from that man with the end of the lens-shaped incisor, and would free itself from him with ease. For it is freed from him without harm, and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate as far as the pannicle, and that which is cut off from the bone is the shape of it, and there remain in it roughness and subtle swellings: then it is necessary that you should rub off that roughness, and pluck out those swellings with sharp knives from which you have prepared a number of different quantities, so that it is possible for you to administer them in all places more convenient for them, and straighter for their shapes, according to the surgery which leads you, and this broken bone, and its shape. And it is necessary that you should administer in your ratio, first of all, the edge of the bone, wider of those razors. Then cut the uterus after the same.
And it is necessary that you should administer in your ratio, first of all, the edge of the bone, wider of those razors. Then cut the uterus after the same. And do not cease to do that according to continuity, until you have reached to administer the narrowness, and the thinner of all.
In every one of the remaining wounds of the lungs, the hair-like, and the fragile, it is necessary to administer care according to that which leads to the rectification of it.
And this is a thing that does not hide over everything, to which in this art is any study, and stood on what we have written, and showed in the large fractures.
But if the little patch has been put on it when you pierce the bone: then it is necessary that you take the linen cloth, according to the quantity of the wound, and dip him in the rose oil, and put him on the opening of the wound. Then take another piece of cloth doubled, or tripled, and dip him in the wine and rose oil, and put him on the first cloth: and make that which you can do easier over that, so that it does not chafe the wound.
Then administer over it the wide ligament: and do not tighten him, unless according to the quantity which holds the bone only: and let go of him with this cure one day, or two days, until you are safe from the hot shower. Then dissolve him, and administer after it the medicines with which is superfluous dryness: like the roots of the lily, and the flour of the herb, and the powder of the thistle, and the aristolochia, and such: and it is, that you make from these medicines a powder, which powder is scattered over the bone as are dry.
And administer universally on it all medicine of its property whose is to clean up, and does not bite. And cause according to your virtue, that the bone is in your cure clear: and it does not sit in it the grease of the ointment, nor the filthiness.
And cause according to your virtue, that the bone is in your cure clear: and it does not sit in it the grease of the ointment, nor the filthiness. And do not leave the virus aggregari in it at all: because when the virus aggregates over the little cloth of the brain, it corrupts him, and putsrefies him, and occurs over great malice after that: and has already occurred in the scalp, when it is washed out by him, especially when the care of him is neglected, the black spot on its surface.
Therefore, if such accidents occur in an infirm person, know that it is certainly deadly.
And if the blackness does not occur, unless a medicine is applied to it which makes it black: then you should take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and linseed with them, and wrap them in a cloth. Then place the wound on a couch: then care for the wound with the types of treatment that are appropriate, until it heals.
For the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose is not broken unless both parts of it break at the same time, or one of them: for there are two bones in it; because the lower part is cartilaginous, it does not break, and does not happen to it except by rubbing, and tortuosity, and shape.
If one of the two parts of it breaks, then you should insert your little finger into the nostril and tighten it with your index finger and thumb until the nose returns to its natural shape: and do this with ease. And beware lest by your operation you cause him pain on the sick bed.
That if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and does not reach that part with a finger: then you should smooth out the edge where the thickness is small.
If the fracture is indeed in the two parts, then make it similar to that: and proceed with its restoration on the day when it was broken, if possible. And if not, then after seven or ten days at most, during calm weather.
Then insert into the edge of the nose with a piece of linen cloth if it has broken in one part, or two pieces if it has broken in both parts: and let it be of such a thickness as to fill the nostril.
And some ancient restorers would say that they pour linen cloth into butter and change it every day. Thus is not true for me, with this it is necessary that the licinus be infused into the albus, and in the dust of the grindstone. Then let go of the licinus, until the bone hardens, and the cartilage is hardened.
And when a feather of an goose is at times inserted in the place of the licinus in the nose, after it has been wrapped with a soft cloth: and so it is, that it holds the fracture of the nose more firmly, and does not prevent the sick from breathing.
And this is not necessary. If you wish, make it so: and if you wish, make the licinus.
That if it should happen that while you are operating the nose a bleeding occurs, then bind the nose with a green thing, or with a cloth soaked in rose oil, or with a little of the herb dacyilon.
If it does not happen that a bleeding occurs, then it is necessary that theemplastre itself with wheat flour, and the dust of turpentine mixed with the albus. Then put on top of it a wooden stump, and do not bind the nose with anything at all.
If it is that the bones of the nose are broken or crushed, then it is necessary that you split them open, and remove each one with the instruments that are suitable for them. Then continue with the cutting, and take care of the nose with what is suitable to ease the inflammation, and consolidate it with the emplastre that is suitable for it, or with an ointment.
If a nail appears between the nose, then it is necessary that you care for it with the licinus: and administer a tube of lead, until it heals.
For the restoration of the lower jaw, when it is broken.
When the lower jaw is broken and is not connected to the nail: examine then if it is a fracture of the end only, and does not break into two parts, and take care of the inner part: then the knowledge of it is easy.
If therefore it is a fracture of the bone in part of the right side, so that you introduce the index finger of the left hand into its mouth: likewise if the fracture is in the left mandible, then introduce the index finger of the right hand; and push with it the gibbousness of the fracture within, easily toward the exterior, with your other hand from the interior part of the bone, and with it make equal itself.
That if the fracture of the mandible is already separated into two, then it is necessary that you provide extraction from the two parts, according to the straightness: until such time as it is possible to make equal itself.
If however it has already happened in the teeth, a jolt, or a rupture: then tighten them of which you hope that they remain with a wire of gold, or silver, or silk. Then put over the broken mandible ceratum. Then put over the same cloth, and put over a large wood-shave made equal: or a fragment of sole skin of equal length as the mandible.
Then bind it above, according to what was prepared for you by way of a ligature, and the application is suitable, until it is not destroyed: and order the sick person that he use peace and quietness: and provide food for his nourishment.
If however you estimate, that already something of the figure is changing by some way: then come near, and undo it on the third day. Then adjust what has been disturbed from it, and plug up the hole with flour that is fine, after you have removed the ceratum: and put over the plug wool that is soft.
While therefore that attachedplug of wool remains over it, and the disposition of the bone is not altered, discharge him, do not undo it, until it is healed: or tighten the fracture. This fracture is often tightened for seven times.
That if meanwhile a hot swelling happens: then administer to it what we said often in the sedative of it, until it moves that swelling.
And if the fracture is with the ulna, consider. I have seen a fragment separated from the bone, or cut with a chisel: then do you carefully in this case, so that you remove these fragments of chisel with what is proper to you in their removal from instruments.
If the opening of the wound is narrow, then increase it by means of the phlebotome according to the quantity of your need.
Then when you remove these chisels, and there remains nothing of them, then close the wound if it is wide: and if not, put over it those strips that are suitable for it, and let it heal by infiltration, until it is healed.
Regarding the restoration of the fork, when it is broken.
Many things are broken from the front part of the shoulder, and the fracture of this is done in one of three ways.
Or it is broken and separated into two, except that they happen to be in her chisel: and it is easier to restore it.
Or otherwise, that they happen on the chisel bone: and it is more difficult to restore it.
Or else, that is the fracture with the ulna.
And the operation in it when the fracture is without the ulna, is, that you may have these two ministers, so that one of them holds a support following the broken fork, and the other extends the neck towards the back side.
Then make the fracture of your fingers equal, so that it may take its shape, according to what is required: and do not let it be prominent, or irregular.
That if you can tolerate a greater extension, then it is necessary that you place under a pillow a sphere made of cloth or wool: and let the size of it be according to the quantity of your need: and extend it, and tighten the fork, and press the sphere with your hand, until the fracture is equal, according to what is required.
That if you cannot draw the end of the fork towards the outside: for this reason, because it reaches to the inside: then it is necessary that it lies down on its cheek: and place under its shoulder a sphere of wool of the right size, and press its minister who is at the bottom, until he raises the bone of the fork which is in the inside to the top: and then correct the fracture, and make it equal with your fingers.
If you feel a satahium from the furcula and it is painful: then you should find it on top of that, and with ease take out the satahium itself with your fingers.
If it is stuck in a bone, then you should prepare the incision with one of the incisories that you prepared for it, after you have placed under the furcula an instrument that will lift up the sifah: and this instrument is made of wood or iron. And this is its shape.
It is joined to a cochlea which is not cut short.
And its width is according to that by which you feel comfortable with the size of the bone and its length. Its length also depends on what is possible for you to operate.
And it has two ends, as you see: and one end is wide, and the other end is narrow.
If, however, the injury that you made when you took out the bone fragment is wide, and if it is secure from the warm apomictic liquid: then you should join the two sides of the wound together with a stitch.
And if the injury is small, or if you are afraid of the warm apomictic liquid: then you should fill the wound with wool and powder according to the amount of the wound that has been cut.
If, however, the warm apomictic liquid occurs: then you should pour on the wool a rosin oil, and vinegar, and wine, and set it down on top of it.
The stricture of the bone is when it is without a wound, and without a cut, it is, as you should place on the bone a paste made of ground flour with white chalk. And set a wood block on top of it. Then place a ball under its tip, if you can tolerate it. Then take up a wheel which the Saracens hold, which is long and wide: and its width should be that of a palm, or about that. Then place on the wood block a doubled powder, and a paste. Then take a star-shaped frame from a thin board, whose width is three fingers wide and whose length is also similar. Then wrap it in a cloth. Then wrap the cloth and the frame together with the healing herbs at the site of the fracture and place. Then place the healing herbs over the fracture as a bandage, and wrap it around his neck, and under his chin, healthy and sick on both sides: and see if it does not hold the fracture tightly as it descends: and this is so that it is not hidden from you, and all, so that it does not move the star from above the broken bone. And for this, it should be so that you see the sick one every day. Whenever you see the ligaments have loosened, then adjust the star and tighten the ligaments.
Then place a soothing ointment on his back, and under his chin, a mild ointment near his sleep, so that when he turns over it helps him from his side. So the fracture in the arm is healed through elevation of the shoulder.
Or bind his arms to his neck: and do not loosen the ligaments unless there is an accident from a fall or from hitting something until it has been twelve days.
Then anoint with oil if you see the face towards that place. And add to the tightness, and let him go, until it is restored and coagulated.
And this fracture in the arm is tightened and healed after fifty days: and sometimes it takes a little longer in some people.
The restoration of a fractured spatula.
Rarely does the spatula break, and not wide enough on the inside: and it does not break from it unless the edge is narrow.
But when it breaks from one side and not wide enough on the inside, and cannot be known unless felt: then, according to the shape of the fracture, prepare the treatment. And shape me according to the natural form with all the skill you possess, which is possible for you.
Then place the powder to be ground with albus (milk), and the wooden stick, and place the cloth over it. Then place on it the flat board from a thin sheet according to the quantity of the spoon of all, or larger or smaller a little.
If the powder is placed under the board at all in some places of the spoon, then make it even with the smooth wood until the board comes down according to the equality.
Then brush on top with long-lasting glue, pressing firmly against the board until it does not move from its place.
And consider the binding every day. As often as you can, when the glue is softened, tighten it up and make the board even if it moves from its place: and let the sick lie on the side of the healthy one.
And the spoon is restored after twenty or twenty-five days.
When then this number is completed, then undo the binding: and you are secure. For this same is made from bones whose connection is not feared, nor is their release.
But if it proceeds from a bone fragment, and pierces under the skin: then cut it on top of it, and remove it. And do as I said in the fracture of the fork from sitting in a hot bath, if anything happens from it.
The restoration of a broken breastbone.
The breastbone sometimes breaks in the middle, and this rarely happens. Its ends are broken most often, and they decay from its injuries.
When it breaks in the middle, which inclines to the lower part, and causes a severe pain, difficulty in breathing, and perhaps a cough up of blood, and the break is evident in the bone, and does not隠れ
Then press his shoulders and gather the ribs from both sides or from the sides with the hands: and subtilize in his equilibrium, according to all ways that it is possible to do so and agree, until he returns the figure of the bones, according to what is necessary.
Then put over him a plaster and a bandage, and put over the bandage a board of thin wood, or of calinger, and of similar things in lightness, after you have laid it with oil. Then subtilize in binding him over the broken bone, that it may not move: and push with the binding according to its roundness to his back sometimes, and tighten him by means of a tight bandage.
Then consider the binding at every hour, and whenever it becomes soft, tighten it: and if needful it prompts to its solution at pruritus, or to corruption which has come about in that place, or to pain, or to swelling: then approach, and solve it, and eradicate the plaster, and rectify what has happened with regard to the cure of it.
Then reduce the plaster, if you see to that face: and fasten him with a bandage, until he is healed.
De restoration of ribs, when they break.
You should know that the fracture of ribs does not occur, unless in the large places which follow the back, and from the extremities of them from the anterior part. And it does not happen to them any abrasion, except through this, because they are cartilaginous. And the knowledge of it does not hide from the sense in the inquiry with fingers.
And the restoration of it is made so, that an even fracture with fingers according to all ways that are possible, until it is even in figure, according to what is necessary. Then put on the plaster and tighten the broken bone with the bandage, if he does not like that.
And if the fracture of ribs has occurred to its inner part: then it happens to a sick person a severe pain, and a pricking, such as that which occurred to him who had pleurisy: for the bone pricks with pain, and also it happens to him that there is difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and much spitting of blood: and this is a difficult cure.
And also the ancients have been clever with many devices: and from them are those who say, that you set meat for the sick which generate inflammation and vomiting, so that the belly is inflamed, and is extended, and drives the fracture to the externals.
But we certainly despise, that it should not be made quickly for making a warm poultice, if it does not happen. But if it has already happened, then add it into it.
And some of them said: Let it be placed on a swollen place, and then suck with strength, and it is more similar to the reasoning. But they are afraid that the swollen fluid will attract supernumerary fluids to the place, because of the weakness of the disposition.
But some of them said: It should be covered with wool which has already been submerged in hot oil: and let there be put feathers between the ribs, so that it is filled up: so that the bandage is equal when it is rolled up according to its roundness.
Then let the sick person be cured with the cure of pleurosis from food and medicine.
That if he is restrained of the sick thing, which he does not bear, and the mouth stings by piercing with the awl, hurting the sick: then let us fear for the sick: then it should be, that we should split on the spot, and detect from the rib the broken. Then let us put over it an instrument which preserves the sifac, of whose memory came first: and let us pierce the mouth with ease, and let us pierce the same.
Then let us gather together two lips of the wound, if it is large with a suture: and let us cure him with plasters, until he is healed up.
That if it should happen while a warm poultice is placed, then let it come close, and pour feathers in rose oil, and put over the spot: and let the sick person be cured with that which suits the poultice.
In the meantime also it is raised up on the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed up.
¶ On the restoration of fractures of the spine and neck.
Of the restoration of a fracture of the spine and neck. Of the bones of the neck, too, a fracture sometimes occurs and rarely happens to them [the bones] when they are worn away: likewise to the spinal bones. Now, if such a thing happens to anyone and you want to know whether it will heal or not, then wait. For if you see his hands already softened, and numb, and dead: and cannot be moved or extended or pressed together, and when you press them with your fingers and prick them with an acorn, he feels nothing, and does not feel pain in them: then know that it will not heal, and is fatal in many ways.
That if he moves them and feels the sensation of touch and pain when pricked: then know that the bones of his neck are healed, and that the sick will recover with treatment.
That if it is similar to the back bones and you want to know whether it will heal or not, then observe his feet: then if you see that they are softened, and what happens to his hands also happens to them: then when he lies on his back, he moves his legs and body without volition: and when he turns over on his stomach, he moves his body and legs without volition: and when he turns over on his back again, and wants to drink, and cannot: then know that it is fatal. So do not attempt to heal it.
But if nothing of this happens to him, the matter is lighter.
And the treatment that comes from this is, to put a little red oil on the spine so as not to be dry: or like when you wipe off sweat.
Place it on top of that sometimes in the day, until he is completely well; then place it on a support that comforts and dries out, and binds it tightly to that: and instruct the sick person to use it quietly and calmly. Do not let him sleep over the part where he feels pain until it is healed.
If it happens that there is a fracture of the bone or anything that has already become separated from it: then you should, so as not to damage the flesh, make a cut and remove it. Then take two edges of the wound, if it is large, with a stitch. Then care for himself with some ointment, from unguentium, until he is healed.
If the fracture is at the end of a bone that is bent outward, and there is an end to it: then you should, with the thumb of your left hand, push against the broken bone by the hand that can do so best, and with the second hand, equating it as much as possible.
Then put something on top of it, and take it off: and care for the wound with the cure that preceded it, until it is healed.
The restoration of the ankle.
Chapter XI.
Bone rarely break in the ankles. If they break, then their fracture is not, unless there is a splitting at the ends of them: and they split in length, and turn toward the inside: and it happens that there is pain in the place, and a piercing pain: and the shin bone splits when it breaks.
And the restoration of it is such that you extend your hand over it, until you stand on top of the fracture, which is as in this figure.
If the fracture is only at the ends of it, then make it equal, as it were, by preparing it for you from equating, until it resembles its natural figure.
If, however, the fracture is in length, or has already turned toward the inside: then let the sick person lie on his back, until you prepare for him the restoration of his fracture. When you have made it equal, put a plaster on top of it: then put an wooden or leather board over it: and tighten with a strap, so as not to allow the fracture to move, nor to remove the board.
And he made them equal in size when he filled them, until they were firm according to their equality: and you shall instruct the sick man to lie on his back or on his sound side.
But if it should happen that he has a warm swelling: then cease from extending it, and from healing it, until the warmth subsides: and put over him what he sits on, according to what preceded, and then return to healing it: and bind him as it should be.
But if it should happen that it has a broken bone, or is fractured: extract it.
Instructor
The assistant is that which is between the pillow and the head of the bed.
But if it should break, then its restoration is according to two ways.
One of which is that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this shape, which follows.
And bind together in both ends two ligaments.
Then hang it from a raised place: and let the sick man sit on a seat. Then let him put his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches the edge of its length, where there is a small piece of wood attached to it.
Then hang it from above the person with something heavy, that he may stretch himself out for the assistant who will work on his lower part. Then the physician shall make the doctor even, at the same time, until he stops the fracture, according to what is needed.
And the other way is that the sick man lies on his back on his pillow, and hangs his hand from his neck with a ligament. Then instruct two assistants, that one of them hold what is above the fracture with his hands: and that the other holds below him, and stretches each of them to their side.
And if you wish for a stronger stretch, then bind under the fracture with a ligament, and over it with another ligament: and let each of the two assistants stretch to their sides.
If then a fracture is near to the extremity of the humerus, then it should be, so that one ligament is placed under the clavicle, and another below the fracture towards the femur.
And likewise if a fracture is near to the knee: then it should be, so that one ligament is placed on that spot, and over the knee itself.
Then an equal fracture should be set with ease without work, until the time when the fracture is made equal as needed, and applied with a good application: then tighten it, if there does not occur a swelling of heat.
But if a swelling of heat does occur, then release the tightening until the seventh day. And place on top of the limb a wet wool dressed in vinegar and rose oil, until the time when the swelling subsides: then tighten it: and the mode of tightening it is that you place a sponge over the fracture.
Then put an innovation from new cloth over the sponge. Then he will tighten his arm on top of his aid, and place his open hand on top of his shoulder.
And place a cloth, and tighten on top of the aid arm so that the arm remains in place: unless it prevents you from doing so, nor should anything be moved over you from the broken bone.
Which if the time comes, that something be moved over you from the broken bone, then use the blocks: and it is like to put on top of the fracture a block which is wider and stronger than the other blocks. And place between all the blocks a length of finger: and let the length of the blocks be equal to the fracture with an addition of three fingers from every side.
Then tighten on top of the blocks with the tightening which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And it should be, so that your tightening is tighter over the fracture spot. And the more the fracture lengthens, the looser the tightening.
If then you see the lengthening of the blocks and the loosening of the tightening, as we have said, at the time when you restore the limb immediately, then do so: and if you are afraid of a swelling of heat, then release the tightening and the blocks until the seventh day, as we have also said.
Then consider the ligament for all three days, so that there is no pruritus or swelling at the site, or to prevent food from reaching the member, due to the excess rigor of the stricture. Correct the whole thing, as we have said above.
But if you are really confident that nothing will come from it: then don't open the ligaments, unless after three days or more.
And let him sleep on his back, with his hands on his belly; and place under the pillow a blanket full of wool, even.
And consider at every hour of night or day, that the broken member does not open, or that the ligaments become soft. Correct the whole thing with your skill.
And provide the nurse with food according to the order we have specified, so that there is a fine food at first, until the mouth begins to tighten; then it should be, that his food increases.
For the custom of the aide and the limb is, that it be tightened for forty days; then it should be opened, and given a bath, and treated with ointment that straightens it out.
But if the fracture is sore, ground down; then don't open from it the ligaments or the splint until fifty days, and for two months.
The restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two clavicles.
One of them is small; and that is what follows the thumb. And the other is large, and that which is placed under a little from the lower part.
Perhaps then one of the clavicles will break alone, or the other; and perhaps they will break both at the same time.
But when the little clavicle breaks above, then the restoration of it is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the big clavicle breaks below, it is a bad break, and its healing is difficult.
And it is worse when two bones break at the same time.
If however the bone that is broken is slightly below the shoulder, then it is advisable for the doctor to approach its restoration in order to place the extension with ease until it is even.
If however the broken bone is a large one: then it is necessary that he put on a stronger splint quickly.
And it is necessary that he put on the hand figure at the restoration of it and its extended extension over the little finger. And let the thumb of the hand be set at a higher position than all the fingers: and let the articular inferior be set for all the fingers, or other: and let the sick sit on a square before himself, and let the little finger be in front of him, or directly behind him, in height, so that the sick person does not suffer any trouble.
Then he shall extend the arm from the lower side, or with his hand, or with a ligature. And another minister shall extend from above likewise.
Then the doctor shall make the bone even, until he reduces it to the best shape that he can.
If however there are fractures of the bones, then you should attempt to restore every fragment to its place with your own strength.
If however it seems to you that there is a separation of the flesh, and it hurts the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it: then take hold of it on top, and remove it according to the method which we have mentioned in those which precede this.
If however there is a fracture with the ulnar bone, I have already done for it to the singular cap, so take hold of its cure from there.
If however it happens in the beginning of your restoration that there is a hot swelling, then take a thin cloth made of linen with a green dye, and white ash, and put it between its thickness and thinness: and tighten the cloth on the bone slightly, until he sits down: then remove the cloth, and place a prepared plaster from powdered linseed with albumen. Then put on the stars, and let there be a star that is put on the fracture itself wider by a little bit, and stronger.
And know that the number of stars of the arm is six in various dispositions: whether it is a fracture in one shaft, or in two shafts together.
Then put on your bandage over the place of the fracture stronger and more firm, and a little more with the bandage to the upper fracture, or to the lower part of it: or put on a softer bandage a little bit according to what precedes the memory of it at the beginning of the chapter.
And let there be cloths that are wrapped around the fracture, soft, wet: and not be hard, rough. And let there be a thread that is tied with linen of its own, middle between thin and thick, as we have described.
And consider the limb and the ligaments after a few days. That if anything requires correction, which is necessary, such as a itch that happens to a limb: then it should be that the limb is immersed in hot water, until that itch quiets down, and you remove the bandage from constricting the limb, until it quiets down, and then repeat the bandage.
That if the bandage has already softened, and the bone is a little distant, and similar things: then correct it all with your power, and consider again.
For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, because of an excess of bandage, then it should be that the food is made a little less, and you leave it a few days, until it cures towards the food, and then tie it up.
But if anything of what we have said does not happen to those who are ill, then it should not be that it is healed, unless after twenty days or so.
Then hang the injured hand by its sleeve on his neck. And let the neck be kept even, and guarded from violent motions. And let him sleep on his back.
And thou shalt know that this fracture is restored in thirty days, or in thirty-two days; and perchance it shall be restored in fifty-nine days. All this depends on the condition of the wound, and on the power of the healing.
On the restoration of broken bones of the hand.
Know that it rarely happens that a fracture occurs in the palm of the hand or in the knuckles of the fingers. And it does not happen to him, unless it is through frequent friction.
When therefore a fracture occurs in the sole of the foot, or through friction: then let him sit on a equal chair: and before him let there be set a second seat equal to it. Then put his hand upon it extended.
Then the surgeon shall extend the bones that are broken, and shall make them equal by the medicine, until when they are joined together by a good joint.
Then let him put on plaster and a splint, if it does not happen that there is a hot ecma. Then let the plaster be placed from above according to the quantity of the place: and thou hast already wrapped it with linen cloth.
But if the fracture is toward the lower part of the sole of the foot, then let him make a sphere-like shape out of linen cloth: and let him instruct the sick person to place his foot upon it with the sole that is broken: then bind it with long linen cloth.
And let him sit on a wax-like cushion, that is soft, so that the wax may come into contact with the body of the sole: and bind it, according to what is necessary.
But if the fracture is toward the outside, then let him place from above one plaster, and another plaster below on the sole: and let the sick person sit with his hand open and straight. Then put on a bandage, as it is extended out from the hand: and extend between the fingers with a ligament.
That if a fracture occurs in any of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, make it equal according to what is necessary. Then tie it with a plant: and if you love her, put on her a straight, strong splint; so that she may hold the fracture together, and not move.
But if the fracture is in some of the digits, such as the middle, index, or ring, then it should be made equal and tied with the finger that follows it: or all should be tied according to their continuity: and that is better. Or put a splint on top of it like we have said for the thumb.
And consider in your restoration, and after that disposition put heat on it: and oppose with it whatever needs to be done, when something happens from it, according to what its narrative tells.
De Restoration of the Fracture of the Pelvis.
The hip bone often breaks and is felt: because it turns towards the inner and back parts.
And its restoration is done in such a way that the fractures are tied with ligaments above and below the fracture. And the injured person extends his hand over his face.
Then he extends all the ligaments according to equality of parts: and this is done when there is a fracture in the middle bone.
But if the fracture is near the root of the pelvis, then there should be a ligament to the side of the pelvic bone so that it does not extend upwards: and another ligament below the fracture.
And in the same way if there is a fracture near the knee, then there should be a ligament close to the knee so that it does not extend downward: and another below the fracture.
Then the doctor should make both hands equal in shape to reduce the hip according to its natural figure: and the bones are joined together by a good connection.
Then it is necessary that you put plaster on it and tighten it, if something has not happened to the member by apothema. But if something has happened to it by apothema: then let him go away for a few days, until the heat subsides: and then return to your cure.
Strictura autem eius ita sit. But the scar should be so placed that it lies over the fracture of the bone, that is, bindean; and twice or thrice, and let there remain none but a little surplus. Then wrap up the leg so that it reaches to the root of the heel bone;
And insert a long thread between the thigh and the leg near the knee towards the lower side, and bind the ends of the thread from the upper part of the two limbs. Then turn over the leg and thigh what surplus there is from the skin.
Then put on top of the thigh at the place of fracture the bone that was broken, and put out of it one bone on to the leg bone.
Then fill up the space between the leg and thigh with soft cloth, so as to equalize the scar.
Then begin strong from the middle at the place of fracture by three or four inches of wrapping. And as much as you lengthen with the bandage from the place of fracture, your scar will be smaller and softer, and milder.
Then bring both ends of the thread that you inserted between thigh and leg down to their ends: Bind now with each of the three bones that are on top, Then bring both ends of the thread down to the bottom, until you reach the ankle bone. And tighten and the ends of the thread also from the other side: so that the bandage does not move out of place.
Then let the scar rest in this state, so that no infection, swelling or inflammation comes about, nor anything similar to them. If something of that sort should happen. Then bring the wound to its proper place, and make straight what has gone astray, as often as we have said before.
But if a piece of bone that stings has gone into the bone: then it should be made even, if you can manage it. And if not, find out under it, and move it about: and take care to remember where it was, until it heals over again.
And when this fracture of the coxae is tighten, besides that they are added to him stars, as we said in the adjutorium and in the arm.
However in the restoration of it this fracture, does not happen an infirmity with lameness. And if it is restored alone, besides that a leg of the other is applied to him, then it is necessary, that he always laments who has it, because.
And you should know that the coxa is tighten in fifty days, or added a little, or a little is made to rest: all this is according to the difference of complexions and the rest of dispositions.
On the restoration of the fracture of the knee joint of the leg.
You should know that a fracture of the knee joint of the leg rarely happens, but it often happens to him a wear.
If, however, a fracture has happened to him, then there is only an opening or a hole in his parts. And it is with an injury, and without an injury. And stands completely on it with a sense of.
The restoration of it is so that he makes up what has been broken from his parts with the fingers, until it is gathered together, and joined according to what is possible from an équation and a facility, and by manufacture.
Then put a plaster from flour sisipal, or to be pounded, with egg white: and put over it a round astellan, if you can bear it: and tighten tightly the fitting that corresponds to it.
Then consider all the dispositions that we have told you about in the other fractures: like an opening of heat, and its likes: so that you oppose to every accident with him that corresponds to it, until he is healed.
On the restoration of a fracture of the leg.
You should know that there are two bones, of which one is thick and is called the femur, and another fine, and is called the fibula.
And it happened in both species of fracture that happened to the two bones of the arm: and for this reason his restoration is made as the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is one.
That if both bones break at once, the body becomes deformed in all parts.
And if one of the smaller bones breaks, the body becomes deformed towards the front.
And if one of the larger bones breaks, it injures the lower part: and it is from those which do not obscure you.
Then administer the extension, and the equalization, and the tying of the bones according to that which is equal.
However, if the fracture of the body is a bad fracture, it has many problems: so that the extension is less, and the relief is milder for you.
And in the body itself there is an operation on the arm: and it is, as when you make the bones equal, and take up all your operation, then take two strips of pine wood, which are used in making hinges that are placed under tables: and they are made from the palm leaves: and choose from them those that have a small thickness, and there are not any of the small ones: and make their length according to the length of the body from the knee down.
Then wrap it over one piece of cloth with two wraps according to its length. And place one side of the body from the one part, and the other side from the other part: and they are from the knee down to the foot.
Then tie the two strips in three places from the two ends and the middle. Since, however, the tightening is forbidden, the body leans to the right and to the left, and remains in good position.
And now the joint is already administered from wood according to the length of the body, and it is placed in it so that it conserves itself from movement.
And many things must be done, so that you make it in the fracture when it is a proper wound of its own kind.
Then consider the wound on every day, and study with it that last effort from apoplexy, or inflammation, or other remains. If therefore anything of these happens, then oppose it to him with what is necessary, until he is healed, if God will.
Of the fracture of the bones of the foot and fingers.
The heel, however, does not occur a fracture within.
Of the bones of the foot does indeed happen when there is a fracture, and of the fingers little also happens when there is a fracture: but they do not happen to them unless there is wear and tear in many ways.
That if there is a fracture of the bones of the foot, and these bones are seen to separate from each other, then let the sick man put his foot on the ground prepared, as one who walks.
Then stand you, and put your foot on that which rises from those bones: then press, or trample on it: and make it even, until it comes back to its place.
Then put a plaster over it, and a cloth from above: and put under the foot a flat board which has two flat heads.
Then tighten it with the foot when you are walking, after you have wound it with rags, and with anything else with which it needs to be bound up.
But when three or four days have passed by, then loosen the ligaments. For you will find the bones even if they are fractured or displaced. The operation then is as you see it.
But if any of the fingers are broken, then restore them, and make even the others according to what you have told me about restoring the fingers of the hand. Then put your finger on a splint according to the length of the finger, and make it a little broader: then place under the foot this board which you have told me about, and tighten it with a firm fastening while you are walking.
But if indeed what is broken are two or three or more bones, then place over each finger a splint of its own size, wound up in a cloth: and tighten the board under the foot: and stand, holding the board with one head under the foot, so that it remains by a good hold.
And it is fitting that you not forget, but that you consider all that I have said to you in regard to the remaining fractures from accidents which we have spoken of: and oppose every accident with what is required.
Regarding the fracture of the woman's shoulder, and of the pelvis, and of the male's thigh-bone.
When the woman's shoulder is fractured, then let her sit in a square position. Then incline her towards the back of herself, and let her be held from behind.
Then the midwife shall fill the woman'e hollow with her hand, until she is filled: and let her be made roundly with the hand from that side.
Then the woman shall be shaken, and her back shall be raised gradually. That hand which has been placed within her, let it come out before the woman' door as a sphere, and the broken bone shall return.
Then place a pillow upon her back. When she wishes to urinate, then let the hand come out easily, and then let her urinate: and reduce it according to the manner in which you first placed it: and then let it return to its pillow.
Let it be done for seven days, or about that, for the bone itself is restored.
And if you wish, take a piece of wax and twist it upon a hole of the woman' peg, and insert the whole wax into her: Then blow with force into the hole, until the wax is bent within the woman' peg, for the fracture returns.
Then let it be filled with her hand, and stand a few days, according to what we have said, until it is healed.
And when the man' peg-bone is fractured, or that of a woman, then administer to its restoration, and to its equalling that which we have described in regard to the bones of the neck.
And let not the right eye be hidden in those close fractures which occur little, especially where there is some study, or use.
And understand my book well, for itself signifies to you in many dispositions a straight way in the restoration of your own, and a constriction of its own: therefore understand.
And in the staff of man when it is broken, take the throat of the goose: and introduce the staff into it. Then put over him the bandage, and let him be wrapped up, and let him be for three days, or about them, and he will be healed, if God wills.
Of the restoration of broken bones, when it is with an injury.
It belongs to him who has suffered a fracture with an injury, especially if it is great, such as the hip bone, or auxiliary, or similar to it, as you see fit, and let him stand immediately: if you attest the conditions of phlebotomy, as we have said before.
That if the bone spills blood, then you should, as you see fit, cut off it, so that it powderizes on top of it: if there is not present another to you.
Then begin to restore the fracture in him on the same day: and do not put off it, if there is no apostema.
But if a poultice becomes hot, then dismiss the restoration of him until the ninth day, until it subsides. And do not approach him on the third and fourth days at all, for you would make bad accidents happen to him.
But if a bone is broken and stands out above the skin that has been detected: then you should, so that you seek to reduce it, and make it equal with your hands with ease and small extension.
But if it is not prepared for the extension of it, and its equality with your hands: then reduce it with a wisp of hay. And this is an instrument that is made of iron, whose length is the quantity of seven fingers, or eight; and its width is according to the quantity of the wound. And for this necessity is there a doctor, so that he may take from them three, or four according to the quantity, which he needs for healing of any kind of fracture.
And it shall be round; and there shall be a little grossness therein, that it may not double itself under pressure upon itself at the hour of the operation: and its acute extremity, which shall have an edge on its extremities. And let it be above that grossness from half of it to the lower ones.
And this is its form.
It is necessary that, in this operation, the acute extremity be placed with care upon the prominent extremity of the bone: and push it forward with a single movement, until when the bone returns and reaches some degree of equilibrium.
Therefore consider to make the extremities of the fracture face one another in a straight line.
If the extremities of its fracture are slight, and does not take it well by means of an instrument, then you must, that you push on the extremity of its bone, until when the instrument can have power over it.
If you cannot reduce them at all by means that we have described, then push it on with care from the incisions which we have said: or cut it with one of the saws in any way that is possible for you.
Then saw off what remains in the bone from sharpness and small grooves.
When, therefore, the bone has been reduced and finds after its reduction a painful swelling that hurts it, you should know that the bone has not returned to its own place.
Make it then. For you have a great power of injury when you complete the restoration that you are making to the bones.
Then submerge the cloth in a black stipping wine. And especially if it is in summer. And do not place over the bone any poultice, nor anything wherein there is oil: that it may not happen to him a putrefaction and corruption.
Then administer herbs in the hour of your supplement to the restoration of the bones. And let go of the bone that is caught: so that you push it with tweezers in the second wound according to the quantity of the wound.
And for every precaution, do not tighten the bone with a fracture. For many often made this stupidity of doctors; and did happen to their patients or death, or corruption, or putrefaction, that is, health. And be your ligature soft, mild, various of the ligatures of other broken bones.
That if the bone is bad, or is a great bone, and you wait on the top of it some bad incident which we have spoken of, and suspend pain in the place: then it is not fit that you should put stars on the top of it. And make for them poultices from tough革in the place of the stars, and tighten the bone with them.
When then is it one day old, or two days, and you see the bone already begin to putrefy, that it generates pus: then remove from off the bone the poultice which you put on it with wine. Then administer poultices, and unguents wherewith we are accustomed of our custom to heal the injuries: such as the unguent of four medicines, and other like it.
And comes to you, that you should loosen the ligature. And observe the bone every day, both morning and evening, until it is consolidated, and healed.
And let the limb be prepared so that pus may run from it to the lower parts with ease.
That if the days pass over many wounds and are not consolidated, nor does the pus run away from it: then you shall know that there are little bones in it. Why it is fit that you should inquire about the bone which you touch. How many of those bones are separated, take them away, and draw them out. And which of those bones are not separated, and pinch the limb, and make it hurt, try to put it, and remove it in any way that you can do it to thee.
That if it happens to the wound to swell up or break out, that is, to suppurate, or some other species of corruption and putrefaction: then you shall oppose each one of them with that which comes to it after the healing: whose prece essit narrazione in his suo.
And from this in which it is necessary that my speech should stand, and which you are to apply to your present mind when the bone is broken, and it comes out over the limb, like the hip-bone, and assistants, and similar things from large limbs, i.e., so as not to suspect its attraction, for often death has happened from it, besides leaving it, until it putrefies.
For perhaps it will fall of itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then therefore take care of the wound if it remains with you; and if not, leave it.
Regarding the treatment of a fracture in the jaw.
This surgery has often been applied to the healing of a fracture. Especially that which is near joints: and it should be fed from that figure of the limb. And perhaps it forbids the limb from its natural action.
Consider therefore then, if the surgery is recent: administer to it medicines which have a drying effect, such as aloe, and olive oil, and myrrh, and wood-black, and acacia, and similar things.
Thus, that you may take from these certain ones, or all of them: and bind them together with astringent wine, or with egg-white, or with vinegar: and place them over the surgery in a poultice, and bind them tightly over the good constriction.
And leave the constriction alone, and do not remove it for many days. Then remove it, and again apply another one, until the surgery has healed.
Or bind it over with a lead strip of uneven thickness. Lead is a property which takes away from the limb whatever it fears.
But if the fracture has already joined with the bone, and is firm, and the need to remove it is urgent: then find on its upper part, and cut off the excessive with a sharp instrument: or saw it off with some rasps, until it comes out: and take care of it, until it has healed.
When cure is made after a disease has left a member remaining which does not suit its natural place.
When a fracture of the bones is healed and yet the member remains short, it is done for many reasons. One reason is the multitude of ligamentious solutions and the non-conformity of its ligation; or because of the superabundance of stricture of the ligaments, until alimentation is prevented from running into the member: or because of the multitude of emulsion which is superfluous at a wrong time; or because of the scarcity of blood in the body, and the weakness of it.
And its cure is, to feed the sick and to make the member strong, until the blood multiplies in it. And to give it a bath. And introduce joy and cheerfulness into him.
Then put a poultice on the member, that it may attract to itself much alimentation. And give him frequent emulsion with warm water, until the alimentation runs, and return him to his natural form.
On the healing of broken bones when they are healed out of their due place.
When it happens that a member is restored after its healing, and yet there is a deformity of the bone or a movement; and food is given through the opening, though the member itself does not prevent from performing its natural function: then it is not necessary to take issue with what it exists, that one should break the member again.
And there have been many stolid doctors and restorers who made this in our country.
This operation is most dangerous, leading to death, or great fear, as it appears to be mortal.
But if the claudication and movement are recent: then it is necessary that they be given emulsion with warm water, in which are boiled soft leaves, such as of aloe, and its root, and mealy-mouthed onion, and similar things. And let him make for himself a plaster with a soft plaster, like that of the decussate darts.
Or let him take a mucilage of aloe roots and mix it with chicken fat or sesame oil, and let him plaster himself with it.
Or let them take young fig branches and wrap them in columbine clay, and similar things that are called as medicines that soften the konsolidation.
And when the neck has been freed with persistent massaging, the old, soft one, which is done with wet hands. And let the member move in all directions during all hours.
But if the tortuosity has already preceded and become strong, and is embedded in a stone, and provokes the need for its treatment with an iron: then it should be, that the upper part of it be cut off, and the continuation of the bone be healed, and what surplus is from the tortuosity or the bone with subtle incisors be removed: and ease should be given to him with care and diligence.
On the treatment of dislocation.
Dislocation is the exit of some joints from their place. Why it is restrained from its own motion, and is supported in its figure. And does occur to the pains of the weak, and the painful wounds.
So when a dislocation occurs, then it is necessary to hurry to its restoration: and it should not be delayed at all.
For if it is delayed, the place will be postponed, and there may be a reduction of the dislocation with it.
Therefore it should not be moved, nor should it be extended in the hour of its postponement. Because it often causes a spasm, and painful wounds.
But when this happens, then you should, in order to prepare for the phlebotomy of the sick. Then it is dismissed, until it rests after the postponement.
Then the member is anointed with hot water and oil. Then reduce it with ease.
And heal every limb with that which reminds it of its place.
I have already arranged the chapters on dislocations and also, with regard to what preceded, from the upper part of the body to the lower.
§ On the Treatment of a Dislocated Mandible (lower jaw).
The two jaws are rarely dislocated unless by some rare chance...
and the dislocation of the upper jaw takes place in only one of two ways. Or, indeed, do they move away from their places by a slight distance and become slightly looser. Or, they are dislocated completely and fully until they become looser towards the breast, until the saliva of the wound flows, and he cannot hold it, nor can he close his mouth, and the tongue of him wiggles with a lisp.
When, however, the dislocation is slight, then it returns to its place by itself with little difficulty.
If, however, the dislocation is complete and full: then it should be administered a reduction quickly, and there should be no delay; and it is as if one holds the jaw at its root with a finger: and the doctor should insert his hand with the thumb of one of his hands between the mouth of the dislocated jaw on the side of the dislocation. Or, if the dislocation is from both sides, then insert two fingers at once. And let the remaining fingers of his hand be outside, with which he will even out.
And order the sick person to clean his jaws and to be able to chew on all sides. And let the doctor adjust the jaw and push it back to its place.
If it is difficult to reduce it, especially if both jaws are dislocated together: then administer a steam bath with warm water and oil until the reduction of the upper jaw becomes easy: and do not delay the reduction of the upper jaw at all, as we have said.
When therefore they are brought together and the bone is closed and do not swell: then put on them pieces of cloth, with a wax that has been made from wax: and rose oil.
Then bind it together with ease using soft ligaments.
And let the sleep be upon his back: and his head be between two pieces of cloth so that it does not move to the right or to the left: nor does it twitch, or want to chew anything: but his food is given to him softly, until when the pain has gone away, and his jaw has been set in motion: then he eats what he wants, and gives it to him with ease.
He does not sweat over the operation of his mouth when he is eating and drinking, and when he is swallowing, until his jaw has been set in motion and has healed.
If the reduction of the two jaws is difficult when they dislocate at some time, and do not return to their places: then many times fever comes from there, and frequent farts: and perhaps the stomach becomes unhealthy, and perhaps pure cholesterol is expelled.
So when you see this: then know that it is a loss, and many times that person dies who has had this for ten days.
On the reduction of the dislocation of the Fork and the extremity of the arm.
The fork does not dislocate from the inside due to the continuity with the spine. And it dislocates sometimes towards the outside: and announces itself to the sense.
And its restoration is, that he lies sick on his back, and extends his arms. Then bind with a strong hand the place where you bound, for it will return by itself.
Then put on it waddings and cloths, and tighten it.
The extremities of him who lies on his side, and continue with him, do not dislocate unless they are rarely displaced. If it dislocates on one day: then let it be reduced and equated according to what we have said, and let it be prepared for you.
Then place over it a plaster, and pus, and a strapping. And instruct the sick person to adhere to tranquility and quietness until healing takes place.
And with this same cure, when the limb of the humerus is reduced and separated from its place.
[¶ On the Reduction of a Dislocation of the Humerus.]
You should know that the humerus is not dislocated except by three means.
One of which is so that it is dislocated toward the soft part toward the lower side. The second is so that it is dislocated toward the side of the chest. And perhaps it is dislocated upward on the humerus, and this happens rarely.
Nor is it dislocated at the back because of the spatula. Nor is it dislocated in front because of the nerves.
Indeed, most often it is dislocated and moved downward toward the soft part; especially in those who have little flesh. Because it moves quickly in them, and enters quickly.
But in those who have a lot of flesh, on the contrary, it moves and enters slowly.
And perhaps it happens to some people that there is a rupture or fall, and the humerus is dislocated by heat; and it is supposed that this happens because it has already been dislocated.
Therefore, you should know this thing, until you are sure of its truth; and then proceed to the cure.
And recognize the dislocation when it is toward the lower side toward the soft part; and distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy one. For there is a marked difference between them; and when the neck of the humerus is bent, and under the soft part near the touch of the head of the humerus it seems to be almost the same as itself: and the sick person cannot reduce his hand to its place, nor move it in all its movements.
And likewise, if it is dislocated opposite the breast, or upward: then the injury is manifest to the touch, and is not hidden.
And of this dislocation, the reduction is easily done when it is recent, or when the person is a boy.
And its reduction is as if he raises his hand towards the upper part. Then put your fingers under its nipple, and raise the suture with force towards the top to its place; and the minister will lift his hand, and extend it upward. Then let him put it down, for he himself will quickly turn over.
If he does not turn over by that which we have said, and there are several days since the dislocation happened: then it is necessary that the sick person bathes himself in warm water, and an ointment which softens and soothes, as if it were cooked aleae roots, and foenugraecum, and melilotum in aqua, and is administered.
Then the sick person should lie down on his back; and a sphere and wool, which is equal to the length of the suture, should be placed under its nipple, which lengthens and relaxes it.
Then the doctor should place his heel over the sphere, and with force should lift the head of the humerus, and draw the nurse's hand towards the lower part.
And if you want to reduce it according to this way: and that is as you make a man who is longer ill stand by the side, and let him put his shoulder under the nipple of the nurse: and lift the nipple towards the top, until the sick person hangs in the air. Then another minister should hold the nurse's hand at the lower part of his thigh. If the sick person is lighter: then it is necessary that he is suspended with something else, so that it supports him: for the dislocation turns over immediately.
It is also reduced according to another method: and that is, as it is laid out on the ground a long piece of wood whose head is round figure: like the hand of the mortar: which is neither thick nor fine. Then place under the patient after they are placed on top of the head of wood a thin cloth: and the sick stand according to the length of the wood.
Then extend his hand on the lower part of the other part, and extend his body with force from one side: for the joint returns to its place with speed.
That if his reduction is difficult through all that we have said, then use this care: and that is, take a piece of wood whose length is the quantity of two arms, and its width is the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness is the quantity of two fingers: whose head is round, so as to alleviate his entrance into the deep ticklish, according to this form.
Then bind over the head a thin cloth to the wood does not hurt the sick.
Then place under the ticklish patient to extend hand, or arm on the wood until the lower part: and bind the wood to assistant and arm and extremity of the hand.
Then place arm over steps by width, and extend hand to the lower part, and let go of the remaining body suspended from one side. For the joint enters immediately.
When the entrance is then completed according to any possible way: then you should put under the ticklish ball of equal quantity of wool. Then place a prepared plaster from ground flour with frankincense, and albite over the whole shoulder, as it turns upside down.
Then tighten under the ticklish with a tightening descending: and turn back on the joint over the plaster upside down: and attach his hand to his neck, and let go, and do not move his hand for seven days.
And it is necessary that the sick patient is placed food poor in nutrition until he is comforted the limb: for it is faster to his recovery.
Then let it be kept for a longer time, after seven days or five, and let it be examined with movement. But if it hardens and does not soften, then he is completely healed.
But if the joint dislocates frequently, because of the moisture that occurs with it, or because of some other cause: then he should administer to it a caustic with three perforations, as was stated in the chapter on caustics.
That if this is done completely, and the ligament is made to heal after seven days, and the dislocation does not return, and the sprain and stricture over it are occasionally loosened, and does not harden, and falls, and cannot raise itself up towards the upper arm: then know that the nerves which are in the shoulder joint have already been cut, or stretched out, or softened. And know that the dislocation will never return to its place.
But the dislocation that occurs towards the breast and the nipple, or the rear reduction, occurs with an impact and extension with the hands: until it comes back, and a remaining sprain and care is administered to it, until it heals.
That if anything happens after healing with weight on the limb, and a delay in its movement: then let the sick person frequently use the bath until that weight is softened, and return it to its natural state first.
**On the Treatment of Dislocation of the Elbow.**
Know that the elbow joint dislocates with difficulty, and also returns with difficulty, and that it itself dislocates to all parts, especially to the front or back.
And its dislocation does not hide itself from you: for it falls with a sound, and with a touch, according to whichever way it dislocates. And when you join a dislocated bed with a healthy one, it becomes clear to you. The dislocation is tight, and the arm cannot be bent, nor can it be touched with its shoulder.
It is fitting that you should set about reducing the dislocation immediately, before warm aposteme occurs.
For if it happens that warm aposteme occurs, it is difficult to reduce it; and one would certainly not heal at all, especially when it is in the rear. For it is worse for all kinds of dislocation, and more painful to them; and often death goes down with it.
And the restoration of it when it is out of them which can be reduced, is as if he extend his hands with both hands: and his arm sit extended, and his medical hands are above the bed and under it, and he pushes the splint with his thumbs of his hands simultaneously, or with the root of his palm, until he returns to his place.
Or else the dislocation is to the front: then he returns as if he double his hand with his hand, until he hits the bed which is dislocated at the root of his palm.
Which if it does not comply with the dislocation to reduce, then administer a painful stretch, strong and hot; and it is as if two ministers extend the arm: and they hold him too, so that he does not move during the stretch.
Then the arm turns back to all parts after it is turned over a long fold of cloth on his hand, or a wide ligament.
And when the doctor touches with his medical hand the joint, he lubries it with oil; so that it is out of them which help in lubricant of the joint with ease. Then he pushes the joint with a painful push, until he returns.
And after reducing it, it is fitting that a plaster be placed on it, in which sits the stain, and drying with white of egg; and be tightened by a tightening going down. And hang the arm from the neck of the nurse: and let go after a few days.
Then unpick it. Which if he is fixed in its joint in its place, then unpick the ligaments from her, and let go herself.
And if you see that the wound is not well sutured, then apply a second plaster, and a ligature, and leave it for a few days until it heals. Then remove it.
If, however, he becomes heavier after the reduction of the suture, and movement is felt: then administer humidification in a bath, and gentle friction, and compression, until the bandage, or put on an ileum, that is, put on the weight of a sheep's fat. Then bind it with a ligature, and leave it for a day and night. Then remove it, and introduce him into the bath. When he sweats then, apply friction on the suture with a moderate force. Then apply one more layer of fat, and then a second, and a third, when entering the bath, until it softens.
And if there is a wound: put on top of it manure made from sheep dung, moist, heated with butter, and bind over the wound.
Make it a few times. The wound will heal, and return to its normal state.
This is the chapter on treatment of dislocations by Albucasis.
The hand often dislocates, that is, the wound between the arm and the hand.
And the reduction of this dislocation is easy. On the contrary, the dislocations in the other joints are more difficult. However, it is necessary that the speed be in the reduction of this dislocation at the time when it happens, before the joint is measured: or happen there an accident of heat.
And the reduction of this dislocation is such, that you put the weak hand of Mahassem on a table, and extend its thumb, and let the doctor place his palm on the eminence of the wound, and push it back, until it comes back into place.
However, it is necessary to consider that the palm has gone back to the thumb of the hand: then put the sick thumb of the hand on a table when extending and reducing it: and if the dislocation is proceeding towards the thumb of the hand, then the position of the hand should be placed inside the table, that is, the inner part of the hand placed on the table, so that the doctor's thumb falls on the eminence of the wound.
If then he returns at once, it is good: and if not, then tie him up with a plaster while the apostema subsides: and let him go, and do not return to that.
For if he does not bear it, and you are unable to relieve his pain, after a few days, however, the wound remains closed according to its own shape: and it does no harm to the sick man, unless his hand becomes soft, and he is unable to grip anything: then you should know that the nerves have been torn away, or worn down.
There is therefore no skill in it, unless it is tied up with a plaster near to his danger. And perhaps it does not bring anything.
So then if Almahassem does not return, then place a plaster on him, which we have described. Then tie him up, and let him go for five days: then unfasten it and let him go, and exercise his hands.
But if his movement is restricted, and something heavy happens to it: then make it soft with hot water and occasional rubbing, until it softens.
The treatment of dislocation of fingers.
When a finger is dislocated completely from its socket, or from the back of the palm, or by the wind up, then extend the finger and push against the dislocation with your thumb, until it returns.
Then support the end of the finger, and suspend it towards the side to which it is dislocated, and let him go for two days.
Then suspend him, and extend him, until he becomes straight again in his own day.
So then when it is night, bind him up according to his story: and do not cease to wash him in the day: and exercise him with movement: and bind him up at night.
Let him have some days, until he is tied up.
And also do the same with him if he is dislocated at the wrist of the hand: and tie him to the side, and do your work with him, until he heals.
And do likewise with it when it is dislocated to the other parts.
When curing a dislocated spine.
When it happens to anyone that there is a dislocation of the spine or of the neck, and many joints are removed from their places: then there is no cure for this, because death approaches the sick.
And a sign of this is that his waste-matter leaves him without volition, and he cannot hold it: and often from it some limb of his, or two of his legs, or two of his arms, or one of them, is made feeble; or one of the joints of his body is removed from its place.
For this reason, it often happens that it is removed from its place, because it often happens that it is removed on all four sides.
That which is removed to the back is called a hunchback.
But the cure for this is, that you should consider then, if a hunchback happens to occur from youth: then there is no cure for it, and no health at all comes from it.
But in that which has occurred from accident or strike or similar things, the ancient method of cure with a long speech I have already said. Whom most does not return with profit.
I have, however, shortened it from that, for whose little excuse is far from his nearness to my intention: and I presented it by way of explanation, and formed an instrument out of it in various ways from him by which they showed it, and presented it itself.
I say, that in the hunchback which has occurred from the front part, there is no skill, nor health comes from it.
And likewise in that which happens on both sides to the back.
And they are not cured of these, unless that which happens in the back with its own story is told by me: and it is that he should lie on his face on an equal platform next to the wall: and spread out under him a damp cloth so as not to hurt his chest.
Then let a straight and solid piece of wood be placed in the foal in the ground, at the end of his foot, about his head: and let another piece of wood be placed about his feet on the other side of his foot: and let the assistant hold the wood, so that it does not stand firm in the foal. And let the assistant hold the other one.
Then let the nurse bend over his head and with soft lint fasten it firmly: and extend the end of the ligament to the wood that is at his head: and bind him there.
Then let another ligament be tightened above his thighs, and above his knees, and at his ankles. Then let all the ligaments be gathered together, and bind them to the other wood that is at his feet.
Then let the assistant extend to the two pieces of wood, and do not remove them from their places, as we have said: but they must not be firm, as we have said.
Then the doctor shall place his palms on the board with strength, until he has stopped: or let him place it on a board. Then let him attach his feet to the board, until he has stopped.
But if he does not stop by this cure, then take a board whose length is about three arms. And make a hole in the wall where we have said, which is near the sick man: let the end of the board come into that hole. Then place the middle of the board on the wood. Then let the doctor place his feet at the end of the other side. And tie it well, until the board is tight: and let him return to his own place.
Then if you wish, operate with a tourniquet that is wound up with your hand: and it is like this, to fix on the ground at the end of the sick man's foot two pieces of wood whose length is about one arm: and at his head in the end of his other foot two pieces of wood.
Then let the length that is between all the wood be one palm: and it has been made in every place a hole, in which the tourniquet runs: and let all the wood be firm on the ground, so that it does not move at all.
And a round piece of wood is inserted; and it is a turning in which the ligament turns in two holes of two pieces of wood.
And at the end thereof is a hole, in which the wood is fixed, whose length is a palm with it that turns; and in two other pieces of wood there is also like it.
Then tighten the ligature which you have tied inside the chest on the turning that is at the head of it; and the ligatures which you have tied on the legs of him on the turning that is at his feet.
Then stand by every turning where the surgeon turns his hand with a lever, with which he turns the turning: and the doctor equit Spondylem, according to what we have said.
This is the form of the turning, which follows.
Then, when you have returned the Spondylus and equated the place, then you should put on an dried plaster with albumen. Then the stasis. Then put upon the plaster a panel from a board, whose breadth is three fingers wide, or about them. And its length is such a quantity as it takes up the space of the Gibbosity, and on the healthy side of the Spondylus.
Then let it be tied with the ligature which we have said. And let the sick one be fed with thin food, until he is healed.
That if anything remains of a eminence in the place at the end of the Sanation: then you should, when you administer the medicine which softened, and relax it, with the administration of the board which we have said at a long time. And now is administered in that leaden plate.
And when it happens that a eminence has come to the last Spondylus of the back: and it is supposed by this dislocation, and it is that opening which it already emits. Why it should not be put in him with this medicine: for if perhaps will happen to make death with it:
Of the Cure of a Dislocated Ankle.
You should know that the shoulder joints and the elbow joints do not occur unless there is a dislocation; and they do not occur among the other joints because of a small distance and closeness.
And the shoulder joint dislocates according to four parts. Since it dislocates forward and backward.
And it dislocates a lot to the inside; and a little to the front and back.
And the treatment of this dislocation to the inside is: because when you tie a healthy leg with an invalid, it is longer; and his knee bone protrudes more than the healthy one, and the invalid cannot double his foot there, and there is a place that follows the hip joint, which is hot, so that the head of the thigh has reached there.
And the sign of him to whom this dislocation occurs on the outside is that his symptoms are opposite to these symptoms.
And the sign of him to whom this dislocation occurs on the front is that he expands a healthy leg according to the complement: nevertheless, he does not double himself without pain in his knee; and if he tries to walk, he cannot step forward: and he holds his urine back, and his hip joint goes outside, and when he walks, he steps on his heel.
And the sign of him to whom this dislocation occurs on the back is that he does not expand his knee, and cannot double himself without bending his hip; and his leg is also shorter than the other one: and his hip joint is softened, and the head of the thigh has reached its place.
The reduction of this dislocation is as follows: consider then, if the dislocation has healed, that it has been reduced with the one who has it. Then if you administer a reduction of it and remains according to its position: then it is not at all in this treatment. Therefore it should not be assumed that it has been completely healed.
In that, however, whose dislocation is recent, and it is of one of the four species of dislocation: then approach to this, as you wish to tie, and extend it to the interiors and exteriors, and move it with the right and left hand: perhaps it will return, and does not need any other care.
But if this does not return in this way, then you should prepare a strong tool, and extend his leg from the lower part: or with his hands, or with a ligament that is tied over his leg above the knee: and another minister extends his hand from above, so that he puts his hands under his toes. Then it should be tied with a soft ligament over the root of the pelvis, and the end of the other ligament should be held.
And it should be extended from the front part of the groin to the hip, or from the back to the spine.
And all these movements should be made at once, so that the sick person rises with his body from the ground and remains hanging.
This is indeed a common type of movement among the four types of dislocation.
If this returns with that which I have mentioned, it is good: and if not, then each of these things that I say about the self-care of the disease is necessary.
In reducing, however, when the dislocation is towards the interiors, it should be that the sick person lies on his healthy side. Then put a ligament over the root of the pelvis, in the place that is between the head of the hip and the place that is under the groin. Then extend the ligament towards the top from the part of the groin to the higher part of the body, to the hip.
Then another strong minister takes his arms, and narrows the large place of the sick hip, and extends it towards the exteriors with a sharp extension. Now he has returned to his place.
And this type is easier than the other types of cure, when this member is reduced in this way.
If, however, an excuse is found against you, and he does not obey you at all in this kind of cure: then it should be so that two feet are bound together with a strong ligature, soft and above the two heels and above the two knees: and let the length of each from its compeer be the quantity of four fingers: and let the leg be extended which is injured by the other quantity of two fingers.
Then the sick one should be hung on the head of the tree, which is in the house: and let the length of him from the earth be the quantity of two arms.
Then order a strong youth to support the hip: and let another be hung with the sick one: and let another push him strongly, for the ligature returns to its place with speed.
In return, however, if there is a dislocation to the outside, it should be so that he lies on his back, according to what we said before when he has a gibbosity. And a ligature should be tied above his leg, the sick one himself, and above his chest.
Then two logs should be placed, one at his feet, and another at his head. Then a log should be placed in the middle of the foot, firmly fixed: and let there be placed there wet cloths so that they do not hurt the sick one: and let the log be between his hips so that it does not pull towards the bottom with the extension.
Then all the servants should extend themselves on their side, and the doctor should make the reduction with his hand.
If then he obeys to the return, it will be good.
And if not, place him on that table, and press him, as we said before in the case of gibbosity, equally. However, it should be so that the sick one lies on his healthy side.
And when the dislocation is to the front, then it should be so that the leg of the sick one is extended quickly: and this also we told about on his back: and let the doctor place his right hand palm on the thigh of the sick one. Then put on a splint with your free hand, and with that very splint place the splint extended to the lower side of the knee.
And if the dislocation is to the back: then it is not appropriate that the sick person be extended to the lower side and be raised up on the ground, but it is appropriate that he be placed on a hard thing, as we also said when we spoke of his lying on two broad things: and it is on his face, and the extensive ligaments: according to what we have just said.
And it is appropriate that compression be administered with a board also to the place from which the joint has come out, when reduction has been completed in accordance with what needs to be done.
And the sign of his return should not be hidden from you: and is it that you extend the two legs of the nurses: and when you see them equal, and the sick one tightens his leg, and expands himself without excuse: then you shall know that the limb has returned, in accordance with what needs to be done: then you unite the two hips, and put a splint, and tighten it with an imamatum, that is to say, a rotator: so that it does not move the width to any part of: and the sick one should stick to quiet for three days, or four.
Then loosen the ligaments, and the splint, and compare the legs together: then if you see them equal in state, then know that the dislocation has already been fixed: so let the sick one go about walking.
And if you see any softening: then return, and put a splint on it, and tighten it according to your first tightening: and let go of it also for three days.
Then loosen it and let the person walk a little on each side for several days, until he is comfortably healed.
De dislocationis genuis:
The knee may be dislocated in three ways. It may be dislocated to the outside, to the inside, and to the bottom, that is to say, to the back.
And it does not dislocate to the front.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you instruct the sick person to apply his leg to his hip. But if it does not adhere to the hip: then you should know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration of all modes of dislocation is so that you make the sick person sit upright, so that he can stretch his leg over it if he can, and fasten his back to his face: and place his foot between your feet.
Then adhere the knee of him with your palms, and make them straight between your fingers above his knee. Then apply with your palm the two sides of his knee with strength. And another minister should stretch out his foot, until he brings back the knee to its place.
And the sign of reduction is that the leg adheres to the hip with ease, not with effort.
Then you should set him, and make the leg adhere to the hip. Then bind them together with a bandage of twisted strips for three or four days. Then remove them.
And do not let the sick person walk for a few days, until he is healed.
But if you do not reduce his dislocation, then administer a strong extension with the ligaments, of which the following account was given in the cure of ankylosis, until he is healed.
The Cure of Dislocation of the Heel Bone
The heel bone is sometimes moved by a slight movement, and sometimes dislocated from the second order of complementariness. And its dislocation takes place either towards the inside or towards the outside.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel bone swollen, proceeding to the side to which it is dislocated.
But the cure of its movement is easy to reduce; and that is, that it is stretched with ease by the hands, and made straight, until it is healed.
When he is to be treated, then if it is a dislocation according to the complement, it is necessary that you make the sick sit upright: and let him hold himself by a strong minister tightly from the posterior part of his back, in the middle of him.
Then you take with your right hand the foot of him from the upper part, and with your left hand at the lower part of the foot place the nail.
Then you draw the foot toward yourself with the right hand. Then with two fingers of your left hand.
Then extend with your left, and push the chest of the foot with the right toward the thigh without labor.
Do this twice, as we have said.
Then push the chest of the foot toward the thigh in a third force, and you draw the nail.
If then he returns in a force one or two according to this mode, and you see the foot even, it is good: and if not, then repeat the operation over him: for he will return.
But if it is forbidden to you to reduce him with that which we have said: then let the sick one lie on his back on the ground, and fasten a piece of cloth firmly into the ground, so that it falls between his knees: and you may now lay upon him the cloth, so that he be not hurt.
Then let the minister take the thigh of the sick one: then extends the other foot, with hands or with a band that binds on the top of the foot. Then let all the ministers extend against the extension of their own, and let the nurse stand between the two knees holding him back so that his body does not attract toward the lower part by the extension.
Then the doctor makes even the dislocation with his hands, and the other minister holds the sound thigh from below. For the dislocation returns with speed.
When therefore the dislocation returns, and you declare to him that the return of it is good: then let you put a cloth and a pad, and fasten it with strong bands, and bind the foot to the thigh with a band firmly tying.
It is appropriate that you do not fear or hesitate concerning the nerves which are behind the heel bone in the back, lest they be injured and cause pain.
Then release him for two days, or three. If the ligament is softened, tighten it; but if it is tight, loosen it. But prevent the sick one from walking for forty days, or even five. If, however, he attempts to walk before that space has healed, there will be no security without first dissolving the dislocation, allowing it to heal properly, and avoiding any further injury.
If, however, he has a fever: then you should administer to him in sedative the remedy we mentioned elsewhere in the context of treatment, and rub it on until it is gone.
Regarding dislocation of the toes and their treatment.
It is appropriate that you allow it to heal with a little stretching without work: and this is not difficult, indeed, it is easy.
If, however, the dislocation is in some of the nerves at the back of the foot: then you should make the sick person's foot stand on an equal piece of ground or on a table, and it will be like walking.
Then stand still, and place your foot on that which protrudes from the joints. Then, with your foot, press down on it firmly until it bends back into place, and you will no longer see any prominence in that spot, and the joint will seem even.
Then place under his foot a board which supports the whole foot, having two ends. Then tighten him up with three days' restriction of movement. Then release him, and let him rest from walking for many days, until he is well-tightened and secure after the reduction.
Regarding the appearances of dislocation with a broken bone.
When something like this happens to him, and he desires a cure and restoration, many times death succeeds: and therefore it is not appropriate, that you should be too hasty in his treatment, which is of this kind, unless you are prudent in the art of long-term use, merciful, compassionate, slow, not daring, and not presumptuous: and that you use only those medicines which settle the heat of fever: and leave to God's discretion the sick person. If you are not hopeful of recovery from destruction with gentleness of sickness, and if it appears that there is some hope, Then prepare to reduce its amount immediately at the beginning of the disease before it happens that a feverish blister occurs.
But if the limb returns [to health] according to our wish, then administer a regimen that quiets the blister: and care for the wound with it when it suits him from the dried ointment.
That if a dislocation is with fracture, and it happens in the bone of separated fractures, then try to remove them, and do in that what we said in simple illnesses from [the fact] that it preceded in those places.
And be careful according to your ability, and guard yourself from the entrance into a state of fear: according to my prediction for you.
For that is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting to your glory, and healthier to your body with them in your time.
