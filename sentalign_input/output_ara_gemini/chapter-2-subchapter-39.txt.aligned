Chapter thirty-nine on removing the leech stuck in the throat	CHAPTER THIRTY-NINE. On the removal of a leech sticking in the throat.	0.8082485
If you treat the leech with what we mentioned in the division of treatment with medicines and it does not succeed, then look at that time in the throat of the sick person in the sun after you press his tongue with the instrument that was described to you, and if your sight falls on the leech, pull it with a small hook or with a smooth, tight piece of date fiber.	When you treat a leech by the medical means spoken of in the appropriate section, with no effect, then inspect the patient's throat in full sunlight after depressing the tongue with the instrument I have described. If your gaze falls upon the leech, pull it out at once with a small hook or a fine pair of forceps.	0.8259855
If you are not able to do it with it, then take a hollow tube and insert it into the throat of the sick person near the leech, then insert into the inside of the tube a piece of iron heated by fire; you do this several times and the sick person abstains from water for his entire day, then he takes a bowl filled with cold water and opens his mouth in it and gargles with it and does not swallow a drop of it and moves the water from time to time with his hand, for the leech will fall on the spot when it senses the water.	But if you cannot get hold of it, take a cannula and introduce it into the patient's mouth near the leech, then pass through the cannula a red-hot iron; do this repeatedly; while the patient must not drink at all that day. Then let him take a vessel full of cold water, open his mouth in it and rinse out with it, but let him not swallow a drop of it; and he should keep the movement of the water going by hand time after time; for the leech straightway falls off when it feels the water.	0.8753468
If it does not come out with what we described, then fumigate the throat with urine and with asafoetida with the instrument that was described in the fumigation of the uvula, you do that several times, for it will fall.	If it does not come away by these means, fumigate the patient's throat with urine or with the juice of asafoetida, using the instrument described for fumigating the uvula. Do this several times, for then it will fall away.	0.8047679
And the way to work in fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are embers heated by fire, and the pot is covered with a lid in the middle of which is a hole, and you install in that hole the end of the instrument, then you throw in the incense, and the sick person puts his mouth at the end of the tube and closes his mouth so that the smoke does not come out until he knows that the smoke has reached his throat, for the leech will fall on the spot.	In fumigating, this is the way to set about it: take a pot containing live coals, fitted with a lid and a hole in the middle of the lid into which is fitted the end of the instrument. Then put in the aromatic; and the patient should apply his mouth to the end of the cannula, with his mouth closed to prevent the escape of the vapour, until he knows that the vapour has reached his throat; for the leech will at once come away.	0.8739618
If it does not fall, then the fumigation is repeated several times and the sick person endures thirst and eats salty things and garlic and does not drink water, so it must come out with this procedure.	But if it does not come away, let the inhalation be repeated many times. Let the patient endure his thirst, and eat salty food and garlic and drink no water. It will inevitably be removed by this treatment.	0.8394915
And this is a picture of an instrument with which you pull the leech from the throat if the sight falls on it, and it resembles hooks, as you see, except that it has this curvature that enters the throat, and its two ends resemble the mouth of a bird, in it is the roughness of a file; if it bites on something, it does not leave it.	This is the figure of an instrument for extracting the leech from the throat when visible. It resembles forceps, as you see, except that it has this bend for entry into the throat; and the two extremities are shaped like a bird's bill, with the roughness of a file. When they have hold of a thing they do not let go.	0.8668181
And another instrument with which the tongue is depressed, and it is a wide ring of iron, as much as the mouth can accommodate above the tongue, enters the mouth standing on its side, so the mouth remains open without the patient's will. And he is absolutely unable to remove it until you remove it.	And another instrument with which to depress the tongue. It is a wide ring of iron, of such a size as to go into the mouth above the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth standing on its side, and the mouth stays open without the patient's volition; nor can he dislodge it at all until you turn it.	0.937837
(Description of the instrument with which the mouth is opened according to this exact measurement)	Inside the ring appear the words: 'The pattern of the instrument for opening the mouth; exactly of this size'	0.48767176
