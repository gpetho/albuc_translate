O you, my dearest son, I have completed this book for you, which is the final one on the science of medicine together with its content, and I have concluded it through its explanations and clarifications. And it has come to me in a vision that I should complete it for you with this treatise, which is part of manual work, namely "surgery."
And because manual work has been abandoned in our region and has been entirely neglected, the science has perished and been fragmented, with nothing remaining of it except the brief descriptions in the books of the ancients, which have become obsolete. And from this have come error and vanity, intentions have been stifled, and the science has been estranged.
Now it seems to me that I want to revive it, together with the organization of this treatise, according to the method of exposition, clarification, and abbreviation; and I will include the shapes of cautery instruments and other tools of the trade, along with explanations and preparations for their use, as is necessary.
And because no good masters of manual skills are found in our time, the art of medicine has been distanced. And it is necessary for anyone who practices it to excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so that he knows the structure of the limbs, their forms, connections, and separations, and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, ligaments, the number of veins, their movements and fixed positions, and the places of their origins.
And for this reason, Hippocrates says that the name without the deed is much, but with the work it is little; and particularly in the art of manual work.
We tell you in the introduction to this book that whoever is not knowledgeable about the previously mentioned matters must beware of falling into error and killing people;
just as I have often seen many of those who meddle in this science and proceed without knowledge and experience.
For I saw a foolish physician who cut open an abscess of scrofula on a woman's neck and severed the arteries of the neck; causing so much blood to flow that the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another physician who attempted to remove a stone from an elderly man, and the stone was large; and he removed with it a piece of the bladder, and the man died within three days.
And I had already been called to remove it, and I saw the condition of the patient and the size of the stone, and I knew well that if it were cut, he would die.
And I saw another physician who undertook the care of a duke from our land who had a broken leg and also a wound with the fracture;
and the physician, full of ignorance, pressed the fracture over the wound with splints very tightly and did not leave any drainage for the wound, and left it like that for a long time;
and he commanded that it should not be unbound;
and it remained in that state until the leg and foot were completely swollen and became ruined.
I was called to come to him, and I hastened to come and unbind the leg; and when I unbound it, he was at peace and felt no pain.
But the corruption was already established in the limb, and I could not heal it;
and the corruption continued to spread through the limb until it was entirely lost.
And I saw another physician who punctured a cancerous abscess and then inflamed it through the malice of his intervention.
For a cancer, when it is pure from melancholic humor, must not be touched with iron unless it is in a place where one can entirely remove what is corrupted.
And for this reason, dearest son, you need to know that manual work is divided into two divisions: namely, work where there is danger in many conditions;
and I will show in each part of this book where there is fear and danger.
For this reason, it is necessary for you to be cautious, so that foolish physicians cannot speak ill of you.
So take your tools with careful judgment, approach your patients lightly and firmly, and use the best method so that, by God's grace, you may bring healing and be praised.
And leave aside terrifying diseases of severe harm;
and put aside your tools when you are in doubt, and have faith in yourself so that you may pass from this world to the other in glory.
Galen says in some of his admonitions: "Do not take on the care of a bad disease, lest you be called a foolish physician."
I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
The first chapter is about cauterizations with fire and with sharp medicinal tools, and this chapter is organized from the head to the feet;
and about the shapes of the instruments, the cauterizing tools, and all that is necessary for the work.
The second chapter is about cutting and piercing, and about cupping, wounds, the extraction of arrows, and similar matters;
and this chapter is organized along with the shapes of the instruments.
The third chapter is about restoring dislocations and twists, and similar matters;
and it is organized from the head to the feet, along with the shapes of the instruments.
Before we turn to the work, it is necessary that I speak of the qualities of benefit and harm in each temperament.
I say that the qualities of benefit and harm are the most extensive topic, the most subtle science, and the most hidden secret;
and many of the wise have spoken of this and have agreed upon it;
but their words suffice me little, as I fear their lengthiness.
I say that cauterization universally helps in all temperaments where there is matter, except for two temperaments: namely, a hot temperament without matter, and a dry temperament without matter.
In a hot and dry temperament with matter, some debated and said that cauterization is of great help; and others said the opposite: that cauterization is not useful for diseases that come from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is hot, and a hot disease must not be treated with heat, nor with dryness;
and the one who says the contrary states that cauterization is of great help for hot and dry diseases that occur in human bodies. For when you compare the human body and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it to be true on some occasions through experience.
And yet, only those who have tested it and who know through long practice the chapter on cauterizations, the diversity of human temperaments, the conditions and causes of their diseases, their developments, and the duration of time, should engage in it;
as for other temperaments, we have no fear, especially in cold and moist diseases. And all the physicians gathered and agreed upon cauterization.
And know, son, that cauterization using fire is among the secrets of healing and is of greater worth than cauterization with burning medicine.
For fire is simple and affects only the member that is burned, causing no harm to any other part.
Burning medicines spread from one member to another, worsening conditions and causing grievous afflictions to the member. And by chance, they may kill the patient.
Fire, due to its excellence and the nobility of its nature, does not do this unless there is excess.
And this I have discovered through experience and the long practice and study I have dedicated to the art, based on the truth of things.
And for this, I apologize for the length of my words, for I do not wish to deprive you of the secret contained in fire and the quality of its operation, how it drives away diseases of the body, as philosophers have demonstrated. Now receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on the time when cauterizations should be done and chose springtime.
But I say that cauterization is appropriate at all times because the arising harm is alleviated with the help of cauterization. And especially when the cauterization is for urgent and necessary pain that cannot wait for the time when greater harm may come to the member.
And do not ever think, dear son, as foolish doctors do. For a disease cured by cauterization does not return. And they say it thus;
And they say it thus; But it is not as they think, because cauterization is only a medicine that alters the complexion, dries the humors that cause pain, and surpasses medicine due to the swiftness of its efficacy and the virtue of its operation and dominance.
And it is possible for the disease to return at times, depending on the patient's complexion, the location of the disease, and its strength.
And the excesses gather in him through the acquisition of food and similar things unless the cauterization is applied to a place with little excess and moisture, such as the cauterization of teeth for pain and similar issues, and such pain does not return. But this happens rarely.
And many people do not understand why cauterization is called the last resort of medicine, and it is true;
But they do not believe that cauterization is valuable after medicine, and their understanding is false, for cauterization is the last resort of medicine because when we have applied various remedies to a disease and they fail, then we administer the cauterization, and it works.
Thus, it is clear that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, not according to the intention of foolish doctors.
The ancients said that cauterization with a gold instrument is better than with iron, and they said this only because of the quality of gold and the nobility of its nature.
And they said that the site of the cauterization does not rot, but this is not true, for I have tested it and found it true in some men.
And cauterization with gold is indeed superior to that with iron, as they said. Yet, when you heat a gold instrument, you cannot tell when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it cools quickly.
And if it is overheated, It becomes useless in the fire. Thus, there are many difficulties with it.
Now I have arranged this chapter from head to foot so that the way may be easier to follow.
This cautery is beneficial for moisture and cold on the brain, and there are two types made for a condition called "soda" and for the many humors that descend from the head to the eyes and ears, and for the multitude of dreams, toothache, sore throat, and especially for all diseases that arise from cold, such as paralysis, soda, apoplexy, and similar ailments.
The form of this cautery is such that the patient is purged with dissolving medicine cleansing the head for three or four nights, according to what the strength, age, and habits of the patient can endure. Then shave the patient’s head.
Then have him sit cross-legged between your hands, and place his hands on his chest.
Next, place the base of your palm on the base of his nose between his two eyes. And where your middle fingers land, mark with ink; then heat the cautery called "olivare," of which this is the procedure: Place it on the spot marked with ink, pressing downward and tightening your hand little by little while turning. Then quickly lift your hand and check the spot to see if you glimpse the bone slightly. If you do not see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have described.
Next, take a little salt, place it in water, soak cotton in it, and place it on the spot, leaving it for three days.
Afterward, apply cotton moistened with butter. Leave it on until the burn is healed. Then treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrafarmaçon" until it is healed.
The ancients said that the longer the wound remains open, the more it purges. And thus it provides greater relief.
Some said that one must leave the cautery on until part of the bone is burned, and then scrape away what is burned and treat it.
Others said the cautery should be left in place and pressed so firmly that bone is removed as widely as a spindle-whorl used by women, so the humors are fully expelled.
The wound must be left open for a long time. Then it must be treated and cauterized.
These two methods of cautery do not seem entirely good to me, except in some cases where the person shows clear signs of fear.
In many cases, it seems to me that I should avoid it.
For the head is weakened by the continuous natural evacuations, as we observe in other parts of the body.
Likewise, when the patient’s head is weak by nature, the first form of cautery is safer and more effective in my opinion, and I use it to work towards healing in such cases.
When chronic pain occurs throughout the head and lasts a long time, the patient must use salves and pills called "cochie," along with head purgatives, oils, and plasters. And if the cautery we previously described is applied and it does not help. Take care if the patient’s head is of strong constitution and not too cold. Then cauterize below the previous cautery a little, as we have described above. Next, make a cautery on each horn of the head down to the bone, as we said earlier, and make one cautery at the spot called "vasselz." This is the place where cupping glasses are applied. Lighten your hand so that you do not reach the bone. The patient feels much greater pain from this cautery than from others, and I will speak of it elsewhere.
The cauteries on the horns must be more delicate than those used to cauterize the center of the head, and this is the procedure:
Of the cautery of the head When sudden pain comes to a part of the head and the disease extends to the eye, and the head has been cleansed with purifying medicines, and the other treatments I have mentioned in the division of diseases have been performed, and none of this helps: Then perform cauterization in one of two ways, namely with sharp medicine or with iron.
The cautery with sharp medicine is done by taking a clove of garlic, removing the skin, and trimming it a little at both ends, then cutting the temple where the pain resides so that you can place the clove of garlic under the skin.
Once it is placed, bind it tightly and leave it for twelve hours. Then unbind it, remove the clove of garlic, and leave the wound as it is for two or three days. Next, apply cotton soaked in butter until the decay is expelled.
Afterward, treat it with ointment until it is healed.
If you wish, you can use some of the burning medicines I have described in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
The cautery with iron is performed as follows. Heat the cautery iron, which has the following form:
It is called "clos" because its head is shaped like a nail with a slight curve and a small protrusion in the middle.
Place it on the painful spot, hold your hand steady, and lightly turn the iron until half the thickness of the flesh is burned.
Lift your hand to avoid burning the artery underneath, which would cause a heavy flow of blood.
Afterward, soak cotton in saltwater and place it on the spot for three days. Then apply cotton soaked in butter, and afterward treat the spot with ointment until it heals.
If you wish, cauterize this migraine with the cautery called "cultellare," using its point, but take care not to cut the artery in this migraine that is not chronic.
Of migraine
When you treat a migraine as previously described in the division of diseases, and it does not help, and you see that the cauteries with medicine and iron are insufficient, then you must heat the cautery called "cultellare" until it turns white.
Then mark beforehand on the painful spot a line half a finger long, and remove your hand once, pressing carefully so as not to cut the artery or reach the bone.
Beware of the jaw, which moves when eating, and of the nerve connected to it, to avoid causing paralysis or spasm in the patient; also beware of bleeding from the artery when it is cut, as this can cause great fear, especially for someone unfamiliar with this practice and not trained or experienced. Leave the procedure incomplete.
But I will tell you how to stop the bleeding when the artery is cut, and I will show you where it is explained in this book.
If you see that these cauteries do not suffice for the condition and the patient is resilient, cauterize the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound until it heals.
If you wish, use the cautery described in the chapter on artery extraction, along with the cautery that has two blades. This cautery is better and more effective than the other.
Of ear pain due to cold
When cold causes pain in the ear, and solutions and the other treatments described in the division have been applied without effect, then heat the cautery called "poins," which has the following form:
Next, cauterize all around the affected ear, or both ears if the pain is in both, staying a little above the root of the ear after marking the spot with ink. Make ten cauterizations around each ear.
Afterward, treat the spots until they heal.
Of the affliction of the mouth
The affliction that must be treated by cauterization is only that which arises from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of diseases;
and cauterization must not be applied to conditions arising from dryness and spasms of the nerves.
When you treat this type of affliction caused by phlegm through purges, evacuations of the head, and gargling, and this does not suffice, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient in three places: one at the root of the ear, another slightly outside the temple, and the third at the meeting point of the two lips;
and place the cauterization on the area that appears healthy, applying it near the top of the ear, slightly below the edge of the head, and another on the temple as long as a thumb; and leave the cauterization in place until half the depth of the flesh is burned;
and this is the shape of the cauterization:
It resembles the small blade we described earlier, but it is slightly finer, and the knife must be a bit thicker;
afterward, treat the area as I have said before, until it is healed.
When apoplexy is chronic and you treat it as we have said, and it does not improve, and the patient has no fever, then apply four cauterizations: two on the two corners of the head, one in the middle of the head, and one at the place called the "vessel" as we described earlier, and the last cauterization on the mouth of the stomach;
and let it be treated as we said earlier.
Of lethargy
For this illness, the patient must be given strong purges and pills to cleanse the brain;
afterward, shave the patient’s entire head, and apply to the occiput the mustard plaster described in the treatise on plasters;
and this is the method of cauterization: apply it as I have described.
If he is healed this way, it is good; and if he is not, make three cauterizations from the middle of the head descending to the neck, with a space between each cauterization of the width of a finger;
treat it as with the others, and if you wish to add more and the patient is able to bear it, make one cauterization in the middle; and if necessary, two more on the two corners, and treat it until he is healed;
and let the cauterizations be those called "olive-shaped," as I have said before.
The head must be cleansed with purges and the remedies we have mentioned earlier;
afterward, shave the patient’s head, then cauterize the middle of the head, each corner, one at the back, and three on the spine of the neck;
and if more is needed, and the body is moist and the patient is able to endure it, and the illness is severe, make four cauterizations on the spine of the back; and leave them until most of the flesh is burned, then lift your hand; then treat it until he is healed, and let the cauterizations be those called "olive-shaped," as we have said before.
Of epilepsy
The epileptic should not undergo cauterization except for those that are phlegmatic, and the brain must first be cleansed with purges and other remedies we described in the section when the patient is strong and able to take medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot endure it, make him use gargling and chewing to cleanse the brain frequently, along with good foods;
afterward, shave the head in the middle, make one cauterization as we described earlier, and one cauterization on the vessel and on each corner; and if the patient is strong and enduring, make cauterizations as I have described for one with paralysis and weakening of the body, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cauterizations be olive-shaped according to the method I have mentioned.
If the patient is a child, make a subtle cauterization according to this method:
When, due to melancholy, there are corrupt humors or moisture and thick phlegm, then cauterize with the type of cauterizations we have described for those with paralysis.
And if, due to melancholy, the humors are tending toward melancholy and the patient’s body is moist, then give him something to drink that will cleanse the brain, as was mentioned earlier in the division.
Then shave the patient’s head; then make a well-formed linen ring, like a circle, and place it in the middle of the head;
and let the patient sit cross-legged and be firmly held from all sides;
then prepare the ointment, which consists of old sheep’s butter; and warm it over a gentle fire so that when it is applied, the fingers can withstand it; then pour it within the circle in the middle of the head and let it cool;
and do this for the patient once a week, along with other good treatments, until he is healed.
Or, if you wish, cauterize the area by making several points with the cauterization tool.
This method of cauterization moistens the brain evenly;
and then apply cotton soaked in butter and chicken fat.
Of wateriness of the eyes When wateriness first appears in the eyes, with the signs I mentioned in the division, begin by giving the patient something to drink to cleanse the head, keep him away from all moisture, and make him sweat or bathe several times on an empty stomach.
Then instruct him to tilt his head back, cauterize the middle of the head, and make two cauterizations on the two temples if the flow of water affects both eyes together, or one if it affects only one eye;
and with the cautery, cut all the veins and arteries beneath the flesh, and let the cauterizations be long, following the width of the temple;
and beware of excessive bleeding, and if you see too much blood flow, staunch it with whatever means you have.
And I will teach you the precautions for artery extraction and incision, and how to stop it.
And sometimes cauterizations are made on the nape, beneath the two bones at the back.
and it is seen to be caused by cold, phlegmatic excesses, then perform the cauterization I mentioned at the start of the treatment for water descending to the eyes: one cauterization in the middle of the head, two on the two temples, and two on the nape beneath the two bones; and if more is needed, cauterize carefully above the eyebrow with a small cauterization tool.
When you treat it according to what we described in the division, and it does not help, then give the patient to drink for three nights consecutively; then shave his head and make a cauterization in the middle with an olive-shaped cauterization tool; and make two cauterizations with the tool called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, slightly below the hairline;
and be careful not to cut the artery.
And this is the shape of the cauterization called "clavilis":
When the membrane of the eye is softened by illness and moisture, cauterize it with this cauterization tool called "olive-shaped." Of which this is the form:
And if you wish, make two cauterizations above the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows themselves;
and do not leave the tool in place longer than necessary to burn a third of the membrane, as I have described.
Of eyelashes that prick the eye Sometimes it happens that the eyelashes are turned inward and prick the eye, and cauterizations are done in two ways: either with fire or with a burning medicine.
For the fire cautery, instruct the patient to let the eyelashes grow until they are long and even; and if they prick him at their roots, restrain his eyes so that they do not move until they grow.
When they appear and are equal, then place the patient in your care; then draw upon the eyelid skin a figure resembling the leaf of a myrtle, and the start of the mark should be near the eyelashes;
next, place cotton moistened with egg white and parsley mucilage on the eye, then heat the cautery of the following design:
Afterwards, cauterize over the figure you have marked little by little many times, so that the tissue is burned at that spot;
and the sign of success in the operation is that you see the eyelid drawn back and the eyelashes raised to the edge of the eye;
then lift your hand and leave it as is for three days, then place cotton moistened with butter until the burn is healed; afterwards, treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if after this the eyelashes reappear, and the eyelid becomes soft, then redo the cauterization in the same place as before;
and if the eyelashes are disorderly, cauterize until the eyelid is restored to its natural position, is smooth, and the lashes no longer irritate the eye.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you instruct the patient to let the lashes grow until they are long and even, then make a parchment shaped like a myrtle leaf;
then take some French soap and quicklime, one measure of each, and grind them together well; and do this quickly so it does not cool, then spread it on the form you made in the shape of the myrtle leaf, and place it on the eyelid skin; and if the affliction is in one eye only, work on that one, and if in both, likewise; and place beneath the eye cotton moistened with egg white;
and the head of the patient should rest in your care, and place your index finger on the medicine, pressing lightly and adjusting each time the patient feels the sting of the medicine, for it will sting like fire.
When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine with your finger. And when the stinging has subsided, wash the area with water and check if you see the eyelid raised as if by the effect of fire or an incision; and if it is so, then it is good.
If not, apply the medicine again to the area where it has not worked, until your operation is even and the eyes are properly set;
then place cotton moistened with butter until the burned tissue has fallen away, and afterwards treat the area with ointment called "dyafenis" or others, until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you are very careful in your work, ensuring that none of the medicine falls into the eyes.
And if the eyelid becomes soft afterward, and the lashes irritate the eye, then restart the application of medicine on the area of the softened eyelid, carefully, just as you did before; then treat it until it is healed;
and this is the form of the myrtle leaf:
And know that men’s eyes vary in size, both large and small, and your adjustments should be made accordingly;
and let not the correct path be hidden from anyone dedicated to the study of this art.
on the treatment of fistula with cautery
When you treat a fistula as we have discussed in the divisions of diseases, and your treatments are ineffective, then you must use cautery according to this method.
Instruct the patient to place their head in your care; and have an assistant hold the patient’s head firmly in such a way that they do not move or turn their head;
afterward, place cotton moistened with egg white or parsley juice on the eye;
then heat the cautery, which is of this design:
it is shaped at the tip like the form of a vulture’s feather, together with the shaft being the cautery;
if you wish, it may be pointed from one end to the other, or if you prefer, shaped like a tent;
but in any case, the one with a tip is more useful for your work.
Afterward, press the fistula if it is open, draw out the pus, and dry it; and if it is closed, open it and extract the filth;
then apply the hot cautery strongly, holding your hand with the cautery above the nerve area near the eye to ensure your hand does not err; and place the cautery into the fatty tissue of the eye and destroy it.
If you reach the bone with the initial cautery, it will be good. If not, redo the cautery again, or even more if necessary, and leave it for three days;
then place cotton moistened with butter on it, and treat it with drying ointment until it is healed; if forty days pass without healing, apply a corrosive sharp medicine until the bone is exposed; and follow the instructions as outlined in its proper section.
And there is a method of cauterizing a fistula described by some of the ancients. Address the fistula and make an incision in the area; then insert into the incision a fine camahan of the following design: it is made to the size of one measure of lead; hold the camahan firmly with your hand, and ensure the patient does not move at all, lest the melted lead run into their eye;
and it is necessary to place cotton moistened with egg white or water over the patient’s eye;
the lead burns the fistula area and heals it with remarkable efficacy.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery as we described, it is good. If not, it is necessary to make perforations in the nerve and guide the fistula back to the nerve's body as required in its proper place.
On cracks in the lips Cracks often appear on the lips, called "poil," especially on the lips of children.
When you treat these cracks as described in the divisions, and the treatment does not work, then heat a small knife-shaped cautery of the following design:
And quickly apply it to these cracks until it reaches their base;
then treat the area with wax ointment until it is healed.
When an abscess occurs at the root of the throat, the uvula, the palate, or the roots of the teeth, it becomes decayed, ruptured, chronic, and turns into a fistula; and you treat it as we described in the divisions, but it does not work: then it is necessary for you to use a cautery matching the size of the fistula; then apply it to the opening or perforation of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches its base and farthest point;
do this once or twice, then treat it as we have explained in the treatments until it is healed;
and if it heals in this way, it is good; and if not, it is necessary to uncover the area and remove the corrupted bone as described in its section.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth become loose, and treating them with medicines does not work, then place the patient’s head in your care; then heat the cautery, whose shape is as follows, in such a way that you place a tube over the tooth;
and insert the hot cautery into the tube quickly, and hold it until the patient feels the heat reaching the root of the tooth;
then lift your hand and reapply the cautery as needed;
afterward, have the patient fill their mouth with salted water, hold it for an hour, and spit it out.
And in this way, the tooth that was loose is stabilized, the softened gums are tightened, and the corrupted moisture is dried.
On the pain of teeth
When tooth pain comes from cold, or there is coldness or humidity, and medical treatments are ineffective, then cauterization is needed in two ways: Cauterization with butter and cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with butter is such that you take cow’s butter and melt it in an iron or bronze spoon; then take cotton, wrap it around the tip of a probe, soak it in the boiling butter, and quickly place it on the aching tooth, holding it there until it cools;
and do this often until its effect reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, soak wool and cotton in cold butter, place it on the aching tooth, and apply hot iron until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
Cauterization with fire is such that you take an iron or bronze rod, making it thick enough so that the fire does not reach the patient's mouth;
then heat the cauterizing rod, whose shape will be described later, and place it on the tooth, holding your hand until the rod cools;
do this often, for the pain will be removed that very day or the next.
And the patient should fill their mouth with good butter during the application of the cautery, then spit it out afterward;
And this is the method of cauterization:
And make the cautery on whatever part you wish, according to your ability;
And this is the shape of the rod:
On scrofula When scrofula is caused by phlegm and cold moisture, and does not respond to digestion with medicines, then heat the head of the cauterizer, whose shape will be described later, and make two openings for the fumes to escape from the other side of the cautery;
and place the heated cauterizer on the abscess once or twice as needed, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, apply the cauterizer according to the size of the abscess, and leave it as is for three days; and apply cotton soaked in butter until the burn is removed;
afterward, treat the area with ointments and dressings until it is healed.
When moisture overcomes the passages of the lungs, especially when it comes from a cold complexion, then the patient must first be treated with purgative medicines;
then make a cautery at the root of the throat, and take care not to go as far as the throat, and burn only a little of the flesh.
Then make another cautery at the junction of the neck and the top of the spine, using the cauterizer called “clavicle,” whose shape we described earlier;
and treat the area as we described earlier until it is healed.
When coughs and lung diseases are caused by cold moisture, and the patient has no fever or dryness, and the illness is chronic, make two cauteries on the chest in empty spaces; and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts;
and use the cauterizer called “clavicle” according to the shape described earlier.
And if you wish, make a cautery with a pricking action using the cauterizer called “point,” whose shape was described earlier in the section on ear diseases;
and make as many as thirty pricks, or around that number.
Afterward, treat the area as described earlier, and use the cautery with three prongs in this manner:
And thus the cautery is lighter because you perform three at once.
On dislocation of the jaw
When the head of the jaw is dislocated due to moisture, and it is put back in place but does not stay, instead dislocating again with small movements, as we have observed, then it is necessary first to reduce the dislocation. Afterward, let the patient lie on their back and on their side; then lift the flesh within the affected joint with the fingers of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated inwardly, then heat the cauterizer with two prongs, whose form is described here:
and cauterize the flesh so that it penetrates to the ribs, and this creates the effect of the cautery combined with four cauteries;
and thus cauterization is done with the cauterizer that has three prongs, so that the figure of the cauterization consists of six cauteries;
and the prongs are as fine as a probe, and this is the shape of the cauterizer with three prongs:
And sometimes an additional prong is added, resulting in eight cauteries.
Afterward, apply crushed leeks mixed with salt to the cauterized area; then let the patient rest, and do not move the limb for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated above, which rarely happens, then make a cautery on the thick part with the “clavicle” cauterizer, or many pricking cauteries.
For the joint is restored, the moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.
When coldness and much moisture affect the stomach to the point that it alters its natural condition, and catarrh increases there, and the usual methods of treatment are ineffective, then the patient must lie on their back and stretch out their legs and arms. After that, make three cauteries: one beneath the hollow of the breastbone, the size of a finger, with the “clavicle” cauterizer, and two on the sides, so that the shape of the cauteries forms a triangle, leaving enough space between them that they do not connect when they discharge pus;
and make the cauteries deep enough to affect both sides of the heart, and the shape of the cauteries should follow this form without addition:
And if you wish, cauterize the middle of the stomach with a large cauterizer in this shape;
and for those who fear this cautery, cauterize with pricks and bleed the stomach at a single point, according to the size you prefer on the side; then cauterize it with the cauterizer called “point.”
Afterward, treat the area as we have described earlier, until it is healed.
When cold and moisture and thick windiness affect the liver, disrupting its natural condition due to excesses; and the patient has been treated according to the methods we have described in sections, but to no avail, then the patient must lie on their flank; and mark three cauteries in this shape, figure, and size over the liver, outside the hypochondrium, where the rib cage begins;
and leave a space between each cautery the width of a finger; and make the cauteries along the length of the body, pressing lightly with the cauterizer;
and burn only half the flesh, and let the patient stand upright;
and if they cannot stand, then let them lie down, stretch their legs, and raise their arms;
And if you wish, cauterize these areas with the knife cauterizer, if you are skilled and wise in the art, and take care not to burn all the flesh, for that would dry out the whole body; and ensure it does not reach the boiling point, for the flesh is very delicate in that area, and this you should know for certain.
When there is an abscess on the liver, and you wish to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient feels pain, but not too intense;
and if it is in the membrane, the pain is excruciating.
And then, when this treatment is described by the physicians, the patient must lie on their back;
and then bleed the area where the abscess is located, and heat the cauterizer that resembles a rod, whose form is described here: And cauterize one cautery until the core is burned, and it reaches the syphac, until all the corruption is expelled.
Afterward, treat it according to the method of draining until it is healed.
And no one should use this cautery except one who has long studied the art of medicine and has treated such illnesses with his hands many times.
Then he may proceed boldly, yet it seems to me that often it is better to avoid it.
Of the cautery for pleuresy
The ancients said that for pleurisy, cauteries should be made with roots of aristolochia, and in this manner: Take a long root of aristolochia, the largest you can find, and it should be dry, as thick and as long as your fingers. Dip its marrow in oil, set it in the fire, and apply one cautery between the hollow and the neck, and two small cauteries slightly descending on the part below the chin.
And two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly declining toward the back. And one cautery in the middle of the chest, another above the stomach, one between the two shoulders, and two on the sides of the chest near the cautery between the shoulders.
And do not press your hand, but act gently, as if inhaling a scent.
Some ancients said that some men use a cautery shaped like a razor, heat it, and place it between the ribs until it reaches the abscess. And the pain escapes, as we have said about the abscess of the liver.
But in this procedure, there is a risk that the patient may die immediately, or a fistula may form that cannot be healed.
Of the spleen
When you treat the disease of the spleen as we have explained in the divisions of treatments, and it does not help, then there are three methods of cautery, all of which are good.
One of these methods is to make three cauteries, or four, in a line along the length of the spleen, following the shape of the cautery for the liver that we described earlier.
And do not press your hand with the cautery, and let the patient often lie on his back.
Another method of cautery is to heat the cautery with two prongs, as we have shown for the dislocation of the shoulder.
And lift the part near the spleen where the patient’s pain occurs on the left side, and let the elevation with which you lift the part follow the alignment of the body, and the cautery should be placed across the width of the body.
Then insert the two heated prongs until the part is pierced through to the other side, and then remove the cautery; in this way, there will be four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the cautery that has three prongs.
Afterward, treat it when it has expelled the corruption over time, and this is often more effective than the other treatments previously mentioned.
Cautery is not useful for dropsy, except in the method called "ascites."
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in the divisions, and your treatment does not work, then you must make four cauteries around the belly, one above the stomach, one above the liver, one above the spleen, two on the back along the spine, and one near the chest. And let the cauteries be placed close to the thickness of the heart.
Afterward, leave the cautery open to expel corruption over time, and do not neglect the treatment of the patient after the cautery. And the healing will hasten, and the two intentions will align with the help of God.
The form of the cautery for the belly should be the pointed one we described earlier. And the one for the back should be oval-shaped, as mentioned earlier.
When the feet are swollen in one who is dropsical and full of citrine water, you must cauterize the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring toe; and lift your hand with the cautery without twisting.
And do not go too deeply, so the citrine water may flow out, and let the cauterization follow this form:
Then make two cauterizations on each leg at the tip of the calf muscle; and let the cauterizations be long, one below the knee in front and the other behind, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauterizations open for a long time without cleaning, so that the water may flow out;
then proceed with the other treatments we have described.
When diarrhea arises from cold and moisture, so that the retentive and digestive power of the stomach and intestines is weakened, and it cannot be cured by ordinary treatments; and you see the patient enduring well and of strong constitution, then make a large cauterization on the stomach according to what has been previously discussed about stomach cauterization, in a circular form; and four small cauterizations around the navel with a fine pointed cautery, and two cauterizations on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient enduring, then make a cauterization on the wrist, one on each shoulder blade, and two small cauterizations on the stomach beside the large one, for the treatment is effective when there is good support.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids
When hemorrhoids are in the anus, whether one or more, and are chronic and made of thick, cold, and corrupted moist humors, and treatments as we have described in sections do not help, then make cauterizations: Three on the spine, at the outermost part just below the nape of the neck, arranged triangularly, and one below the navel by two fingers' breadth;
and if you think their stomach is cold, and the food does not digest, and the face appears swollen, then make one large cauterization on the stomach as previously described, another on the liver, and another on the spleen with the fine-pointed cautery; and leave the cauterization open for a long time. Then treat the area until it is healed.
When you cut the thelul, heat the cautery shaped like a razor, and then place it fully heated upon the cut thelul; and keep your hand there until the cautery reaches the root of the vein from which the blood flows;
do this once or twice, and if there are many theluls, cauterize each one as we have described; then treat with beneficial ointments until they are healed;
and if you cauterize with a large cautery on the alchatim, it will be more effective.
When the patient cannot endure incisions or openings, as we will describe in its section, such a condition arises that it cannot be healed except by cautery.
When someone has a fistula, and it is old and emits putrefaction and corrupted moisture, you must probe it with a fine tent and ascertain with the tent how deep it is.
Then heat a cautery that resembles a razor, and insert it into the fistula to the depth indicated by the tent, and repeat the cauterization until the rotten and corrupted tissue is burned away, once, twice, or three times, depending on the need;
and take care not to burn the nerves that are there, nor the large veins.
If the fistula leads to the bladder or intestine, take care in those areas, and only perform this in fleshy parts, ensuring it does not penetrate.
Then treat the area until it is healed, and if the wound has closed and the matter has been removed for a long time, know that the area is fully healed;
but if the matter has not been removed, know that the area is hollowed and the bone at the base is corrupted; and thus as one of these cases we will describe in its section.
When pain from cold occurs in the kidneys, accompanied by large winds, and there is no desire for women, then you must cauterize the kidneys on both sides with the fine-pointed cautery we mentioned earlier;
and if we cauterize in the middle, there will be three cauterizations in a line, which will provide greater relief.
On the bladder When the bladder is soft and weak from cold and moisture, causing the patient to retain urine, make a cauterization on the upper part of the bladder, where the pubic hair begins, one on the right and one on the left, each as long as a thumb joint;
and make one cauterization on the back, or two if needed;
and let the cauterization be fine-pointed, as previously described.
When the uterus is cold and moist, preventing conception, and the menstrual flow is corrupted and delayed; and when they come, great pain is felt: then three cauterizations must be made around the navel, as we have described for bladder cauterization, and two cauterizations on the back;
and let the cauterization be fine-pointed, as we have described.
When viscous moisture descends to the socket of the hip, causing it to shift from its place, and the sign is that one thigh is longer than the other when measured together;
and the separation point is found to be hollow, then you must cauterize the patient on the socket of the hip with a circular cauterization, bleeding the area around the socket as it turns, so that the socket is enclosed within the circle;
and let the cautery be of the type used for the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available, make three large olive-shaped cauterizations, as deep as the entire core;
and treat the area until it is healed.
On hip pain When pain occurs in the hip socket from cold and moisture, and the patient has been treated as described in the section but the treatment does not work, and the condition is chronic: then you must purge the patient of thick humors with fetid pills or other suitable pills. Then perform cauterization;
and the method of cauterization follows two approaches: namely, the use of burning medicines and fire cautery.
Fire cauterization has many methods, one of which is as follows:
that you make three triangular cauterizations on the hip socket in this shape, with good depth and size, spacing each cauterization by the width of a finger, and using an olive-shaped cautery;
sometimes a cauterization is made in the center on the top of the hip, resulting in four cauterizations in this pattern:
And if you wish, cauterize with the circular cautery we mentioned earlier for hip dislocation;
but do so in a way that the circle encompasses the entire hip, and all the thickness of the core is burned.
This is the method used in sciatica when the pain is in the hip and does not extend to the thigh or leg.
And if it extends to the thigh and leg, make two cauterizations where the patient says the pain is, and one cauterization above the ankle by four fingers' breadth, slightly to the left;
and let the cautery be knife-shaped, burning to the core's thickness;
and if the patient feels the pain extending to the toes or nearby, cauterize where the pain is felt, making three or four points with the cautery called "points." And if necessary, make more cauterizations;
and if the pain is below the knee toward the thigh, make a cauterization with the knife-shaped or circular cautery, and take great care in all your cauterizations not to leave the cautery so long that you burn the nerves and large arteries, or cause the patient greater harm and contraction.
And I myself have seen many who applied cautery on the ankle of the foot, and left it so long that the leg became completely swollen, as well as the foot, and the entire foot was pierced and corrupted. After a loosening of the belly from which he died.
And if the pain is in two places together, apply cautery to both, in this manner.
And the wise said concerning the cautery of the hip, for which this is the method, make such an iron, and let its head be as thick as a small date, or a little less, and let it have serrations, and let the distance between one serration and the next be the size of a thumb’s joint.
And let the serrations be open on two sides, and let them resemble knots, and let there be a well-made iron handle.
And this is the shape:
And let it be heated until it is completely red and sparks fly from it, and then place it on the hipbone of the afflicted side, and let it be turned on the sound side.
And cauterize it once with a round cautery and leave it for three days. And then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open for a long time. Afterwards, treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Albucasis says that we use this cautery little because of the fear of its appearance, and we see few who use it.
And yet it is one of the good cauteries, for those who can endure it, and in the cases where it is appropriate.
The cautery of burning medicine is such that you make a serrated instrument on which the edge of the opening descends, and let it be made of bronze or iron with a long surface, and let there be two knobs in its height, and between each the thickness of a finger. And let them be open on the outside and above, and joined together in this form:
Then place it on the hipbone of the patient lying on their healthy side, and press your hand firmly on the hipbone. Afterwards, pour between the two circles some warm water that has been heated slightly by fire, and leave it for an hour, and let the patient endure its heat and burning.
For they feel a stinging sensation like that of fire.
And when the stinging sensation has passed, lift your hand with the instrument and wash the hip with fresh water, and leave it like this for three days, and apply butter until what is blackened from the scalding is removed. And leave it for three days so that the rotting may be expelled.
And this would be the final aid after treatment with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain has extended to the thigh or to the leg, make an instrument to hold water in the same manner as you did for the hip.
And this is the method of hot water, and I have written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicine. Take alkali and quicklime, equal parts of each, and grind them together, and place them in a new pot. In which there is a small opening outside, just large enough for the tip of a razor to enter.
In which there is a small opening outside, just large enough for the tip of a razor to enter. And place over this pot another well-sealed pot, and pour over the alkali and lime some fresh water until there is a finger’s width above the powders when you press it with your hand.
And leave it like this until some distilled water descends and collects in the sealed pot, then take all this water and pour it over the lime and alkali as before.
And then it will be very strong water and is used in many medical operations and in the cauterization of other body parts.
For it acts in the same way as fire, and there are also other medicines with which one can effectively cauterize the hip, such as resin, honey, anacardium, lime, and soap, all mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a cure in which a man was healed of hip pain and sciatica, and he praises it greatly, saying that no other treatment was done, and that he was healed in a single session when this treatment was applied, and he bathed as instructed below.
And he says in this manner that you take fresh and dry green litharge, grind it well with a bit of grease, and apply it to the hip, the thigh, and the leg where the pain is, and bind it.
And leave it for three hours, or until the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then make him enter the bath until his body is slightly soaked, and then put him to bed, and the pain will leave entirely, and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with such medicines unless it is after cleansing the body.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat dung, it helps greatly.
And the cautery should be done in this way. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the hollow between the big toe and the next toe, which is called the fossa.
Then take dry goat dung, burn it until it becomes charcoal, place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished.
And repeat this again, and do not stop until you judge that it reaches the hip and the pain has ceased.
And this type of cautery is called the "goat cautery."
On back pain
When pain occurs in the back, whether from a fall, a blow, excessive evacuation, or something resembling the spread of cold matter, cautery is useless in all these cases except for the one caused by the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary, after the patient has been purged with fetid pills or similar remedies, to make on his back, where the pain is, three lines marked with ink, and on each line, apply five or more cauteries, depending on the strength and capacity of the patient to endure.
And the cautery should be done according to the method called "point cautery."
And if you wish, make three or four cauteries with the medium clavilary cautery, in this form:
This disease often occurs in small children, and the signs at the beginning are that they have labored breathing when they rise, and fear. And you find in the lower spine of the back and the nodes the swelling that appears above the other vertebrae.
When you see this and want to treat it, cauterize it with the circular cautery in this form. So that the cautery equally covers each part of the spine.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with the pointed cautery in two or three lines, with the points close to one another.
Afterwards, treat the area until it is healed as we have described, and ensure that you do not administer cautery in a hump caused by nerve spasm.
On joint pain
When joint pain is caused by moisture spreading to each part of the body, and when the pain is in the foot, which doctors properly call "podagra," and when it is caused by cold and medicines cannot cure it, it is treated by cautery in this manner:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cautery be olive-shaped, in this form:
And if necessary to touch the surface of the foot, make the cautery with the one called the "point cautery." And if the pains extend to the knees and other joints, which happens often, apply to each knee three or four cauteries on each side, using the olive-shaped cautery.
And if more are needed, apply more, but do not keep your hand there except until the thickness of the core is burned.
And if the pains descend to the knees and back, apply the cautery as described in the previous chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make two lines of points around the wrist;
and if pain remains in the fingers, make points on each joint and on the back of the hand;
and if the pains extend to the elbows or to the shoulders, cauterize each part, manage the patient well, and administer medicines.
For if you provide good management and purge phlegm, he will be healed with God's help.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the bowels descend into the testicles and it is recent, it is necessary that when you intend to treat it, the patient does not eat that day; and that he consumes things that loosen the bowels, so that the feces descend from his body;
then make him lie on his back between your hands, and instruct him to hold his breath until the bowels are returned to their place, and guide them back with your fingers, and incise at the edge below the rupture above the pubic bone, marking with a shape resembling half a circle over the body;
then heat the cautery tool, which has the following form:
until it is white-hot and emits sparks. Then return the bowels to their place; and the assistant holds his hand over them so that they do not return out;
and spread the patient’s thighs well, placing a cushion under him and one assistant on his thighs, and another on his chest to hold his hands;
then place the cautery tool on the marked spot with your whole hand, hold it steady, and keep it there until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, repeat again until you come to the bone; and be careful that the bowels do not protrude when you apply the cautery; so that you do not burn them; and so that the patient does not die or suffer other harm.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worth nothing.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be fine according to the measure of their bones, and for adults as large as their size requires;
after three days, treat the cautery site with butter until the burn is alleviated;
afterward treat it with other ointments until it is healed, and have the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is well closed;
and it is necessary that his diet remain light for a long time, so that the bowels do not protrude when he resumes walking.
And after forty days, when he wishes to get up, provide him with a well-made bandage, and have him wear it for another forty days;
and let him rest well, exert himself little, and avoid excessive consumption of food and drink, as well as loud shouting;
and when he follows this instruction, he will be fully healed.
And I will next discuss the treatment for cutting in its chapter.
When ruptures occur in other parts of the abdomen and are noticeable, and you want them to grow no further, make a round cautery according to its size, and burn one-third of its depth; then treat it as we have described;
and some of the ancients have said that it should be cauterized with a cautery of three angles in this shape:
but first mark the site with ink and draw a line across the width above the rupture, and another below, and place your hand in the middle with the cross-shaped cautery.
But the first cautery is lighter and milder.
Of chronic pain in any limb When pain occurs in any limb, either from a fall or a blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and medicinal treatments are ineffective, then it is necessary to cauterize it with a cautery called "point," and the cautery should match the length of the limb, its smallness, its weakness, its strength, and the location of the twisting and the pain.
If he is healed from the first cautery, that is good;
if not, repeat another cautery on the same spot, for such is the practice that it must move to the nearest limb, therefore you must apply cautery until the patient is healed.
Leprosy is sometimes greatly helped by cautery, and particularly the disease that comes from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you wish to cauterize it, observe whether the disease is at its beginning, and if it is treated as we have described in the section, and it neither worsens nor remains, and you fear that the corruption will take over the entire patient, then apply five cauteries on the head: One in the middle of the head at the crown, and another toward the forehead at the hairline; and two on the two temples, and one at the back of the head at the occiput;
and hold your hand there until the cautery reaches the bone, and until the scabs rise outward so that the vapors of the thick humors can escape;
and cauterize on the skin according to what is described above.
And if the leprosy is spread throughout the body; and it appears clearly, it is necessary to cauterize with the cauteries we described on the head, and one cautery on the tip of the nose, two on the spine of the neck, six on the spine of the back, one large one on the sacrum and another beside it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the elbows, two on the tendons of the chest, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the palms;
and be careful of the nerves located in the lower back, that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one cautery is applied on the wrist bone, another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you perform, the more you help him, and many benefit from it;
and know that the patient does not feel the pain of the cautery as the healthy do, because the body is already entirely corrupted.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large or small according to the limbs and joints, as you will find in the forms of the instruments.
Afterward, treat the site with bean flour mixed with honey and other remedies until it is healed.
When swelling appears in a limb and has been treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and it is not healed, then apply cauteries to the limb according to the size and smallness of the limb;
and let the cautery penetrate slightly into the thickness of the flesh; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes a cautery is applied to the hand, the foot, and the back, at the exit of the nerve that moves the limb, and thus the swelling is removed;
and nevertheless no one should undertake this unless he is knowledgeable about the limbs and the paths of the nerves that move the body.
When the disease called "albaras" is aged, and medicinal remedies are of no use, then cauterize it with a slightly deep cautery, according to the thickness of the flesh, until the whiteness is removed, and its color is changed;
then treat it with flour of beans and lentils mixed with rose oil, plantain leaves, and blood of a dove and a lark, each in equal parts; and let it all be mixed together, wrapped in a cloth, and applied to the site until it is healed.
The treatment of chancre with cautery
When a chancre appears at the beginning, and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that resembles a circle, all around the chancre.
And yet the wise men have said that one should also cauterize in the middle of the chancre;
and yet this does not seem good to me, for I fear it might become ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen this happen sometimes;
and it is more proper that it be cauterized around, with the cautery called "circle," as we have said for many cauteries.
When someone has a disease called "adubelati," and it delays in maturing, either because of its excessive production, or because of the age of the patient when he is decrepit (that is to say, too old), and he has little blood, or because of the season; and you wish to hasten its maturation: then cauterize around it with many small cauteries in pricking motions; Then leave it like this. For it will hasten to die.
And if you want to pierce it with the cautery, then heat the cautery, of which this is the method:
And place your hand in the middle of that ailment which is called "adubelati," until the cautery has pierced the core, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it externally in such a way that the flow of the corruption is alleviated.
Then treat it until it is completely healed.
There is another kind of disease which is called "corrodens," and it is nothing other than a consumption of the limb, for it eats the limbs just as fire consumes dry wood.
If you see this disease in a place that can endure cautery together with fire, then heat the pointed cauteries, both small and large, according to what is needed for the location of the disease.
Then cauterize all around so that you remove all the corruption, and let none of it remain, so that everything that is corrupt is removed.
Then leave it for three days, and apply sulfur crushed with oil to the cauterized areas until the burns from the fire are removed, and all the corruption as well.
Then treat it with ointments that generate flesh.
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh is not growing, that is fine;
And if not, then begin the cautery again on what remains of the corrupted areas.
And this condition has sometimes been treated with sharp medicine instead of fire cautery;
but nevertheless fire cautery is of greater help, and I have already explained the treatment with sharp medicine in the section: take it when you need it.
About corns that appear on the feet Many times it happens that on the feet a condition arises, which we call "clos," and it is a hard lump that injures the foot.
And the cautery for this condition is of two kinds. That is, fire cautery and hot water cautery.
Fire cautery is when you heat a small cautery tool shaped like the nib of a quill, made of good iron and sized to encompass the corn on all sides, with fine edges;
then place it hot over the corn, and rotate your hand all around the corn until it reaches the base of the corn; and leave it like this for three days until it starts to discharge pus; then make a poultice of wild mallows crushed with salt, leave the poultice on all night, and the corn will fall off and be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the area with ointment that generates flesh until it is healed.
And if they have spread over the body, which often happens on the hands and feet, you should apply hot water cautery there; and it is done in this way: take a small tube of brass or iron, or a quill-shaped tool, and place it over the corn or the wart; place the tube so it surrounds the area, then pour a little hot water inside, hold your hand firmly, and press while rotating so that the edge of the tube reaches the root of the corn and allows the hot water to penetrate deeply to the root;
and have the patient endure the sting of the hot water for a while; then leave it like this, and it will be uprooted entirely with its roots.
Do this one after another until you remove all those on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
When someone trembles from nerve coldness, quartan fever, or another cause, you should apply four cauteries on the spine of the back, one cautery between each vertebra; and one cautery on the foot, and one on the stomach with the olive-shaped cautery;
then the trembling will stop, and the recovery from the cold condition will hasten.
Sometimes foul-smelling pustules appear on the body, caused by thick, corrupted matter.
It is necessary, when they first appear, to apply cautery on the head of each pustule: a fine cautery made of myrtle wood, with its tip heated in fire, or from the root of long birthwort, or a lenticular cautery.
Sometimes they are cauterized at the start when they appear, in this manner, and they cannot grow further, as the excess causing them is interrupted, and they are healed;
but it must be done after bloodletting.
Many times, there are great flows of blood from an artery cut in a wound that comes outward, or in the incision of an abscess, or in the cauterization of a limb, and similar cases; and it is a very serious thing to stop.
And yet, when this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the wound in the vein and press so firmly that the blood calms under your finger, and no drop escapes;
then heat several olive-shaped cauteries, both small and large, until they are all red-hot;
then take one, large or small depending on the wound and the location where the artery is broken, and place the cautery on that vein where your finger was, and hold it there until the bleeding is stopped.
And if it gushes out when you lift your finger from the vein and the cautery cools, quickly take another of the cauteries from the fire.
And do not stop repeating this one after another until the bleeding is stopped.
And be careful not to burn the nearby nerve, and that no other harm comes to the patient.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, it cannot be properly stopped, especially if the artery is large, except by one of the four methods we have mentioned: either by cautery, by extraction when it is not drawn out, by strong binding with thread, or by applying medicines that have the power to stop blood. And it should be tied and tightened properly.
Whoever uses methods like tightly binding with cloths, applying burning things, or other similar measures will find they help little or not at all.
And if this happens to someone and there is no doctor or medicine available, they should place their index finger on the vein’s wound as we have said, pressing firmly until the bleeding is stopped over the wound and the vein. And do not move the finger, but frequently wet it with very cold water until the blood congeals, thickens, and stops.
And from then on, use the cauteries and medicines that are needed.
We have told you in the first chapter about all the diseases for which fire cautery or burning medicine is needed, as well as the occasions, causes, instruments, and forms of the cauteries.
And I have organized that chapter from head to foot, and I will follow the same approach in this chapter so that what is sought can be found more easily.
And before I begin, it is necessary, dear son, that you understand that there is more danger and fear in this chapter than in the first about cauteries, and therefore it requires greater caution.
For in the operations described in this chapter, there is often blood loss when opening a vein, making an incision on an abscess, treating wounds, extracting arrows, making an incision on a stone, and similar procedures. Where there is risk and fear, and death comes to many.
And I warn you not to undertake anything foolish. For many types of people come for treatment. Some come who are so distressed by their illness that they die easily from the despair they feel about their disease and its severity. And of these, one should be afraid.
And among them are those who pretend to be rational and say: “Wait, I am cured”; but the illness is dire.
You should not consent to those who come to you with such behavior, but place greater value on your honor than on your greed, and act not foolishly but wisely in matters you are certain of, and from which you can gain profit and reputation.
And use prognosis and indication in treating your patients so that healing is achieved.
And this will help you gain good reputation, glory, and a lasting memory of praise.
Dearest son, may Our Lord grant you good understanding and righteousness, and may He inspire you with the holy inspiration of His hand, amen.
Now I have organized this chapter, dividing it into sections, as I did in the chapter on cauteries, arranged from head to foot, so that you may more easily find what you need.
Know that this condition often occurs in children during childbirth when the delivery compresses the head of the child too strongly.
And sometimes it arises from an unknown cause.
And I have never seen this condition except in children, and in all those I have seen, death came quickly. And therefore, it seems better to me to leave such cases alone.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and the head swelled every day so much that he could not bear it;
and the moisture increased so much that he died, and this moisture gathered under the bone upon the membrane, between the brain and the bone;
and the operation is such that if the moisture is between the brain and the bone, and the swelling is small, you make a wide incision in the middle of the head;
and it should be as long as two fingers, so that the moisture flows;
and here is the shape of the spatula:
If the moisture has increased more, and the swelling is larger, then make two incisions in the shape of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is under the bone, and you see the signs that the seams of the head are open on each side, and the water spurts out when you press it inward with your hand, and this is not concealed from you: then you must make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner:
And after the incision, extract all the moisture outside. Afterward, compress the incisions with cloths and powders, and apply wine and oil, and leave it thus until the fifth day;
then untie it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and continue compressing the head evenly, and give the patient dry food with little moisture until the body is strengthened and healed.
And another method of incision is that you observe where the swelling is evident, and where the water has accumulated;
for sometimes it is in the front; sometimes in the back; sometimes on the right; and sometimes on the left.
Cut therefore where the swelling appears, and where the water is gathered, and cut it as much as you are able;
and be careful not to cut the artery; and let there flow a stream of blood, so that the patient does not die from excessive bleeding or evacuation of moisture.
When someone has a disease called "catarrh" in the eyes or chest, and the disease is chronic, and medical treatment does not help, then the final cure is cauterization along with cutting the two arteries.
It is necessary, therefore, when you are about to cut them, that the patient leans back his head; then rub the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient presses his neck with a cloth; then observe where the veins pulse, and the locations of each one are behind the ears, and slightly recessed;
then mark the places with ink, then cut each one with a sharp spatula from two sides, until the cut reaches the bone, and this should be across the width of the head.
And if you wish, place the spatula under the artery and cut above it, cutting as if across two fingers.
And when the vein is cut, the blood spurts continuously outward.
And if the artery is not visible to the touch, you must measure the distance of three fingers, then mark with ink and cut down to the bone;
and the amount of blood that must be let out is six cups, and possibly a little more or less, depending on what the patient can bear and the fullness of the artery;
then examine the wound: if any portion of the membrane remains on the bone, cut it so that hot swellings do not form there, then compress the wound and bind it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Of migraine When chronic migraine occurs, along with acute catarrh, due to the moisture of tears and heat in the temples, old stubborn congestion, and similar conditions, and it has been treated by various medical remedies to no avail, then we extract the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have described.
And the method of extracting them is that the patient pulls back the hair from their temples and focuses on the artery that is visible in the temple, for it is clearly evident by its pulsing, though it is less visible in some men who are excessively cold.
And if it is not visible, let the patient compress their neck with a cloth, then rub the area with a coarse cloth, and sprinkle the spot with hot water until the artery becomes clearly visible. Then take the spatula of which the shape is as follows: Then lightly peel the skin until you reach the artery, then pull it upward with pincers and carefully separate it from the tissues beneath it on each side.
And if the artery is thin, twist it at the point of the hook, then cut it in that part to the extent of two heads. For if it is not completely cut, the blood will not flow entirely out.
And let out between six cups and three cups of blood.
And if the artery is large, you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread so that putrefaction does not occur before the healing of the wound and the prevention of blood flow.
Then cut the excess portion between the two ties at that very moment, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with a blade-shaped cautery down to the bone so that the heads are completely cut.
And this is the best procedure, provided the patient has no fever and is of a warm temperament. For cauterization helps to eliminate the moisture: Thus, it is of greater help for moisture-related conditions.
Alternatively, for the extraction of arteries, one must fill the area with old cotton and apply well-made tents over it.
And when they are untied, treat with dry medicines that promote flesh growth and with tents until it is healed.
And if blood flows from the artery while you are working on it, quickly stop it by cauterization, or fill the area with vitriol and compress it by hand to staunch the blood. And if you do not have this at hand, place your finger on the spot until the blood coagulates, and sprinkle the area with cold water until the bleeding stops, and compress it as necessary.
And there should be a space of one finger's thickness between the two blades, and then when you have marked the two places with ink, you place the heated iron on them until it reaches the bone and cut the vein in two places. And the cuts should be spaced apart because this cautery does not fully solder the wound.
And this is the shape of the cautery:
And the best and easiest method of artery extraction is to cauterize the vein with this double-edged cutting cautery, but the blades should be quite thick to retain their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it retains its heat less.
Tears When tears from the eyes descend from the veins located on the surface of the head, and no medical cure proves effective, and you see the face of the afflicted redden and feel a trembling sensation in the forehead; and if the eyes are weak and moist such that the hairs of the eyelids have fallen, the eyelids are inflamed and raw from the burning of the tears, then this treatment is needed. The ancients called this "contused cure," and the procedure involves shaving the afflicted's forehead, then making three incisions evenly along the length of the forehead.
The ancients called this "contused cure," and the procedure involves shaving the afflicted's forehead, then making three incisions evenly along the length of the forehead. One incision should be as wide as two fingers in the center of the forehead, descending downward to the nose, and the other two on either side above the eyelids, taking care to avoid cutting the arteries located above the eyelids.
Keep your hand away from the line of the two jaws, and each wound should measure the width of three joined fingers.
Prepare a piece of sponge and several cloths to wipe the blood, then use a sharp spatula on both sides as described:
from the incision near the temple to the second incision; and scrape all the tissue between the two incisions down to the membrane covering the bone, then repeat this from the middle incision to the other side, and then remove the spatula. Then insert into the first incision the instrument called a "knife-blade," which is very sharp on one side and smooth, not sharp, on the other, shaped as follows:
Place the sharp side toward the flesh and membrane, and the smooth side toward the bone, and insert it until it reaches the middle incision.
Cut all the vessels descending from the head to the eyes so that the incision is continuous to the exposed membrane, and then do the same in the middle incision to the other side.
Then remove the blood evenly and press the area to stop the flow.
Then place a tent of old cotton in each incision and cover with cloths soaked in wine, oil, and vinegar, ensuring that hot abscesses do not form.
On the third day, loosen the bandage and administer a large quantity of warm water, then treat the wound with basilicon ointment mixed with rose oil and other remedies for healing wounds until fully healed.
When someone develops an acute cataract regularly, and you see the eyes weak and small, the vision diminished, and the eyelids burnt; and the hairs fall out, there is deep, sharp pain in the head, and the patient sneezes; then understand from these symptoms that this matter and cataract originate from several veins, and the best treatment for it is this.
Instruct the patient to shave their forehead, then make a large incision in the middle of the forehead, and another of about one inch in width. Start the incision from the left temple to the right temple, cutting down to the bone. Keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that lead to the jaw.
Once the bone is exposed, wipe away all the blood with a sponge, then separate the two edges of the incision and insert old cotton and linen tents. Then bandage it with cloths moistened with wine and oil, ensuring that no hot abscesses develop.
When it is removed, you must rub the bone until flesh begins to grow, then treat it with drying agents that help generate flesh.
In this way: Take two parts wheat flour and four parts colophony, and make a plaster. Apply it to these wounds to generate flesh everywhere.
Of the blockage of the ears
Everything that falls into the ears is one of four things: either grains, an insect, a piece of mineral stone or a similar object such as iron; or seeds, such as barley, beans, or peas; or flowing substances such as water and vinegar, or similar materials.
When a stone or another type of object falls into the ear that does not fit or grow there, place the ear in the sunlight.
If you see the stone, drip a small amount of violet oil or sesame oil, then proceed with extraction. Induce sneezing with spices, block the nostrils when the sneezing begins, and place pieces of cloth or wool around the ear. Extend the ear upward.
Many times it comes out through this treatment.
If it does not come out, proceed with extraction using fine pincers shaped as follows:
If it comes out with the pincers, it is good.
If not, perform the extraction with a fine hook with a small curve.
If it still does not come out, make a small brass tube and insert its end firmly into the ear opening, sealing the area around the tube with soft wax so no air can enter alongside the tube. Then pull it out forcefully, as it often comes out as we have said.
If it does not come out this way, take birdlime and place it on an appropriate instrument, wrapping it with a bit of cotton. Press the birdlime onto the stone or object, then pull it out.
If it does not come out through any of these methods, quickly cut the ear before a hot abscess or spasm develops.
The method of incision is to first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and draw blood according to their strength, then seat the patient between your hands, turn their ear upward, and make a small incision at the root of the ear in the fatty or dependent area. Make the incision crescent-shaped until you reach the stone, then remove it to the best of your ability and suck the area quickly with your mouth.
Treat it until it is healed.
If it is a grain inside and it swells, proceed with extraction.
If it cannot come out, use a thin, fine spatula shaped as follows: Make an incision in the grain.
Do not do this if you think the grain is moist from the dampness of the ear, until you have divided it into many pieces.
Then extract it with fine pincers and by suction, as we have described, so the extraction is eased.
For water that falls into the ear, the patient should first use sneezing with spices and fill the ear with old cotton. Lie on the ear itself where the water is. If it comes out this way, it is good.
If not, take several small stones the length of your finger, thin and light, and heat them slightly in the fire. The patient places one stone in the ear opening, stands on one foot, and strikes the stone in the ear with another stone. Continue striking stone against stone until all the water comes out, and it will fully exit this way.
If you wish, take a reed, place one end in the ear, and set the other end on fire until most of the reed is burned.
Repeat this with other reeds until all the water comes out, as we described for the stone.
For extracting an insect, if it is small like a flea or similar, treat it as we described in the earlier section.
If it is large enough to be felt, use pincers for extraction. This is one of the easiest things to remove from the ear.
For extracting worms growing in the ears, if the treatment described in the earlier section and the discussion on distillations does not help, you must inspect the ear in sunlight: If you see worms, remove them with fine pincers, and if none are visible, take a tube shaped as follows:
It should be narrow at the bottom and wide at the top. And place the finest tip into the ear according to the severity of the patient's condition, then suck strongly through the tube. Do this repeatedly until all the worms come out.
And if they do not obey and come out, wrap the tube with cotton as I described in the stone method.
And if they still do not emerge as we have said, administer distillations proven by the ancients for killing worms, and you will find them in the treatise on distillations.
And distill your oils and medicines into the ear with this instrument, the design of which you see here: Let it be made of silver or brass, narrow below with a small opening, and open above for distillation.
And to press the distillation inside, use a well-made brass instrument for this purpose, and if you wish, take a razor and neatly wrap its tip with cotton. Then pour your oil or juice, and whatever medicines you desire, into the tube, and let the tube remain in the ear.
Next, insert the razor with the cotton into the tube, and press gently with your hand until the oil is distilled into the depths of the ear. Let the patient feel it inside, and let the distillation be slightly warmed over a fire before distilling it into the ear. Ensure it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be as effective.
On the obstruction of ears
Some children are born without any opening in their ears.
And this same thing happens in men due to the obstruction of a wound or flesh growth within the ear, and this obstruction sometimes extends deep into the ear so that it cannot be seen.
And sometimes it occurs slightly outside the opening, where it is clearly visible.
An obstruction that occurs deep within and cannot be seen is difficult to cure in many cases, while for one that is visible, you should expose the patient's ear to the sunlight. And look inside: If you see the visible obstruction, work on it with this spatula, the design of which is shown here:
Let it be sharp and cutting at both the front and back, but smooth so as not to harm the ear.
If the obstruction is due to a flesh growth or crust in the ear, hold it with fine pincers and cut it lightly until all the flesh is removed.
If the obstruction is deep within the ear, take a fine, light razor, warm it slightly over a fire, and insert it into the ear canal.
If you detect an obstruction causing the patient discomfort in hearing, pierce lightly and ensure not to damage the nerves of the ear.
Then insert a tent into the ear according to the width of the opening, and moisten it with Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until the wound is healed, or take a tent and moisten it with rose water, then sprinkle it with crushed vitriol.
If you see the ear swollen, you must remove the tent and replace it with another tent moistened with cerate made of rose oil and wax, until the swelling subsides. Then treat it until it is healed.
If bleeding occurs, soak a sponge and cloth in cold water, place it on the ear, and use other treatments from the distillation treatise to stop the bleeding.
These growths that appear on the eyelids, whether moist or dry, should be stretched with tongs and pincers and cut with a spatula at their roots. Then apply crushed vitriol to the spot.
If blood flows, cauterize it with a fine lenticular cautery, and the cautery is more effective after the incision.
And often they return if any part of their roots remains. But when they are cauterized by fire, their roots are burned and do not grow back.
Of hailstones. Often in the membranes of the eyes appear things that resemble hailstones in their shape and hardness, and for this reason, this illness is called "hailstone," and it is an accumulation of thick moisture in the upper and lower membrane. The procedure is as follows:
The procedure is as follows: First, observe whether the hailstone moves from one place to another, which is an easy thing to ascertain.
Then make a wide incision, peel the membrane slightly on each side, take hold of it with forceps, and cut it.
If you cannot cut it without piercing the membrane slightly, it does not harm the patient.
If the incision is large, close it with sutures and treat it until it is healed.
If it is small, do not force it, as the ointment will quickly restore it and generate tissue.
If the hailstone descends inside the ear towards the upper part, invert the membrane, stretch the hailstone with forceps, cut it, and press on both sides.
If the membrane separates due to the incision, this causes no harm.
Once the hailstone is removed, wash the eye with salted water and treat the area with tissue-regenerating medicine until the patient is healed.
Of fat in the eyes. Exinach is a fat that forms in the tissues of the upper membranes, occurring more often in children than in others, greatly troubling their eyes, causing cataracts in the mornings, and making them unable to look at sunlight because tears flow rapidly to their eyes.
For this reason, they often lie face down and sleep on their faces, causing the membranes under their eyebrows to become moist, swollen, and covered with the Exinach visible in the eye. When you press the area with your fingers, you can feel the Exinach between them.
The procedure is that the patient rests their head in your lap.
Then take a linen cloth, prepare a tent in the shape of a circle according to the amount of Exinach present in each part, and place it over the area. Press with your fingers on both sides so that the Exinach is gathered in the center of the circle.
Then, with a sharp spatula, make an incision in the middle of the moisture, wide but no larger than the cut made in ordinary bloodletting.
Cut deep enough through the skin to reach the Exinach. In many cases, the Exinach emerges from the incision as a piece of white fat.
Remove it using a piece of cloth wrapped around your fingers, turning your hand to the right and left until it is entirely extracted.
Take care not to widen the incision or push the spatula down to the eye, as this may cause injury.
If the Exinach does not appear at the start of the incision, slightly enlarge it until it becomes visible.
Then extract it as described, moisten cloths with vinegar and water, place them on the area, and secure them with bandages.
Some practitioners crush salt and apply it to destroy any remaining moisture.
Then treat it until it is healed.
If a hot abscess forms at the site, treat it with soothing plasters until it heals.
Of hairs in the membranes. When unnatural hairs grow in the membranes and become aged, they harm the eyes, causing various conditions such as excessive tearing, softening of the membranes, and whitening of the cornea, ultimately leading to the destruction of the eyes.
The treatment is done in four ways: By cautery with fire, by sharp medicine as explained in the chapter on cautery, by incision and suturing, or by scissors, as I will now describe.
You must place the patient’s head in your lap, then turn the membrane of the eye with your left hand.
If it is turned, that is good. If not, insert a needle with a thread into it. This should be near the edge of the membrane where the hairs grow, next to those hairs; pull the thread upward along with the membrane and turn it with the razor.
Then make an incision underneath the membrane, below the additional hairs, using the cutting spatula, from the large tear duct to the small one.
Then remove the thread and place a small tent of cotton and cloth beneath the membrane; then mark a hook-shaped figure on the membrane, like the leaf of a myrtle, and ensure that the figure matches the amount of membrane you wish to remove, as designated.
Sometimes it is necessary to cut a large amount of the membrane depending on how much the membrane has softened.
Then, with the spatula, cut along the two lines you have marked, starting from the large tear duct to the small one. Let one of the incisions be near the natural hairs, about the thickness of a root; then insert the forceps into one of the two corners of the wound and peel it all away.
Next, bring the two edges together with a suture using a needle and a fine wool thread, wipe away the blood, and burn the excess thread above the two eyebrows with something sticky, if you wish to do so.
If not, do not worry about it, then leave the suture and the threads in place for three or four days.
Then treat the wound without further sutures using drying and binding substances, for the membrane will lift and heal itself with the closure of the wound, but sutures are safer (as the ancients said), and this procedure is without danger. And there is another method:
And there is another method: It is that you mark the membrane with a figure shaped like a myrtle leaf, as we have described, with three separated hooks in the form shown here:
Then cut away the part that protrudes, equally with small tools, following the shape described here:
If you cannot hold the forceps and the matter is uneven, take a needle with a thread and place it in the middle of the figure. Place another thread near the large tear duct and a second thread near the small one, then gather the threads evenly between your fingers.
Then lift your hand evenly, raising all the skin where you have marked, as we have described, then bring the two edges of the wound together with sutures and treat it until it is healed.
If an abscess forms at the incision, soothe it with wax plasters and similar soothing ointments.
Sometimes, the hairs on the membrane are inverted.
In such cases, you must use the incision method we have described.
But the suturing in both cases is more precise.
The treatment with scissors is as follows: You invert the membrane and make an incision within it as I have described, then prepare two scissors with skill and two fine threads as long as the membrane and the width of the spatula. Cut at the two ends of the two sides where you hold the threads.
Then carefully join the two sides over the protruding part of the eye’s membrane and tighten the two scissors firmly on both sides. Leave it like this for a few days, and the skin that was compressed will die, blacken, and decay until it falls away on its own.
If it delays, cut it with some scissors, then treat it until it is healed;
and when the wound is closed, the skin will be smooth, and the hair will not grow back;
and this is the shape of the two incisions you will make according to this figure, and to this length and width:
the process is such that you take a fine needle, and thread it with a soft and fine silk thread; then join the ends and tie them together delicately, and let the length of the thread be one palm long;
then prepare another fine silk thread in the hollow instrument briefly, and tie the ends of the thread;
then the patient places their head in your lap;
and let it be near the sunlight so that the procedure is clearly illuminated, for it is a delicate and fine operation, then insert the needle with the hollow instrument at the root of the attached hair, and pierce through the skin swiftly until you pull it over the natural hair;
then draw the hair up to the hollow instrument, and insert it into the hollow instrument, whether it is one, two, three, or several hairs;
then pull back your hand so that the hairs come out with the hollow instrument through the skin along with the natural hair.
And if the hollow instrument is pulled and the hair does not come out with it, you will pull the hollow instrument underneath with the thread you have prepared, until the hollow instrument emerges from the upper hole and you see it with your eyes;
then you will pull the hollow instrument and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair takes root in its place and flesh grows over it;
and if the hair is short, accompany it with a long natural hair, and lift it with that one or leave it until it is extended, and then remove it.
Of the rotting of the eye When this illness called "aleacrati" or rotting occurs in the eye, there are two types:
one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it occurs due to the closing of a wound, or cutting, or cauterization, and similar causes.
And the method of treatment is that you cut that closure, separate its edges, and place linen pledgets inside, and bind it until it is healed;
and you must not use drying or constricting substances in its treatment. For if you do this, the illness will return worse than before;
but treat it with softening agents, such as fenugreek; and moisten it with water or mallow and linseed cooked together, and ointments of diacylon melted in one of the oils, and wrap a pledget in it, and treat it with this.
And the key to your treatment is to ensure that it does not close in the same way as before;
and this procedure that we have described is merely to prevent this illness from returning in the form it was before.
This disease, which is beneath, is truly called "axacrati," and is both natural and accidental.
The accident arises from a wound, a split, cauterization, and similar things;
and the way of the operation on it is that you take a needle, in which there is a double thread, and pierce it into the flesh, making it go from the left tear duct to the right, so that the thread comes out in two ends from the flesh;
then stretch the flesh above with the needle, and cut it at a width of one spatula. And if the shape of the eyelid returns as it should, that is good;
if not, take a razor and place it in the split, turn the eyelid, and make two splits on the side inside the eyelid;
and let the ends of the two splits meet at the two corners of the incision you have made, forming an angle so that when they are joined, the shape resembles the letter called "Greek I";
then remove that flesh, to the extent its sides are sharp underneath, from what follows the eyelid, then join the two separated parts and sew them with a woolen thread;
then treat it with the softening medicines and tents we have mentioned, until it is healed.
And if the disease comes from a split, a stitch, or cauterization, you must make a full split beneath the hairs of the eyelid, as previously described; then separate between the two edges with a tent, as I have said;
then separate between the two edges with a tent, as I have said; and one must perform the operation according to the form of the disease, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise master prepares with all his skill to restore the shape to its natural form;
and the patient himself, according to what is needed in the work and instruments, in several arrangements.
When this adhesion happens to many men in such a way that the upper eyelid is stuck to the white of the eye and cannot move or perform its natural functions, you must then insert the tip of a razor beneath the eyelid and lift it up;
and stretch it with forceps until you cut what is attached with a subtle spatula, which should not be too sharp or too cutting, so that the patient does not suffer or the overly sharp spatula does not harm the eye;
and let your incision, with which you separate that adhesion, be light, so that the eyelid returns to its natural form;
and all that adhesion is healed, and sometimes they use salty water on the eye, then wash it with fresh water and collyrium;
then place a linen tent between the eyelid and the eye, and put on the eye wool soaked in egg white; and after the third day, use collyrium and soothing remedies until it is healed.
Know that the nail appears in two forms: it is either fibrous and resembles a hard membrane or another that is not fibrous but appears like frozen white moisture, which cannot be grasped with forceps when touched with iron.
Both types start near the large tear duct and grow little by little until they cover the entire sight, light, and movement of the eye.
And the method of incision is that the patient places his head on your chest, then opens his eyes; and lift the eyelid with your hand, then grasp the nail with small, curved forceps and pull it upward; then take a needle and thread it with a horsehair, cowhair, or oxhair, and a strong thread; and slightly bend the tip of the needle, pierce it through the middle of the nail, passing it through entirely, tie the nail with a thread, stretch it upwards, and scrape the edge of the nail that follows the pupil with the thread, all the way to its root; then cut the remaining part at the tear duct root with a fine spatula and small forceps, leaving the natural flesh of the tear duct untouched so that tears may flow as usual.
And sometimes the nail is removed with just the hook and thread, as we have described; then it is scraped entirely with the gentle spatula, whose shape is as follows:
And ensure that the spatula does not touch or tear the fleshy membrane, and that the pupil is not pierced.
After the incision, sprinkle a little crushed salt into the eye and apply collyrium made from litharge, and leave it until the next day. Then treat it with what is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not fibrous, and you cannot insert the needle or use the hook, this type of nail is often treated with medicines.
These grow as I have explained earlier, and if you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye and use a light, slightly sharp spatula as follows: And subtly lift the nail upward, and if you see it thinning and the removal seems close, drop collyrium made from litharge, red collyrium, and crushed salt into the eye from your mouth, and cover the eye until the next day.
If anything interferes in the eye, such as a hot abscess, then leave it and first treat the hot abscess until it is healed, then resume the work as before until it is healed.
Then resume the work according to the same procedure until it is completely removed.
If the appearance of flesh from the tear duct greatly disturbs the eye, suspend it with a hook, cut part of it but not all, so that tears may still flow.
Then drop into the eye red collyrium made from litharge.
In the eyes of some men, red flesh sometimes grows, covering the pupil, constricting the eyelids, turning them outward, and resembling a pomegranate flower.
And the procedure is for the patient to rest his head on your chest, then open his eyes, and grasp all that flesh with suitable hooks, holding it firmly;
then cut the foremost flesh, continuing to cut with a razor until the end, being careful not to injure the eye during the procedure;
and let the incision be made with the spatula as we have described for the nail, and with small forceps, with which the debris is removed, as the shape described after this chapter demonstrates.
And when the incision is complete and all the flesh is removed, fill the eye with crushed salt or drop in red collyrium and similar corrosive medicines, and place cotton soaked in egg white over the eye to protect it from hot abscesses.
If anything remains, and hot blood rises, and you fear a hot abscess, leave the eye and treat the abscess with soothing remedies for hot abscesses.
Then return to your work until it is healed, and proceed similarly whenever flesh accumulates in the eye in this manner.
But nevertheless it is necessary that you alleviate the treatment of each weak eye by the natural method; and by the accidental method, through the use of iron instruments;
and do not place your hand on any of these operations until you see that this member can endure the procedure.
Sebel are red veins that are spread over the eye, and they obstruct vision and weaken the eye permanently.
It is necessary first that you observe whether the eye, in which sebel is present, is strong, and that there is no other disease except for the sebel; then treat it in this manner:
command the patient to place their head against your breast, then tie off those veins with a thread according to your skill, and let the thread be fine and doubled in this way:
And let there be two threads arranged step by step on one body in this way:
then as you treat them, cut those veins subtly, and wipe the blood little by little, until you see those veins moving away from the eye;
and ensure that you do not injure the eye with the tips of the spatulas, and perform this procedure at midday before the sun, and be very precise in your work so that you cut nothing except those veins;
and when you have done this, instill green and red collyrium into the eye to destroy what remains of the sebel.
And if you are unable to complete all of this at that time, then apply a poultice to the eye made of things that soothe the pain of the eyes, and leave it for some days until the pain subsides and there is assurance of no hot abscess, then resume in the way described earlier until it is healed;
and this is the form of the procedures:
The doctors call this fistula "arissati":
when you treat it with cautery and sharp burning medicine as I have described above, and it is not healed, then it is necessary to incise the abscess where it should be opened and draw out all the moisture that is there, until the bone is exposed.
And when the bone is exposed, and you see the corruption and the blackness, then scrape it with the instrument of which this is the form;
and it is called the "rough head," and let it be made of Indian steel with a rounded head, and let it be pointed like a file as it is in this form:
And place it on the area of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that the corruption has been removed;
and do this several times, then restore the area with drying medicines.
if the area is closed, and flesh grows there, and the body of the opening is sealed, and it remains so for forty days, and it does not reopen and does not form an abscess, and no bad conditions occur, know that it is healed;
if not, then there is no other recourse than to bring the fistula back to the opening of the nostril in this way: and this is to expose the bone a second time with iron and sharp medicines, and when it is exposed, take a drill in this form, and let its head be made of iron with three angles, and let its shaft be tapered to the end as you see here:
then place it on the bone near the lacrimal duct, and move your hand a little away from the eye, then turn the drill until it pierces the bone and the patient feels it by the air escaping if they place their hand over their nostril;
and then restore the area with drying medicines as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the area hardens, the matter will go to the nostril; and this is a much easier condition for the patient.
When the eye opens outward entirely and there is no obstruction to the nostril or shrinkage, it is necessary that you bind the patient;
then treat it, then apply cupping glasses to the nape without incision to draw out, then place on the eye a poultice made of acacia, aloe, incense, and sarcocol, and then bind the eye and apply the poultice with bandages and cloths;
and the method of the cloths is that you take sufficiently soft cloths, fold each one in four, and then place them one on top of another according to the quantity needed for the eye;
then bind it tightly over with a firm bandage, and repeat the cupping to draw without incision;
then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bound day and night, and if the binding becomes loose, it is necessary to tighten it further;
then remove the binding after the day and night, and if you see the eye recovering, it is good;
if not; then repeat the poultice, cloths, binding, and cupping until it is healed.
Of the rupture of the uveal membrane When a rupture occurs in the uveal membrane, it opens, and a swelling appears like a grain of resin, and it is frightful to behold;
then if you wish to cut it, the procedure is such that you insert a needle at the root of the lower part up to the upper one, then insert another needle with a doubled thread near the lacrimal area; and pierce it there, and leave the first needle in place according to the arrangement;
then cut the area of the double thread and tie part of the uveal membrane around it, and bind it tightly, then remove the needle and place on the eye wool soaked in egg white;
and leave it until the thread falls off with the uveal membrane, then treat the eye with comforting remedies until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is restrained by the uveal membrane on each side with a ring of cloth, until it is healed.
And if the eye swells significantly, pierce it with a fine spatula that reaches deep into the eye, and drain the albugineous moisture so that the eye settles and reenters immediately;
then bind it until it is healed.
This disease, which is called "alcunnati," is nothing but clouding that gathers in the eye, resembling descending water, but it is not water;
and the method for examining it is to have the patient sit on a prepared and upright seat, then take their head between your two hands, and move it until you see the clouding rise to the surface in your view; then ensure it remains visible, and does not descend, and the light becomes unobstructed, and the patient sees things as they used to;
and if it does not descend below, know that it is water, and if the descent of the clouding is not arranged as we have said.
then make the patient sit between your hands, then take a fine spatula and cut slightly into the corneal membrane along the continuation of the conjunctiva with the corneal membrane and the corona, until the clouding emerges;
and when it has emerged, instill into the eye warm water mixed with honey, or water in which fenugreek has been boiled with honey, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
Of the waters of the eye We have already the descriptions of the waters in their division, and what is necessary to pierce them; thus it is done according to health.
You must seat the patient between your crossed hands, away from the light of the sun, and bind the healthy eye tightly;
then place the eyelid of the eye in your left hand if the eye is the left one, or in your right hand if the eye is the right one;
then take in your right hand, if the eye is the left one, the instrument called "almagda," or in your left hand, if the eye is the right one;
then place the point of the instrument beside the crown by the width of a hair in the whiteness of the eye at the part of the lesser tear duct, then press the instrument called "almagda" skillfully, and turn your hand until it pierces the whiteness of the eye, and feel that the almagda reaches the empty space;
and it is necessary that the depth of the almagda's path be the same as the space from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and this is the crown of the eye;
thus you will see the membrane in that place due to the clarity of the corneal layer, and you can insert the instrument to where the water is, then expel it one pathway after another.
If the water descends immediately, the patient sees before themself and the instrument in their eye.
Then let them rest a little, and if the water rises again, apply force with the instrument, and when it is fixed inside and does not rise, withdraw the almagda lightly while turning your hand little by little;
and then place a bit of powdered gem salt in the water, and rinse the eye with it inside. Then place outside the eye cotton or wool soaked in rose oil and egg white, and bind it with the healthy eye.
We, and those of our time, apply crushed cumin with egg white.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye due to its hardness, for there are some people whose eyes are too hard, you must take the instrument called "alberit," whose shape is as follows:
And pierce only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a subtle opening, then insert the almagda, as we have said;
and at the completion of the procedure, prepare a suitable bed for the patient, where they may sleep on their back in a dark place;
and let them be deprived of all movements, take light food, and not move their head either to the right or the left, and let them be bound according to their condition until the third day;
then unbind them in the same dark house, test their vision, and make them see some objects, and then reapply the binding until the seventh day;
and it is not necessary for you to do this during the treatment or immediately after the incision, but you must alleviate it, for the water rises quickly.
If hot abscesses appear, unbind the eye before the seventh day, and treat it with something that soothes abscesses;
and when it is calmed, unbind the vision and place a small cloth on the face to cover it from light, and let them remain in that dark house.
And then leave the house little by little, and return to their usual activities;
and know that no disciples should meddle in this matter. And one came to us from Iraq, who told us that in their country they performed a pierced almagda, through which the water is drawn out, but I never saw such a thing in our land, nor did I ever read it in the books of the ancients; and perhaps it is a new invention.
And these are the likenesses of the forms of the almagda, so that those who do not know them may see them;
and let them be made properly of bronze: And let their heads have the same subtlety, and their ends be in three sharp angles.
Sometimes various types of flesh grow on the nose, some of which resemble scorpions with many legs;
and there are those where the flesh is ulcerated with a reddish color, and others with soft flesh of good color. In the case of soft flesh that is not ulcerated, you must seat the patient between your hands facing the sun;
In the case of soft flesh that is not ulcerated, you must seat the patient between your hands facing the sun; and open their nostrils, apply the salve to the flesh, and extract it; then cut away what you can safely handle with a subtle, sharp spatumile, until you are sure that all the flesh is removed.
And if anything remains that cannot be cut, gently open it with a delicate instrument, so that nothing is left. And if excessive bleeding or a hot abscess occurs, treat it as necessary;
And if it is a malignant abscess, act quickly and cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then pour vinegar and water or wine into the nose. If the nose opens, and moisture flows down to the palate, know that it is healed;
and if moisture does not flow as it should, know that flesh has grown on the underlying bone, which the instrument cannot reach to cut.
Then you must insert a slightly thick linen thread, knotted at short intervals, with each knot spaced about a finger's width or less. The patient must place the end of the thread in their nostril as best as they can and pull it while inhaling until it comes through the nose into the mouth.
This is often done by schoolchildren, and it is an easy thing for anyone willing to do it.
Then hold the end coming out of the nose in one hand and the other end from the mouth in the other hand, and rub them alternately over the knots in the thread.
Do this until you know the knots have broken down the flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe away the blood, moisten the thread with Egyptian ointment, and reinsert it into the nose as before.
Do this for three days or more until the ointment corrodes all the remaining flesh.
Then place a lead tube in the nose for some days until it is healed, and if drying medicines are needed, use them.
This is the shape of the instrument used to purge the head, through which oils and medicines are distilled into the nose:
It should be made of silver or bronze, resembling an open lamp, shaped like a tube, with similar conduits.
And if you wish, make a closed tube, and let the instrument be ready for purging the head.
It should have a handle at the top to hold it while heating the oil or other liquid.
Of the flesh on the nose
Sometimes a condition called "telul" appears at the tip of the nose, growing larger over time until it becomes visible and unsightly.
Therefore, you must cut it at the beginning and remove it completely, then apply a cautery or a burning medicine to the area.
And if cutting is delayed until it becomes large, check whether it is hard, reddish in color, and poorly textured:
If so, do not touch it with iron, for it is an ulcerated abscess, and cutting it sometimes brings great harm to the patient.
But if the abscess is soft to the touch, not reddish in color, and you see that it can be entirely cut, empty the patient and cut it without fear, then treat the area with drying and astringent substances.
Know that when a discontinuity occurs in one of these complex cartilages, it rarely heals, except in some people.
Thus, when this happens to someone, you must check if the wound is fresh with all its blood. Then join the two edges with a suture and treat it until it heals.
And if the edges are already separated on both sides, you must scrape all parts of their surface until they bleed, then join the two edges with a suture, tighten it, and sprinkle it with powdered dragon's blood and ground incense. Place over the powders a piece of strong plaster or another adhesive plaster, and leave it until it falls off by itself, then treat it with ointment until it heals.
The method of suturing is that you join the discontinuity: Either with needles, as we described for abdominal sutures; Or with thread, as I have explained to you.
On abscesses of the lips.
Many people develop hard abscesses inside the lips, resembling vetch seeds, sometimes smaller, sometimes larger.
Then you must turn the lips, incise each node, grab it with forceps, and cut it into pieces.
Then fill the site of the incision with powdered vitriol until the bleeding stops.
Then wash it with vinegar and treat the area with drying agents until it heals.
Often, flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients called "albulus."
You must hold it with forceps, cut it at its root, and let the pus or blood flow.
Then apply powdered vitriol or other astringent and drying powders to the site.
And if that flesh grows back after the incision, as often happens, cut it again and cauterize it. It does not grow back after cauterization.
Sometimes, ugly and rough crusts accumulate on the crowns of the teeth, inside the mouth, between the gums. Sometimes the teeth are black, yellowish, or green, to the point where the decay spreads to the gums, and the teeth become foul-smelling.
You must seat the patient between your hands, with his head in your lap, and scrape the teeth until the crusts are entirely removed. Do the same with the blackness, the greenness, the yellowness, and other stains, until they are cleaned.
If you remove it all at the first scraping, it is good. If not, start again on the second and third days, until you have completely scraped it away.
Know that teeth require various forms of instruments for scraping, depending on what the work demands, because scrapers for the outer surfaces of teeth have different shapes from those used between the teeth. Have these and other forms ready with you.
When treating a tooth for pain, you must delay extraction as long as possible, because it should not be done hastily. For it is a very precious substance, and until then there is no justification for scraping.
So when the patient is forced to extract a tooth, you must be certain of which tooth is causing the pain. Often, the pain deceives the patient, who thinks it is in a healthy tooth and has a good tooth extracted. Yet the pain does not cease until the diseased one is removed, for we have often seen this with noblemen.
When you are certain of the painful tooth, you must scrape around the tooth with a sharp spatula to protect the gum on all sides.
Then move it with your fingers or fine forceps, little by little, until it is well loosened, then firmly secure the forceps. Let the patient’s head rest in your lap between your knees, and hold him steady so that he does not move.
Afterward, extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it does not come out at first, take one of these instruments, insert it gently on each side, and move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is pierced and decayed, you must fill it with cloth where the holes are. And tighten it gently with forceps so that it does not break under the pressure.
You must work very carefully around the gum to loosen the tooth.
Take care not to break it, leaving a piece behind, which could cause the patient even greater pain than before because of the malice of the root.
Beware not to act like ignorant practitioners, who through haste and recklessness sometimes break the tooth, failing to apply what we have described.
Instead, they sometimes cause great illness due to roots left behind or the broken tooth, as we have often seen.
When the tooth is extracted, wash the site with wine, vinegar, and salt.
If there is bleeding, as often happens, fill the site with powdered vitriol.
And if that does not work, cauterize it.
The forms of the instruments used to loosen the teeth first must have long points and thick handles so that they do not bend when extracting the tooth.
And these are their forms: They must be robust so that they do not bend during extraction, made of well-crafted steel, and toothed to hold firmly.
On the roots of teeth. When the root remains after extraction, you must place cotton soaked in butter on the site for one or two days until it softens, then use the forceps called "algefri," whose head resembles a bird's beak.
They should have an interior made like a file, and this is their form:
If the roots do not come out with these forceps, you must uncover the flesh entirely around the root and use the instrument called "althali," which is a lever, and this is its form:
It must be strong and thick so that it does not break, and if the root comes out with it, that is good.
If not, use all the instruments, whose forms are shown hereafter:
And use this instrument, which has two prongs, whose form is as follows: And other tools used earlier for the treatment of teeth, and this instrument resembling large forceps, whose form is as follows:
This instrument must be strong so that it does not break, and know that there are many tools for teeth. Likewise, there are other tools not listed here.
A wise and skilled master devises his own tools according to what his work and the diseases show him, for there are conditions for which the ancients did not specify instruments due to their diversity. If part of the tooth or other bones breaks or rots, search for the appropriate instruments, as I have told you, and use gestures, whose form is as follows:
They must be robust and firm to hold the bone so that it does not slip but can be held and removed.
Then restore the site with appropriate medicines, and if there is a small amount of rot in the bone, scrape it with this instrument.
When a tooth appears out of alignment with the natural body, and its form is unsightly, especially in young women, you must determine whether the tooth has grown after the others and is not in the correct position and cannot be filed or ground down.
Then it must be removed. And if it is loose alongside the tooth, take this instrument, whose form is as follows, resembling a small beak and made of sharp steel at the tip.
And cut it little by little over several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that you do not move the others; and if it is apparent that it can be filed, file it with a file shaped like this:
and it is like the file used to make needles;
and file the tooth little by little over several days gently, so that it does not move until it falls;
then smooth it in the end with a rasp, and if the tooth is too sharp and injures the tongue, it is necessary to file its roughness until it is even, so that it neither injures the tongue nor disrupts speech.
When the front teeth are loose, either from a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot bite down on what they eat without them falling, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and that is not enough;
then it is necessary to restrain them with a gold wire, for silver wire turns green and rots, but gold does not change at all;
and let the wire be moderate, neither too thick nor too thin, according to the size of the space between the teeth;
and if you want to align the teeth, take the wire and insert it doubled between the two healthy teeth, then place the ends between the loose teeth, if there is one or several, until you carefully reach the healthy tooth on the other side; then begin again the wrapping up to the part where you started, and tighten your hand subtly and carefully, so that it does not move at all;
and let your binding be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot come loose.
Then cut the ends of the wire with pincers, assemble them, and push them between the healthy teeth, placing them so that they do not injure the tongue;
and then leave it tightened like this as long as it can hold, and if it loosens or the wire breaks, tighten it again with another wire;
so it will remain and serve like this for all its time, and this is the form of the teeth and the arrangement of the two healthy teeth and the two loose ones, as you see:
And when the tooth falls, put it back in its place, as fresh as possible, just as we have said;
and let no one intervene who is not wise and patient, and sometimes one makes the shape of a tooth from cow bone, places it where the missing one was, and binds it as we have said, and it stays and serves for a long time like this.
Sometimes there is this tie beneath the tongue that is natural, and one is born like this; or from the accident of a wound that has fused;
and the operation is such that you open the patient’s mouth, place their head in your lap, and lift their tongue;
then cut the fibrous tie broadly, so that the tongue is freed from its attachment, and if there is hardness or a knot, and it is from a fused wound, use a hook and cut broadly at that attachment;
and be careful that the incision is not too deep, because of the artery underneath;
and when you have finished, wash the area with rose water and vinegar, or cold water, then place under the tongue a linen tent;
and let the patient keep it there every night, so that the area does not fuse.
And if a flow of blood occurs, place powdered vitriol on the area; and if the blood overwhelms you, cauterize it with a speckled cautery iron, which is good for this; then treat it with other remedies until it is healed,
and if you see it as reddish, black, or hard, and the patient does not feel it, do not touch it, for it is a chancre;
and if it tends toward whiteness, and there is moisture, apply a hook to it, open it with a fine spatula, and free it on both sides; and if blood overwhelms you during the procedure, place powdered vitriol on it until it is staunched, then return to your work until you have removed all the pus;
then wash the area with vinegar and brine, and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
Of the abscesses of the throat Sometimes lumps appear in the throat, called "godath," properly referred to as the two tonsils, and when you treat them as we described in the section on cutting, and they do not heal, take heed:
if it is a hard abscess of little size and reddish color, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is swollen, do not touch it with iron, also because of the risk of bleeding; but leave it until it matures, and then you will open it, or it will rupture on its own.
And if it is of white rounded color and the root is delicate, prepare the instrument for cutting, but first ensure that the hot abscess is resting and calmed.
Then have the patient sit in front of the sun, their head in your lap, open their mouth, have the assistant hold them with their hands, and press down the tongue with the instrument, shaped as follows:
and let it be of fine silver or bronze, shaped like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument and see the abscess, take a hook and insert it into the tonsil, and pull it upward as much as you can;
and pull some tissue with it, then cut it with the instrument shaped like this, resembling forceps; and both ends are curved, one facing the other, very sharp, and made of Indian or Andalusian steel:
And if you do not have this instrument available, cut it with pincers, shaped as follows: And let it be sharp on one side, and not on the other;
and when you have cut one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision, have the patient gargle with warm water, and water with vinegar, and if bleeding occurs, have the patient gargle water, or boiled pomegranate rinds, or myrtle leaves, and similar substances, until the bleeding stops; then treat it until it heals;
and sometimes other abscesses form in the throat beyond the two tonsils, then cut them just as you would the two tonsils.
And I treated a woman for an abscess that had formed in her throat, namely a small abscess;
and it had nearly closed her entire throat, so that the woman could not breathe because her airway was blocked, and she could neither eat nor drink, and she would have died if she had remained like this for one or two days.
And the abscess had swollen so much that it had forced out two branches through the two openings of her nose.
I hastened immediately, inserted a hook into one nostril, then pulled it out, and extracted a large amount of pus;
then I did the same in the other nostril, opened her mouth, and pressed down her tongue;
afterward, I inserted the hook into the abscesses and cut a part of them, and only a little blood came out; and thus the woman’s airway was unblocked, and she began immediately to drink water and then wine, and I did not stop cutting at that abscess over a long time;
and the abscess kept regrowing and refilling the space I had emptied, until it became very large again;
then I pierced it and cauterized it inside the throat: thus it remained without growing;
and I left that region, and I do not know what God did for her after me.
Of the uvula
When rheum descends to the uvula, and it is swollen and elongated, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is swollen and round below, it is called "uvula."
When it has been treated as we described in the section on cutting, and the treatment does not help, and you see that the hot abscess has calmed and it is delicate, then it is necessary to cut it;
and this one, which is round, compact, and not elongated; and if it is red, reddish, or black, you must avoid cutting it. For there is great danger to the patient.
It is necessary, therefore, when you see it, according to the manner I have described, concerning its whiteness and length, to seat the patient facing the sun and press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned earlier; then insert the hook into the uvula, draw it down, and cut it with one of the two instruments I mentioned in the incision of the tonsils.
And it is necessary that you cut nothing but the excess that goes beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, it will harm the voice and speech;
and after the incision, use what we have described in the incision of the tonsils and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient fears the cutting, then you must use a device for cauterization to alleviate their fear.
And the method of cauterization is very precise. And the patient must rest his head on your chest, then you press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and prepare it with hot quicksilver water, ensuring it is neither too thick nor too clear; and fill the tip of this instrument, which is of the following form:
And at the tip there is a cavity where the medicine is placed, similar to the tip of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine upon the uvula;
and the patient should lie on his side so that saliva and mucus flow from his mouth along with the medicine, preventing it from descending into the throat and causing harm;
then hold your hand with the medicine and press it upon the uvula for half an hour until you see it blackened and the stinging of the medicine has subsided;
and if you wish, take cotton, wrap it around an instrument, soak the cotton in the medicine, and place the instrument with the cotton above the uvula so that the cotton adheres to it;
and do this often until the cauterization is complete, then let it dry, and it will fall off after four or five days.
And if it is necessary to restart the cauterization with the medicine, then restart it, and after the cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton dipped in butter, and clean what surrounds the medicine;
and it should be moistened with cold water and treated with gargles until it is healed.
This treatment is safer than incision and cauterization;
if it is treated with fumigation in this manner, take calamint, hyssop, oregano, rue, chamomile, oats, and similar herbs, and gather them all or some of them in a pot, add garlic, and bring to a boil;
and the pot should be well sealed and made of strong clay, and in the middle of the pot there should be an instrument head shaped in this manner: And it should be made of silver or brass, and one of its ends should be placed in the patient’s mouth so that the vapor rises to the uvula through the tube, until the uvula is desensitized;
then repeat this often until the uvula dries, and ensure that you do not perform this at the beginning of the arrival of a hot abscess, as many complications may arise; and this should only be done during the decline of the hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not available, take a tube and insert into its tip an eggshell so that the patient’s mouth does not become too hot; for the eggshell prevents the vapor from harming the mouth, and this is a good and safe treatment.
Many times, a bone or fish spine, or some other object, gets stuck in the throat;
so you must extract what you can see, pressing the tongue in the sunlight with the instrument, so that you can locate the object;
and for what you cannot see and is lodged in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach; perhaps the lodged object will emerge through vomiting;
or the patient should swallow a piece of sponge, a piece of navelwort, a lettuce root, or a morsel of dry bread; and tie a thread to the sponge and have them swallow it; and when it reaches the spot, it will adhere, and then you will pull it out;
and if it does not come out with what we have described, then take a lead instrument shaped as follows:
And let the instrument be curved at the tip so that it can enter the throat more easily, and let the tip be elevated; and ensure that you do not touch the epiglottis to avoid causing coughing, and do not push the bone further inward;
and better yet, let the patient himself guide the instrument, so that he can target where the object is lodged; then push it down, or pull it out evenly with the instrument, until it is removed.
Concerning the leech in the throat
Sometimes the leech is treated, as I have said in the division, through medicinal cures; and when this does not work, then inspect the throat of the patient in the sunlight, after pressing his tongue with the instrument I have described to you.
And if you see the leech, remove it with a small hook or with fine pincers suitable for this purpose.
And if this does not work, take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient’s throat, then place a hot iron at the end of the tube, and do this repeatedly. And have the patient avoid drinking water all day.
Then take a full glass of cold water, open his mouth, pour it in without swallowing, and move it around with his hand often; and as soon as the leech senses the water, it will fall off.
And if it does not fall off as we have described, fumigate the patient with asafoetida using the instrument I described for fumigating the uvula;
Do this many times, as the leech will soon fall.
And the method of fumigation is to take a pot containing live coals, cover the pot with a lid pierced in the middle, and in this hole place the end of the instrument;
then add the fumigation, and the patient places the end of the tube in his mouth, closing his mouth so that the smoke does not escape but instead reaches the leech;
and the leech will fall immediately, and if it does not, repeat the fumigation many times;
and have the patient endure thirst, eat salty and pungent things, and refrain from drinking water;
and then it will be necessary for the leech to be expelled by this procedure.
And the shape of the instrument used to extract the leech, when it can be seen, is like curved pincers designed to enter the throat; and it resembles the beak of a swan, with a rough texture like a file, so that whatever it grips, it cannot let go;
There are many types of abscesses, as described later in this book, differing in perforation and cutting;
and these fall into two categories: one that retains its form and moisture.
And the second type depends on the location they occupy in the body.
For an abscess in the head differs from one in the fundament, and an abscess in fleshy areas differs from one near joints, and each requires its specific treatment.
And there are abscesses that should not be pierced until the pus is mature according to its completion;
and there are those that must be pierced when they are ripe, and do not mature according to their completion, such as abscesses near the joints.
For when abscesses form near joints, and they are left until they decay around them, the ligaments and nerves of the joint may become damaged, which causes contraction in that limb.
Or the abscess is near a vital organ, and if you delay the piercing until it is mature, it will harm the vital organ;
or it is near the base, and it must be pierced before it matures;
and you must not pierce a ripe abscess without completed digestion, except for one near the base, so that it does not rot deeply, spread within, and form a fistula; and it cannot heal for a long time.
And you must know the proper time to pierce an abscess that is mature according to its completion, which is when the pain has subsided, the fever has diminished, the pain and redness have lessened, along with the swelling and hardening at the head of the abscess, and the other signs;
and you must place the piercing at the lowest point of the abscess, where it appears most swollen;
and the piercing should align with the body’s length, whether the abscess is on the hands or feet, or near joints, nerves, and arteries, and in all places where there is no curvature. In those that curve, according to the contour of that limb.
And when the abscess is in a fleshy area, it is better to wait for the piercing until it is established with completed digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the body will be spread with its venom and filled with much filth; and perhaps its edges and depth will harden.
And there are some abscesses that are pierced across the breadth of the body, according to what the limbs require.
And you must administer small openings for small abscesses; and for large abscesses, large openings, and multiple cuts according to the size of the abscess;
and there are abscesses where the core must be exposed and cut; when it has already become like a strip of cloth and is lifeless, it must be treated as one does with carbuncles:
and there are some that are split into three angles, and others that are cut like the leaf of myrtle, such as abscesses of boils;
and there are others where a round incision is made, and other cuts and similar shapes.
Those that have no head, such as soft superficial abscesses, must be pierced fully;
and when the abscess is large and has accumulated much pus, and you pierce it, you must not extract all the pus at once, but only a part; then plug the abscess until the next day, then extract some more again; do this many times, little by little, until all the pus is expelled;
especially if the patient is of weak strength, a pregnant woman, a small child, or an elderly decrepit man. For the spirit sometimes departs with the expulsion of the pus, and the patient may die without you noticing.
Avoid, therefore, this step with great caution, and when you have pierced the abscess, wipe the wound and check if the abscess wound is small; and if it is a full incision, administer linen or old cotton wicks; and if it is a large abscess with many openings, you must place a wick in each one so they meet each other;
and if you have cut part of the skin in the abscess and exposed it around, you must fill it with old cotton or scraps of linen without moisture, and bind it until the third day;
then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if a flow of blood occurs during your procedure, administer cold water and vinegar, soak a cloth, and place it over the bleeding area several times.
And if the flow of blood persists, apply care and management, and use the powders I have mentioned in various places in this book; and if it is winter, and the area or the abscess is very sensitive, you must apply tents and cloths soaked in hot wine and oil.
And if it is summer, and the area is fleshy, you must apply cloths soaked in water and oil, or in cold wine and oil, until the third day, as we have said.
Then open the abscess, clean and treat it as required, until it is healed.
And this must be universally understood in the treatment of abscesses:
Now I have told you how to proceed with the treatment of abscesses, and here is the chapter.
On the surface of the head, small abscesses appear, and they are like knots in cloth, resembling the yolk of an egg, with many similar forms.
Some are fatty, and some have moisture like pus.
And there are some that are hard and stony when cut, and there is no doubt unless the artery is affected.
And the process of cutting requires that you test with an instrument called a "trocar," the shape of which is described below, to determine what it contains.
For if it contains moisture, you make an incision lengthwise above it.
And when the moisture has been emptied, scrape without leaving any of the skin that held that moisture, for it will return if anything is left behind.
Then dip cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is available. If not, in water and salt, and use it to fill the wound, leaving it until the next day. And this will expel what remained overnight.
And then repeat the cotton treatment, as before, on the second and third day, until you are sure nothing remains from the night.
Then treat the wound with suitable ointments until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty matter, cut it in this form, lengthwise. And apply your ointments, scrape it from all sides, and focus your care on removing the layer where it lies.
And if the artery causes you trouble, do what I have told you later.
And do the same for the abscess if it is stony, cutting and treating it as I have instructed.
And cutting a stony or moist abscess is easier, as they contain little blood. And there are some abscesses on the head with no moisture, such as one I cut from the head of an old woman.
And I found the abscess to be like a heavy stone, rough and white, and it could not be broken. And if one struck it, it would cause a wound as if from a stone.
In other abscesses appearing on the head, except those that arise on children’s heads or near the roots of the ears, the incision must always be made at the lowest point to let the pus flow out.
And treat them as required.
Many times, these abscesses occur on the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes appear elsewhere on the body; they are numerous and often interconnected.
And each scrofula is properly contained within its own layer, like the swellings and abscesses of the head, as we have mentioned. And the appearances of these scrofula are many.
And the appearances of these scrofula are many. There are some that contain moisture, and there are malignant ones that refuse to heal.
In those that you see are well-disposed to the touch, resembling the color of the body, movable in all directions, and not connected to the nerves of the neck, nor to the artery, nor to the conduit, and are not deep;
Then you must cut it from above, and peel it from all sides, and stretch the two lips of the wound with hooks, if you need them, as we have said about abscesses of the head.
And remove it little by little, being sure not to cut the nerve or the vein, and ensure that the knife is neither too sharp nor too cutting, so that the hand does not slip or go too far, to avoid cutting what should not be cut.
And if you cut the vein or the artery, and this prevents you from working, apply crushed vitriol or some powders that staunch blood, and compress the wound. And leave it until the abscess subsides, the wound softens, and begins to suppurate.
And when the bleeding has stopped, return to your work until it is completed.
Then, use your index finger to check if any small scrofula remain, and if so, cut and clean them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, you must not cut the scrofula at its root but tie it with a strong double thread and let it fall off on its own without causing harm.
Then fill the wound with old cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, and treat it.
And if you cut out the entire scrofula, you must bring together the two lips of the wound, sew them immediately, ensuring there is no excess flesh remaining due to the size of the scrofula. You must ensure to cut its root, extract it fully, and sew it as we have described.
You must ensure to cut its root, extract it fully, and sew it as we have described. Those scrofula that contain excess fluid should be pierced where they appear ripe.
Pierce it as described earlier, depending on its state, then administer wicks with ointment and similar substances so that it destroys what remains of the corruption. And when the wound is well cleaned, treat it with ointments that regenerate flesh until it heals.
The ancients spoke and wrote about the incision of the throat. But I have never seen anyone in our land perform it, and these are the writings of their words.
For those who have quinsy, it is necessary that the opening in the throat, called the "epiglottis," be cut. And help is not made through this because all the veins and lungs of the patient are affected when they have a hot abscess in the mouth, the throat, or the tonsils.
When the illness is in the channel of the lungs, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to prevent the death caused by strangulation.
Therefore, when we want to split the epiglottis, we must make a small transverse incision under the third or fourth ring, between the two rings, or to the extent of the incision in the membrane, but not into the cartilage.
And this spot is suitable for the section of the epiglottis because there is no flesh there, and the vessels are distant.
And if the practitioner is hesitant, he must stretch the skin of the throat with a hook, then cut the tissue until he reaches the channel. And avoid the blood vessels if you see any, and then cut the membrane, as we have described.
And the cutting is evident by the discharge of phlegm from the channel that escapes through the broken area and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for a while.
And when the time has passed during which one fears strangulation, bring together the two lips of the wound of the heart, and sew it entirely without the cartilage;
then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Albucasim says that this should not be done until the throat is completely obstructed, and the patient is judged to be dying, and breath fails him. Then one cuts the epiglottis because the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death;
and for this, the ancients recommended leaving the wound open until the severity of the illness has passed, which occurs in three or four days.  Then they recommended sewing the wound and treating it until it was healed;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw a young woman take a knife, drive it into her throat, and cut part of the bronchial tubes;
and I was called to treat her, and I found her as if dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood that had flowed from it, and I knew well that she had cut neither a vein nor a vessel other than the throat, and the air was escaping through the wound.
I hastened, and sewed the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and nothing happened to the young woman except that her voice was hoarse, and she later returned to her normal state;
therefore, I say that one should not fear the cutting of the epiglottis.
This swelling is called "hernia of the throat," and it is a large swelling, the color of a jasper, and is very common in women;
and it occurs in two forms: natural, and accidental;
the natural one has no remedy.
And the accidental one is of two kinds, one resembling fatty nodes, and the other resembling a swelling that comes from a node of an artery; and there is fear, and one should only operate on the small ones, testing and probing it with the introducer: if you find it like a fatty node, and it is not attached to any vein, then cut it as one cuts nodes, and remove it with its covering, if it has one; and examine everything well, and treat it as is necessary, until it is completely healed.
There are many kinds of nodes, of which I will describe all the forms;
and now I must explain all the differences between a node and a discharge.
I say that a discharge involves heat and accompanying fever, until the inflammation subsides, and the putrefaction is complete; then the fever and the heat cease.
With a node, there is neither heat, fever, nor pain, and it contains a membrane, which is its own sac and is the color of the body, beginning like a jasper, and becoming large;
and they are of two types, either fatty or moist, and of many colors, as I mentioned in the classification.
It is necessary, when you come to the treatment of a node, to test and examine it first with the instrument called the “introducer,” as its form will be explained in the following chapter.
And the method of examining swellings of the nodes is to take the moistest part you find in the swelling, and rotate your fingers little by little, until you know that the instrument has pierced the core, according to the size of the swelling;
then remove the introducer, and observe what flows out.
If flowing moisture runs out, note its color, and incise it as I described for other swellings;
and if no moisture comes out after the introducer, know that it is fatty, so cut it in a cross, take it with pincers, and gently strip it on each side, and ensure the coat where it lies is extracted intact with the node;
and if you cannot extract it intact, then remove it piece by piece until nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the node will return many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood troubles you, fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, compress the wound, and apply soothing poultices to the swelling, and treat it with other remedies until it is healed;
and if the node is large, sew the two lips of the wound and treat it with what generates flesh.
and if the beating vein or something else troubles you, hurry and fill the area with crushed vitriol, and leave it covered for two or three days, until the wound festers and the blood's inflammation subsides; then return to cutting away what remains of the node.
Here are the forms of introducer instruments, and they are of three types: large, medium, and small;
and there are three square ones called "albaret," and one called "breb," and these come in three types: large, medium, and small, for examining fistula swellings;
and they are like the needles used to sew tendons, and they are made of yellow brass, or iron, or silver, and those of yellow brass are preferable, and black lead is better tested for probing the curves of fistulas;
and they are of three types: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the opening.
The forms of hooks are of many types, as you see here:
and there are hooks with two curves of three types as well;
and there are hooks with three curves, and these also come in three types;
and there are hooks with two curves, and hooks with only one curve, and these come in three types;
and all of these are necessary for their respective uses.
The heads of those used for cutting are sharp, and there are some that cut only on one side, with which nodes are stripped, to avoid cutting veins or nerves;
and some of these introducers have blades set in handles, so the patient does not notice during the opening of swellings;
and they are of three types: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and they are used only on fleshy areas, such as the legs, arms, breasts, groin, and similar places;
and sometimes one makes another small instrument, resembling pistachio shells, in this form, used to stop bleeding: and it is sometimes placed on the area bleeding from the cutting of veins and arteries, and sometimes it is used in this larger form:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to become corrupted, until they resemble women's breasts;
and they remain unsightly and swollen, and anyone who wishes to treat them must incise them following this form from line .b. to line .g.: then strip the fat, fill the wound with medicine that generates flesh, then bring together the two lips of the wound with stitching, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast slopes downward and is softened due to its size, as happens with women, make two incisions on the top, with two similar cuts; one of which should meet the other at the ends, so that the larger line contains the smaller one, following this form, from line .b. to line .g.; then strip the skin between the two lips, remove the fat, and apply what we have mentioned about stitching and powders, and what is necessary for the treatment, until it is healed;
and if it does not heal, or the incision is not completely made because the patient refuses to rest, or because of the flow of blood, you must fill the wound with cotton soaked in a corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remainder and the fat, then treat it until it is healed.
These abscesses that arise under the armpits are types of hard scrofula with ridges, and there are some that contain moisture.
Thus, those that contain moisture must be cut in this manner, from line .b. to line .g.: And when all the pus that is in the abscess is emptied, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat it with an appropriate ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess resembles scrofula, cut it as we have explained in the incisions for scrofula, and if the wound releases pus, apply cauterization as we have described earlier.
When the artery is ruptured, and the skin above it is closed, abscesses often form, and the same happens with a swollen and abscessed vein.
And it can be recognized when it is due to the artery, as the abscess is long and deep. And when you feel it with your fingers, you sense a constriction.
And when it is due to the vein, there are apparent red streaks.
And it is folly to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits, in the groin, on the neck, or in many other places, and it is very large. Thus, one must avoid using a knife for treatment, and this must also be avoided for one at the head, while for one caused by artery swelling, cut along the skin lengthwise.
Then open the incision with hooks, and carefully separate the artery from the tissues until it is exposed.
Then insert a needle beneath it, and pierce it through to the other side, and tie the artery tightly in two places with a double thread, as I have instructed you in the extraction of the two arteries in the temples.
Then pierce the area between the two ties with a trocar until the blood contained therein is released, and the abscess is emptied.
Then apply the treatment that prevents the generation of pus, until the ties fall off. Then treat it with an appropriate ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is due to the incision of the vein, you must grasp with your hand as much of the abscess and skin as you can, then insert the needle under the area you are holding, and pierce it, passing through a double thread so that it comes out on the other side. Then tie the abscess, as I have told you, with a tie at one of the two ends of the thread.
And if you fear that the thread may come loose, insert another needle with a thread beneath the entire abscess at the incision of the first needle, and tighten the threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess so that the excess flows out, then cut the excess from the core and leave what is tied.
Then place a small cloth moistened with wine and oil on it, and administer treatments with wicks and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses occur in arteries and veins, abscesses occur in nerves when they are injured, or from excessive strain, and similar causes.
And this happens more often in the wrists, fingers, and in all places with joints, and it is a serious abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and it is in many cases without pain.
And when it is pressed firmly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep within the body but beneath the skin.
And it moves easily in all directions and does not go forward or backward, nor below nor above, and the one that is in joints must not be cut with a knife. For contraction could result. And for one that is in the head or forehead, cut the skin with a spatula.
And for one that is in the head or forehead, cut the skin with a spatula. If the abscess is small, hold it with forceps and cut it at its root.
And if it is large, suspend it with a hook, skin it, then remove it and close the wound with sutures, and treat it until it is healed.
Sometimes it occurs on the belly and nowhere else, this "fungus," and it is a condition called "funge" because of its resemblance to mushrooms, with thin roots and a large head.
And there are small ones and very large ones.
And I saw a man who had two on his belly that resembled mushrooms more than anything else, and there was no difference between them; they were white, had fine roots, were already split, and constantly oozed moisture.
I cut them and found that one weighed eighteen ounces, and the other six; and the procedure in the incision is such that you must observe whether the growth is moist, and whether the color of the lump is white, moist, and has fine roots. Cut it with a broad spatula, and have the cautery heated in the fire ready before you.
Cut it with a broad spatula, and have the cautery heated in the fire ready before you. For during the cutting, there often comes too great a flow of blood, and if the bleeding overwhelms you, hasten to cauterize it.
And if you see the patient frightened and fearful of the incision with the knife, take a well-made lead thread, tie it around the lump as we have described, and leave it for two days.
Then tighten it further, and continue tightening the lead thread until it cuts through the lump, which will fall off on its own without effort.
And if the roots are thick, cutting is dangerous, especially on the belly, but you can cut half of it and then cauterize it to prevent regrowth.
Then treat the wound, and be careful not to cut the lump that is of a pale color, poor consistency, and unhealthy appearance.
For it is a cancerous abscess, and I will address the treatment of cancer later.
When the bowel protrudes If the appearance of the bowel is caused by cautery of a wound or splitting of the diaphragm, and it is on the belly and some of the bowels protrude, as happens in other ruptures, or from blood flowing from veins or arteries as previously mentioned, or from air pressure;
And if it is from the rupture of the diaphragm and the escape of the bowel, the color of the abscess resembles the color of the body, it is a light condition without pain, and presents with varied discharge. And if it is due to the escape of the intestine, it is more variable, and when pressed with the fingers, it retreats, then returns, and sometimes it becomes constricted and grows significantly when entering a bath or after great exertion.
And if it is due to moisture, it is a light condition and is evident when pressed by hand, without much resistance.
And if it is due to blood, the abscess appears large and hard, and is confined to a specific area. And if it is due to air pressure, it is soft to the touch, and the procedure is to determine if the appearance is caused by arterial blood, venous blood, or air pressure.
And if it is due to air pressure, it is soft to the touch, and the procedure is to determine if the appearance is caused by arterial blood, venous blood, or air pressure. Then you must abandon the treatment. For he has doubt and fear, as I told you in the chapter on abscesses, because of the artery and the vein.
And if the manifestation is in the intestine or the bowel, you must command the patient to hold their breath, lie fully stretched, then cut around the navel. Then order them to lie frequently under your hands, go around the area you have marked with the spatula, and lift half the abscess above with the large hook. Then tie it tightly with a strong thread or a cord of durable silk, and secure the knot firmly.
Then open the half of the abscess stretched over the binding, insert your index finger, and search for the intestine. If you find it caught in the binding, untie it and push the intestine back outside the abdomen.
If you find the bowel, take it with the hook and cut off the excess.
If the artery or vein resists, proceed carefully around it, then return to your work and take two needles with two strong threads, passing the needles around the area you crossed and pierced.
Then tighten the abscess in four places above the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles and leave the site until it rots and the dead flesh falls off by itself. Or cut it when it becomes softened and rotten, then treat the site as necessary, and finish with the abscess as we have described.
Or cut it when it becomes softened and rotten, then treat the site as necessary, and finish with the abscess as we have described. Extract the blood or moisture you find, then treat the site as needed and close the wound.
On the chancre We have discussed in the classification the types of chancre, how to treat it with medicines, and how to avoid surgical intervention.
We mention the chancre that arises in the womb, requiring great caution in treatment, and the ancients said that when a chancre is in a place where it can be removed, such as the breast, the thigh, or similar areas, it should be completely excised at the onset.
Nor did anyone before me ever cure one.
And the procedure, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you purge the patient sometimes of black bile;
then bleed him if he has evident repletion, then place the patient in a good position to perform the procedure;
then throw out the ulcers or chancre, and the flesh from all sides, and remove it from all sides without leaving anything behind;
and let the blood flow completely, and press the area firmly with your hand or with something else, and if the flow of blood opposes you due to the incision in the artery or vein, then cauterize it until the blood is stopped; then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
on dropsy We have already spoken in the division about the types of dropsy, and how the gathering of fluid is formed, and the signs of each type, and the treatment done with medicines, and that which is cured by the knife:
and one must not touch these two types with a knife: namely, tympanites and hypochondriac dropsy, for they are fatal conditions;
therefore, when you treat this form of dropsy called "ascites" with medicines, and the treatment does not help, then observe whether the patient is weak, or if he has another disease besides dropsy, such as fever and diarrhea and similar conditions; then do not touch him with a knife, for there is risk;
but if you see that the patient is of strong constitution, and he has no other illness but dropsy alone, and he is neither too young nor too old, then you should proceed in this way: lift the patient upright with your hands, and the assistant presses the belly, pushing the fluid toward the lowest part of the abdomen, then take the spined spatula in this shape: And let it be sharp on both sides. with a point, and yet not so penetrating that it can reach the intestines when it is inserted, and cannot injure them;
then observe whether the dropsy is situated near the intestines: then it is necessary to cut above the navel, three finger-widths directly below the sternum; and if the dropsy is due to a disease of the liver, then let your incision be on the left of the navel, three finger-widths away;
and if it is due to the spleen, then let it be on the right, and the patient must not lie on the incision so that the superfluities do not flow to that weak spot;
then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and insert it, and lift your hand with the spatula between the skin and the membrane as if skinning, to the extent of a fingernail or slightly around it;
then pierce the membrane until the spatula reaches the empty space, which is the place of the fluid, then withdraw it and insert this instrument, whose shape is as follows: It resembles a thin silver reed and is made of light brass or copper, and has a small opening at the lower part; and on one side, three openings; and two on the other side, and one elsewhere;
and its head is shaped like a quill, in the form of the incision that a scribe makes on a pen;
at the upper end is the little ring, so that when the instrument reaches the fluid, it descends immediately into the tool;
then drain half or a third of it, for if you drain more than necessary at that time, by chance the patient may die from the dissolution of his spirit, or he may faint, or approach death;
but drain according to the quantity of his strength and according to what the dispositions of the patient’s vitality and his pulse signify;
then withdraw the instrument and retain the fluid, and it is retained immediately by the plug that stops the opening in the membrane, of which I have spoken, that you pierce in this manner;
then use the instrument again on another day, if you see the patient enduring this well, and draw out a small quantity of fluid;
do this for several days, and be careful not to err so that only a little fluid remains.
And if you have doubts about the patient, and you leave a lot of fluid, then treat him with burial in hot sand, and with much sweating or baths and exposure to the sun, and limit his drinking; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed, and cauterize over the stomach, the liver, and the spleen after the extraction of the fluid, as I have mentioned before.
Sometimes children are born without an opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its proper place.
It is necessary immediately to pierce it with a very fine spatula in the following shape:
then insert into the opening a small fine lead tube, bind it, and leave it thus for three or four days; and when he wants to urinate, remove the tube, let him urinate, and then reinsert it;
and perhaps this is not needed, for the urine that comes out prevents it from closing.
For those whose opening is small, it should be treated with the lead tube, as we have said, and it will widen.
Those whose opening is not in its proper place are injured, for some are born with the opening at the tip of the penis, which prevents them from urinating forward unless they lift their penis upward; and they cannot procreate because the substance cannot reach the womb, and this is a grave condition.
And the method of the procedure is that the patient lies often on his back, then the tip of the penis is extended and cut like the shaping of a quill, so that the opening is in the middle, as it should be;
and beware of the flow of blood that often occurs, and if it does, stop it with something that stops bleeding, and treat the wound until it is healed.
On pustules of the penis Many times, these pustules appear on the penis, and it is an appearance of unsightly flesh;
and there are malignant and non-malignant ones;
you must take them with a fine hook, cut and clean them all, then apply cotton moistened with Egyptian ointment; then treat it with diafinicon ointment until it is healed.
And if the pustule is malignant, of foul color and smell, it is necessary to apply cautery.
When you have cut it, and if the pustule is at the top of the penis and partly under the skin and partly outside, you must first remove the part of the pustule that is inside; and when it is healed, treat the outer part.
For if you treat both together, the tip of the penis is not secure from being pierced, and blackening and corruption will occur in the penis and the testicles;
thus it is necessary to remove all that is black and corrupted, then apply a plaster of honey and flour made from pomegranate peel and vetch, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And if a flow of blood occurs, apply the lunar cautery in the following way:
The cautery assists in two conditions at once: namely, the flow of blood and the corruption;
and if the tip of the penis is corrupted and constricted, it is necessary to insert a lead reed into the canal of the penis, and the patient urinates through it;
and when the skin tightens at the tip of the penis, which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or it occurs from a wound or abscess, it is necessary to free it with a sharp instrument, so that the binding is undone, and the tip of the penis is freed from all sides;
and if it is a severe matter to resolve, it is necessary to free it slightly with a spatula from the tip of the penis and the skin;
then carefully separate the two, and insert a small fine linen cloth moistened with cold water so that it does not tighten again.
Circumcision is not a rupture of continuity like other wounds; however, when we perform this act voluntarily, especially on children, it is necessary that we do it in the best and safest manner for their well-being.
I say that the ancients did not speak of circumcision for their children, for it was not practiced in their law, and we only have what we have learned through experience.
For I have seen the majority of masters and practitioners perform circumcision with a knife, with forceps, and with a razor;
and the flesh would retract because there are two layers, and sometimes the one above is cut while the one below remains. Then it must be cut again, and the pain is doubled, and in the healing of the wound from the knife, the edge of the member is not securely treated;
and with the healing by the nail, sometimes the flesh slips, and the work fails, and many times they grow in such a way that no further healing is needed, and I have seen this.
In the healing done with forceps and a binding thread, I have found the effectiveness of this method, for the forceps cut precisely both above and below.
For when you press your hand, you cut evenly in one single motion; but ensure that the thread is tightly wrapped around the skin;
and the method of the initial work should be that you make the child think, if he understands, that you are only tying the thread around the member, and you can distract him in every way possible;
then have him stand straight between your hands, and conceal the forceps in your hands or beneath your feet so the child does not see them or any of the instruments;
then place your hand on the member, blow on the flesh, and pull it up so that the head of the member is visible; then clean it thoroughly of the filth that has accumulated there, then tie the spot firmly with a double thread, and tie it below with another binding a little apart;
then clean it thoroughly of the filth that has accumulated there, then tie the spot firmly with a double thread, and tie it below with another binding a little apart; and hold it with two fingers by the second binding, with the thumb and forefinger, and cut between the two bindings, then quickly remove the upper flesh and pull the head of the member; then let the blood flow little by little, for it is cleansing; and apply powder, and on the powder place a small piece of soft linen moistened with a mixture of cooked egg yolk, rose water, and good, fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and care for it with other treatments until it heals.
The shape of the forceps for the healing is as follows:
the two ends should be slender and sharp, and the heads should be as large as the handle, evenly so:
the error in the healing occurs when the inner flesh retracts during the incision;
then you must extend it with your nail, before the site becomes infected;
and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your nail, hold it with pincers and then cut it.
And if three days pass and the flesh beneath the member becomes swollen, leave it until the swelling subsides, and then gently scrape it;
then cut it as best as you can without damaging the member, for this will not harm it.
Treat the site with soothing powders, as we have mentioned in the treatise on powders, and if the flesh is cut beyond measure and extends above, it will not harm it;
therefore, treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Of the retention of urine
The retention of urine is caused by the obstruction of a stone, coagulated blood, pus, flesh growth, or similar things, as we have mentioned in the division;
and if the urine is not released, and you see that the retention is due to a stone lodged in the neck of the bladder, the patient should kneel and bend forward; and their feet should be placed on their back, the belly stretched upward from the back, and the patient should hold their breath as much as they can; then the neck of the bladder is compressed to expel the stone, which allows the urine to be released;
and if it does not flow as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, you must administer extraction with the instrument called a "syringe," the shape of which is as follows:
it should be made of fine silver, lightweight, and smooth, like the feather of a bird; and the shaft should be one and a half palms long, and the tip should be thin.
The method for releasing the urine is as follows: take a double thread, tie a small amount of wool or cotton to the end, and place the end of the thread into the syringe;
cut away the excess wool and push it to the tip of the syringe, then coat the syringe with oil, butter, or egg white, and have the patient sit on a seat, and anoint the bladder and the penis with moist oil, olive oil, and warm water;
then gently insert the syringe into the penis until it reaches its root, and bend the penis over towards the bow;
then push the syringe further until it reaches the bladder, and the patient will feel it come to the empty cavity, and this is done only when the passage it enters is twisted;
then slowly extend the thread along with the wool, and the urine will follow the wool, then remove it, and let the urine flow;
and repeat with the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
When abrasions or blood appear in the bladder, or rot has accumulated there, and you wish to distill waters or medicines into it, use the instrument called a "clepsydra," the shape of which is as follows:
It is closed and has three openings: two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the terminal opening through which the medicine flows should seal the penis well without addition, so that moisture can be drawn out and pushed in as needed;
and when you want to send your medicines into the bladder, place the head of the clepsydra in the moisture, and pull on the plunger inside;
then you will draw the moisture into the clepsydra, and then push the plunger firmly back in; then the moisture will enter and go into the bladder immediately, so that the patient will feel it;
and this is the form of the delicate clyster used to irrigate the bladder:
It is made of silver or brass, and its head is higher;
and below, it has a ring where the bindings attach;
then take a sheep’s bladder and place in it the moisture with which you want to irrigate the bladder, then tie it between the two rings firmly with a good double thread, and warm the moisture slightly over the fire;
then insert the head of the clyster into the penis, and press your hand gently on the bladder along with the moisture until the patient feels that the moisture has already entered the bladder;
and if you do not have the bladder, take a piece of parchment, make a circle, and pierce it roundly around; then thread a strong string through these holes, assemble the circle as one assembles a ring, and place inside it the oil, moisture, and water you wish, and attach it to the instrument;
and do as you would with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Of the stone
We have already spoken in the section about the types of stones and their extraction along with medicines;
and I have explained the difference between the stone formed in the kidneys, all the signs, and the cases in which a stone should be operated on by incision; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will explain it to you clearly and briefly.
I say that the stone formed in the bladder occurs more often in children, and it is a sign when urine flows from the bladder resembling water in its fineness;
and sand appears in it, and the patient rubs his penis, which often droops, and then stiffens; and many times their anus discharges;
and healing is easy in children up to four years old, very difficult in the elderly, and moderate in the young, those between youth and old age;
and treatment is easier for those who have a large stone than for those who have a small one.
And when we proceed to the treatment, it is first necessary to cleanse the patient with an enema to remove all the feces from the intestines. For it sometimes hinders the search for the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, lift him up and shake him below, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder and sometimes dislodges from its high position;
then seat him between your prepared hands, his hands placed under his thighs, so that the bladder is entirely inclined downward;
then search for and touch the stone within;
if you feel the stone in the space, hasten now to incise above the stone.
And if it does not completely descend when touched, moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand if the patient is a child, or your middle finger if the patient is a young adult; insert it into his anus, search for the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, guide it to the neck of the bladder;
then press with your finger and push it outward to where you want to incise.
And instruct the assistant to press the bladder with his hand, and to extend the testicles upward with his right hand, while with his left hand removing the skin beneath the testicles in the area where the incision is to be made;
then insert the cutting spatumile, the form of which is this: And make an incision between the area between the testicles and the anus, not in the middle but toward the left buttock;
and make it directly over the stone, keeping your fingers in the anus, and the incision should be transverse, wide on the outside and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, but not too large;
perhaps press with the finger in the anus, so that it comes out easily without effort;
and know that there are some stones with angles and edges: they are difficult to extract;
and there are others that are smooth, resembling an acorn, and round, for which extraction is easier.
For those with angles and edges, make the incision larger;
and if it does not come out, you must use tongs shaped like a file at the tip to tightly grasp the stone so that it does not slip; or you insert beneath it a delicate instrument curved at the tip;
and if you cannot maneuver it this way, widen the opening a bit, and if bleeding occurs, staunch it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, first bring the largest one to the neck of the bladder, then cut above it, extract it, and then the smaller ones if there are several.
And if it is very large, it must be broken, and a larger incision must be made. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or the urine continuously leaks because the wound cannot heal;
but nevertheless, strive to remove it, or break it with pliers, until you extract it piece by piece;
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with incense, aloe, and dragon's blood, compress it, and place over it a cloth moistened with oil and wine, or with oil, rose water, and cold water, to soothe the hot abscess; then recline the patient on his back and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you untie it, thoroughly moisten the area with oil and water, then treat it with dyafinicon ointment and basilicon ointment until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses appear in the wound, along with erosions and blood clots in the bladder, and this causes urine retention, which is mixed with blood in such a way that it flows together with the urine: then insert your finger into the wound and extract the blood, for if it remains, it will spread through the bladder and corrupt it;
then wash the wound with water, garlic, and salt, and treat it in every way you know until it is healed;
and each time you treat him, it is necessary to bind his thighs together and apply the medicines to the affected area.
And if the stone is small, lodged in the urethral passage, and prevents urine from flowing out; then treat it as I mentioned earlier, cutting it several times if necessary; in this way, you are excused from performing a more invasive procedure. I have already proven this method in practice.
Take an iron drill shaped like this, with three edges fixed to a shaft:
then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot move back into the bladder;
then gently insert the drill into the urethra until it reaches the stone; and rotate the drill with your hand little by little on the stone until you can pierce through it;
then the urine will flow immediately; next, press your hand on the remaining part of the stone that is still inside the urethra. It will soon break, and the fragments will pass out with the urine, and the patient will be healed;
and if for some reason you cannot do this, tie one thread below the stone and another above it, then cut the urethra at the level of the stone between the two ligatures, extract the stone, untie the ligature, and clean the clotted blood from the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
About the stone in women
It seldom happens that a stone forms in women, and if it does, the treatment is difficult and hindered for three reasons:
the first is that the woman might be a virgin;
and the second is that it is difficult to find a knowledgeable woman willing to expose herself to physicians, especially when she is chaste.
And the third reason is that it is difficult to find a woman skilled in this art with her hands;
and the fourth reason is that the stone in women is located deeper than in men, which requires a deeper incision, and there is great risk involved. And if necessity demands it, you must seek a well-trained midwife, though she is rarely found, and if you cannot find one, then search for a discreet and virtuous female physician;
and provide her with wise counsel in women’s matters, or with a woman who knows some part of the art, and instruct her to do what you direct for the investigation of the stone; and carefully observe whether the woman is a virgin:
and carefully observe whether the woman is a virgin: in that case, she must insert her finger into the rectum and search for the stone;
and if she finds it, she must hold it under her finger, and you must instruct her to insert her finger into the patient’s vulva, search for the stone, and press firmly on the bladder with her left hand.
If she finds it, she must gradually move it from the entrance of the bladder downward until it reaches the root of the thigh;
then cut above the stone at the root of the thigh toward the middle of the vulva, where it has been moved and can be felt in that area; and do not move her finger from above or below the stone, and make the incision small at first;
and do not move her finger from above or below the stone, and make the incision small at first; then insert the probe into the incision; if you feel the stone, enlarge the wound so the stone can come out, and know that there are many types of stones:
namely, small and large, rough and smooth, long and round, and those with roots.
Thus, understand their forms to determine how they will exit.
And if the bleeding overwhelms you, apply powdered vitriol to the area and hold it there for an hour until the bleeding stops;
then return to your work until the stone is removed, and use the instruments I have described for extracting stones in men to assist you in your procedure;
and if the bleeding overwhelms you and comes from a cut artery, apply the powder to the area, compress it with tents and bandages, and do not continue; leave the stone and do not extract it, for the patient might die; then treat the wound.
And when the heat from the blood has subsided and the area is no longer inflamed, return to your work until the stone is removed.
Watery hernia is nothing more than an accumulation of moisture or white syfac under the tissue of the testicles, which contains the egg;
and it is called "syfac," and sometimes it is precisely in the membrane of the egg, so one might think it is another egg; and it is the membrane of the testicle between the white syfac we mentioned;
and this occurs only rarely. And the formation of this hernia arises from weakness that affects the testicles, spreading this substance.
And sometimes it results from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: either a color resembling jaundice, or it is reddish blood, or black, or watery white, which happens most often;
and these are the signs to recognize this accumulation: if it is in the white syfac we mentioned, the abscess is round, slightly elongated like the shape of an egg, and the testicle is not visible, as it is surrounded by moisture.
And if the moisture is in the membrane itself, the abscess is round with a part of the egg visible, which makes one think it is another egg;
and if the moisture is between the membrane of the testicles and the white syfac, it can be felt clearly;
therefore, when you wish to know the color of the moisture, test it with the square introducer described earlier. Based on what emerges after using the introducer, judge what is inside.
And when we treat it with surgery, the patient must first be bled as much as his strength and bodily fullness allow;
then recline him on his back on something slightly raised, and place many cloths beneath him;
then sit on his left, and instruct your assistant to sit on the right and stretch the penis toward one of the two sides of the testicle tissue;
then take the light spatula and cut the membrane of the testicles along its length to the root, making your incision straight, dividing the membrane of the testicles until you reach the white syfac, and peel it carefully as best as you can;
then pierce the syfac full of water with a wide opening, extract all the fluid, then apply your ointments, and stretch the syfac upward;
and do not touch the tissue of the testicles, only the syfac; cut all of it or piece by piece, carefully removing it, for if you do not cut it thoroughly, the fluid will return;
and if the egg escapes during your procedure, return it to its place once you have completed the work on the syfac;
then bring together the two edges of the testicle tissue with a single suture, and treat it like other wounds until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another disease, you must bind the vessels that are suspensory, fearing the flow of blood;
then cut the testicle along with the suspensory, and extract the testicle, and treat it as we have said.
And if fluid is gathered in two parts together, know that these are two branches; then cut the other part just as you did the first one equally, then wipe the blood, and place in the wound wool soaked in rose oil;
then cut the other part just as you did the first one equally, then wipe the blood, and place in the wound wool soaked in rose oil; and place outside other wool soaked in wine and oil, and place it over the two testicles, and put doubled cloths on top, and bind it all with a bandage in this manner:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with shredded wool in this form, and they should be joined by sewing at the waistband of the breeches, with one end reaching from the base to the back, and the other to the area of the thigh;
and the other two ends over the two groins, and all the compression should be gathered at the buckle of the breeches;
and sometimes this branch is treated with cautery instead of cutting with iron, and it is done by taking a fine knife-like cautery, and cutting the skin of the testicles, and heating it as we have said, so that the white sac containing the fluid is uncovered;
then take the cautery in this manner, and pierce that sac at the swollen areas, and scrape it with this fine heated cautery:
And cut it in every way you can, until you scrape everything out;
and ensure that the fire does not touch the testicle;
and know that this procedure is safer; and you avoid the risk of blood flow, and it is gentler than the work of cutting;
and if anything opposes you, such as a hot abscess, blood flow, or anything else, treat what is opposing you according to what has been previously mentioned.
And if the patient is fearful and does not wish to endure this procedure because of its horror, then administer perforation, as I tell you, and when you are very certain by the signs we have described that the watery branch is there, make the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess at the lower part with the wide spatula, and make the perforation along the length of the body;
and the opening should be wide so that all the fluid may flow out;
then place cotton on the area, and bind it, and let it drain the remaining fluid, then treat it until the wound is healed;
and if the white tissue does not let the fluid exit through the mouth of the wound, then you must insert a feather or the instrument used to draw fluid from dropsical patients, the form of which was mentioned earlier;
and widen the wound a little, and know that the fluid will return, and will gather again after six months or so, and when it gathers as before, the patient will live out his days this way.
Know that in the cutting of this branch there are dangers in many conditions, for which it seems to me that it is often better to leave it;
and I will tell you the procedure and the characteristics of the abscess.
I say therefore that many abscesses occur in the body, and especially in the testicles; and it is from many causes.
It is namely from an excess of sharp and bitter fluid, which is spread to the testicles, or from trauma;
and the color of the abscess is like the color of the body; and no pain is found, and the abscess is serious;
and sometimes there is a grave abscess, fearful and dangerous, and of dark color, and sometimes it comes from damage to an artery, or swelling of a vein.
When it is from damage to an artery, it is known by the disposition of the hot abscess, when you press it with your fingers; and you must not touch it.
The one caused by swelling of the vein is recognized by its reaction to the pressing of fingers, and it is possible to perform the incision on this condition and on the surrounding tissues; and this involves cutting the heart of the testicles, then lifting the testicle upwards, extracting it from the white sac, and freeing the suspensory from all sides of the testicle.
If the testicle is already fused with its surrounding tissues, you must then extract the testicle and cut it;
and if it is adherent to the sac or to the vessels inside, you must free all this tissue and cut it in a rounded manner.
And if the growth of tissue is located at the rear, you must cut all of it and extract the testicle as we have described.
And when your procedure is complete, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
This is an abscess enclosed by a wrapping resembling a bud, accompanied by the softening of the testicles, and the patient moves with great difficulty when he walks;
and the treatment of this condition is nearly as fearsome as the one previously described, yet we will explain its procedure to you, according to what the ancients practiced.
The patient must sit on a raised seat, then you press down the suspensory of the testicles with your fingers, along with the vessels near the penis, and the assistant holds and stretches them tightly;
then cut across with the wide blade of the spatula at the level of the vessels until they are exposed, and then scrape from each side, as we have explained in the extraction of arteries in the temples;
then insert a needle with a double thread, and tie it at the first location where the swelling occurred, and tie it again at the other end; then cut them in the middle straightly, along the length of the body, and remove the corrupted fluids;
then treat the wound as with the others where pus forms, ensuring that no vessel falls that nourishes one of the testicles;
for from this no harm comes, and if life reaches all the vessels, the testicles must be extracted along with all the vessels; so that the organ does not lose its nourishment due to the incision of the vessels, and dries up and cannot recover.
The occurrence of this branch is due to the rupture that occurs in the sac or the stretching over the abdomen in the groin area, which causes the intestines to descend through this rupture to one of the testicles;
and this rupture is either of the sac or of its stretching, and these two forms arise from many causes:
from trauma, or jumping, or straining, or lifting heavy loads, and similar causes;
and the signs when it is due to the stretching of the sac are that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not occur suddenly; and the abscess is uniform up to the base, because the sac presses against the intestine.
And the signs, when it is due to the rupture of the sac, are that it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the abscess appears irregular, under the skin near the surface, due to the protrusion of the intestine and the body outside the sac.
And sometimes the mesentery descends along with the intestine and becomes trapped there, causing great pain for the patient, especially when it is pressed.
And in these treatments, there is fear of using iron, which is why it must be avoided.
And the method of the operation is that you instruct the patient to push the intestine back inside the wound with his hand, if he can do so; then hold his neck between your hands and raise his thighs;
then stretch the skin above and cut along the entire length of the skin of the testicles; then insert the edges of the incision with hooks as needed to open the wound, and ensure they are positioned so the bone can be exposed;
then peel back the fascia that is beneath the skin of the testicles until the white hard fascia is uncovered on all sides;
then insert your index finger into the area surrounding the testicle, between the white fascia beneath the skin of the egg and the second fascia, and separate the part behind the egg and between the second fascia;
and then move the testicle with your right hand inside the skin of the testicles, stretching the white fascia upward with your left hand, and lift the egg along with the fascia toward the incision; and instruct the assistant to stretch the egg upward, and untie what is behind the binding;
and check with your fingers if any intestine is entangled with the white hard fascia, and if you find anything, push it back into the abdomen;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of ten strands, and insert it into the back part of the fascia, which is after the skin of the testicles; after the incision, then cut the ends of the threads that are visible, so that there are four threads left; then gather them one over the other in the form of a cross, and tie the fascia, which we mentioned is beneath the skin of the testicles, with a strong binding from two sides; then wrap the ends of the threads and tie them tightly on both sides, so that none of the vessels nourishing them can enter, preventing the formation of a hot abscess; and then place another binding over the first one, two finger-widths from it, and after these two bindings leave from the fascia beneath the skin of the testicles the width of one finger; and after that, follow the roundness of the structure that the egg forms;
then cut in the area beneath the skin of the testicles, until the blood flows, as we mentioned before;
then apply wool soaked in oil, place it in the wound, and use the binding that we described. And sometimes the white fascia we mentioned is cauterized after the incision, to prevent the risk of blood leakage. For this happens often, and leave the binding in place until it falls off on its own;
and if it delays falling off, sprinkle it with warm water and apply what we described until it falls off;
then treat the wound with further care until it is fully healed.
On fleshy hernia
In this type of rupture, I have never seen anyone who dared to perform the treatment with iron.
And the ancients said it is treated like the rupture that surrounds the life force, in such a way that you tie the vessels after the incision just beneath them;
then cut through it and treat the abscess of what is active until the vessels are detached;
and treat it as we have described until it is healed.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the groin, as we have said, and the location opens;
and none of the intestines descend into the testicles, and if any do descend, it is little, and they return by themselves every time;
and yet, if it remains too long in this state, the wound or fascia grows until the intestines descend;
and this happens due to the stretching of the fascia in the groin, as we said, for it becomes stretched, then softened and swollen, and the location opens;
and the treatment is by cauterization, as we have said before;
and sometimes it is treated with iron in this manner: and it is that the patient lies often on his back between your hands, then you cut the location of the swollen rupture wide, according to the size of three fingers;
and then pull out the fascia beneath the skin that follows, then take the bandage and place it over the visible location of the fascia;
and press it deep into the abdomen, then sew the two visible locations of the fascia above the end of the bandage, and sew both;
then remove the end of the bandage, and do not cut the fascia nor stretch the egg or anything else, as I informed you in the treatment of the rupture of the intestines; then treat it as you would treat wounds.
then treat it as you would treat wounds. And when you cut the threads, cleanse it and treat the wound until it is healed.
The fascia is restricted and does not protrude in the rupture, and cauterization is better in this location and closer to recovery.
On the softening of the skin of the testicles
Many times, the skin of the testicles softens in some men because the flesh inside is softened, and it is unsightly to behold;
and it is necessary, when one wants to treat it, to make the patient lie on his back and cut the softened skin over the natural skin;
then join the two edges with a seam, and if you wish, first sew the excess of the softened skin with three or four firm stitches;
then cut between the stitches, and treat it as you would other wounds, until it is healed and the threads fall out.
On castration
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, and for this reason, I would prefer not to speak of it in this book;
and it is only necessary for two purposes:
one is that the physician knows how to answer when asked about it, and knows the treatment;
and the other, because we often need to castrate certain animals to help us, such as goats, sheep, cats, and other animals.
I say then that castration is done in two ways: either by pulling or by cutting.
In the method done by pulling, we make the animal sit in warm water until the testicles are softened and hang loose; then take them in your hand until they are retracted and you no longer feel them.
On castration by cutting: you must hold the animal and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspensory cord and cut over each egg with one stroke, after you have carefully skinned them;
and leave a small part of the fascia and the thin fascia covering the vessels;
and this method of castration is better than the one done by pulling, because with pulling, part of the testicles may remain, causing the animal to desire lust;
then treat the wound until it is healed.
On hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism occurs in two ways in men: one is when between the two testicles appears something resembling the form of a woman’s nature, with hair, and sometimes urine flows from it.
And the other form is in women, where on the pubic region there is something resembling a penis and two testicles.
And the treatment for both the man and the woman is to cut away all the additional flesh and treat it as you would other wounds;
in the second form, where urine leaks through the skin of the testicles in men, there is no cure.
Tentigene is flesh added to the natural part, such that it is very unsightly to see; and some women have it as large as a hand, and this is the cure.
You must grasp the excess of the tentigene with your hand or hooks, and cut it gently;
and not go too deep, so that no flow of blood occurs there, then treat it with another remedy until it is healed;
and for another flesh that grows at the mouth of the womb, and fills it, and sometimes erupts out, and resembles a cow’s udder, and for this the ancients called it the “cow disease.” You must cut it, as we have said of the tentigene, and treat it until it is healed.
Erratique is when the nature of the woman is not pierced, or the opening is small; and it is natural from birth, or occurs due to illness that has come there;
and it is natural from birth, or occurs due to illness that has come there; or it is by added flesh, or by a thin or thick syfac, and it is formed deep in the womb, or on the sides, or beneath, or wherever it may be;
and it prevents conception and childbirth, and perhaps also the menstruation;
and the recognition of this is through examination by the caretaker.
If the obstruction is close and visible, feel for it with your fingers or a probe.
If it is a thin syfac, and it is close to the two lips, hasten and break it thus:
place your two index fingers together, and let the woman lie on her back, with her legs spread apart;
then stretch the two lips firmly, until the thin syfac is broken and the obstruction is opened;
then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the spot, and let the woman lie with a man each day, so it cannot close up.
And if the syfac is hard and thick, you must cut it with a spatula-like tool resembling a myrtle leaf.
If the obstruction is of grown flesh, suspend it with a hook and cut it;
and use medicines to staunch the blood, such as acacia, dragon’s blood, frankincense, mixed with egg white;
then insert a wide lead cane, so that the wound cannot close up;
and keep it so for a long time, and insert a tent of dry linen;
then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And when in the womb grown flesh appears, it must be cut in this manner, unless it is a cancerous ulcer. For a cancerous ulcer in the womb, one must not touch it with iron.
Of hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood frequently flows, and when hemorrhoids are old, they become thelul.
And we have already described in the division their appearances and signs, and I will now discuss those that receive treatment.
I say that hemorrhoids and thelul, when they are deep in the womb and are not perceptible to touch, are not treated with iron.
Those that are at the mouth of the womb, which can be felt, are those that can be treated.
It is necessary then to place the woman in a cool room, then grasp the thelul with forceps, and cut it at its roots, then sprinkle medicines to staunch the blood, such as acacia, dragon’s blood, frankincense, and similar substances;
then press her feet against the wall for an hour, and then place her in cold water;
and if a flow of blood occurs, have her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peel, galls, and similar things, and then take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a poultice to place on her back.
And if it staunches, it is good. If not, then apply cupping glasses to her back and breasts without cutting.
Then take wool, soak it in the juice of plantain or dog rose with old wine, and apply it to the area.
And when the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until it is healed.
And the one called "albathir" is red and resembles a rough surface, and it must be cut as I have said of the thelul; and then treat it until it is healed.
Many types of ulcers appear in the womb, such as cancer, stony ulcers, herpes, estiomenes, fistulas, hemorrhoids, hot ulcers, and many other conditions that I have mentioned in the division.
It is necessary then that I speak in this treatise of the hot ulcer that occurs in the womb, which is not one of those ulcers that collects pus;
and if you wish to know the work of iron, see if the ulcer is acute in the beginning of its appearance, full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red when you can see it. Then do not hasten to pierce it, but allow it to mature until the pain subsides;
and then have the patient sit on a seat, and place two small stools for support, leaning on her back and bringing her feet to the outer sides of the legs;
and her thighs should be spread, and her arms placed under her knees, and bind them well with a good tie;
then position her body toward the right side, and administer the instrument used to open the mouth of the womb, of which the form is described hereafter;
and it is necessary that when you wish to use this instrument, you first insert a probe to determine the depth of the womb, so that what enters from the instrument does not go deeper than it should, and does not injure the patient; and if the instrument is too large, you must cover the depth of the womb with cloths, so that the instrument does not cause harm.
And you must place the horn of the instrument on top, and hold the instrument.
And when the ulcer opens, and it is soft to the touch, you must cut it at the top with a sharp spatula.
And when the pus is emptied, you must place tents soaked in rose oil or dry green oil in the wound.
And place the tent from the wound to the depth of the womb, and apply clean wool soaked in water or mallow decoction over the womb and the wound.
Then treat it after two days with suitable ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and the wound are washed with an enema of water and honey, and then water with cooked roots of lily and long aristolochia. Then return to the ointment.
And if the wound has spread into the womb, it is necessary that you avoid cauterizing with iron, but treat it as we have explained in the section.
Of childbirth It is first necessary for the midwife to know the pattern of natural childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman pressing downward and desiring to breathe the air.
Then the child hastens to come out. Then know that this childbirth is in the natural form, and the emergence is with its head, and the afterbirth with it.
And when you see these signs, you must press lightly on her belly so that the child comes out quickly.
For when it descends with its head, the afterbirth comes out with it, and the womb is cleansed of its excess by proper purification.
And the one that comes otherwise does not come naturally.
For it sometimes comes feet first, or the body or head appears, or the hands, or it comes on its belly or sideways, and is sometimes turned on its neck, and in other bad positions.
Thus, the midwife must be wise and skillful in these matters, and guard herself against errors and deceptions, and I will show you all the positions and how to help them.
If the child comes headfirst in a natural birth, and the woman gives birth with difficulty, and her strength is weak, have her sit on a seat, or have women hold her.
And anoint her genital area with oil or cooked fenugreek, and then the midwife inserts between her fingers the small spatumile described here. And split the afterbirth, and cut it with her nail so that the moisture within runs out.
And press the woman's belly until the child descends, and if it does not descend, it is necessary to administer an enema with fenugreek mucilage and sesame oil.
Then make her inhale and sneeze with spices, and hold her mouth and nose for a moment. The child will now come out.
And if both hands come out first, you must gently push them back, little by little. And if they cannot be pushed back, place the woman on a seat and lift her feet high. Then tilt the seat to the ground, and hold the woman so that she does not fall during the tilting.
And if the hands cannot enter, and the child dies, cut its hands with the knife previously mentioned, and extract the child, and adjust it properly.
On the delivery of the child feet first When the child comes feet first, you must push it upward. And then turn it little by little until it is aligned.
Then take one of its feet and extend it little by little.
When it moves up to the thighs, instruct her to push and make her sneeze with spices. Then it will come out if God wills it.
And if it does not emerge as we have said, turn it little by little until it is in the natural position. For then it will come out easily.
And if it does not come out as we have said, take mallow mucilage, sesame oil, and melted gum, and grind them all in a mortar. And apply this ointment to the woman’s genital area inside and out, then make her sit in warm water up to below her ribs.
And when she is softened below, make a suppository of myrrh, place it inside her, and leave it for an hour. Then make her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze, close her mouth and nose, and lightly press her belly, for the child will now emerge.
On the delivery of the child knee-first When the child comes in this position, the midwife should insert her hands little by little. Then it should be turned over its neck, with its feet hanging downward, and the woman lying on a bed. And fold its hands little by little, then place her hands on her belly, and remove the cushions below her until she is positioned downward. And if the child does not emerge, take its feet and move them firmly, then move the belly upward, then insert your hands. And draw the child out little by little. And instruct the woman to push until the child comes out.
On the delivery of the child with one arm extended It is necessary to manipulate to bring the arm back. If it cannot be brought back, make the woman stand up and walk.
If she cannot walk, make her lie on a bed and spread her legs firmly.
Then administer the mucilage I have described.
And if she does not give birth, make her sit on a seat, then work to bring the arm back. And draw the child out in the natural position, make her sneeze, and instruct her to push until the child comes out.
On the delivery of the child with its head back, hands spread, and face turned toward its mother’s back The midwife must hold it with her hand, then turn it little by little and guide it gently.
And when it is aligned, apply mallow mucilage and oil to the genital area, as we have said, then instruct her to move little by little.
And when you have done this, make her sit on a seat and instruct her to push. And make her sneeze. On this same procedure with the afterbirth
On this same procedure with the afterbirth When it comes out in this manner with the afterbirth, cut the afterbirth with your nail so that the moisture is drained.
And if the child is hanging by its face and neck, cut it from the cord so that it is not retained, and the child does not die.
Then push the child inside until you have positioned it as it should be, and instruct the woman to push again.
On the delivery of twins Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four are born. And this is not a strange thing, though it happens rarely. Two [children] are a strange thing, and they rarely live.
Two [children] are a strange thing, and they rarely live. I know this, that they are multiplied and separated by the membrane that divides them, which is attached to the cord.
And sometimes they emerge as naturally as one alone, as we have said.
And if they emerge with difficulty, treat them as we have explained, and let the midwife be skillful and act quickly and gently. And let her act in such a way as to bring them safely to health. On multiple children
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more up to fifteen are formed in the womb, and they are all shaped in the form of children by the design of the glorious Creator. It is necessary for the midwife to know all this, for such things may happen unexpectedly. Let her act accordingly as required.
Of the dead child
When you treat the woman of the dead child or womb, as I have said in the section, and it does not come out, and you are forced to operate with your hands; it is necessary that you know if the woman is of sound health, and does not have a condition where she fears death;
it is necessary that the woman be laid on her back, with her head inclined downward, and her legs raised;
and the assistant holds her from both sides, or she is tied to the bed so that she is not moved by the descent of the child;
then rub the mouth of the womb with moist oils mixed with mallow mucilage, fenugreek, and flaxseed, and then anoint the attendant's hands with these oils and mucilages;
then insert them into the womb gently, then find a place where the instruments should be placed, and check if the child is positioned to descend head first;
if so, insert the instruments into its eyes or neck or mouth or palate or under the chin or in the joint or near the ribs, and if the descent is feet first, insert them at the ankles and the lower ribs;
and it is necessary that the instrument be held in the right hand, and the curve placed between the fingers of the left hand, and insert it with the whole hand gently, and fix the instrument in one of the places we have mentioned, until it reaches the hollow part;
then insert another instrument opposite, or a third if needed, so that the extraction is balanced;
and then extend it evenly, moving from one side to the other, to allow the remains to come out, and the instruments should have teeth to hold the remains, as shown here in the design:
And if a part remains, the attendant should anoint one of their fingers with oil, insert it into that part, and pull the remaining part;
and if none remains, then place the instrument at a higher location, and do this until everything comes out completely.
And if one hand comes forward before the other, and it cannot be pulled back due to constriction, you must wrap it in a cloth until it fully emerges; then cut it at the joint of the palm or the wrist, and similarly you must do the same for the other hand and for both feet.
And if the child’s head is large and narrow at the exit, or if fluid has accumulated in the head, you must insert the spiked spatula between your fingers, split the head, and extract the fluid; or you break it with the instrument called "almidach," the design of which is provided with the instruments in the chapter following this one;
and do the same if the child has a naturally large head;
and then pull out the bones with forceps, and if the head escapes but is stuck in the joint, it must be split so that the fluids from the chest come out;
and if it cannot come out, then cut it into pieces as much as you can;
and if it is swollen in the abdomen or under the ribs, you must pierce it until the fluids flow.
And if the child is on its feet, the extraction is easy, and guiding it to the mouth of the womb is simple.
And if it is narrow in the abdomen or the chest, you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand; and cut the abdomen or the chest until the fluids within flow;
and if the other members are removed and the head remains, the attendant should place their hand deep into the womb and pull it to the mouth of the womb; then insert one or two instruments and extract it;
and if the mouth of the womb is constricted due to a hot abscess that has formed there, no work should be done on it, but rather moist and fatty substances should be applied; and apply poultices and wash with softening and moistening waters.
And if the child is on its side and you can reposition it, apply what we have said about a living child;
and if that is not possible, then extract it piece by piece, leaving nothing of the afterbirth.
And once you have done this, apply what we have said for hot abscesses that occur in the womb;
and if there is a flow of blood, it should be treated with astringent water, and other remedies should be applied.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had died, then another was conceived on top of it, and the other also died. After a long time, an abscess formed in the groin, swelled so much that it opened, and began to emit a great stench.
I was called to treat it, and I thought for a long time, but I could not close the wound.
I applied a strong drawing poultice, and a bone came out, and after a few days, others followed. I marveled greatly, because the womb has no bones.
Then I thought they were the bones of a dead child.
I probed the wound and extracted many bones until the woman was in a better condition; and the woman lived a long time this way, with a little discharge continually coming from the place;
and I have recalled this chapter only to say that when the practitioner encounters a strange situation, they must know how to provide help.
Here follows the shape of the press by which the books are lifted;
and with two screws at the two ends of the two straps. However, the horns should be finer than the restrainer and should be made of ebony or boxwood;
and the opening of the wood should be one finger wide, the edge of the wood one finger wide, and one and a half palms in length; and in the middle of the two straps there should be two additions of the same wood, securely fixed at either end, half a palm in length or slightly more;
and these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the womb to open it when the two horns are turned.
Another form, similar but finer and lighter, should be made of ebony or boxwood, resembling forceps; and it should have two additions at its two ends, as you see, one palm in length and two fingers wide;
and when you want to open the womb with the instrument, have the woman sit on a bed, with her feet dangling and her legs spread, then insert the two joined additions into the womb, and hold the head of the instrument below between her thighs; then operate the instrument with your hand, as you would with forceps, according to the amount you want to open the mouth of the womb, until the assistant accomplishes what they intend.
These instruments are all superior, and their designs are numerous; and when the surgeon has prepared them, the work is much faster and more efficient for their purpose.
Do not neglect the instrument; ensure it is ready, as its necessity cannot be excused.
When the afterbirth is retained during childbirth, you must instruct the patient to hold her breath, then make her sneeze with the appropriate method, and press your hands on her mouth and nose; and if it comes out this way, all is well.
If not, take a pot, make a hole in its lid, and put in herbs that can open the mouth of the womb, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia wood, and centaury. All these herbs, or some of them, should be boiled in water in the pot over the fire.
Then place a tube in the hole of the pot, with the other end in the mouth of the womb, and hold it there until the vapor enters the womb.
Then make her sneeze, as we have said. The afterbirth will quickly emerge.
And if it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to moisten her left hand with sesame oil or marshmallow mucilage, then insert it into the womb and search for the afterbirth. When she finds it, she should take it and stretch it little by little straight out so that the womb does not collapse during the extraction.
But she must move it lightly to the right and left, then pull it. It will come out and detach.
And if the mouth of the womb is already constricted, we have spoken of the treatment of sneezing and the fumigation with herbs.
And if it does not come out with all that we have described, be careful not to pull recklessly.
Rather, you must tie what is at the mouth of the womb to the woman’s thigh, then administer a clyster with tetrapharmacon ointment. This will soften it, reposition it, and make it come out.
But still, when it softens, a foul odor may arise, affecting the stomach and head, harming the patient. Thus, suitable fumigations are necessary for this.
Some of the ancients recommended fumigating with watercress and dried figs.
The design of the instrument used to fumigate the woman for retained blood or afterbirth is this:
It is made of glass, resembling a tube, with the narrow end placed in the womb and the wide end above the fire.
The fumigation should be over embers and held there until it is used up, then another should be prepared.
Many children are born with an anus that is not pierced, instead blocked by a thin membrane. Thus, the midwife must pierce that membrane with her finger, not with a sharp blade, and ensure the sphincter is not harmed.
Then place wool soaked in wine and oil on it, and apply ointments until it is healed.
If you fear it will close again, insert a lead tube into the opening and leave it for several days, removing it when the child needs to pass waste.
Sometimes this obstruction comes from the closure of a wound or abscess. Then the closure must be cut. Treat it as we have described with the lead tube.
Fistulas that appear below the anus are swellings and enlargements near or between the two parts of the anus, sometimes singular or multiple.
When this swelling becomes old, it opens and discharges white watery moisture or subtle pus, and sometimes these fistulas are perforating.
They are identified by the fact that stool or gas escapes through them when the patient defecates, and sometimes a worm emerges.
Some fistulas pierce as far as the bladder or halfway up the penis. They can extend to the junction of the thigh or even to the tailbone.
Thus, one recognizes a perforating fistula of the anus and a non-perforating one. This is done by inserting your index finger into the anus and a fine bronze or iron needle into the fistula if it is not twisted.
If it is twisted, insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair until you can feel it with your finger.
If you cannot feel it and no stool, gas, or worm comes from the opening as we described: Know that it does not perforate. Then proceed to treat it quickly.
And when the fistula perforates to the bladder or the urinary canal, urine leaks from it and cannot be healed with medicines.
If it perforates to the junction of the thigh, the probe will reach that location. If there is no twisting and the surrounding area is painful, pus will constantly flow from it, and neither medicines nor healing ointments will help.
For these perforating fistulas, there is no cure except through surgery, despite the vain attempts of foolish physicians who meddle with them.
For a fistula that is not perforating and not old, there is hope for healing with surgery, as I have experienced. The patient should lie on their back under your hands.
Lift their legs over their thighs, and their thighs should be inclined towards their abdomen. Then insert a bronze probe, or a lead one if there is twisting, until you determine where the probe reaches.
If the patient feels it around the anus, you must insert your index finger and confirm if the probe has perforated it.
And if you feel with your finger a membrane or flesh, then you know it is perforating. Do not attempt to treat it, as it cannot be healed.
It is said that some can indeed be healed, but this rarely happens.
The method of aid involves heating a fine cautery to match the width of the fistula, as previously described. Insert it while hot into the fistula until it reaches near the anus. Do this two or three times until you are sure the damaged tissues, resembling the quill of a bird, are burned away.
Then treat it with probes moistened with butter until the burnt tissue comes out, followed by healing ointments to regenerate and close the flesh.
If it heals this way, that is good.
If not, it cannot be healed in any other way.
If the probe enters but does not reach the finger placed in the anus, and there is a thick covering of flesh or membrane between your finger and the probe, examine the fistula where this covering leads. Cut at the start of the fistula, continually insert the probe further, and follow with the cautery until it reaches the end of the probe. The probe will be freed and fall out.
Then clean out the damaged tissues, which resemble a bird’s quill, leaving none behind.
If blood overcomes you and interferes with your work, cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine.
For a fire cautery achieves two good results: namely, the burning away of damaged tissues and the stopping of bleeding and moisture.
Then treat it with probes moistened with butter or crushed substances until the site expels pus and the burnt tissue is removed in it.
Then heal the wound with closing ointments that generate firm flesh, using dry medicines.
For once it is restored, it is healed and does not return.
If the fistula reaches deep into the anus and is distant from the body, insert your finger into the anus and investigate this.
If you feel the probe and there is tissue, membrane, or flesh between them, or it is close to perforating, then proceed with confidence and hope using one of three methods:
either cauterize it as described, cut it down to its depth, or if possible, insert probes and treat it as before.
Do not go too deep, lest you cut the structure that holds the anus, causing involuntary stool leakage. Then treat it as we have described.
Then treat it as we have described. Perhaps it will be healed, or you can remove the covering and clean it once it is cut near the anus, either with a probe or another sharp instrument. Then clean the damaged tissue in the wound as thoroughly as you can. Next, work to restore the wound and ensure the fistula remains in the area away from the anus.
Next, work to restore the wound and ensure the fistula remains in the area away from the anus. This will be easier for the patient.
And sometimes fistulas are treated in this manner: and it is when you insert the tent into the fistula, and it is at the side of the anus near the skin above, then take a tent pierced at the tip in this shape: And insert a twisted thread into it, and insert the tent with the thread into the fistula until it reaches the tip.
If it pierces into the margin of the anus inside, then draw the thread from that opening, so that you place your finger in the anus;
and pull the end of the thread, and join the two ends together, and tighten one against the other, and leave it for one or two days;
and tighten it occasionally until the thread cuts the flesh between the two, and they fall away;
then treat the wound until it is healed and healthy.
If the fistula does not pierce through, make it pierce in all the ways you can, unless it is too deep. For it is not appropriate to use the ligature to cut so deeply, and then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The shape of the sharp spatula used to open the fistula is very pointed on one side and cutting; and not on the other side, so that one does not cut what should not be cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds: either they are inside the anus, like grains of grape, and there are small and large ones, and they often bleed, and there is one or more, and they are outside the anus and at the rim of the anus;
but those that are outside have little moisture, and often leak a little yellowish fluid or a little blood, and have the color of the body;
and the treatment for those inside the anus is to instruct the patient to strain when going to the bathroom, so that the hemorrhoids protrude, and the threads become visible; then act quickly, and seize it with pincers, or hold it with your fingernail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the pincers cannot hold them because of their moisture, take a small cloth, or cotton, or a piece of camel-hair fabric; and extract them with your fingers, then cut them, and sprinkle on some hot powders to act as a cauterizing agent; or cauterize them as described in the chapter on cauterization, then treat them with other remedies until they are healed;
and if the hemorrhoids cannot protrude, give the patient a sharp and biting enema to wash what is in the anus, so that they may protrude clearly; when the patient strains, and the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, the treatment is simple;
when the patient strains, and the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, the treatment is simple; it is to grasp them with your fingernail or pincers, and cut them, then treat them as we have said, until they are healed, and fear the use of a blade. Then you must perform the suturing in this manner:
Then you must perform the suturing in this manner: take a twisted thread, and thread it into a needle, then draw the thread above and pierce the needle on the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread below the needle, and make it wide;
and tighten the thread firmly, then tie the thread, and withdraw the needle, and do the same with all the others, and leave one to drain the excess blood;
then place on the anus a cloth moistened with rose oil or wax, and apply it to the anus, and instruct the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they fall away, and when they have fallen, treat them with ointments and other remedies until they are healed.
Of the drying up of stool or the anus Many times stool dries up in the intestine, and from the constriction of nature, and when the illness is old and medicine is ineffective. Then you must scrape at the surface with the tip of a spatula or your fingernail to remove the crust above, which prevents moisture; then treat it until it is healed as is necessary;
and if it cannot heal, begin the scraping again more forcefully than before, until it bleeds greatly and is flayed; then treat it until it is healed.
Of fremitus Formice is a small false growth around the body, and it goes very deep;
and sometimes it is caused by cold, and it feels like a dead fremitus, and it appears all over the body, more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the treatment is to take the quill of a goose feather, or a strong feather from a vulture, and place that quill over the fremitus, so that the circle surrounds the fremitus completely; then turn your hand with the quill until you cut all around the fremitus, and push it deeply, and scrape the fremitus from its roots.
And if you wish, do this with a bronze or iron quill shaped in this way, being precise below and pulling above: not piercing, for better grip with the finger and better pressure.
And if you wish, cauterize the fremitus as explained earlier in the chapter on cauterization.
Sometimes enemas are made from silver, brass, molten bronze, or hammered bronze;
and sometimes these instruments are made small or large, according to those for whom they are prepared. Thus, those used in the treatment of children and the weak or delicate are small.
Thus, those used in the treatment of children and the weak or delicate are small. The shape of both small and large enemas is wide above, where the chamber is fastened, as follows:
and it should have a separation where the chamber is fastened, as you see, and the end should be pierced inside;
and it should have two openings on one side, and one on the other;
and the chamber where the medicine is placed should be made from an animal bladder or parchment, and it should be pierced all around with small holes, and there should be one finger's width between each hole; then insert a strong thread, twisted tenfold or so around, and assemble the chamber as one does a leather bottle. and when the medicine is inside, tie it to the instrument in front with a strong thread, then administer the enema.
And this is the shape of the circular attachment:
And the medicine should be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the enema instrument with oil, egg white, or something similar, then insert it gently; then the practitioner squeezes it with both hands together until it is completely empty, then withdraws the enema instrument, and the patient raises their legs to the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, hold it in as long as possible; and if they sleep with it overnight, it is of greater benefit.
And if you administer it for the illness of diarrhea, and the medicine comes out too quickly, repeat it until they are healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids in the anus, or an abscess, the enema should be as delicate as for a child;
and this is the form of the delicate enema, on which the skin is tightened:
We have already spoken in the division about the treatment of wounds;
now we shall discuss the treatments by hands and medicines, as a conclusion.
I say that wounds differ according to what causes them, the places where they are made, and what they are made by.
The things by which wounds are made include the throwing of stones, the cuts of swords and knives, or of spears or wooden shafts or plates, or similar things;
or wounds that occur in specific places on the body, such as wounds that fall on the neck, or on the head, or the chest, or the belly, or the liver, and similar parts;
and I shall tell you the treatment for each type of wound, and begin with simple wounds of the head, as the detailed explanations will come in their chapters.
I say that when a simple wound appears on the head, and the bone is not broken, take note whether it is caused by the throwing of a stone or similar things, and the skin is still torn and the wound is large, and you suspect the development of a hot abscess: then immediately let blood from the cephalic vein, especially if little blood comes from the wound, and the bloodletting should be on the side opposite to the injured part;
and the patient should avoid excess wine and heavy foods.
And if he does not wish to bleed, let his food be reduced, and let him drink no wine, nor consume any meat.
and place on the wound, if hot abscesses appear there, cotton moistened only in rose oil, or in styptic wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, then place on the wound, if it is fresh with its blood and has not been altered by the air, a powder, which I will describe a little further on;
and if the burn has altered it, then apply certain ointments until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, as from a sword slash or similar, and the edges cannot be brought together with tents, then join them with sutures, as I will describe for wounds of the abdomen, by stitching.
If the wound exposes the bone, and it hangs and is attached by only a little, then cut it off; then treat the wound with medicine, and restore firm flesh in place of skin, and command the patient to eat hearty foods, such as heads and cooked wheat, as well as poultry and similar things.
And if you find rot in the flesh, and it does not affect the bone, then cut away all the rot and throw it away, then treat it;
and if there is an artery or vein in the wound, from which blood flows and cannot be stopped by medicines, then locate the artery, and if you find it loose, tie it with a thread; and if that does not work, then cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, then the treatment is easy: and it is that you place in it this powder which seals before the burn has altered it.
And the manner of the powder is as follows: take one part incense; two parts dragon’s blood; three parts quicklime, and grind it finely, and fill the wound with it, and compress it firmly, so that it adheres well and unites with its blood;
and then bind it well, and leave it without unbinding, unless it swells; for the medicine should not be removed until it is healed.
And sometimes this is done with only quicklime, when incense or dragon’s blood is not available, as long as the burn has not altered the wound.
And if the burn has altered the wound, especially in summer, then one does not place this powder there;
but applies some digestive ointments, or poultices of barley flour made with water and honey, until it expels pus; then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And if a fragment of bone accompanies the wound, and it is small, then extract it with fine pincers;
and I will tell you further on about fractures of the skull.
Of the wound to the neck
If a wound occurs on the neck and it is simple, there is no difference between it and one on the head, except if the nerve or artery in the neck is cut.
If it is the nerve, there is no other remedy than to abandon treatment, and not to place anything constricting there, for it harms the nerves and causes them to contract; and place nothing cold on the wound, for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their connection is with the brain, which is the highest organ;
but the medicine should be mild, such as warm herbs washed in sweet water and mixed with rose oil, or cucumbers washed similarly in sweet water, and other mineral substances prepared in this way, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, then sew it and bind it with bandages, then treat it until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and hollow and full of pus, then puncture it at a lower point;
and if the artery is cut, and blood flows from it, then uncover it, tie it, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the spine of the throat is cut, or the throat, and the passage through which food goes is preserved, then sew the throat over the trachea, and do not touch the trachea but restore it to its natural shape; then bind it appropriately, and leave it for some days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has left an impression on the bone, then examine it; and if there are pieces of bone, extract them all if you can, and those you cannot remove, leave them until the wound decays, and the issue becomes loosened and eased;
and if the wound is fresh, then sprinkle the powder I mentioned over it. And if there is bone in the wound and a fistula, treat it as I described in its chapter.
If it is a blow from a lance or knife, and the wound is deep, then observe whether air escapes from the wound when the patient breathes: then know that the wound is mortal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with its blood, do not place the powder on it in the first hour, nor bind it, for the blood might not settle at the bottom, and it could return to the heart and kill the patient; but apply an attractive ointment, and bind it twice a day;
and if you do not have ointment, place old cotton in the wound to absorb the moisture, and have the patient lie on the wound for three days, or four, or more; so that spasm, trembling of the heart, or difficulty breathing will not occur; and when you see good progress, then know that the wound is safe. Then treat it with tents and other remedies until it is healed;
and if it cannot heal, then operate, knowing that there is a fistula;
then treat it as it should be. And if the wound is from an incision by a sword or knife, and it is simple, either on the chest or the back, treat it as I described above; if it is large, with sutures;
if it is small, with powder, and if it has pressed into the bone and broken pieces, then examine the wound and remove them if they are detached; and if they are not detached, then let the wound rot, so that the extraction becomes easier;
and for other wounds on other parts of the body, the treatment is as we have described.
Of the rupture of the abdomen
The ruptures of the abdomen are large, medium, and small;
from the large wound sometimes the intestines, or the nerves of the intestines, protrude, through which their reentry;
and the suturing is more difficult, and sometimes the small wound is worse than the large one, because it is more difficult to replace the intestines unless they are returned little by little;
because the intestines swell as soon as they feel the cold, making reentry more difficult, and for this reason the medium wound is better, as it allows the intestines to be returned to their place more easily than the other two.
And know that the ruptures of the abdomen occur in four ways:
two common sutures are used in suturing the abdomen, and the sutures of other wounds of the body and two other specific sutures are shared with other wounds;
and yet they are more appropriate for the suturing of the abdomen, and I will name and explain each one.
I say that when the wound is small, and some part of the intestine protrudes, it is difficult to replace, and this happens in one of two ways: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen from the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this way: moisten a sponge or a soft cloth in warm water only, or boil water with hyssop, cypress, and spike, and bathe the intestine until the swelling is reduced;
and sometimes use astringent wine, which is better than plain water for reducing swelling.
And when you see the swelling subside, moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow and mallow have been boiled, for this eases its reentry little by little;
and if it cannot reenter, slightly enlarge the wound with the instrument used for cutting hemorrhoids;
and the first treatment is better than cutting, as one must not cut unless there is great necessity;
and this is the instrument for enlarging it:
it cuts inside in the curve but not outside, and here is the shape: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestines protrude, return them to their proper place in their natural form if you are able, for this is much better.
When the wound is large and it is in the lower part of the abdomen, you must have the patient lie on his back and raise his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the lower part of the abdomen, raise the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and likewise if the rupture of the abdomen is in one of the two sides, ensure that the injured part is higher than the other;
and thus you must manage what I have described for large and medium wounds.
For small wounds, apply what is prepared, then have in your hands a compassionate assistant who holds the entire rupture with his hand and joins the lips.
And this is the common method of suturing: take one or more needles, depending on the size of the wound, then leave a finger's breadth from the edge of the wound and insert a needle with a strong thread. Pierce through the two edges of the skin along with the two edges of the fascia, which lies under the skin, so that you pierce it on that side and join the two edges of the fascia together with the four layers.
Then wrap a double thread around the needle on both sides, then join the two edges of the wound evenly, and leave a finger’s breadth again before inserting another needle.
Then tie the thread as you did with the first needle, and continue doing this according to the need for needles until the entire wound is closed.
And the needles should be of medium size, neither too fine nor too thick, because fine needles cut through all the flesh, and overly thick ones cannot enter properly. Thus, they must be medium.
And the needles must not penetrate too far outside the flesh and skin, as they would cut and reopen the wound before it can heal.
Then cut off the ends of the needles so they do not injure the patient while sleeping, and place plugs or cloths at the ends of the needles to hold them in place, and leave them until the wound is healed.
And this method of suturing with needles is more suitable for small wounds, as one or two needles suffice.
The second suture method is common and involves joining the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the fascia together with one needle threaded with a medium-strong thread.
And when you have pierced all four layers together, bring the needle back to the side where you started, in the same way one sews cloth.
And leave a space between each stitch equivalent to the thickness of a small finger.
This suture is well-known, and I once sutured a wound on a man’s abdomen who had been injured by a knife. The wound was more than a palm’s width in size, and about two palms of intestines were protruding, with the wound located in the middle of the abdomen.
I returned the intestines to their place after they had been exposed for twenty-four hours, and the wound healed within fifteen days, and I treated him, and he recovered.
The physicians had judged that he would die, and it was a miracle.
And I did not treat him with ointments, as I was in a place where none could be found, nor any medicines. I simply placed old cotton on the wound twice a day and washed it with honey water until he was healed.
Now I will tell you about the two specific suturing methods:
Take the needle and insert it from the outer part to the inner part.
When it has pierced the fascia straight through, leave the edge of the fascia where you inserted the needle and pierce it again from the inner part to the outer part on the other side.
The idea of this suture is that you sew as tanners do with skins, leaving the fascia on one side once and picking it up on the other until the suture is fully completed.
The second method of suturing, which Galen properly describes, is as some do, joining the two parts naturally and applying one edge of the fascia to the other in this manner:
Insert a needle into the nearby edge of the wound and pierce that spot only, leaving the two edges of the fascia. Then turn the needle and pierce it from the outer part to the inner part at the two edges of the fascia.
Then pierce both from the outer part to the inner part, at two other edges of the wound on the opposite side.
And this is the best and most common method of suturing.
Galen said this statement, and some attest to it, that one must sew the belly with two needles, each having a thread;
and one must insert one needle on one side and the other on the opposite side, in the manner of those who sew straps;
and know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the stitching is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
The treatment of the wound is the same as the treatment of other wounds:
and it is that when you find the wound fresh with all its blood, before the inflammation has altered it, you must replace the intestine and sew it;
then apply the powder that generates flesh, and if the inflammation has altered it, apply any available ointment until the wound suppurates; and let the threads fall off, and let the scar and the healing unite; then treat the wound as with others, until it is healed;
and if you lack medicines, then as soon as it begins to discharge pus, apply old cotton and change it twice a day until it is healed.
For you have no need of other medicines in many cases when the wounds are simple;
and if you fear that the wound might cause complications to the principal members, you must soak light wool in moderately heated oil or rose oil and apply it around the groins and under the armpits;
and if there is pain or putrefaction in the bowels, which often happens, administer an enema of warm black wine, especially if the putrefaction reaches the intestine;
and pierce it inside, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small one.
The intestine called "jejunum" cannot heal when it is injured, and this is due to the density of the veins there, the delicacy of the whole body, and its proximity in nature to the nerves.
And if the mesentery protrudes from the wound, replace it as you would the intestine, as long as it is fresh;
and if it is old and has turned green or black, you must tie off the blackened area to prevent blood flow there, as there are veins and arteries;
then cut what lies between the ligatures, and let the two ends hang down from below the wound to the outside to facilitate the removal when the mesentery falls, and the wound suppurates.
Of the rupture of the bowel
When the intestine is round and the wound is small, it can be repaired in some men, as I saw a man who was wounded in the belly by a lance;
and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and it became old and turned into a fistula, and excretions and gas escaped from it;
I treated it as best I could and persisted in my efforts until it was healed and the place closed up.
And when I saw it close, I feared that the patient might have pain in his belly; but he had no pain and remained in better health, eating and drinking.
And some practitioners said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be bound in this way: Take clamps with large heads, then bring together the lips of the wound, and when the clamp opens its jaws, place it on the two lips so that it pinches them shut;
then cut off the head of the clamp, and it holds so that it cannot come loose, then place another clamp in the same way as before, until the wound is entirely closed; and sew the wound.
The heads burn off in the intestine and cause no harm to the patient, and the intestine can also be tied with a fine thread made from the intestine of an animal, in this way:
Take the end of this thread from the intestine, which should be very clean, then tie a fine twisted linen thread to its end, then thread it through a needle, sew the intestine, and return it to the rupture.
And this method of sewing with clamps is nothing but a path of confidence and hope;
And if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the small intestines, there is neither art nor health to be found, except through great delicacy.
Of a fistula, wherever it may be Know that any wound or abscess, when it grows old, is universally called a “fistula,” especially when it is hardened and emits pus.
And a fistula is, in truth, a hardened and whitish knotty swelling where no pain is felt, and it is as closed as the quill of a bird.
And sometimes clear pus escapes from it, and other times thick; sometimes little, and other times a great deal;
And I have already spoken of this in the classification of wounds, that any wound that does not heal and has no flesh, is due only to one of nine causes: namely, the smallness of the blood or the body; or its malignancy; or because there is hard flesh within it or on its lips, preventing new flesh from forming; or there is too much pus; or the area is rotten, and the matter is of poor quality; or the medicine used in the treatment is not effective; or because the corruption is of a pestilential nature; or because the nature of the region causes delayed digestion, slow healing, and natural swelling; or there are veins or bones present:
And I have already shown all these causes, their signs, and their treatments in the classification.
Now it is necessary that I explain to you the treatment of a fistula that is done by manual operation.
Know that fistulas occur in all parts of the body; for there are fistulas that come to the large veins, and to the arteries, and to the nerves, or to the diaphragm, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to certain ribs, or to the spine, or to any joint of the hands or feet; and there are some that occur in the essence of a principal member, and in similar places.
And all the fistulas of this nature are difficult to heal, and there is nothing but effort and ignorance.
And if there is any fistula that does not reach the places I have mentioned, and you are confident of the cure, and you want to examine it, then take a probe of bronze or iron, and if the fistula is straight, explore it;
and if the fistula is twisted, examine it with a fine probe of lead, for lead bends easily around the twists;
and if the fistula has several openings and you cannot examine it well with probes, then inject it through one of the openings, for the moisture will flow from one opening to another and cleanse it;
then carefully examine it as best as you can, to determine if there is bone or nerve involved, and if it ends deeply, and ask the patient well about the pain he feels when you press with your hand, and where he feels it;
and when you truly know the location where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or in one of the places I mentioned to you, then cut it according to what I have told you, and remove the foulness and the decayed flesh inside;
and then treat it until it is healed, and if the fistula is very deep and straight, you must cut it deeply, as far as you can, then place probes moistened with a sharp medicine, and insert them to the end of the fistula, so that the medicine corrodes the excess tissue remaining at the bottom;
and then apply ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed by this, cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, cut it.
If neither vein nor nerve nor principal members trouble you, as we have said;
and if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, scrape it until all the corruption is removed, then treat it with things that generate flesh until it is healed;
and if it is not healed, and pus continues to flow as before, know that you have not reached the bottom:
then uncover and search until you reach the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the site;
and if it is healed thus, it is good. If not, know that the corruption is too deep for you to reach; there is no other remedy than to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small corrupted bone, and you can extract it with forceps, extract it with a suitable instrument, and if there are several bones, extract them all, leaving not a single one;
and if the moisture troubles you, and there is no error or fear, then cut away the moisture and flesh, and expose the bones.
And if you cannot remove them all at once, apply to the wound something that generates rot, and leave it until the area around the bones is rotted, and then the bones will come out more easily;
and if it is a large bone, such as from the leg or thigh, scrape only the corrupted part until all the blackness is removed, then restore the wound;
and if a large part of it is corrupted and it reaches the marrow of the bone; then it must be filed and cut down to the corruption, and then treated until it is joined;
and I will tell you about a fistula that occurred in a man’s leg, so that you may take example and aid from it in your work.
There was a young man of about 30 years who had pain in his leg due to an internal cause, so much so that the substances came to his leg, and it became swollen with a large abscess, and there was no external reason to open it.
But the doctors, through their recklessness, worked on it so much that the abscess opened, and a lot of matter flowed out, and it became a fistula, and many openings appeared, all of which discharged pus and moisture from the body.
And many doctors treated it for about two years, but there was no one skilled in the art of surgery until I was called, and I saw his leg and the medicines with which they were treating it, and the substances flowing copiously from the openings. And the young man's body was becoming red and had a sallow color.
I inserted a probe into one of these openings, and then examined all the openings and found that one connected to the other from all parts of the leg.
I then hastened and cut into one of the openings until I exposed a part of the bone, and I found it corrupted and perforated, and the corruption extended into the bone.
I sawed away the part of the corrupted bone that was visible to me and thought there was no other corruption except what I had removed.
And I began to treat the wound with healing medicines over a long time, but it could not heal.
And then I started again, exposed the bone as before, and found the corruption continuing in the bone; I sawed it, removed it, and worked to heal the site. But I could not succeed until I cut around a palm’s length of the bone and removed it entirely, then treated it with medicines. And he was healed and cured quickly, and there was no need to restart the work except due to the patient’s weakness, as he could not endure it, and because of the fear I had for his life. For due to the evacuation, he often bled, but he was completely healed, and in place of the bone, a hard flesh grew, which was of good quality and caused no harm or hindrance whatsoever, neither in walking nor in movement.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, it must be sawed in this manner: Take a cord, and tie it to the end of the bone that is exposed, and instruct someone to pull it upward. Then take another cord of wool, thicker than the first cord, and tie it over the flesh above the bone, and stretch it, so that you draw the corrupted flesh downward and expose the flesh over the site where you want to saw, ensuring that the saw does not harm the flesh.
And place a stick or a board beneath the bone to stabilize it while cutting the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary to saw as much as one can see and feel the corruption, and saw again if needed.
And if the bone is corrupted but not exposed, and the corruption is in the middle or in a section, then uncover all the flesh.
Then place a stick beneath, and then saw from one end of the corruption to the other, with the sawing following the length of the corruption as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, then cut the corrupted joint and saw the bone where it connects on the other side.
And if the corruption is at the connection of two joints, then there is no remedy other than cutting.
And if the corruption is in the wrist of the hand or the ankle of the foot, it is very difficult, but you must still investigate this corrosion and determine how it manifests. And clean it in every way you can, provided the veins or nerves do not cause you trouble.
And know that the knives and saws for cutting these bones are of many types, according to the position of the bones, their appearance, their thickness, their delicacy, their size, their smallness, and their hardness. And thus it is necessary to prepare the instrument suited to each kind of operation.
And know that the work will show you the instrument you will need, according to the knowledge of this art and the observation of the forms of the diseases. Thus, consider carefully the instrument you need according to what is required.
The flesh rots either from an internal cause or from an external cause.
And when you have treated this corrosion with medicinal cures and they do not work, it is necessary to cut that limb up to where the corrosion extends, so that the patient escapes death or, worse, the harm caused by the loss of the limb.
And the signs are that the limb becomes black, so that it seems as though it has been burned by fire, and it rots after the blackening; then the corrosion spreads from limb to limb and takes over the entire body.
So hasten to cut it, and if it is caused by the sting of some venomous creatures, like a sea scorpion or a viper or similar, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, then cut it off and do not let it reach the hand.
And if it reaches the hand, cut it off at the joint so that the corrosion does not reach the arm.
And if it reaches the arm, cut it off at the elbow.
And if it passes the elbow, it is death, and no remedy will help except the amount of his strength.
And do the same when the corrosion reaches the foot. If it reaches the first joint, cut it after the next joint.
And if it reaches the foot, cut off the entire foot. And if it rises to the leg, cut it off at the knee joint.
And if it goes above the knee, there is no other solution than to leave the patient to die.
And the method for cutting or sawing the limb is that you tie it above and below, and one assistant pulls one tie downward and another assistant pulls the other tie upward, and you sever the flesh between the two ties to a width of one span, so that the bone is exposed.
Then cut or saw it, and place on each side a piece of linen cloth so that the saw does not touch the healthy area and cause the patient another wound or a hot abscess.
And if blood flow comes during the operation, cauterize the site quickly or apply some astringent powders.
Then return to your medicine until the procedure is complete, then bind the injured limb with an appropriate bandage and treat it until it is healed.
And I will tell you what happened to a man concerning his foot.
He developed a blackening that seemed like a burn from fire, and this corrosion first appeared in his toe, until it affected the whole foot.
And when the man saw the corrosion, he hurried to cut off his foot, and he was healed.
And a long time later, the corrosion returned in a finger of his hand, and he came to me, and I applied counteracting treatments after purifying the body, but the corrosion could not stop.
And he wanted me to cut off his hand, but I did not wish to, as I had hope of counteracting the condition. And I also feared that if I amputated his hand, he might die, as the man's strength was weak.
And he despaired completely, returned to his land, hurried to cut off his hand, and was healed.
And I have recounted this only so that one may do likewise, if needed.
Sometimes an abscess appears in a fleshy area and remains so long that it causes a large accumulation of pus. Then it bursts and opens, and the pus flows out, leaving the area hollow, like a vessel. And the skin above it is as thin as a delicate cloth and does not reach the bone or the nerve, and such a condition is called a “sain” and not a “fistula.”
But if it is so deep that it reaches the bone, it is called a “fistula.”
And the treatment is that you cut away all the skin around it, especially when it is thin, like a cloth. And this is necessary because of its corruption.
And if you believe that the skin is inflamed, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, treat it with a clyster in this way:
observe if the swelling is large, and the discharge that flows from it has a foul odor, then treat it with an Egyptian medicine prepared in this way: take garlic, oil, and litharge in equal parts, and cook them in a vessel over the fire until the medicine becomes red and as thick as honey;
then take from it as needed, dissolve it in water and honey, and use it to cleanse the swelling, squeezing out the opening; and leave the medicine in for two hours, then extract it by pressing;
do this many times until the swelling is cleansed and the stench is removed;
and sometimes it is cleansed with ash water when this medicine is unavailable, which is made by taking vinewood ashes, pouring water over them, then straining it, and using it to cleanse until you are sure the swelling is well purified;
and if the patient cannot tolerate it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the ash water, then cleanse it with water and honey mixed with a little ground litharge; or cleanse it with a mixture of honey and wine, as honey has the property of cleaning and washing, and wine causes the swelling to dry out;
and when you have done this and believe the swelling is well cleaned, treat it with something that promotes the growth of flesh in it, such as diafin plaster mixed with rose oil and wine;
or cleanse it with certain medicines and ointments whose properties I have described in the treatise on ointments;
and if the opening of the swelling is small and the nozzle of the cleanser cannot enter, enlarge it slightly with a tool, and insert a plug of Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment, so that it becomes widened;
and if the wound is too large, sew it up, leaving only an opening through which the cleanser can enter, and if the opening from which the discharge flows is above, cut it lower;
and if you cannot cut the breast below as you wish, arrange it so that the pus flows to the lowest place where it is, for when the pus is deep, do not allow flesh to grow there, and if you cannot cut the breast below as you wish, arrange it in such a manner: that the pus flows easily downward, and leave none of the pus there;
that the pus flows easily downward, and leave none of the pus there; and take consolidative medicines to apply to the breast, and spread them on a linen cloth that covers the entire breast; then cut with scissors at the opening of the breast a little larger than the first, then spread a soft ointment on another cloth according to the size of the opening, and place it on the opening of the breast to ease the pus, and do not remove the large cloth except after many days, once;
and the one on the opening of the breast, remove it often to take out the pus, and note what flows from the pus, whether it is venomous or little or much, digested or undigested;
and observe whether the patient feels pain or not, and whether there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine is applied in this manner and you see the tissue springing up over the opening of the breast, then know that the breast is already healing, and health is approaching;
and then untie it in the morning or on the third day, and when you untie the wound, replace the cloth and renew the ointment.
And if subtle venom flows after a long time, do not despair of healing, for health is approaching.
For there are men whose flesh is slow to grow in their wounds, and others in whom the opposite occurs;
and if undigested pus springs from the breast after many days, know that the breast is not healing;
and if the breast is slow to heal and delayed, add medicines that are moist in substance and dry in virtue, such as the ointment called diafinit, for it contains a large part of vitriol, and it is the ultimate medicine;
take the ointment diafinit, and prepare it with rose oil, and sprinkle it with aged wine equal in substance;
then preserve it and use it;
and this same effect is achieved by well-cooked thickened honey, when the ointment diafinit is not available, or you take myrrh, aloe, and incense, grind them, and powder them over the honey while it is on the fire;
and then soak a cloth in it, and spread it over the breast, and sometimes administer long aristolochia and roots of heavenly lily, which is like the flour of vetch and centaury; and use these in simple or composite form: grind them, make a powder, and put it on the honey I mentioned, and use it;
and if the cure is prolonged, and is not achieved through this treatment, then know that the corruption is deep, and has affected the bone, the hard tissues, or the ligaments; then treat it as a case of fistula, as we have said previously.
A whitlow is an abscess that forms beneath the nail of the finger of the hand, or the foot, or sometimes forms on other fingers;
and when it becomes chronic, and no attention is paid to it, a hot abscess forms there, spreads, and expels pus to such an extent that it reaches the root of the nail, and sometimes consumes it entirely;
and the corrosion reaches the bone, causing a foul-smelling pain, and the tip of the finger becomes swollen, and its color darkens.
When you treat it as we have explained in the division, and the treatment does not succeed, you must cut away all the remnants of the nail with a blade, then cauterize the wound afterward. The cautery is a great help if the bone is healthy, and the nail is sound.
and if the nail presses into the flesh and begins to puncture and injure it, you must insert a wedge under the nail where it pierces the flesh, lift it upward, and carefully cut away that flesh gently, then apply burning and corrosive medicines to remove all of it; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corrosion has reached the bone, cut it and remove it, for as long as the corrupted bone remains, it cannot heal;
and if you see the finger decaying, cut it off at one of the joints as previously described, then treat it until it is healed;
and if it is struck and inflamed, and there is great pain, you must first bleed it;
then cut the nail with a sharp spatumile, cutting across above it, and ensure that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for the patient would feel too great pain;
and if this happens, apply something to ease the pain.
The extra fingers that appear on the hands of some men are sometimes entirely fleshy, sometimes they contain bones, and sometimes they have nails, and some of them grow at the root of the joint, or the growth occurs in certain joints of the fingers.
Those that grow on some joints of the finger do not move, but those that grow at the joint of the finger sometimes do move;
The removal of the fleshy one is simple, as follows: Cut it at its root with a broad spatumile.
Those that grow at the root of the joint are difficult to treat: so refrain from cutting.
For one that grows on the back joint of the finger, you must first cut the flesh circularly down to the bone, then cut the bone with an appropriate saw, and then treat it until it is healed.
The joining that occurs between fingers happens from birth, or by adhesion of a wound, or by burning with fire, or by similar causes.
You must cut this adhesion so that the fingers regain their natural forms; then place between them tents or cloths soaked in rose oil, so that they do not adhere again; or place between them thin pieces of lead until the area heals as it should.
If adhesion occurs between one of these fingers and the palm, cut this adhesion as necessary.
Boils are swollen veins filled with melancholic superfluities, which occur in various parts of the body;
and they occur more frequently on the legs of those who walk, work, and carry loads than on others.
It is necessary, therefore, to administer purging of the bile at times, and then treat them with basilicum ointment.
The treatment with iron is of two types: one is to cut them and draw out the black blood; and the other method is to lift the vein and extract it entirely.
The cutting is done in this manner: First, bathe the leg in very hot water so that the thick blood becomes thinned, then bind the patient's leg from above the thigh down to the part below the knee.
Then cut the vein in one place, or in two or three, with a wide incision, and draw out the black blood with your hand from one end to the other, until as much blood as the patient's strength can bear has been let out.
Then bind it, and instruct him to abstain from foods that generate black bile.
And resume the evacuation and the bleeding when the veins are full, and it harms the patient.
The removal of it is done in this manner: Raise the patient’s leg, if it has much hair, then place it in a bath and bathe the leg in hot water until it becomes red and the veins swell.
And if you do not have a bath, warm it by the fire, and then cut along the vein either at the top of the knee or in the part below near the ankle.
Then open the skin with a hook and strip the vein on each side until it is visible to the touch.
And it appears red and black, and when it enters the skin, it looks like a white cord.
Then insert the hook beneath it until it is raised from the skin, and then hang it gently on a hook, then cut it in another place three fingers higher.
Then strip the skin over the vein until it is visible, then raise it with the hook as you did before, and hang it on another hook as you did the first.
Then make another cut, or several if needed, then raise it and cut it at the toe of the foot, then draw and raise it up to the second cut.
Then pull it out cut by cut until it is entirely out, then sever it.
And if you cannot pull and raise it, insert a needle with a strong double thread, tie it, pull it, insert a hook beneath it, and twist your hand from one side to the other until it comes out. And take care not to let it break, for if it breaks, it cannot be pulled or raised, and harm will come to the patient.
And when you have entirely removed it, place over the wound site wool soaked in wine and rose oil. And treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted, twisted, and coiled together, and it is not straight as we have said, you must slit it crookedly but not cut it. And pull it as we have described before.
The shape of the tool used to cut the vein is curved and does not slice so as not to cut the vein.
And it is of a thick curve, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein, but it must be thick as we have said, and here is its shape:
This vein forms in the legs, in warm regions where no grass or trees grow, and in lands without moisture.
And it may sometimes form elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens from putrefaction that arises beneath the skin, as serpents and worms form within the body, nestled between skin and flesh.
And the signs of the onset of this vein are that a very great inflammation appears in the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to protrude, like the root of a plant.
When the head appears, you must wrap it around with a piece of lead weighing one and a half to two ounces, and tie it, leaving the lead hanging from the leg, and each time a part emerges outside, wrap it around the lead and tie it.
And if it is too long, cut off a portion and wrap the remainder, but do not cut it at the root until it is completely removed. For if you cut it, it will retreat into the flesh and cause an abscess and decay at the site, and severe illness.
For this reason, it must be drawn out little by little to the end, leaving nothing behind in the body.
And sometimes this vein, when removed, is five handspans long or even ten. A man once came to me whose vein was ten handspans long, and when you cut it, insert a hook or probe and pierce it deeply so that it is entirely removed.
And the material inside must be emptied, and apply medicines to the site to counteract putrefaction for some days, then treat it as with abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has fewer roots, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, where many openings appear and roots sprout.
Treat it then as we have described above.
Of worms that are born between skin and flesh This disease is called in our land "ox disease" because it often occurs in oxen, and it is a small worm born between skin and flesh, which travels throughout the body, ascending and descending, and can be felt as it moves from limb to limb until it pierces the skin where it travels and emerges.
And it is generated by the decay of certain humors, just as worms, serpents, earthworms, and ascarids arise in the belly.
And its malice is feared, for when it travels through the body, and ascends to the head, and reaches the eye, it sometimes enters and destroys the eye. And this happens often.
When you wish to treat and remove it, it can only be drawn out when it is moving.
Thus, you must bind the area above and below it with a strong and tight band, then cut above and draw it out. If the worm is deep in the flesh and you cannot find it, cauterize the area with fire until it dies.
And the greatest harm it causes is that it destroys the eye, as we have said.
And if you see it moving toward the head near the eye, press tightly beneath the eyebrow, then cut above and draw it out.
And the patient must undergo purification of the body with dissolving medicines for the corrupted humors, and abstain from foods that generate putrefaction.
Of pain caused by windiness This disease is called in our land "vakirir," and it is a pain that occurs in certain limbs and can then move from limb to limb.
And I have seen what I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm.
And shortly after, I saw it rise like a worm to the shoulder, faster than anything, like quicksilver as it moves from one place to another.
The pain left that place and lodged in the shoulder, and then shortly after ran throughout the body until it reached the other arm.
Then she told me that it kept moving around her body, as I had seen.
I marveled greatly at how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this disease behave in this manner. Nevertheless, I had seen many cases where pain moved from one place to another, but I had never seen it as I did in this woman.
And I thought it was because the woman had a dry body and exposed veins, and thus this constrained windiness appeared.
And this does not appear in those who are delicate, with moist bodies and covered veins.
And when you wish to treat this illness, and the patient feels that pain, if it appears to you as we have said, then quickly bind it above and below, and then cut over it until that swelling, forced into place, escapes outward; and cauterize the spot;
and if you do not see it with your eyes, treat it with something that expels swelling, such as fetid pills, serapin pills, and similar remedies.
Arrows are diverse, according to their forms and the parts of the body where they strike.
The diversity among them is that there are those with large points, and small ones, and those that are barbed and welded; and those with two edges, and those with tongues, and those made of segments;
and those that strike a limb do so in two ways: either in a principal organ, such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar organs. When it strikes any of these places, and the signs of death, which I will tell you shortly, appear to you: then you must refrain from extracting this arrow, for death will follow in many circumstances; and when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not deeply embedded, then extract it, and treat the wound.
The signs for the brain when an arrow strikes it and pierces the bone, and the cerebral fluid that is above the brain escapes, include dizziness, sudden fainting, vertigo, redness in the eyes, inflammation and redness of the tongue, spasms and confusion of thought, and vomiting of bile; and sometimes it escapes in fluid from the nostrils or ears; and sometimes speech and voice are lost; and from the wound escapes a white moisture resembling pus, and sometimes also fragments of flesh;
and if these signs appear to you, refrain from treatment, and do not extract the arrow if it is embedded.
The signs for the arrow when it strikes the heart are that it is near the left breast, and it feels as though it is fixed in something hard, not hollow; and sometimes the arrow moves as the pulse does, and black blood flows, and coldness and cold sweat occur, and fainting: then know without doubt that death is near.
The signs of an arrow that injures the lung are that blood full of foam escapes from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, breathes heavily, and seeks cool air.
And if the arrow strikes the covering of the chest, it is near the lower ribs; and there is heavy breathing and great pain and sighing; and all the parts of the shoulders move.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, sometimes undigested food escapes from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the abdomen, and fecal matter escapes through the wound in the intestines, then there is no hope for a cure or for extracting the arrow.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine escapes and flows outward, and the patient feels severe pain: know that the wound is fatal.
The other parts, such as the face, the neck, the throat, the shoulders, the arms, the spine, the buttocks, the thighs, and the legs, and similar members, are safe in many cases. When the arrow is in a nerve or an artery, and it is not venomous, as I will tell you happened to me, so that you may act in the same way.
It happened to a man that an arrow fell into his tear duct at the root of his nose: I examined it and extracted it from the other side beneath the fat of the ear, and he was healed without complications.
And I extracted an arrow from an eye, which had fallen into the fat of the eye beneath the eyelid, and the arrow was lodged, and I could only reach its point near the shaft, and the arrow was large, from a Turkish bow, with a light head without barbs;
the eye was healed, and no bad complications occurred.
And I extracted an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and it was an Arabian arrow with barbs:
I smoothed the barbs and worked delicately until I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted an arrow from a man, which had fallen into his belly, and I thought he would die;
and after thirty days had passed, his condition had not changed; I cut above the arrow, manipulated it, and extracted it, and there were no bad complications.
And I saw a man into whose back an arrow had fallen, and the wound was sealed over;
and the arrow remained inside him, and his natural functions did not change, nor did he experience any harm in any of his natural actions.
And I saw another man into whose face an arrow had fallen, and the wound was sealed; and he remained thus without suffering great pain;
and many other similar cases.
And I extracted an arrow from a man among the king's princes, which had fallen into the middle of his nose, and was slightly inclined to the right side; and the arrow was entirely lodged.
I was called to treat it three days after it had fallen. I found the wound very narrow.
I probed it with a fine probe and could not feel it; and he felt pricking and pain beneath his right ear.
I thought it was from the arrow's point. I applied an adhesive and digestive plaster to the spot so that the area would not swell; and the location of the arrow became apparent to me.
and the location of the arrow became apparent to me. I applied the plaster for several days, and the wound healed again, and the patient remained like this for a long time, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose;
and he told me about it. I applied a corrosive, sharp medicine to the wound for several days, until it opened, and I probed it and felt the head of the arrow embedded in the spot;
then I added more of that sharp medicine to the opening of the wound, until the head of the arrow became visible to me;
and about four months passed, and then the wound widened enough that I inserted the pincers, moved it from one side to the other, and it could not come out;
then I did not stop delicately working and manipulating with different instruments until one day I grasped it with well-made pincers, as their design will be described at the end of this chapter, and I extracted it and restored the wound.
And the physicians judged that the cartilage of the nose could not be restored: I restored it, then, and the wound healed, and the patient was completely cured.
Now I have told you the details of extracting certain arrows, so that you may apply your skill to what I do not say, for the book cannot encompass everything;
but the wise master draws great knowledge from little, and based on what is present and what is missing, discovers new procedures and new instruments for addressing the strange occurrences that arise in this art.
I say that arrows can only be removed from the parts where they are lodged in two ways: either through the place where they entered, or through another spot;
and those that exit through where they entered are arrows lodged in fleshy areas, and they sometimes come out immediately.
And if it does not come out immediately, then leave it until the flesh rots around it, and the way out is eased;
and likewise, if it is lodged in the bone and cannot come out, then leave it like this for several days, and move it daily;
and then it will come out, and if it does not, then pierce around it with a fine drill until the area around it is widened, and then extract it.
And if the arrow is lodged in a part of the body so that it cannot be seen, then search for it with a probe; and if you feel it, then extract it with a suitable instrument;
and if you cannot because of the narrowness of the wound and the depth of the arrow, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the way, then widen the wound until it is large enough;
and extract the arrow if you can, and if the arrow has barbs by which it holds, then remove the flesh embedded in them on both sides as much as you can, and then break or bend the barbs of the arrow until you can extract it;
and work carefully so as not to break the arrow, for extracting it would then become more difficult.
And if you cannot extract it at once, then leave it until the surrounding area becomes rotten, and then extract it, for the extraction will be easier. And if the flow of blood opposes you, then administer what we have discussed regarding treatment in its chapter;
and beware of cutting into a nerve or vein, and plan how you can remove the arrow without danger, whether quickly or slowly, forcefully or gently;
and position the patient in the way he was when the arrow fell into him, for that is the greatest aid there is, and if you cannot, then position him as the signs indicate to you.
An arrow that comes out the other side, where something of it is visible, or where the skin is swollen so that it can be seen or felt clearly:
then cut above it, so that the pincers can grip it, and then extract it: and it will come out immediately.
And if it is stuck in the bone, then rotate your hand gently, so that it enters the bone and widens it, then extract it.
And if it cannot come out, then leave it again, and then restart the extraction until it comes out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is there, then push it out with the shaft;
and if the shaft has fallen off, and you want to apply pressure, then use a capped instrument so that the point of the arrow enters the cap of the instrument;
and then push it out, and if the arrow is broken, then use an instrument with an inward-pointing tip to ease the extraction.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut away all the flesh around where the poison is, if you can, then treat the wound as needed.
And if the arrow falls into the foot, the belly, the bladder, or the side, and it is near the surface, and you can cut above it, then cut;
and take care not to cut the vein or the nerve, and then extract it, and then sew the wound, if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the pincers used to extract arrows resembles the beak of a bird, and here is the design:
And there are many types: large, medium, and small, depending on the size of the arrow.
The shape of the capped pusher is also like the quill of a bird, to press against the point of the arrow, as this design shows:
There are thirty-one veins for bleeding, of which sixteen are in the head, namely: Two pulsating veins behind the ears, which are called the two "herbech"; And the two arteries visible in the temples; And two veins in the tear ducts of the eyes, which are called "aspires"; And the vein in the middle of the forehead; And the vein at the tip of the nose; And the two guindeges in the neck; And the two veins in the lips above the mouth, which are called "augeherich"; And two veins beneath the tongue.
The veins commonly used for bleeding are five in each arm:
One is the cephalic vein, on the left side, called by common folk the "head vein"; The middle one is called "faste," composed of the cephalic and basilic veins, and commonly called the "heart vein"; The basilic vein is on the right side, called by common folk the "belly vein," located on the fold, and it is the one most clearly visible on the wrist.
The salvatelle is the vein between the little finger and the ring finger, and it has two branches;
And in the leg and foot, there are three veins: One is below the curve of the hollow on the left side, the second is the saphenous vein at the ankle on the right side; And the vein called "nesse," which is at the ankle on the other side;
And in the other leg, there are three veins below these.
Bleeding from the veins behind the ears helps with chronic catarrh and migraines;
And the procedure for bleeding, as I tell you, is to raise the patient's head and rub the area of the veins with a coarse cloth; Then the patient's neck is tightened with a band, so the two veins appear behind the ears in two places connected to the head: Find them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse beneath your finger, there bleed on one side;
Then take the lancet and insert it beneath the vein up to the bone, then lift your hand along the vein, cutting both the skin and the vein by about two finger-widths, letting the blood flow as much as you wish;
Then bind it tightly until it heals;
And I have already explained the incision and cauterization in the first book.
Bleeding from the two arteries in the temples is effective for chronic migraines, sudden migraines, persistent ophthalmia, and sharp tear pains in the eyes;
And the procedure for bleeding is as I describe: The patient tightens their neck so that the two veins become clearly visible; Feel the pulse under your finger, and then bleed on one side;
Then lift the vein upward with your index finger, insert the lancet beneath it, elevate the vein, and cut it as you have done with the other two veins, letting the blood flow according to your need;
Then untie the patient, press your finger on the vein for an hour, and afterward apply cotton to it; Then bind it tightly and leave it until it is healed;
And we have already spoken about their cutting and extraction in the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the vein in the forehead is as effective as bleeding from the cephalic vein for chronic facial diseases, migraines, and redness;
And the procedure is that the patient tightens their neck while twisting it so that the vein becomes visible; Then take the instrument called "fosseur," whose form is as follows:
Place its point on the vein, strike it with your hand or another object, and let the blood flow according to the quantity you desire; Then release the patient's neck and bind the vein until it heals, sometimes using a wide flame for the procedure.
Nevertheless, the lancet must not be too sharp; Bleed it crosswise, for the bone is near, and the lancet may break if it is too delicate.
Bleeding from the two veins in the tear ducts helps the eyes, scaly eruptions, redness, swelling in the eye, and facial diseases;
And the procedure for their bleeding is for the patient to tighten their neck by twisting it with some band, as described before;
Then bleed it, making the incision crosswise and slightly along the length with a somewhat wide lancet, as there is little flesh there. If the lancet is too delicate, it might break.
Let the blood flow as much as needed, then apply cotton and bind it tightly.
Bleeding from the vein in the nose is effective for acute fevers, sudden fits of madness, facial diseases such as migraines and redness of the face, especially when chronic;
The procedure for the bleeding is for the patient to tighten their neck, then for you to pinch their nose with your left hand and take a long, delicate lancet. Insert it into the space in the middle of the lip, between the two nostrils, since the vein is not easily visible there, and the blood will immediately begin to flow.
Do not go too deep, let the blood flow as needed, then bind it for the night, as it heals very quickly.
Bleeding from the two guindeges helps with constriction of the groin, the onset of leprosy, many illnesses, scabs, corrosive ulcers, herpes, and tumors.
The procedure for this bleeding is for the patient to tighten their neck beneath one or the other vein, as we have mentioned.
The practitioner should stand above the patient's head, while the patient sits on a seat. Bleed the vein along its length with a somewhat wide incision, letting the blood flow moderately or as much as needed.
Then repeat the procedure on the other vein, untie the band, and compress both veins moderately so the patient does not choke. Leave it until morning, so the wound can heal.
On bleeding from the lips Bleeding from the veins of the upper lips helps with excess moisture in the mouth, gum infections, chapped lips, and nasal issues and their surroundings.
The procedure for this bleeding is to have the patient sit in front of you and tighten their neck as I described. Then turn the lip and observe the two veins, one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left, recognizable by their dark color and the small black veins surrounding them.
Cut both veins, and if you cannot identify them or are unsure, cut the largest on each side. Do the same with the two veins above and below, as the method is the same.
On bleeding beneath the tongue Bleeding from the veins beneath the tongue helps after bleeding from the cephalic vein and is useful for throat constriction, uvula diseases, and mouth diseases.
The procedure for this bleeding is to have the patient sit between your hands in the sunlight, lift their tongue, and observe a black vein on each side beneath it.
Bleed both veins, but do not go too deep, as the arteries are beneath them.
The veins in the wrist commonly bled are bled in two ways:
Either by using a wide lancet shaped like a myrtle leaf, or a delicate olive-shaped one resembling a sharp knife, called "anesil"; They are wide or delicate, depending on the width or narrowness of the veins. The form of the myrtle-leaf lancet is very renowned, and it is as wide as you see:
It is necessary to open the prominent veins filled with thick, visible blood, which contain thick and troubled blood; and this is the shape of the olive-shaped lancet:
and it is more finely pointed and is for bleeding the fine veins where there is fine citrine-colored blood.
The bleeding of the basilica, which is one of these veins, helps with diseases beneath the throat, in the neck, chest, and abdomen;
and it is necessary for the surgeon to bleed carefully and to beware of the artery that is below. And if he cuts the artery and a flow of blood occurs, it must be stanched, as I have said; and the lancet should not be piercing, but cutting, like a little blade.
And if the basilica does not appear clearly, you must compress it and choose another; or you seek one of its branches, or you bleed instead the vein in the middle of the arm: it appears clearly; and you cut it with the small blade, as we have said.
And if you want to know the location for bleeding, you must first compress the arm and touch the spot until you feel the pulse; then mark the spot with ink, tie the arm, and cut the vein with the small blade; and take care not to strike the artery when you see the spot swelling, for it is the artery: avoid it then.
And if you see it spurting upward like a child’s urine, and the blood is red and fine, know that it is arterial blood: then hurry, press your finger on it for a long time, and remove it only if the blood stops, which often happens; tie the arm and leave it so, and let the patient remain still;
and be cautious, and do not let him move until he is healed.
And if the blood does not stop, overwhelms you, and medicine is not at hand, then cut the artery if it appears, for its ends retract; and staunch the blood.
Take a pistachio bark, split it, take one of the halves and bind it tightly until the next day;
if the blood stops, it is good; if not, treat it as we have said, with powders that staunch blood;
and the stanching is not difficult in many cases because of the smallness of the wound and the tightness of the band on the arm.
Bleeding from the middle vein helps as it draws blood from the upper head and lower body, since it is formed by the basilica and cephalic veins, as we have said;
and the surgeon must beware of the nerve that is below, for if he pricks too deeply and strikes the nerve, it will swell, the healing will be difficult, and perhaps it will not heal;
and this nerve often appears, but if it does not appear in some people due to its subtlety, you must bleed it with the small instrument; and avoid the nerve to the best of your ability.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, cut it lengthwise.
The bleeding of the cephalic vein helps as it draws blood from the head and aids the eyes;
and it is necessary to bleed with the olive-shaped or myrtle-shaped lancet, for it is the safest of all veins, as it has neither nerve nor artery below. However, you must seek the easiest spot, and it does not matter if you fail the first time; you can try again; and perhaps the spot may swell in some people when the first attempt fails, but it is not a problem.
The quality of the bloodletting is according to your intention.
The first thing you must know about bloodletting is that it is administered only to preserve health and to prevent future illnesses;
and the bloodletting should be done in one of the three veins located on the arm: namely, the cephalic, the median, and the basilica; and one must perform bloodletting at the beginning of spring while fasting, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of repletion appear;
and it should be done on the first or third day, two or three hours after dawn.
Bloodletting for illnesses has no fixed time but is done whenever necessary, by day or night, at any hour and at all times;
and children should not be bled until the age of fourteen, nor pregnant women except from the fourth to the seventh month. Nor should the elderly over sixty years old be bled.
And when someone wishes to be bled, in whatever manner it may be, it is necessary to cleanse the intestines with a mild enema if there is much retained waste, so that the veins do not draw harmful impurities from the intestines to the principal organs;
nor should someone be bled who is excessively full from food, nor one who is drunk, until they are sober, nor those with dropsy;
and one should avoid bleeding after colic, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual activity, labor, wakefulness, fasting, and anything that exhausts the vitality, either of the soul or the body;
then refine the humors, if the blood is thick, by foods, drinks, and medicines, if you have the ability;
then enter a bath, if nothing prohibits it, to refine the blood, and bleed yourself from the vein of the chest around the third hour, as we have said;
and on that day avoid work, strain, lust, and similar activities;
and be cheerful and joyful, and let the bleeder be higher than the person being bled, rub the arm two or three times, then tie the band moderately tight, for if it is too tight or too loose, the blood cannot flow;
then rub the spot with the hands until the veins swell and can be felt;
then moisten the lancet with a little old oil, and place the finger of the left hand on the vein below the spot where he wants to bleed, so that the vein does not move and fail when struck.
For there are veins that move like cords during bleeding, and there are some that are filled with air, so that when the lancet is applied, they retract, and the vein cannot be opened, and thus it happens with such veins. And if the vein is opened, the wound may be too narrow; therefore, the bleeder must be cautious in these matters.
And if the vein opens the first time, it is good; if not, then try again slightly below or above the spot quickly, as long as the area is not swollen.
And if the spot is swollen and the patient is alarmed, leave it for one or two days without binding the arm: possibly hot abscesses may form there;
do not enter the bath, then resume the bleeding if the patient is willing;
and if the opening is small, or the blood flows thinly, and you fear not enough blood will come out, strike in the same opening directly with the lancet;
and open it slightly and quickly, before the area becomes swollen; for this happens many times when the wound is small.
If you see the spot swell, do not resume the bleeding, and apply a bit of oil residue, for it soothes the flow of blood and is better in that spot than the oil itself;
and thus administer oil residue in each bloodletting when you bleed the veins, to stop the flow of blood;
and the same effect is achieved by theriac and ox balm when applied to the spot; it refines and spreads the blood when it is too thick.
And if there appears a large abscess, which happens often, especially when it is not bled except at that time when the vein’s opening is small, hasten, and apply a sponge soaked in water and slightly warm salt, and press it for an hour;
and it is necessary to do this after the blood flows from the vein, and if some blackness or greenness remains at the site after a few days, it does no harm; and if you wish, apply something of aloe or myrrh mixed in juice of calamint, pennyroyal, or the like.
And often there appears an abscess or swelling at the bleeding site of the basilica vein:
then place your hand on it, and if you find the site soft under the hand’s compression, this appearance is bad. Avoid then applying anything we have mentioned, for there is a risk that arterial blood may flow;
but make a dry plaster to harden the site, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And draw blood from each according to the quantity of his strength and the color of the blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it becomes red; and if you see it thick, let it flow until it becomes thinner; and if it is too warm, let it cool down.
And for someone who is full-blooded and strong, and needs blood extraction, it is necessary to make a larger incision, and use wide lancets;
and for someone who is weak, do the opposite, and they must be bled little and often, and bleeding must be done by cutting across, not by piercing;
and this manner of bleeding is safe from blood leakage and nerve cutting, and is better than bleeding along or across.
And to the one whose body fails due to bloodletting, it is necessary to give bread moistened in pomegranate juice; if he is heated, then draw blood three or four times. And if he is of a cold complexion, let him eat before the bloodletting bread moistened in must syrup, or in aromatic honey syrup with spices, such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, chickpeas, and a well-scented syrup.
And if he faints during the bloodletting, after the loss of much blood, it is necessary for him to sip meat broth and subtle aromatic syrup, and to use the other remedies that we have described in the section or chapter on fainting, for the evacuation of the vein.
And if he wishes to air his arm and bleed again, it is necessary, when he is weakened by heavy bloodletting, that he bleeds little by little, according to the measure of his ongoing strength.
And he who wishes to air his arm after the first bloodletting, and has a strong body, should bleed himself seven hours after the first bloodletting, or after the ninth hour.
And he who wishes to bleed another part should let blood on the second or third day.
For there is much blood in the body which is already heated, and it brings about fever; thus it is necessary to draw a large quantity, and widen the incision until he falls into faintness; then observe all the conditions of bloodletting, and place your hand on his pulse as he bleeds, so that death does not occur in place of fainting, as this happens often when the bloodletter is negligent;
and it is not proper, when you wish to untie the arm and let the blood flow a second time, and the incision is closed, to press strongly on it; nor if the arm is bent, that he should extend it hastily, for that would be harmful;
but leave it until it bleeds a second time; or prick it with the tip of the lancet, so that the blood which has coagulated in the vein exits outside, and apply a bit of salt dissolved in water, and press lightly on it.
And if the vein is swollen, then leave it and do not press on it, until the swelling subsides.
And if it is necessary to draw blood a second time, then bleed in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the middle of the arm is bled in place of the head vein because it is connected.
And the method of bloodletting is such that the patient places his hand in hot water until the veins are red;
then bind it moderately so that the veins appear clearly, then bleed it across, not wide nor long;
and let the incision be wide, and let the blood be drawn near the joint of the hand, and if the blood cannot flow, then place the hand back in hot water and let the blood flow into the water until you have enough;
and if it is in summer, do not put the hand back in hot water, for it is done more in winter than in summer;
and the bloodletting from this vein is safer than from all other veins, as there is neither artery nor nerve there.
The bloodletting from the inner part of the right hand is beneficial for all liver diseases, and this is the method:
press the hand and place it in hot water until the vein is swollen so that it can be seen; and bleed it across, and if you cut it completely, it does no harm;
and do not go too deep, for the nerves below are entirely bare of flesh, and then place the hand back in hot water if the blood has coagulated in the wound and cannot flow.
And when you have drawn as much blood as necessary, then apply oil and salt to the vein to heal it quickly, and do so for each vein.
The bloodletting from the left hand is beneficial for diseases of the spleen, and do exactly as I have described for the right side.
The bloodletting of the saphenous vein is beneficial for all diseases below the body, such as diseases of the womb, retention of menstrual flow, diseases of the kidneys, thighs, and chronic leg ailments, and similar conditions.
And the method of its bloodletting is that the patient places their foot in hot water and rubs the vein until it appears, then ties above the joint of the foot. The vein is at the ankle, and many branches extend above the foot.
Bleed it then either on the larger branch or at the ankle, for it is very effective.
And if you bleed it on the foot, be careful of the nerves below, and bleed it across as though cutting.
And let the lancet be rounded.
And if the blood cannot flow, place the foot back in the water and let the vein empty well.
And if the bloodletter misses the first time, try again a little higher, for the area is safe.
Do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and do the same for the saphenous vein of the other foot.
The location of the sciatic vein is at the outer ankle, and its bloodletting is effective for hip pain when it is caused by hot blood.
And the method of its bloodletting is that the patient enters a bath and presses four fingers above the ankle, twisting, for otherwise the vein does not appear.
And if it appears, bleed it in every way you can, cutting across. And it is better to cut it, for the area is safe, and it is well known among many people.
And it is better to cut it, for the area is safe, and it is well known among many people. And if you cannot find it, bleed one of its branches that appears on the top of the foot, near the little toe, and be careful of the nerves.
Let the blood flow as much as you want, then untie the binding, apply cotton, and press it. It will heal immediately.
Cups are made of horns, brass, or glass;
and cupping is done in two ways: either by striking and drawing blood or without striking.
And this cupping without striking is done in two ways: either with fire or without fire.
And cupping, which is done by striking and drawing blood, is performed in fourteen places on the body, one of which is on the crown of the head; another is in the middle of the neck; and two others are on the sides of the neck; and a cup below the chin; and cups on the two shoulders; and cups on the buttocks; and cups in the middle of the two arms; and cups on the two legs; and cups on the two ankles;
and cupping does not draw much blood, except from small veins scattered in the flesh, and thus it does not weaken the body as vein bloodletting does. And it is not appropriate for it to be applied, whether with fire or without, in any disease caused by overfullness, until the entire body is emptied.
And if cupping is necessary due to disease or custom, it should be applied at any time at the beginning of the month, at the end, in the middle, or at any time.
For there are those who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are those who find fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck, and dimness in their eyes;
and those who find a drop of blood in their mouth, have a swollen tongue, and spit blood; and there are those who dream and see blood, wounded people, corpses, and similar things at night.
And when we see these signs, especially in the middle of the month, we recommend cupping after three hours of the day.
Bloodletting from the basilic vein helps with head pains that come to the eyes, and it is not necessary for this to follow a complete evacuation of the body.
And this cupping serves in place of the cephalic vein bloodletting, and it is not suitable for those of a cold complexion or those who have catarrh, as it greatly harms them.
And thus it is not appropriate for elderly people or those with cold diseases in the head to use it.
And he who bleeds himself often becomes forgetful, and therefore it is necessary to place the cupping glass a little lower, for fear of forgetfulness.
The cupping at the middle of the neck serves in place of bloodletting from the head and basilic vein, and thus it is effective for constriction of the chest, splitting of the lung canal, cough, and fullness.
And it must be applied lightly, for if it grips too firmly, it causes forgetfulness or distress in the stomach and heart.
The cupping on the two sides of the neck is effective for head pain, ophthalmia, migraine, strangulation, and pain at the roots of the teeth, and serves in place of bloodletting from the basilic vein.
And you must instruct the healer to press with his hand when applying it, so that he does not cut an artery and cause a flow of blood.
The cupping below the chin is effective for mouth diseases, gum decay, and similar conditions affecting the mouth. And it serves in place of bloodletting from the two lips.
The cupping on the shoulders is effective for diseases caused by heat and fullness.
The cupping on the elbows is as effective as that on the three veins of the arm, as it draws blood from these large veins.
And instruct the healer not to strike too deeply, for the place is bare of flesh and lies over nerves and arteries.
The cupping glass applied to the lower back is effective for hemorrhoids of the rectum and diseases beneath it, and the cupping glass must be large and made of brass, as it needs to draw well. And perchance, if it were delicate, it would break. And it causes large wounds.
The cupping on the legs openly lets blood, as it draws blood from the entire body, and is effective for chronic pains in the loins, womb, and bladder, and eases menstruation.
And they serve in place of the two saphenous veins and the two ankles, yet they weaken the body after long use and cause fainting in many cases.
The manner of applying the cupping glass is that you first place it empty, suck moderately, and set it quickly, moving it evenly, and not ceasing until you see the place redden and swell, and the redness of the blood appear.
Then strike, reapply the cupping glass, and take heed of the body's condition, for there are those who have tender flesh and open pores. In such cases, it is necessary to strike only once, and to make large and somewhat deep wounds. And suck lightly.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to strike twice. The first time to refine the pathway of the thick blood.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to strike a third time.
And when we wish to draw blood little by little, once is sufficient. And if we wish to draw a lot of blood, we repeat often.
And if the blood is thick, strike deeply, and the limit is when the skin is pierced suddenly, and for one with thick and tough skin and narrow pores, you must anoint the cupping sites with opening and dissolving oils. If it is in summer, use oil of violet, sweet almond oil, or oil of gourd seed.
And if it is in winter, use oil of watercress, lily, chamomile, or similar.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, take oil of amaranth, balsamite, dill oil, or similar.
And if the one being bled has tender flesh and wide pores, no oil is needed, but they must be washed after cupping with rose water, cold water, nightshade water, gourd water, purslane water, or similar.
And one who has much moisture should rise with water of myrtle, sumac, or similar substances.
And those who have thick superfluities rise with old wine, or elder water, or a decoction of dill or chamomile, or other similar substances.
And it is not advisable to perform cupping before or during a bath, but rather an hour or two afterward.
And one must not sleep after cupping, and it is necessary to take precautions when one is about to be cupped and after being cupped.
And beware if the person being bled is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed. Then they must take cold things, such as pomegranates, endives, lettuce with vinegar, and similar items. And they should eat young chickens, capon meat, and moist foods.
And they should eat young chickens, capon meat, and moist foods. And one with a cold complexion should take honey syrup and aromatic medium wine, which is between old and new, eat little, and consume young chickens, small birds, and pigeons.
And on the day they are cupped, they should drink more than eat.
And it is sometimes necessary to give certain men treacle or nutmeg before or after cupping to strengthen the principal organs. And the blood should be refined, but those who are hot in nature must not drink it.
The cupping glasses applied without incision are those placed on the liver, the spleen, the gouty joint, the stomach, the abdomen, the loins, and the hip, because these parts do not tolerate being struck upon. And they are only applied to draw blood from one part to another, such as placing them on the breasts when the nose bleeds.
To remove the viscosity in a part, as when we place cupping glasses on the stomach and abdomen to reduce the organ's size.
And it removes pain when there is obstruction or stone, and by its attractive power, it may remove the obstruction or dislodge the stone from its place.
And it acts similarly when applied to the liver and spleen when there is retained flatulence, and these cupping glasses are applied empty only to suck. And sometimes they are applied with fire, and other times filled with hot water, as in pleurisy, and in such cases, the cupping glass is filled with plain hot water or water in which appropriate herbs have been cooked.
The form of the cupping glass applied with fire is as follows:
It should be two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and on the side around the middle, it should have a small hole, as if for inserting a needle, and it should be made of brass, smooth at the front so as not to injure the patient when placed on the body.
And in the middle, it should have a transverse rod of brass or iron for placing a lit candle, and they should come in large and small sizes depending on the illness and the age of the person receiving them.
For the cupping glasses for children differ from those for the elderly, and those for the thin differ from those for the fat.
And this is how this cupping glass should be placed on the body:
Take a wax candle or a wick, and place it in the center of the cupping glass across the rod in the middle, so that the flame is at the bottom of the glass and does not burn the patient.
Then place it on the body, and your fingers should cover the hole we mentioned, so that when desired, the vapor escapes, and the cupping glass is removed.
And take the wick again as before, and repeat often if necessary.
In the cupping glass applied for pleurisy, with water, there is neither rod nor hole, and it is only applied when filled with water and placed directly on the body.
And this is the form:
Leeches are only applied to parts where cupping cannot be used due to their smallness, such as lips and gums, and similar places. and to places devoid of flesh, such as fingers or the nose, and similar areas.
And the method for their use is as follows: when you find leeches in clean fresh waters, free from decay, take them;
and place them in fresh water for a night so they become accustomed and have nothing in their stomachs; then let the vein be bled and cupped, rub the area until it is red, and apply the leeches;
and when they are full and fall off, if it is a place where a cup can be applied, apply it, for it is very beneficial afterward.
If not, cleanse the area with garlic and then with water thoroughly, and then compress it;
and if the spot bleeds too much after the leeches, wet a linen cloth in cold water and place it on the area until the bleeding stops;
and if the bleeding persists, apply powdered vitriol, galls, or similar substances until it stops;
or place halves of peeled beans on the area and leave them until they adhere to the spot, and it will stop immediately;
and if you need more, take other leeches.
And if the leeches do not attach, rub the spot with fresh blood, or prick it with a needle until blood flows, then apply the leeches, and as soon as they sense the blood, they will adhere;
and when you want them to fall off, sprinkle a bit of powdered aloe and salt, or ashes, on them, and they will immediately let go.
Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, as it concerns the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, dear son, that foolish physicians abandon this chapter, as they have never seen any of the ancient books nor read a single letter of them;
and for this reason, knowledge is scarce in our land, for I never found a single good one;
and I know nothing except through the knowledge of the ancient books, in which I have studied so much that I have drawn knowledge from them, through experimentation, and through the habits of my life;
and I have here described to you in this chapter what is contained within, and I have summarized it at the end, and I have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are used, as I have done in the two chapters before this.
It is fitting, then, that we speak in the prologue of this book about the summary of the discourse and the chapters where the wise focus their understanding and dwell on the truth, so that those who are experienced may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a fracture, dislocation, twist, or break occurs in someone, you must hurry to bleed the patient on one side and the other, unless something prevents it, such as bodily weakness, being a child, or being elderly; or if the weather is not very hot or too cold;
and eat cooling foods, such as cold broths, bird meat, and goat meat, and avoid drinking wine, eating fatty meats, or overfilling oneself with foods that fill the veins with blood, so that you do not risk a hot abscess or the spreading of matter to the limb;
so let the patient return to their original regimen that they had been following.
And when the broken bone begins to heal, the patient should be nourished with foods that provide substantial nourishment and contain viscosity, such as wheat cooked in water, rice, heads, feet, cow tripe, eggs, fresh fish, strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment, fractures heal more thoroughly and quickly.
And know that the broken bones of the old and decrepit cannot heal or fuse well by their nature due to the dryness of their limbs, nor can those that are too tender, such as the bones of small children;
but do not worry, place a large tendon over the broken bone, which adheres and joins the limb together until it strengthens as it was before; and do not impede its healing, and for this, the patient must be nourished with substantial foods, as we have mentioned.
And know that fractures vary in many ways.
For a fracture of the head is different from one of the chest or leg, and I will explain all kinds of fractures in this chapter. For there is a fracture that radiates outward, and another sharp one, like the cut of a pen for writing.
For there is a fracture that radiates outward, and another sharp one, like the cut of a pen for writing. And there is a fracture with a wound, and a fracture with only a small crack.
And each type requires its own technique and proper instrument for restoration, according to what the case demands.
A bone fracture is recognized when the area is twisted, visibly deformed, and makes a sound under the pressure of the hand;
and when there is no twisting or sound upon touch, and the patient feels no great pain, then there is no fracture;
but there may well be twisting, a crack, or a small fracture. In such cases, do not manipulate it by hand, but apply the remedies mentioned later, and then gently bind it immediately.
And know that a fracture that radiates outward, where the two parts are disjointed, must immediately be aligned properly before a hot abscess forms there;
and if a hot abscess does form, let it be for a few days until the abscess subsides;
then set it evenly as best as you can, gently and wisely, and know that its healing will be easier than that of one with fragments;
then bind it as is appropriate, as will be explained later.
And if the bone is broken into pieces, stretch it on both sides, whether it is a hand or foot, using your hand if it is a small limb, or with two cords, or a cord and your hand.
And place the limb in its natural shape, so that when the parts of the broken limb are separated, carefully return all the fragments to their places as best as you can, and ensure that your work does not cause the patient injury or pain.
And properly align the two ends of the bones in the best possible way.
And feel it carefully with your hand to determine if it seems not to be well-set:
then adjust it gently, and do not bind it too tightly, nor press it excessively as those do who, through their work, cause hot abscesses and contraction in the limb, as we have often seen.
And when the limb is properly set, instruct the patient well not to move it, whether awake or asleep, or when turning, or in any other way; and ensure that the limb is so secure that the patient feels no pain. For if they feel any pain, it is not properly set, and it must be adjusted so they feel no pain.
and ensure that the limb is so secure that the patient feels no pain. For if they feel any pain, it is not properly set, and it must be adjusted so they feel no pain. And be careful that it is set straight so that no deformity occurs when it is healed.
And the condition of the broken limb is as I have described to you.
Know that broken limbs vary in smallness, largeness, and shape.
For there are small members, such as arms and fingers and the like: so they must be wrapped in soft and fine linen cloths; and those which are large, such as the thigh and the leg:
must be wrapped with a wide and firm band, for the wide band embraces the entire large limb and compresses it evenly from all sides so that there is no defect;
then bind it around with light padding, three or four turns depending on the limb, and press gently with your hand on the band, then move above the fracture and compress it less, so that the fracture moves slightly away from itself;
and loosen the band little by little, until you cover a large part of the healthy area, then take another band and wrap it again over the fractured area;
then return to the area below the fracture and bind it moderately, neither too tightly nor too loosely, as we have said in the first binding above;
then place padding of linen or cloth between the bands until it is all even, then bind everything above with a bandage, and then place your well-made splints on top, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or an abscess, then apply something to calm the hot abscess and to remove the swelling, and leave it so for a few days;
then bind over your splints, and let them be of the width of a split cane cut carefully, or of wood used for making baskets, or of palm branches, and shaped according to this design:
but the splint placed on the fracture must be slightly thicker and wider than the others;
and it must be as long as necessary for the limb, whether small or large; then bind over the splints as you did in the first bandaging, then bind over it with a thread neatly, as in the first binding over the fracture; the tighter it is at the top, the less so below;
and the thread must be moderate, neither too thick nor too fine, and made of soft linen;
for if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the work of fools who make their bindings from twisted linen cords, it is a great error, for the binding cannot be even if it is too fine, and there must not be less than the width of two fingers between each splint.
And if the patient is wounded by the edges of the splints after binding in healthy areas, place padding of linen or combed wool beneath them so that he is not injured.
When the wound is with the fracture and the bone is broken, I will describe its treatment hereafter.
And know that it is not necessary to bind all fractured limbs with splints on the first day. For when the limb is large, splints should not be applied until after five or seven days, or more, depending on your certainty about preventing a hot abscess from occurring;
and here is the method of the ancients’ plasters to restore fractures, dislocations, and twists:
and it is that you take flour that sticks to the walls of the mill, and mix it with plenty of egg, and apply this preparation, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it, and this is the common method of the plaster that restores the fracture in various situations, and especially for women and small children, because it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another method of plaster for restoring fractures, dislocations, and twists: take 3 ounces each of frankincense, ladanum, spikenard, asafetida, Arabic gum, and myrrh, 10 ounces of each; myrrh and aloes, 5 ounces each; rock alum, 9 ounces; and make them into a powder and mix them with plenty of egg; if the person’s complexion is warm, use this plaster, for it is of good composition, restores broken bones quickly, and is effective for many people.
Another method of plaster effective for twists: take 10 ounces each of myrrh and marshmallow; myrrh and aloes, 9 ounces each; acacia, 6 ounces; Armenian bole, 10 ounces, and grind it well, mix it with water or plenty of egg, and apply it.
Another method of plaster for joints and bones displaced from their places, which soothes the resulting pain and prevents the fracture from worsening: take fresh wool, soak it in oil cooked with garlic, and apply it to the area.
This plaster does not restore, but it is good for calming a hot abscess and properly removing pain.
Another method of plaster that restores broken bones: Take dried fig leaves and ground ivy leaves, grind them together, and make a plaster.
Another method of plaster for restoring bone fractures and reducing the remnants of the abscess. Take root of marshmallow, chamomile, violet flowers, and vetch flour, one part of each;
and grind them, mix with wine, and if the limb is inflamed, mix it with moist coriander water or plain water, and use it.
Another method of plaster, stronger than the first, when a hard abscess appears during the restoration of the limb. Take roots of marshmallow, linseed, pomegranate flower, melilot, and elder, and flowers of violets and chamomile, all in equal parts; and grind them, mix with saline water, or plain water, or wine, depending on the heat of the limb and its condition.
Hippocrates says in his book that nothing should be placed on a fractured limb for restoration except a cerate made of wax and oil, and nothing else, and says it should be neither too soft nor too hard.
And Galen believes that for restoring a fractured limb, slightly warm dry substances should be applied, such as myrrh, aloes, incense, and similar things, as we have described.
Another method of plaster that is effective for wounds and pain: Take myrrh, human hair cut into pieces, or bird feathers, and marshmallow, and salt in equal parts, grind them, and make a plaster and apply it.
And then loosen it a little later, and check whether the patient feels any pain or if the bone has moved from its place; if not, do not loosen it for several days. And if pain occurs in the area, or itching, restlessness, or swelling, act quickly, loosen it, and immediately remove the plaster;
and take light cloth, a moistened sea sponge, and dip it in water, and cleanse the area until the itching ceases and the pain is soothed; then let the limb rest for an hour, then apply dry wool soaked in water or rose oil, and bind it for one night until you are certain of the absence of a hot abscess;
and let the inflammation of the limb subside, and the pain be removed, then restart the gentle binding and apply a little plaster, and do not bind it as tightly as before; and proceed carefully until it is healed.
And if you see that the hot abscess, redness, pain, and swelling are entirely gone, and you need plaster and binding, then restart it as you did before, evenly.
And if none of the issues we mentioned arise in the limb, do not loosen it until after three, four, five, or seven days; and sometimes leave it for twenty days, depending on what you observe, until the fracture solidifies and the flesh begins to close over it;
then bind it more tightly than before, and nourish it well, as I have previously explained;
and if you see the area drying out more than necessary, know that nourishment cannot reach it; then moisten it with warm lukewarm water each time you loosen it, and do this every third day, and slightly loosen the binding;
by this process, nourishment will flow to the limb, and it will heal quickly, avoiding the mistakes of foolish physicians who restore the limb improperly:
this is harmful, and such practices are dangerous, and I see no better method than to leave it and treat it properly.
There are many types of fractures, with various shapes, and their causes are distinct;
for there are fractures caused by the blow of a sword, where the strike removes all the bone down to the membrane beneath it, as an axe does to wood; and for this reason, this type of fracture is called "hatching."
Or when the sword cuts the bone from above without piercing it, this type of fracture is called "simple."
And the wounds from these two fractures may be large or small.
And if there is a crushing impact, or a splitting, or a blow from a stone, or from falling on a stone, or other similar causes.
And if there is a piercing fracture that reaches the membrane beneath the bone, or that is above the bone, the wound may be either large or small.
And there is a wound that appears on the bone as fine as a hair, and the split is small, and for this reason, this fracture is called "capillary."
And if the wound is caused by being struck with a stone, or by falling, or by a similar occurrence, and a piece of bone is driven inward, the spot becomes hollowed, as when cauldron-makers strike on cauldrons; so the piece of bone enters within.
And this happens more often to those who have soft bones in the head, such as a child’s head;
and in all these types of fractures, small fragments of bone are detached like splinters; and I will speak of them in their proper place.
And we recognize all types of fractures by the signs above them, by probing with tents, and by the corrupted flesh that is over them.
The capillary type is known by this: when the bone is uncovered and one rubs it, the fracture appears black.
In treating a fracture, pay attention to the patient's symptoms, and if you see any adverse signs such as vomiting bile, loss of consciousness, convulsions, fainting, acute fever, bulging and reddening of the eyes, or other similar signs in various manifestations, then recovery is unlikely.
But if you see no alarming symptoms and hope for recovery, then begin the treatment.
And when the wounded comes first to you, and it is winter, you must remove the bone before the fourteenth day at the latest that you can.
And if it is summer, hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane beneath the bone becomes corrupted, and the complications we have described occur.
And if the fracture of the bone reaches the membrane that covers the brain, you must incise the fractured part in this way:
and take the head of the wounded patient, and expose the bone in every way you can, especially around the shape of the wound as gently as you can, and if there is a flow of blood when the bone is exposed, or a hot abscess, aid it with what is necessary, which is to fill the area with cloths soaked in rose oil; and let the wound rest until the hot abscess has subsided, and you are assured there is no flow of blood; then begin to remove the bone around it, and this is done according to two methods of procedure:
the first method is that you make a narrow incision at the front, and this is its shape:
And then insert another incision larger than the first.
And the second method is to have a number of various incisions, some narrow and others wide, pointed, and made of Indian steel;
and work lightly so that you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is strong and hard, you must pierce around it before making incisions with augers, not too deeply so that they do not go beyond the bone of the skull, and there must be a margin or a ring at the tip to prevent the point from passing beyond the bone;
and you must have several, so that each matches the thickness of the bone, and so that you have augers for every type of skull;
and this is the shape of the three types of augers:
The technique for piercing around the fractured bone is that you place an auger on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know the bone is pierced;
then place the auger in another spot a little farther, and do so all around, then cut with incisors the space of the bone that lies between the holes, and do this as delicately as you can, and lightly, as we have said, until you remove the bone with your hand or with one of the instruments you have, such as pliers or pincers;
and take care not to touch the brain or the membrane.
And when you have pierced and removed the bone, you must remove the remaining fragments of the bone with another instrument resembling an incisor, but it must be thinner and more delicate than the other incisors;
and if any small bones or fragments remain, remove them gently with one of the instruments; then treat the wound with tents and ointments as we have described.
And the other method of procedure is the one Galen describes, which is safer; and he greatly praised it, and this is what he said. You must first expose a part of the bone, where the fracture is clearly visible, so that when you have uncovered that part, you will place beneath the head this lenticular incisor, whose shape is as follows:
And it does not cut on one side, but the blade is sharp on two sides, so that the cutting edge is directed toward the bone;
then strike lightly with a small mallet so that you cut the bone gently all around, and be very careful of the membrane beneath it;
if it is adhered to the bone, remove it gently, as it can be removed without harm and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not reach the membrane, and the bone is only cut on the surface, and there are small pieces, you must smooth out the roughness and remove the splinters with a fine rasp, of which you should have various sizes to apply to each area in the most suitable way, depending on the procedure and the shape of the fracture.
Begin first with large rasps, then with finer ones, and do not stop until it is done properly.
In each of the other capillary incisions and subtle fractures, you must proceed according to their alignment;
and this is not difficult for someone who has devoted their study to this art.
And if the membrane is exposed, you must take a linen cloth, sized according to the wound, soak it in rose oil, and place it on the wound; then take another cloth folded in two or three layers, soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do this as gently as you can so as not to harm the membrane, then apply another bandage over it, and do not tighten it further than what is needed to secure the wound only;
and leave it like this for one or two days until the hot abscess has subsided, then loosen it and apply medicines such as lily roots, vetch flour, frankincense powder, aristolochia, and similar things;
and make a powder from these things, place it on the wound, and always apply cleansing medicines without irritation;
and ensure that the wound is always clean, leaving no ointment on it nor allowing dirt to accumulate, for when dirt gathers on the brain’s membrane, it corrodes and rots it, causing great harm to the patient;
for when something irritating is applied to the membrane, it causes contraction above. Take care, therefore, that if any bad complications occur to the patient, as we have described, it is truly dangerous without a doubt.
And if discoloration appears only because of the medicine applied, having such a property, you must take one part honey and three parts rose oil, soak a cloth in it, and place it on the membrane; then treat it in the necessary ways until it is healed.
Know that sometimes both upper parts of the nose are fractured, or only one of them, because these are two bones;
and the one below is cartilaginous and does not break but only swells or twists, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is fractured, you must insert your little finger into the nostril and adjust the fracture from inside with your index finger and your thumb from outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, ensuring the patient does not feel pain from your procedure.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and the finger cannot reach the spot, you must align it using the end of a slightly thick rod.
And if the fracture is on both sides, do the same, and hurry to set it on the first day, if possible;
if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the hot abscess has subsided, then place linen tents at the tip of the nose, if the fracture is on one side.
Or insert another on the other side if the fracture is there; and the tents should be thick enough to fill the nostrils.
And some restorers said the tents should be soaked in butter and changed daily. It does not seem right to me, but rather they should be soaked in a mixture of egg white and powdered saffron; then leave the tent in place until the bone is firm and the cartilage has hardened.
And sometimes goose feathers are placed in the nose instead of tents, wrapped in a soft cloth, to hold the fracture, and the patient breathes through them; now do whichever you prefer.
And if a hot abscess appears on the nose while you are working on it, apply wax or cotton soaked in rose oil or a little diachylon ointment.
And if no hot abscess appears, apply an external plaster made of sesame flour and frankincense powder mixed with egg white, then place light tow on it and do not bind the nose tightly;
and if the nasal fracture is small and broken into tiny pieces, extract them with appropriate instruments, then sew the split and treat it with flesh-generating and healing substances, such as suitable plasters and ointments;
and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, inserting small lead pipes until it is healed.
When the mandible is broken below, and there is no external wound, and the fracture is only external and not split in two, except for being slightly inwardly arched, one can recognize it easily.
If the fracture is on the right side, you must place your index finger inside the patient's mouth. And if the fracture is in the left side of the mandible, then insert the index finger of your right hand, push the fracture inward gently, adjust it externally with the other hand, and make it even.
If the mandible fracture is separated into two parts, you must extend both sides until they are even.
If the teeth become loose or there is a fracture, bind them with a thread of gold, silver, or silk, then apply wax to the broken mandible and place a double layer of cloth over it. Place over the cloth a well-made splint or an even piece of leather, long and wide according to the mandible, bind it as tightly as you can, and instruct the patient to rest and eat light foods.
If you see that the shape changes, untie it on the third day, then readjust what has shifted. Apply a plaster made of mill powder mixed with plenty of egg or sesame flour after removing the wax.
Place light wool over the plaster, and if the plaster hardens and the patient’s condition does not change, leave it until they are healed. Often, it heals within three weeks.
If a hot abscess forms, administer the treatment we have often described.
If there is both a fracture and a wound, check whether any piece of bone is detached. Carefully remove it with suitable instruments.
If the wound is narrow, widen it with a flame according to your need.
Once you have removed all the pieces and none remain, sew the wound if it is large, and apply one of the appropriate plasters to generate flesh until it heals.
The clavicle often breaks in front, toward the shoulder, and the fracture occurs in three ways:
Either it is broken and separated into two parts with fragments, which is the easiest to restore.
Or there is a fracture with a wound.
When the fracture is without a wound, the process is that you have two assistants, one of whom holds the support for the broken clavicle. And the other stretches the neck toward the affected side.
Then align the fracture with your fingers so that its shape is as it should be, with no projection or gap.
If you need to extend further, place under the patient’s shoulder a round ball of cloth or wool, as thick as needed. Stretch and lift the clavicle, compressing the ball with your hand so that you align the fracture as required.
If you cannot draw out the end of the clavicle because it is too deep, the patient must lie often on their side, place a medium pillow under the shoulder, and have the assistant press the shoulder downward until the clavicle bone is raised.
Then adjust the fracture with your fingers, and if you find it shattered, you must make an incision above it.
Gently extract the fragments, and if the bone cannot align due to an overgrowth, cut it with one of the chisels you have. However, you must place this instrument under the clavicle to protect the surrounding tissue.
It resembles a spoon but is not curved, and it should be as wide as needed, according to the size of the bone and the nature of the task.
It should have two ends, as you see, one wide and the other narrow, corresponding to the shape of the wound you made when extracting the bone.
When you are sure there is no hot abscess, sew the wound; if the fracture is small or you suspect a hot abscess, fill the wound with cloth strips and tents according to its size.
And if hot swellings appear there, moisten a cloth with rose oil, vinegar, and wine, and apply it.
The setting of the bone, when it is without wounds and without cuts, is to apply a plaster made of mill powder and egg white to the bone, place light wadding over it, and position a pad under the armpit, if necessary. Then take a very large bandage, about a palm wide, and place a double cloth over the wadding and the plaster. Then take a thin splint, three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around the bandage so that the ends of the bandage hang loose. Place the splint over the fracture, and wrap the bandage over the neck, under the healthy armpit, and under the injured armpit. Bring it back together from each side, and when you see that the binding holds the fracture properly, and you clearly see that the splint does not move on the fractured bone, check it each day, and if the binding loosens, tighten it again.
Have the patient lie on their back, and when they sleep, place a small pillow under the armpit to raise the support upwards. This will relieve the fracture of the shoulder blade by aligning the shoulder, or you tie their arm to the neck, and do not untie it unless bad complications arise, for up to twenty days.
Then renew the plaster if you see it is needed, tighten it, and leave it this way until it is healed.
And it is healed within twenty-eight days at most, and sooner for some men.
On the fracture of the shoulder
It rarely happens that the shoulder is fractured at a wide place or in the middle, and it is not known except by touch.
Align it according to the shape of the fracture, and restore it to its natural form in every way you can.
Then place mill powder mixed with egg white on the area, along with light wadding, and apply a double cloth over it. Then place a broad, thin splint slightly wider than the shoulder, and if there are hollows beneath the splint in any part of the shoulder, fill those hollows with flax wadding so that the splint sits evenly.
Then tighten it firmly with a large bandage so that the splint does not move from its place, and check the binding every day.
Each time it loosens, tighten it, and realign the splint if it is out of place, and have the patient lie on their side.
And the shoulder is healed in twenty or twenty-five days.
And when this time has passed, untie it, and be assured, for this is not a bone that is easily dislocated.
And if a piece of bone protrudes and presses under the skin, make an incision and remove it, and do what we have said about fractures of the shoulder blade to relieve hot swelling.
On the fracture of the chest
The chest is sometimes fractured in the middle, but this happens rarely. But it often fractures on the outside.
And when it is fractured in the middle, it collapses inward, and the patient feels great pain, has difficulty breathing, coughs, and may vomit blood, and the hollows in the fractured bone are visible and can be clearly felt.
The treatment is to have the patient lie often on their back, place a cushion between their shoulders, then press the shoulders and bring the ribs on both sides together with your hands, carefully adjusting them to align as perfectly as possible so that the shape of the bone is as it should be.
Then apply plasters and wadding over a thin splint of willow or other light wood, wrap it in a cloth, and bind it over the fractured bone so that it does not move. Wrap the binding around the back, tighten it properly, and check the binding every hour; if it loosens, tighten it again.
And if it must be untied due to irritation, itching, pain, or swelling at the site, untie it quickly, adjust the plaster, and address what has arisen with appropriate treatments.
Then reapply the plaster and tighten it until it is healed.
On the fracture of the ribs
Know that rib fractures only occur in the thicker parts near the back and at the inner ends, and they only break because they are brittle. This can be clearly felt through probing with the fingers.
The treatment is to align the fracture as it should be. Then apply the plaster and secure it with a splint, if necessary.
If the rib fracture collapses inward, the patient feels great pain and a stabbing sensation, like pleurisy, because the bone pierces the membrane. They breathe with difficulty, cough, and vomit large quantities of blood, which is a grave condition, and the ancients devised great skill to address it.
Some say that food which bloats the belly should be administered to push the fracture outward.
We do not do this, lest hot swellings develop there, if they are not already present. If they are present, treat them accordingly.
Some of them said that cupping should be applied to the area to suck forcefully, and this seems reasonable. However, there is a concern that cupping might draw impurities to the area due to its weakened state.
Some said the area should be covered with wool moistened in warm oil, and tents should be placed between the ribs to equalize the surrounding binding, then treated as for pleurisy with food and medicine.
If the patient feels such severe pain that they cannot bear it due to the bone piercing the membrane, and the patient is at risk, it is necessary to make an incision over the fractured rib and place an instrument underneath to protect the tissue.
Then the bone should be cut and removed gently, the two edges of the wound sewn together if it is large, and treated with plasters until it heals.
If hot swellings occur, place cloths moistened with rose oil over the area.
And treat the area as required for swellings, and have the patient lie frequently on the appropriate side until they are healed.
The same applies to the spine.
When this happens to someone and you want to know if they will recover, check if their hands are soft, swollen, and lifeless, and if they cannot move or extend them; when you prick them with a needle, they feel nothing.
Know that this condition is often fatal, but if they can move their hands and feel when they are pressed or pricked, know that the joints of the bone are intact, and the patient can recover if treated properly.
If a similar condition occurs in the spine, and you want to know if they will recover, check if the feet are soft and if the same symptoms appear as in the hands, and whether involuntary wind or bowel movements occur on the back.
And when they are turned onto their stomach, observe if involuntary bowel movements happen. And when they are turned onto their back and want to sit up, they cannot do so. Know that this condition is fatal. Do not exert yourself with treatment in such a case.
If these symptoms are absent, the condition is milder.
The treatment is to observe if there is a hot swelling, and apply rose oil or egg yolk oil to the spine until it subsides.
Then apply one of the comforting and drying plasters, bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest. And ensure they do not sleep on the side where they feel pain until they are healed.
If any bone is displaced, it is necessary to cut over the area. Remove the bone, then bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with stitching, and treat it with healing ointments until it is healed.
If the head of the bone, called the "head of the spine," is fractured, insert your thumb of the left hand and align it as best as you can with the other hand, then apply the plaster and splint, if needed.
Then secure it, and if there is a displaced bone, cut over it, remove it, and treat the wound until it is healed.
On the fracture of the hip bone
It rarely happens that the hip bone is broken, and if it does, it is usually only a slight narrowing at the head. It splits lengthwise, inclines inward, and causes the patient pain at the site, stinging, and swelling of the broken part.
The restoration consists of placing your hand on it until you are directly over the fracture. And determine what the fracture is and its shape.
If the fracture is only at the head, align it so that it takes its natural shape.
If the fracture runs lengthwise or inclines inward, have the patient lie on their stomach until the restoration of the fracture is ready. When you have aligned it, apply a plaster, then a splint of wood or leather, and bind the fracture tightly so it does not move.
And fill the area beneath the ribs until the level is even. Instruct the patient to sleep on their healthy side or on their back.
If a hot abscess develops, do not touch it until it subsides, and apply the treatment we mentioned earlier. Then return to the restoration and bind it as needed, provided there is no adverse complication.
On the fracture of the shoulder joint
The shoulder joint is what lies between the elbow and the head of the shoulder, and if it is broken, it must be restored using one of two methods:
The first is to take a wooden rod of medium thickness, shaped as follows:
Tie two cords at both ends, suspend it above, and seat the patient on a chair.
Then place the broken arm over the rod so that it reaches the armpit, with a curve of wood in the middle, and hang a weight from it or have the assistant pull downward.
Then the physician aligns the fracture with their hands until the break is restored as it should be.
The second method involves laying the patient on their back, tying their hand to their neck, and instructing two assistants—one to hold above the fracture and the other to hold below it with a cord, each pulling in their direction.
If you want the traction to be stronger, tighten a cord below and above the fracture, and have each assistant pull in their respective direction.
If the fracture is near the head of the shoulder, place one cord under the armpit and another near the elbow, below the fracture.
Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, a cord must be applied lightly without strain, until the fracture is aligned at the site and at the elbow.
Then align the fracture as needed and bind it, provided no hot abscess develops.
If a hot abscess develops, do not bind it for seven days; instead, apply wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the abscess subsides.
Then bind it, and the method for binding is to apply a plaster over the fracture, bring the arm close to the shoulder joint, and place your hand on the shoulder or chest.
Apply the bandage and bind over the joint and the arm, so the arm acts as a splint unless something prevents it, or the bone is not displaced.
If you fear the bone may move, use splints, placing a wider and stronger splint over the fracture, with a finger’s width of space between each splint, and ensure each splint extends three fingers’ width beyond the fracture on either side.
Then bind over the splints, as I described at the beginning of the chapter on fractures, tighter at the center and looser outward.
And if you see the placement of the splints and the binding, as we have said, at the time you restore the broken limb, and you fear a hot swelling, then leave it bound until the seventh day, as we have said;
then check every three days the binding, so that irritation or inflammation does not occur at the site, or that nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight. Adjust it, as we have said.
And if no such incidents occur, do not loosen it until after three days or more, and let the patient sleep on their back with their hands on their stomach.
And place underneath the support a cushion filled evenly with wool, and monitor each hour of the day or night that the alignment of the broken limb does not shift, or the bindings do not loosen.
Adjust it with the help of medicine, and give the patient the food we mentioned earlier, prepared in such a way that it is initially light. And when they begin to recover, let it be more substantial.
And it is customary that the supports and the leg should be fully restored within forty days. And then it should be loosened, and baths and medicinal ointments should be applied to straighten the site.
And if the constriction is severe and swollen, delay loosening for fifty days or two months.
On the fracture of the arm
The arm is composed of two bones, called the two "fossils," one of which is small, and it is the one that follows the thumb.
And the other is large, and it is the one beneath, towards the little finger.
Sometimes the large bone alone breaks, or the small one, and sometimes both together.
When the small bone is broken, the restoration is simple, as is the healing.
And when the large bone is broken, the healing is more difficult and more severe than when both are broken together.
If it is the small bone alone that is broken, it must be slightly extended and set evenly.
And if it is the large bone, it must be bound more tightly.
And extend it on a cushion, and hold the thumb of the hand higher than the others, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and let the patient sit cross-legged on themselves, with a cushion in front of them, higher, so that the patient endures no strain.
Then the assistant stretches the arm at the lower part towards the hand or the binding, and another assistant does the same above.
And then the physician sets it evenly, according to its best form.
And if the fracture has fragments, place each one in its position, and if there is any displaced one that pricks the flesh and you cannot restore it to its position, then cut and remove it, as we have said earlier.
And if the fracture has a wound, I have discussed this in the separate chapter. Then undertake the treatment.
And if, at the beginning of the restoration, hot swelling occurs, apply a cloth smeared with cerate made from rose oil and white wax, that is neither too hard nor too soft. And bind the cloth above it carefully, until the hot swelling is soothed.
Then remove the cerate, and apply a plaster of mill powder mixed with plenty of egg, then place the splints, and let the splint on the fracture be always stronger and slightly wider than the others.
And know that there must be six splints on the arm in various positions. Whether the fracture is in one bone or in both.
And tighten more on the fracture than elsewhere, and always less as you move away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter. And let the cloths on the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough.
And let the cloths on the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough. And let the thread used for binding be of linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And check the limb and the binding after a few days. And if any bad incidents occur to the limb, such as itching that affects it, you must bathe the limb with warm water until the itching is soothed;
and let the limb rest, not too tightly bound.
Then reapply the binding, and if the binding has loosened and the bone is displaced, or similar issues arise, adjust it.
And if you notice that nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tightly bound, you must loosen it slightly and leave it for a few days, until nourishment flows, and then tighten it again.
And if none of these issues occur with the patient, do not loosen it for twenty days.
Or thereabouts, then hang their hands at their neck, and let their shoulders be even, and ensure they avoid movement or dislocation, and let them sleep on their back.
And know that this fracture is restored in thirty or thirty-five days, and perhaps in twenty days, depending on the structure and the constitution of the patient.
On the fracture of the hand
Know that fractures rarely occur on the back of the hand or at the joints of the fingers, and instead there are often dislocations.
And when the palm of the hand is broken or dislocated, the patient must sit cross-legged and sit upright, evenly before them.
Then place their hand stretched out on a cloth, and the assistant extends the broken bones, and the physician sets them evenly until they are well joined.
And apply the plaster and lint, if there is no swelling, then place a splint according to the size of the area. And wrap it in a linen cloth.
And if the fracture is on the inner side around the palm, make a roll of cloths, and instruct the patient to press it against their broken palm. And then bind it with a long cloth, and let the splint be of soft wood, as large as the palm of the hand, and tighten it as needed.
And if the fracture is on the outer side, you must place one splint above and another below on the palm, so that the hand remains open and straight, then wrap it entirely around the hand, and secure the binding between the fingers.
And if the fracture occurs at one of the finger joints, if it is the thumb, set it straight as required. And bind it with the palm, and if you wish, place a small straight splint to support the fracture and prevent it from moving.
And if the fracture is in one of the other fingers, such as the index finger or another, set it straight and bind it with the healthy finger next to it. Or bind them all together in one bundle, which is often better, or place a splint, as with the thumb.
And take care during the restoration and in managing hot swelling, and treat it as I have said.
The bone of the thigh is often fractured, and it is evident when it turns forward or backward.
And the restoration is done by binding one strap above the fracture and another below. And the patient lies on their back, and each assistant stretches their strap evenly on their side.
And this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
And if the fracture is near the base of the thigh, one strap should be near the hip, and the other below the fracture.
And likewise, if it is near the knee, then the strap should be beside the knee, and the extension downward.
Then the physician sets the bone evenly with both hands until it is in its natural shape, then applies a plaster and binds it, if there is no hot swelling.
And if there is hot swelling, let it subside, then return to your work and treatment. The binding is done in this manner.
It is necessary that you wrap over the fracture a hard bandage folded two or three times, and leave the excess, then turn the leg so that the heel reaches the root of the buttock, and place a long thread between the thigh and the leg, below near the knee, with the ends of the thread coming out above;
then wrap the bandage over the leg and the thigh, then place splints on the fracture, and put one splint on the bone of the leg;
then fill the empty space between the leg and the thigh with soft cloths to ensure even pressure, then begin to tie tightly three or four twists over the fracture; and the higher you go above the fracture, the less tightly you bind;
then attend to the two ends of the thread that you placed between the leg and the thigh, and tie to them the three splints that are above, then return below to the end of the thread, until you reach near the foot;
and tighten it so that it does not move from its place, then leave it thus, provided that no abscess, swelling, or other appearance occurs. And if it occurs, then untie it and address what appears, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of bone that protrude, they must be removed, if possible; and if this is not possible, then the area must be opened, and the piece extracted; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is fractured in such a way that splints are applied to it, as is done for the forearm or the arm;
nevertheless, with the restoration done in this way, the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in fifty days, or a little less or a little more, depending on the differences in constitutions.
Know that fractures rarely occur in the hollow of the knee, but it bends often.
And if it fractures, it is only a crack or a perforation, and it occurs either with a wound or without a wound, and this is easily felt.
And the restoration is done by aligning what is dislocated to its proper place as much as possible;
then apply the plaster, and place a rounded splint if needed, and tighten it as required, then revisit all the measures we mentioned for other fractures, such as abscesses, heat, and other signs; and apply the appropriate treatment for each condition, until it is healed.
Concerning the fracture of the leg
Know that the leg contains two bones, one of which is rightfully called "mustel" and the other "foscile";
and the fractures occur in the same way as in the arm, and for this reason, the restoration is the same as for the arm, and the process is identical.  And if both bones are fractured together, the leg bends in all directions.
And if the smaller bone is fractured, it bends forward.
And if the larger bone is fractured, great pain is felt, and it is clearly visible; and it bends downward.
Then perform extension, set it straight, and tie the splints evenly;
but nevertheless, if the fracture is severe and there are many fragments, the extension must be less and gentler; and adjust it according to your ability.
And when you have completed your work, take two wooden slats that enclose the leg on both sides, and are as long as the leg from the knee to below;
then wrap a bandage in two places above and below, and tie it in the middle as well, and at this point the leg cannot bend to the right or the left, and thus it is well secured;
and some apply a rod along the length of the leg, made of wood, and the leg is placed on it to prevent movement, and this is specifically done in fractures with a wound;
and the leg is moved each day to check for any abscess, heat, or other condition; and treat it until it is healed.
Concerning the fracture of the bones of the foot
At the ankle, fractures do not occur, but sometimes fractures occur in the bones of the foot, and rarely in the toes, and they are usually simple cracks in various positions.
And if a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see these bones overlapping one another, have the patient place their foot on the ground as if they were trying to walk, then immediately place your foot on theirs, where the bones are raised, and press until they return to their places;
then apply plaster and padding, and place under the sole of the foot a small board with two flat ends, then bind it to the foot appropriately, after wrapping with cloths and other necessary materials.
And after three or four days have passed, untie the binding, for you will find the bones aligned, whether fractured or dislocated.
And if any toes are fractured, restore them as we have described for the fingers of the hand; then place on the fractured toe a splint matching the length of the toe, and slightly wider, then place under the foot the board I mentioned, and tighten it appropriately;
and if two or three, or more, are fractured, place a splint on each toe according to its size, wrapped in a linen cloth, and tighten the board under the foot; and let the end of the board extend beyond the sole of the foot, so that it holds it securely.
And you must not forget the other measures I mentioned for other fractures, as we have described; and address each complication as required.
Concerning the fracture of the bone of the wrist
When the bone of a woman’s genital region is fractured, make her sit with her legs apart, then incline her toward her back, and have her held from behind;
then fill the vaginal opening of the patient with cotton, and insert as much as a fistful;
then make the woman stand up and raise her back little by little, and the cotton will move upward until it reaches the vaginal opening, and the bone will return to its place with the cotton.
And when she wishes to urinate, remove the cotton, and after she has urinated, replace it, and do this for seven days or so: the fracture will then be restored, and if you wish, take a sheep’s bladder, tie a pipe to its opening, and insert the entire bladder into the vaginal passage; then blow forcefully into the pipe until the bladder is inflated inside: thus the fracture will be corrected in the vaginal passage;
then fill it with cotton, and leave it like this for several days, until it is healed.
And when the wrist bone of a man or a woman is fractured, restore it as we have described for the bone of the hip;
and these fractures are not hidden from one who devotes study and practice to them, and understands my book.
For fractures reveal through various conditions the correct method of restoration: so understand it then.
For the penis, when it is fractured, take a goose’s throat and insert the penis into it; then wrap it with cloths around, and leave it for three days or thereabouts, and it will heal quickly.
Of fracture with a wound
It is necessary for one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as in the thigh bone or the humerus or similar, to be bled immediately, as the bleeding we have described indicates.
And if the wound heals, staunch it with vitriol, if you have nothing else, then proceed to set the fracture in that same hour or on that day, if no hot abscess forms.
And if a hot abscess forms, delay the setting until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, for you would cause a harmful condition to develop.
And if the broken bone is visible through the uncovered flesh, you must carefully set it with your hands, with slight extension.
And if the extension is not sufficient to equalize with your hands, adjust it with this iron instrument, which is seven or eight fingers long, and its width matches the size of the wound. And for this, it is necessary for the physician to have three or four of them, depending on the needs of each fracture treatment.
And it should be round and slightly thick so it does not bend under compression on the limb during your work, and it should be sharp at the front and thick from the middle onward, thus:
And it is called a "palainche," for which the curved head must be placed on the visible end of the bone. And push it in all at once, until it returns, and it is aligned one against the other. And if the fracture is delicate and the instrument cannot grip the bone well, you must cut the end of the bone so that the instrument can gain control over it.
And if you cannot bring the bone back as we have said, then cut it with a suitable instrument for this, whether a scalpel or saw, as you are able.
Then clean what remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is set, and the patient feels great pain afterward, know that it is not in its natural position.
Then ensure it is in its proper place, then soak a cloth in black styptic wine and apply it carefully, especially if it is in summer. And do not apply wax or anything else containing oil to the wound, so that it does not cause decay and corruption to develop.
Then apply splints once you have set the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, trimming the covering all around according to the size of the wound, and take great care that the wound is not compressed along with the fracture.
And many times foolish physicians have done this, and have caused death or sometimes gangrene to come upon the patient. And let the compression be softer and gentler than for other fractures.
And if the wound is bad or large, and you fear that harmful conditions might arise as we have described, and you find pain in the area, then do not apply splints. Instead, wrap it around with stiff cloths in place of splints, and tie them.
And when you see after one or two days that the wound is generating pus, remove what you had applied with wine, and apply a healing ointment for wounds, such as tetrapharmacum and similar.
And you must untie the limb twice a day, in the morning and evening, until it is set and healed.
And you must position the limb in such a way that the pus flows downward easily.
And if many days pass, and it cannot heal but continues to produce pus, know that there are small bone fragments, for which you must probe the wound with a tent and remove all these loose pieces that cause this pain.
And if a fistula forms in the area, or another type of corruption, you must treat it as described in the chapter above.
And when the bone is broken and exposed in the limb, such as the thigh bone or the humerus, and others like the large bones, do not extract it, for often death results from this, but leave it until it rots.
By chance, it will fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days, then treat the wound if you can.
And if you cannot, then leave it.
They often appear after the healing of the fracture, especially near a joint, and the appearance of the limb is unpleasant to behold. And as a result, the limb might not perform its natural functions.
Take care then, if the lump is fresh: Apply styptic medicines, such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh, sarcocolla, acacia, and similar substances, either one of them or all together, and mix them with styptic wine, egg white, or vinegar. Apply them to the lump with a cloth, bind it tightly, and do not loosen it for several days.
Apply them to the lump with a cloth, bind it tightly, and do not loosen it for several days. Then loosen it and reapply the treatment until the lump is removed.
Or press a well-made piece of lead onto it. For the property of lead is such that it removes all swellings on the limbs.
And if the lump has already hardened like stone, and it is necessary to remove it, cut into it and open the visible excess. Or shave it with a blade until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
Of a limb that is weak after healing
When the fracture of the bone is repaired, and the limb remains weak and delicate afterward, it happens for many reasons: One is because it was bound too tightly and not properly as it should have been. Or because there were too many bindings, and nourishment could not reach the limb. Or due to excessive wetting. Or from too much movement, and not at the right time. Or because the body has little blood, thus it is weak.
The treatment is to have the patient eat and strengthen the body until the blood is increased in it. And give them baths, and provide joy and delight.
Then apply weight to the limb so that it draws much nourishment to it, and frequently bathe it with warm water until nourishment flows to the limb. And it returns to its natural shape.
Of a limb twisted after healing When a limb is twisted after repair, and the broken bone is visible, and the shape of the limb is ugly, yet it does not lose its natural function:
Do not believe fools who say the limb must be broken anew, and many foolish physicians have done this in our land.
This practice is condemned, and great harm, even death, can result from it.
However, if the lumps and twisting are fresh, they should be bathed with warm water or softened with cooked herbs, such as mallow leaves, roots, melilot, and similar things.
And make a softening plaster, such as a well-made diachylon, and take the mucilage of mallow, mix it with chicken fat or sesame oil, and apply it as a plaster.
Or take fat figs and mash them with dung from doves, and similar medicines that reduce hardening.
Sometimes the lump is removed by continuous and prolonged rubbing with moist hands. And administer movement to the limb every hour.
And if the twisting has aged and hardened like stone, and must be removed with iron, cut it down to the bone with a fine scalpel, carefully. And apply sutures and care in the treatment.
Dislocation is when a joint is displaced from its position, causing the limb to be misshapen, and the patient feels great pain and severe injury.
When dislocation occurs in someone, it must be immediately reset without delay.
For if delayed, the area swells, and it may be reset with difficulty in its place.
Therefore, the joint must not be moved while it is swollen. Often this causes spasms and other pains.
However, when this happens, bleed the patient, then wait until the hot swelling subsides.
Then bathe the limb with warm water and oil, then gently reset it, and treat each limb as its treatment requires.
And I have arranged the chapters of dislocations from the head to the feet.
It rarely happens that both mandibles are dislocated, and the dislocation of both occurs in two ways: either they are slightly displaced from their place and somewhat softened; or they are completely dislocated and hang downward, with saliva flowing from the mouth as it cannot be held in, and the mouth cannot be closed, encumbering the tongue and speech.
When the dislocation is minor, it often corrects itself spontaneously.
But if it is complete and severe, you must restore it quickly without delay;
and in such a way that an assistant holds the patient’s head while the practitioner inserts the thumb of one hand at the root of the mandible’s dislocation inside the mouth, if the dislocation is on both sides; and the other fingers of the hand are outside to align it properly;
and instruct the patient to relax the mandibles and move them in all directions. And the practitioner aligns it until it returns to its place.
If repositioning is difficult, especially if both mandibles are involved, they should be bathed with warm water and oil to make the process easier.
Do not delay in restoring them, as we have said.
Once they are properly restored and the patient’s mouth closes well without difficulty, place damp cloths soaked in a salve of rose oil and wax, then secure it lightly with soft bindings;
and let the patient sleep on their back, with their head supported between two cushions, ensuring it does not move to the right or left, avoiding any effort to chew, and eating only soft foods until the pain subsides and the mandibles are stabilized;
and later, they may eat whatever they wish lightly, but avoid exerting effort to open the mouth for eating or drinking until the mandibles are fully stabilized and healed.
If the two mandibles cannot be properly restored in a timely manner and are not returned to their positions, fever and recurring episodes often arise, along with possible diarrhea or vomiting of pure bile.
When you observe this, know that it is fatal. Many times, those afflicted die within nine days.
The sternum cannot dislocate from the ribs where it connects to the chest, but it may occasionally dislocate outward, which is easily felt.
The treatment is for the patient to lie often on their back and extend their arms; then press the area firmly with your palm, and it will return to its place;
then apply a poultice and a bandage, and tighten it;
and the end near the ribs cannot dislocate; except slightly, and if it ever dislocates, restore it to its place as we have described;
then apply a poultice and bandage, tighten it, and instruct the patient to rest until they are healed;
and in the same way, the head of the shoulder is restored when it is displaced from its place.
Of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is dislocated only in three ways:
the first is when it is dislocated downward toward the armpit; the second is toward the chest; and sometimes it dislocates upward, which is rare;
it does not dislocate backward because of the shoulder blade, nor inward because of the nerves;
it often dislocates downward toward the armpit, especially in those with little flesh, for in them it comes out quickly;
in those with sufficient flesh, it dislocates with difficulty and returns with difficulty.
Sometimes, due to a blow or fracture, the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, leading one to think it is dislocated.
It is necessary to examine it to be certain; then begin the treatment.
The dislocation is recognized when it is downward toward the armpit, and a distinction can be made between the injured shoulder and the healthy one, with clear differences between them. You will find a hollow at the head of the shoulder, and under the armpit, when touching the head of the shoulder, it will feel as if it were a bone. The patient cannot bring their hand to their nose nor make any movements.
Likewise, if it is dislocated upward, it is not hidden, as you can clearly feel it by touch.
This type of dislocation can only be treated by repositioning, especially if it is recent or if the patient is a child.
The method is for the assistant to raise the patient’s arm upward, then place their hands under the armpit and lift the joint forcefully upward into place. The assistant raises the arm and stretches it upward, then places it back down. It will quickly return to place.
If it does not return as we described after a few days, the patient must be bathed in warm water. Then administer softening and soothing treatments, such as a decoction of marshmallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and apply it.
Then let the patient lie on their back, and place an even woolen pad under the armpit, neither too soft nor too hard. The practitioner then puts their heel on the pad, lifts the head of the shoulder with care, and pulls the patient’s hand.
Another assistant holds the patient’s head to prevent it from moving downward. The shoulder will return immediately, and if you wish, restore it using this method:
Have a man larger than the patient present. Let him stand on the patient’s side, place his shoulder under the patient’s armpit, and lift the armpit upward so that the patient hangs in the air. Another assistant pulls the patient’s hand downward toward the abdomen. If the patient is too light, attach something heavy to them, and the dislocation will immediately return to place.
The shoulder can also be restored using another method:
Place a long wooden rod into the ground, with its head rounded like a pestle, neither too thick nor too thin. Place it under the patient, but ensure it is covered with soft cloths, and the patient should be positioned along the length of the rod.
Then stretch their arm downward forcefully, and the joint will quickly return to its place.
and if it does not want to return for all these things that we have said, then do this treatment: take a stick of two arms in length and four fingers in width, which has a rounded head to enter deeply beneath the armpit, in this manner:
then wrap soft cloths around the head of the stick, so that the stick does not harm the patient, and then place it under the patient’s armpit;
and stretch the arm along the length of the stick, and bind the support to the stick, and the arm at the head of the hand, then place the arm on a rung of a wide ladder, and let the hand extend downward, and let the body hang on the other side: the joint will return in place immediately.
And when it is in place, in whatever manner it may be, you must place an equal-sized wool ball under the armpit, then apply the plaster prepared with millstone powder, along with incense and egg white, over the entire shoulder and around it, then bind it appropriately under the armpit, and tie the band over the plaster, and brace the hand against the neck, and let the hand remain thus.
And it is necessary for them to eat little, so that the limb is strengthened, for it will heal faster;
and then they may eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and not softened, then it is healed.
And if the joint is out of place because of moisture that has come there, or for another reason, then you must apply cauterization in three spots, as is set out earlier in the chapter on cauterization.
And if you do all this, and it comes undone after seven days, and the joint does not hold, and they cannot raise their arm upward, then know that the nerves at the head of the shoulder are severed, stretched, or softened; and know that the joint will never again be fixed in its place.
The dislocation that is toward the chest, the breasts, or behind, is corrected by pressure and stretching of the hands, and it is treated in another manner;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if, after healing, stiffness comes to the limb, and slowness in movement, let the patient bathe many times, until that stiffness is relieved, and it returns to its original condition.
of the dislocation of the elbow
Know that the elbow joint is dislocated with difficulty, and with difficulty it returns;
and if it is dislocated in all directions, and especially in the front and back, the dislocation is not hidden, for it is clearly seen and felt; and dislocated according to its particular form. And when you place the dislocated elbow with the healthy one, you can see it clearly. For the joint is crooked, and they cannot bend their arm, nor touch their shoulder with it.
And it is necessary that you set it before warm abscesses appear there, for if warm abscesses come there, it would be difficult to set it;
and perhaps it cannot be completely reset, especially when it is toward the back; this is worse than other dislocations, and is of greater pain, and perhaps it brings death.
And the restoration is, when it is such that it can be reset, that you extend their hand with your two hands; and their arms are stretched, and the physician’s hands surround the elbow, above and below, and press the joint with their thumbs together, or at the base of their palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in the front, it will return when they press their hand against their other hand and strike the dislocated elbow with the base of the palm.
And if it does not want to return to its place, then apply strong extension;
and this is done by two assistants extending the arm while holding it steady so it does not move during the extension;
then turn the arm to each side, after wrapping it in a double cloth, long and wide;
and when the physician has the joint in hand, anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then press the joint firmly until it returns to place;
and when it is in place, apply a dry plaster with egg white, bind it firmly, hang the arm from the patient’s neck, and leave it for some days, then unbind it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, then untie the binding and leave it;
and if you see that the joint does not hold well, reapply the plaster and binding, and leave it for some days until it is firmly set; then unbind it.
And if there is stiffness after the resetting of the joint, and it moves poorly, bathe and gently massage it, and press it until it is relieved; or place on the joint a fat sheep’s fleece, leave it for one day and one night, then remove it and let it soak in a bath; and when it sweats, gently rub the joint, then replace the fleece, and return it to the bath; and do this two or three times, until it is healed;
and if you wish, place cow dung moistened and heated with butter on it, and bind it;
and it will return to its proper condition.
the dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and its resetting is easier than the other joints. Nevertheless, it must be reset quickly, in the very hour that it is dislocated, before the area swells or a warm abscess appears.
And the resetting is done by placing the dislocated hand on a table, having an assistant stretch the hand, while the physician aligns it, placing their palm on the visible part of the joint and pressing until it returns to place.
Nevertheless, it is necessary to ensure it is well in place; then the patient places the back of their hand on a table for extension and resetting. And if the dislocation is on the back of the hand, the patient places the back of their hand on the table, and the physician places their hand on the visible part of the joint.
If it returns immediately, that is good. If not, apply plasters that soothe warm abscesses, and leave it like that without restarting the treatment.
And if they cannot endure it, and you cannot reset it after some days, the joint will remain twisted;
and it does not harm the patient except that the hand remains weakened and cannot grip anything firmly: then know that the nerves are severed, or the arteries;
and there is no other remedy except cauterization near the affected area, and perhaps nothing else will help.
And when the hand is in place, apply the plaster we mentioned, then bind it and leave it for five days, then unbind it and leave it thus.
And if they cannot move it well and there is some stiffness, soak it in warm water, and rub it until it is healed.
Of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the fingers of the hand are dislocated to either side, sometimes toward the back of the palm or the front.
Then extend the finger and push the dislocation as far as you can until it returns, then support the head of the finger and stretch it toward the part where it is disjointed.
And leave it for two days, then set it straight that day.
And at night bind it, as we have said, and during the day unbind it, make it move, and rebind it at night.
And do this often until it becomes firm, and do the same if it is dislocated to the front of the hand, and proceed as you did earlier, until it is healed.
And do the same when it is dislocated to another side.
Of the dislocation of the spine of the back
When the spine of the back or neck is dislocated, or there are several dislocations, there is no treatment, for death hastens the patient's end.
And the signs are that excretions escape without will, and they cannot control them, and often some limb is paralyzed, either both thighs or both arms or one.
And often the spine moves in four directions.
The one that moves backward is called "gibosity."
The treatment is to consider if the gibosity has been present since childhood. Then there is no treatment or healing at all.
And the one that comes from falling or blows or similar causes, the ancients spoke of treatments with elaborate explanations, though not all are very effective.
But I have summarized it according to my understanding and have designed instruments in various ways.
I say that in the gibosity that appears at the front of the chest, there is neither remedy nor cure.
And likewise for the one that appears directly on both sides, no cure is possible except specifically for the one at the back, as I have said.
And it is that the patient should be stretched face down on a flat surface and have straw underneath them so they do not injure themselves.
Then drive one stake firmly into the ground at the head and another at the feet, and tie one strap under the patient’s armpits and another at the hips, knees, and ankles.
And two assistants should pull the straps, one at the head and the other at the feet, through the two stakes.
And the stakes should be well secured as we have described, and the doctor should press their palms firmly on the spine until it returns to place.
And if it does not return through this treatment, take a plank three cubits long, with one end against the wall, and have the patient lie on their side, placing the head of the plank against the wall, then the middle of the plank over the spine. And the doctor should place their feet on the other end of the plank and press firmly until it returns to its place.
And if you wish, do this using a winch that turns by hand. And you must drive two stakes at the head of the patient, one cubit apart, and two more near the feet, with a space of one palm’s width between each stake above and below.
And each stake should have a hole through which the winch passes, and the stakes must be firmly set in the ground so they do not move.
And between each pair of stakes, there should be a rotating stake around which the straps turn, and the two rotating stakes should have two small pegs, each a palm long, to turn the winch.
Then tie the strap under the armpits to the winch at the head and the other strap at the feet to the winch there, and each assistant should turn their winch along with the strap, while the doctor aligns the spine as we have described.
And when it is aligned, apply a drying plaster with plenty of egg, then lint, and then a splint made of a small plank three fingers long, which covers the site of the gibosity and the healthy part of the vertebra, then bind it with a strap as we have described, and the patient should use delicate nourishment until they are healed.
And if anything arises at the end of the healing, administer softening and soothing medicines along with the splint we mentioned earlier. And sometimes a piece of lead is applied, and sometimes a protrusion appears on the back vertebra of the spine, and it is believed to be a dislocation. But it is the bone that is visible, and no assumption should be made. By chance, it could lead to death.
Know that at the joints of the hip and the shoulder, only dislocations occur, not as with other joints.
And the hip joint can be dislocated in four directions: Inward, outward, forward, and backward.
More often inward than elsewhere, and rarely forward or backward.
The sign of an inward dislocation is that when the injured leg is compared with the healthy one, it appears longer, and the knee of the injured leg protrudes more than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend the knee toward the fire. And the area nearby is swollen with a hot abscess because the head of the thighbone presses there.
The sign of an outward dislocation is that these symptoms are the opposite of the previous ones.
The sign of a forward dislocation is that the patient can extend the leg completely. However, they cannot bend the knee without pain, and if they try to walk, they cannot move forward, retain their urine, the groin swells, and when they walk, they step on the heel.
The sign of a backward dislocation is that the patient cannot extend or bend the knee, and that leg is more twisted than the other, the groin is soft, and the head of the thighbone is under the ribs.
The remedy for this type of dislocation is to see if the dislocation is old, and if it remains in its position, there is no treatment. And no assumptions should be made about it.
But if the dislocation is recent and one of the four types, act quickly to rotate the joint, stretch it inward and outward, and move it to the right and left. By chance, it will return, and no further treatment is needed.
And if it does not return in this way, it is necessary to prepare a strong assistant, who will stretch the leg strongly with both hands or with a strap tied above the knee. Another assistant should stretch their hand over in such a way that they place their hands under the armpits and bind the thigh softly with a strap. And another holds the end of the strap.
And they all stretch upward and downward at the same time until the patient is lifted off the ground all at once and remains suspended.
This method of stretching is common to all four types, and if the dislocation is corrected, as we have said, that is good.
If not, further treatment is required for its type.
When the dislocation is inward, you must place the patient on their healthy side, then place the strap at the root of the thigh and the area beneath the groin, then stretch the strap upward toward the groin and the flank.
Then another assistant should use their arms to brace the thick part of the injured thigh and stretch it outward strongly. It will then return to its place immediately.
And this type of dislocation is easier to treat than the others.
And if you cannot set it in the manner we have described, you must bind the two feet of the patient together with a strong, gentle band over the two heels and the two knees, and the injured leg must be stretched two fingers more than the other.
Then he should be suspended from the top of a post, two arms' lengths above the ground.
Then command one assistant to grasp the top of the thigh, and another assistant, hanging with the patient, should firmly hold the thigh, for the joint will promptly return to its place.
And when the dislocation is external, let the patient lie down as we have described for one who is hunchbacked, and tighten a band properly over the injured leg and over the foot as well.
Then place two logs, one at the head and the other at the feet, and fix one log between the thighs of the patient, at the center of the body. And wrap damp cloths around it so that the patient is not harmed, then let each assistant pull towards himself, and let the physician adjust the dislocation with his hands.
If it returns, that is good.
If not, place him on a table and press as we have described for the hunchback, and let the patient lie on his healthy side.
And when the dislocation is forward, the injured leg must be stretched quickly, as I have said. And let the physician exert pressure on the injured hip with one hand, and press with the other hand, extending it downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is external, the patient must not be stretched downward or lifted off the ground, but rather positioned as if the hip were dislocated externally, as we have described for lying on both hips. And let him lie on his stomach, with the band extended as we have said before, and pressure must be applied to the joint on the table. And it will be proper when the patient stretches his legs, and they are even. Then align the thighs, apply a plaster, and wrap it with a bandage so that the hip does not move. And let him rest for three or four days, then loosen the bandage and reapply the plaster.
And if you see that they are even, rewrap it as before, and leave it for three days.
Then loosen it, and let him walk gently, until the limb is strengthened.
Concerning the dislocation of the knee.
The knee is dislocated in three ways: That is, inward, outward, and backward.
And it is not dislocated forward.
And the sign is that you command the patient to bend his leg to his thigh, and if it does not press against his thigh, know that it is dislocated.
And the restoration for all is that you make the patient sit upright, stretch his leg if he can, place your back against his face, and put his foot on your feet.
Then take his knee in your palms, pull it between your fingers, and firmly bend both sides of the knee. And let another assistant extend his foot until the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that his leg presses well against his thigh easily.
And apply the plaster, make the leg press against the thigh, and bind them tightly together for three or four days, then loosen it.
And the patient should not exert himself by walking until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not in place, apply strong stretching, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
Concerning the dislocation of the heel.
The heel is sometimes displaced and sometimes fully dislocated, either inward or outward.
And the sign is that the ankle is swollen and projects towards the side where it is dislocated.
The reduction is simple, and it must be gently stretched by hand if it is only displaced.
And when it is fully dislocated, you must make the patient sit upright, and have one assistant hold the leg firmly above the ankle.
Then pull the foot toward you with your right hand, then with your left hand twice, then extend it upward and gently push the foot upward.
And do this twice, as we have said, both pushing and pulling the foot.
If it returns to place, that is good.
If not, begin the process again, for it will return.
And if it cannot return this way, make the patient lie on his back on the ground, and fix a stake firmly into the ground between his thighs, wrapping it with cloths so that it does not injure the patient.
Then let one assistant hold the thigh, and another assistant stretch the foot with his hands or with a band tied over the ankle. Then let each assistant pull evenly, and the stake should remain between the patient’s thighs to hold him steady during the stretching.
Then let the physician adjust the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant hold the healthy leg below, and the dislocation will quickly return to place.
And when it is in place, apply the plaster and stuffing, bind it tightly, and tie the foot to the leg, being careful that the nerves behind the ankle are not compressed too tightly.
Then leave it for two or three days, and if the band loosens, rebind it.
Then loosen it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days. And if he walks before this time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if a hot swelling appears, you must calm it, as we have described elsewhere, until it is healed.
Concerning the fingers. When the fingers are dislocated, they must be gently stretched without force, and this is an easy matter.
And if the dislocation is in any joint of the back of the foot, you must make the patient sit on a flat surface or a table upright, place your foot on what is visible of the joint, then press firmly with your foot until it returns to place.
And when it is aligned and nothing is apparent, place a two-sided board under the sole of the foot, then bind it tightly, leave it for three days, then loosen it. And let it rest until it is healed.
Concerning wounds and dislocation together.
When a wound accompanies a dislocation and one attempts to treat it, it often happens that the patient dies.
Thus, do not be presumptuous in treatment if you are not skilled in the art, have not practiced it long, and are not compassionate, merciful, and patient, but rather cautious.
And at first, use soothing remedies for hot swelling, and leave the patient in the hands of God if you see no hope of healing. And when you see hope, then promptly restore the limb to its place before the hot swelling occurs.
And when the limb is in place, apply soothing remedies for hot swelling, and treat the wound as necessary with drying ointments.
And if there is a fracture or small loose bones along with the dislocation, remove them and do what we have said for simple injuries.
And beware of acting out of fear, as I have said, for this will benefit you according to your Creator and for the safety of your soul and your body.
