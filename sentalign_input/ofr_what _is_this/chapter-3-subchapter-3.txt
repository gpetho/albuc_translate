Know that sometimes both parts of the nose above are broken, or one of them alone, for these are two bones; and the one below is cartilaginous, and does not break, but only bends or twists, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, you must insert your little finger into the nostril, and with your index finger and thumb from the outside, gently realign the fracture; do this gently, and be careful that the patient does not feel pain from your work.
And if the break is in the upper part of the nose, and your finger cannot reach the place, then you should straighten it with the end of a somewhat thick stick.
And if the break is in two parts, do the same, and hurry to restore it the first day if you can; if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the hot swelling has subsided, then insert tents of linen cloth into the end of the nose, if the break is in one part.
Or insert another one on the other side, if the break is there; and the tents should be so large that they fill the nostrils.
And some restorers say that the tents should be moistened with butter and changed every day.
It does not seem good to me, but they should be moistened in a mixture of egg white and mill dust; then leave the tent in place until the bone is firm, and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes goose feathers are inserted into the nose instead of tents, with a soft cloth around them, which holds the break in place, and the patient breathes through them; now do whichever you prefer.
And if hot abscesses develop in the nose while you are working there, apply cerate or cotton moistened with rose oil, or a little diachylon.
And if hot abscesses do not develop, apply a cooling plaster made of sesame flour and incense powder, mixed with egg white, then put light compresses on top, and do not bind the nose; and if the break of the nose is small, and it is broken into small pieces, extract them with suitable instruments, then stitch the wound, and treat it with things that generate flesh and promote healing, such as suitable plasters and ointments; and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and insert lead cannulas until it is healed.
