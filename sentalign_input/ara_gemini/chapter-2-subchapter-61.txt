Chapter sixty-one on removing stones for women
Stones rarely form in women.
If one of them develops a stone, its treatment is difficult and prevented for many reasons.
One of them is that the woman may be a virgin.
The second is that you will not find a woman who allows herself to be examined by a physician if she is chaste or has close male relatives.
The third is that you will not find a woman who is skilled in this craft, especially working with the hand.
The fourth is that the location of the incision for the stone in women is far from the location of the stone, so it requires a deep incision, and in that is danger.
If necessity calls for it, then it is best to find a skilled female physician.
And they are rarely found.
If you cannot find one, then seek a chaste and gentle male physician, or bring a skilled midwife in women's matters, or a woman who has some knowledge of this craft, and have her do all that you instruct her to do, starting with examining the stone.
That is, she should see if the woman is a virgin, then she should insert her finger into her rectum and search for the stone. If she finds it and presses it under her finger, then you should instruct her to make an incision over it.
If she is not a virgin but is a widow, then instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it well.
If she finds it, she should move it from the opening of the bladder downwards as far as she can until she reaches the base of the thigh, then make an incision over it opposite the middle of the vulva at the base of the thigh, from whichever side she can reach it and feel the stone in that area, with her finger not moving from the stone, pressing it underneath.
The incision should be small at first, then insert the probe into that small incision. If she feels the stone, then she should increase the incision to the extent that she knows the stone will come out of it.
Know that the types of stones are many, including small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, and branched. Know their types to be guided by that to what you want.
If the bleeding overcomes you, sprinkle crushed vitriol on the area and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your work until you remove the stone.
Make sure you prepare for yourself the instruments that I mentioned for removing stones in men, to help you in your work.
If the bleeding overcomes you and you know from the pulse of the blood that it is from a severed artery, then place a cautery on the area and tighten it with bandages tightly, and leave it and do not return to it, and leave the stone and do not remove it, as the patient may die. Then treat the wound. When the intensity of the bleeding subsides after a few days and the area putrefies, return to your work to remove the stone.
