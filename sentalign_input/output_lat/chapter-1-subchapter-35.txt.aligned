CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE.	Chapter 37.	0.608251
On cauterization of warts after excision. When you excise warts, heat a spike-shaped cautery and bring it, hot, to the site of the excised wart, and press down till the cautery reaches the mouth of the vessel whence the blood comes. Do this once or twice over.	When you remove althelul (lesions or ulcers), heat a cautery shaped like a rod. Then insert the heated cautery into the cut althelul, pressing until it reaches the mouth of the vein from which blood flows; do this once or twice.	0.8104143
If the warts be more than one, sear each one separately as we have described ; then dress with suitable ointments till healed.	If there are multiple althelul, cauterize each one as described. Then treat them with appropriate ointments until they heal.	0.8266698
And if you burn the patient with one big cauterization over the lumbar region that will add to the effect.	If you cauterize with a large cautery over the alcatin, this is the most beneficial method.	0.4724834
