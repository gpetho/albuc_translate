On the external instruments for cutting and perforation.
Chapter 46.
Among them are the shapes of intromissa, and there are three types.
For among them is a large one, a medium one, and a small one.
They should be made of polished iron with square ends to ease their entry into abscesses.
And these are the forms of Experientia, or perforating tools: one of them is called beris, that is, a perforator, and there are three types.
For among them is a large, a medium, and a small one.
They are suitable for probing abscesses, exudations, fistulas, and buboes in areas where bones are involved.
And others are made round, smooth, and polished, like large needles used to stitch cushions, and are made of brass, or copper, or iron, or silver.
And the best of them are those made from brass.
Experientia are also made from black lead, which are suitable for examining fistulas, which, with their curves, allow a gentle retraction.
And there are again three types.
For among them are long, medium, and short ones, according to the width and narrowness of the fistula.
The form of hooks, and they are of many types.
For among them are simple ones, that is, with one curve: and they are of three types as you see, large, medium, and small.
And among them are blunt hooks: and they are of three types.
And among them are hooks with two curves, and they are of three types: and among them are hooks with three curves, and they are of three types: and all these are necessary in their respective places.
And these are the forms of scalpels, with which nodes and abscesses are cut and scraped: and there are three types: among them are large, medium, and small.
Their ends for cutting are sharp, while the other ends are not sharp: and they are designed this way to assist in scraping nodes when there is a risk of cutting a vein or nerve: and so that the patient may heal and find some relief from the cauterization encountered during the scraping of an abscess.
These are Magda, and they are of three types.
They are made of copper, and they resemble a probe, with which alcohol is made: and at the broad end, there is a hidden pointed Spatumilis: and it moves inward and outward when you wish, as you see.
The form of Spatumilia that are hidden between the fingers during the perforation of abscesses: and the patients do not notice them: and there are three types, large, medium, and small.
The forms of cups used for cutting off the flow of blood: and there are three types, large, medium, and small.
They are made of brass or copper, round, slightly elongated, as you see: and they should be delicate.
And it is necessary for you to have these types of cups, both large and small: so that you may quickly cut off the blood flow in an emergency, and when medicine is not present.
However, do not use them for cutting blood flow in every part of the body, and use them only in fleshy areas: such as the calves, thighs, arms, breasts, abdomen, and groin, and similar areas, which are fleshy and moist.
And sometimes they are made as small instruments, similar to the shape of pistachio shells: by which blood is cut off when it flows from a place of phlebotomy, or at the incision of a vein or artery: and sometimes they are made round in this shape.
