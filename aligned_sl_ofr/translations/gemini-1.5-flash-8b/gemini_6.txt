O you, very dear sons, I have completed this book, which is the last of the science of medicine, together with its fullness, and have made the end through its expositions and its declarations. And it has come to me in a vision that I complete it with this treatise, which is a part of the work of hands, that is to say, "surgery".
And because the work of hands is weak in our region and is completely foreign, the science is lost and cut off, and nothing remains of it except the small descriptions in the books of the ancients that the hands have altered. And from this has come error and vanity, and the intentions are closed and the science is distant.
Now it seems to me that I want to revive it together with the organization of this treatise according to the way of exposition, declaration, and abbreviation; and I will bring together the forms of fire cautery instruments, and of other instruments of the work with the addition of their declaration and preparation, as is necessary.
And because no good masters of hands are found in our time, the art of medicine is distant. And whoever undertakes this must excel in the science of anatomy, as Galen says, so that he knows the arrangement of the limbs, and their forms and their junctions and separations, and has knowledge of the bones and nerves and veins and their number, and the movement and stillness of the veins, and the place of their exit.
And for this reason, Hippocrates said that the name with the name is much, and with the work is little; and especially in the art of hand.
We tell you in the introduction of this book that whoever is not knowledgeable about the aforementioned things should be careful not to fall into error and kill men;
as I have often seen many of those who undertake this science and abandon themselves without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish man who cut an abscess of scrofulous sores on a woman's neck, and cut the arteries of the neck; so that so much blood flowed out that the woman fell dead in his hands.
And I saw another man who extracted a stone from an old man, and the stone was large; so that he carried away with it a piece of the bladder, and the man died within three days.
And I had already been called to remove it, and I saw the condition of the sick man and the size of the stone, and knew well that if it were cut out, he would die.
And I saw another man who treated a duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the break there was a wound;
and the ignorant surgeon forced the break over the wound with strong bandages, and did not leave the wound any slack, and left it like that for a time.
and he commanded him not to loosen it at all;
and remained like that until the leg, foot, and ankle were all swollen, and it came to ruin.
I was called to come to him, and I hurried to come and untie the leg; and when I loosened it, it was at peace and felt no pain.
But in any case, the corruption had already been established in the limb, and I could not heal it;
and the corruption continued to spread through the limb until the entire limb was lost.
And I saw another mire that collapsed the festering abscess, and then inflamed due to the malice of its lord.
For a chancre, when it is pure of melancholic humor, it is not necessary to touch it with iron unless it is in such a place that one can remove all that is corrupted.
And therefore, my son, you must know that the work of hands is divided into two divisions: that is to say, work where there is danger in several dispositions;
and I will show in each place of this book where there is fear and danger.
Therefore, it is necessary that you guard yourselves, so that fools may not speak ill of you.
So take your weapons in consideration, and undertake your patients gently and firmly, and use the best way so that through the grace of God you come to salvation and are praised;
and leave the dreadful illnesses of grievous health;
and remove your weapons from that which makes you fearful, and have faith in yourselves so that you may come from this world to the other with glory.
Galen said in some of his admonitions: Do not take on a serious illness as a cure, lest you be called a foolish healer.
I have divided this treatise into three chapters.
The first chapter is of cauteries by fire and of cauteries by sharp medicine, and the chapter is ordered from the head down to the feet;
and of the shapes of instruments, and of the iron tools for cautery, and of all that is necessary in the work.
The second chapter is of cutting and piercing, and of cupping and wounds, and of the extraction of arrows, and of similar things;
and the chapter is ordered and the shapes of the instruments.
The third chapter is of restoring dislocations and sprains, and of similar things;
and is ordered from the head down to the feet, and of the shapes of the instruments.
Before we remember the work, it is necessary that I say the quality of the help and the harm of each temperament.
I say that the qualities of help and harm are the longest speech and subtle science and the secret answers;
and many wise men spoke of this, and agreed on this;
and I am satisfied with their words, for I fear the length.
I say that cautery helps universally to all temperaments where there is matter, except for two temperaments: that is to say, a hot temperament without matter, and a dry temperament without matter.
In a hot and dry temperament together with matter, some debated and said that cautery is a great help; and the others said the opposite: that cautery is not useful for illnesses that come from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is so hot, and it should not be used to cure a hot illness by heat, nor by dryness;
and the one who said the opposite stated that cautery is of great help for hot and dry illnesses that come upon people's bodies. For when you compare the body of a man and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you find the body cold.
And I agree with this statement. For I have found it true on some occasions through experiment.
And in any case, do not intervene unless one who has tested it, and who knows through long use the chapter on cauteries, and the diversity of human temperaments, and the dispositions and causes of their illnesses, and the occurrences and the time period;
of other temperaments we have no fear, especially in cold and moist illnesses. And all the physicians assembled and agreed to the cautery.
And know, son, that cautery combined with fire is among the secrets of cures, and of greater goodness than cautery with burning medicine.
For fire is simple, and it only affects the part that is inflamed, and does not harm other parts very much.
Burning medicines spread from one part to another, and cause the affected part greater difficulty in healing; and perhaps kill the sick person.
Fire, because of its intensity and the goodness of its substance, does not cause this harm unless there is excess.
And this I have found through experiment and through the length of service and study I have put into the art, and it is based on the truth of things;
and for this I apologize for the length of the speech, for it does not please me to deprive you of the secret that is found in fire, and the quality of the work, how it expels diseases from the body, as the philosopher says in demonstrating; or receive it in your thoughts.
And know, son, that they agreed on the time when cauteries should be performed, and chose spring.
And I say that cautery is suitable at all times, because the harm that results is lessened by the help of cautery; and especially if the cauteries are necessary for pains, strong and quick, so that they cannot wait for a time when greater harm might befall the limb.
And never think about it, dear son, as fools do; for the illness that is cured by cautery has no return; and they say so;
and they say so; but it is not as they think, because cauteries are only a medicine that changes the complexion, and dries the humours that are the cause of the pain, and is more valuable than other medicine because of its quick effectiveness and the virtue of its action and power.
And a powerful thing it is that the illness sometimes comes according to the complexion of the sick person and the location of the illness and its power;
and when excesses accumulate in him through the consumption of food and similar things, unless cauteries are applied where there is little excess and moisture, like cauteries for toothache and similar things, then such pain does not return; But this happens little.
And many people do not understand why cauteries are called the last resort of medicine, and this is true;
but they do not believe that cauteries are effective after other medicines, but their intentions are false, and cauteries are the last resort of medicine because when we administer various cures for a disease and they are ineffective, then we administer cautery, and it is effective.
Therefore, it is clear that cauteries are the last resort of medicine, not according to the intentions of foolish people.
The ancients said that cauteries of gold are more effective than those of iron, and they said this only because of the quality of gold and the high nature of its substance;
and they said that the cauterized place does not cause rot, but this is not true, for I have experienced it, and found it to be true in some men;
And cauteries of gold are more effective than those of iron, as they said. And yet, when you heat a gold instrument, you cannot tell when it is hot by the color of the gold, and it cools quickly;
and if one heats it too much; so do they in the fire; and thus there is enough impediment.
Now I have ordered this chapter from head to foot, so that the path may be easier to find.
This cautery is good for moisture and cold in the head, and there are two of them, used for a disease called "soda," and because of many humors that descend from the head to the eyes, and ears, and for a multitude of dreams and toothaches and sore throats, and especially for all diseases caused by cold, such as paralysis, soda, apoplexy, and similar diseases.
The method of this cautery is that the patient is purged by a dissolving medicine, purifying the head for three or four nights, according to the strength, age, and constitution of the patient. and then, heal the patient's head.
And then have him sit cross-legged between your hands, and place his hands on his lap.
Afterwards, place the root of your palm on the root of his nose, between his two eyes. And leave your middle fingers there; then heat the cautery, called "olivare," the form of which is this: And place it on the location marked with ink, and with a gradual decrease in pressure, move your hand back and forth. Then quickly lift your hand, and observe the spot; if you see the bone slightly exposed, and if you do not see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you.
Afterwards, take a little salt, and place it in warm water and soften cotton within, then place it on the spot, and leave it there for three days.
Afterwards, place dampened cotton in butter. and leave it there until the burning is gone. Then treat the wound with the ointment called "tetrafarmaçon" until it is healed.
And the ancients said that the longer a wound remains open, the more it purges. and therefore so it is helped.
And some of these said that one should leave the cautery until part of the bone is burned, and then one must remove what is burned from the bone and treat it.
And others say that one should leave the cautery on for so long, and press it so hard, that one breaks off a piece of the bone as wide as a spindle that women put in their thread for the humors to flow out;
and one should leave the wound open for a long time; after that, one should treat and close it.
And these two methods of cauteries do not seem to me to be entirely good, except in some men where there is a way to overcome fear;
and I think I should leave it.
for the shoulder is weakened by the continued solutions of nature, as we testify in other limbs;
and even when the patient's shoulder is weak by nature, and the first semblance of cautery is safer and milder for me, and of this I use the method in this case of combined health.
When chronic pain comes to the entire head, and lasts a long time, the patient should use herbs and pills called "cochie," and head cleansing, and oils, and plasters; and if one applies the cautery that we have previously mentioned, and it is ineffective. Be careful if the patient's shoulder is of strong nature, and that it is not too cold; Then cauterize below that cautery a little as we have mentioned above. Afterwards, apply cautery to each horn of the head down to the bone, as we previously said, and apply cautery to the place called "vasselz"; and it is the place where leeches are applied; and hold your hand so that you do not see down to the bone: the patient feels much more pain in this cautery than in others, and I will speak of it elsewhere;
and the cauteries on the horns should be finer than those used on the middle of the head, and this is the form:
of the cautery of the head When sudden pain arises in a part of the head, and the illness extends to the eye, and the head has been cleansed by purifying medicines, and the other treatments I mentioned in the division of illnesses have been applied, and none of it helps: then apply cauteries in two ways, that is to say, with sharp medicine and with fire.
The cautery with sharp medicine is that you take a piece of garlic, remove the skin and slice it into two pieces, and then make an incision in the temple where the pain is located in such a way that you can place the garlic under the skin;
and when it is placed, tie it securely and leave it like that for twelve hours; and then untie it and remove the garlic, and leave the wound like that for two or three days; then put on cotton soaked in butter until the suppuration ceases.
After that, treat with ointment until it is healed;
and if you wish, use some of the burning medicines I have written about in the chapter on burning medicines.
The iron cautery is done in this way. Heat the cautery with this shape:
And it is called "closed" because the head is shaped like a closed container with a slight curve, and a small appearance in the middle;
and place it on the painful area, hold your hand, and rotate the iron gently until half of the core's thickness is burned;
and lift your hand so the artery, which is outside, does not burn, and copious blood flows out.
Afterwards, place cotton in boiled water, and apply it to the area for three days; then apply cotton soaked in butter, and then treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
and if you want to cauterize this migraine with the cautery called "cultellare", use the entire tip, and be careful not to cut the artery in this migraine, which is not ancient.
of migraine
When you treat a migraine, as we have previously discussed in the divisions of illnesses, and it doesn't work, and you see that the previously described cauteries of medicine and iron are not sufficient, then you must heat the cautery called "cultellare" until it is white;
and thus, apply it to the painful area in a line of half a finger's length, and remove your hand once, and be careful not to cut the artery and not to reach the bone;
and beware of the jawbone, which moves when one chews, and that the nerve has only the movement and spasm does not come to the patient, and beware of the escape of blood from the artery when it is cut, or cutting may cause great fear, especially to one who does not know it, and who is not a student and experienced; and leave the work half-done;
but I will tell you how one stops blood when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it belongs in this book.
And if you see that this cautery does not suffice for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize it in the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed;
and if you wish, administer the cautery that we have mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, along with the cautery that has two blades; and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.
of the pain in the ears due to cold.
When pain in the ear comes from cold, and one has applied dissolving medicines and other treatments as we have said in the division, and the pain does not change, then heat this cautery which is called "point," of which this is the shape:
After, prick all around the diseased ear, or around both if the pain is in both, and move a little above the root of the ear once you have marked the location. and have ten pricks around each ear;
after treat the area until it is healed.
of the torture of the mouth
Torture that must be cured by cautery is no different from those caused by phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illnesses;
and do not apply cautery to those that come from dryness and spasms of nerves.
When you treat this type of torture caused by phlegm from humors and purgings of the head and gargling, and that doesn't work, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, and another a little outside the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips;
and place the cautery on the part that appears healthy, and apply it to the head of the ear, a little below the head's horn, and another on the temple the length of a thumb; and leave the cautery there until half the heart is burned;
and that is the form of the cautery:
And it is similar to the knife we have described before, but it is slightly more subtle and it is necessary for the knife to be slightly larger;
after treating the area as I have said before, until it is healed.
When apoplexy is old and you treat it as we have said, and it does no good, and the patient does not have a fever, then apply four cauteries: Two on the two temples, one in the middle of the head, and one on the place called the "vessel" as we have said before, and the final cautery on the mouth of the stomach;
and be treated as we have said before.
of lethargy
For this illness, give the patient large yarrow and pills that cleanse the brain;
Afterwards, raise the patient's head, and apply the mustard plaster, which is written about in the treatise on plasters, to the patient's occiput;
and this is the manner of cautery: if you do it as I have said.
If he is thus healed, it is good; and if he is not, then make three cauteries from the middle of the head, descending down to the neck, and have one finger's breadth between each cautery;
and treat it as the others, and if you wish to add more, and the patient is enduring, then make one cautery in the middle; and if necessary, two others on the two horns, and treat it until it is healed;
and let the cauteries be those called "olivare," as I have said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed of sores and of what we have said before;
After this, the head of the patient, then cauterize it in the middle of the head and on each horn, and one behind and three on the spine of the neck;
and if you need more, and the body is moist and the patient is suffering, and the illness is severe, then make four cauteries on the spine of the back; and leave them until the most of the heart is burned, and lift your hand; after the treatment until it is healed, and let the cauteries that are called "olivare" that we have mentioned before.
of epilepsy
The epileptic should not use strong fire cauteries except those who are phlegmatic, and it is necessary first to cleanse the brain with years and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division when the patient is great and suffering from taking medicine.
And if it is a child who cannot bear it, then make them gargle and chew, cleansing the brain often with good food;
After the physician has placed the head in the middle, he applies cauteries as we have previously described, and cauteries on the vessel, and on each horn; And if the patient is strong and able to withstand it, apply cauteries as I have described for those with paralysis and body softening, on the spine of the back and neck, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped, in the manner I have stated.
If the patient is a child, apply small cauteries in this manner:
When, due to melancholy, superfluities or corrupted moisture and thick phlegm are present, then cauterize with the same type of cauteries as we described for those with paralysis.
And if, due to melancholy, the superfluities are tending towards melancholy, and the patient's body is moist, then give the patient drinks to cleanse the brain, according to what is stated earlier in the division.
Then, treat the patient's head. Then make a linen bandage, like a circle, and place it around the head;
and the patient sits cross-legged, and be firmly held from all sides;
Then apply the liniment, and it is worth using old badger butter; and warm it gently with fire, so that the patient can tolerate the application. Then empty the circle inside the head, and let it cool.
and do this to the patient each week once, with other good treatment, until they are healthy.
Or if you wish to cauterize it, by making many punctures with the cautery.
This method of cautery softens the brain equally.
and then put on cotton moistened with butter and goose fat.
of the water of the eyes When water comes first to the eyes by the signs that I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient to drink things that purify the head, and keep it free from moisture, and make him sweat in a bath several times fasting.
Afterwards, he commands him to lie on his back, and gives him cautery in the middle of the head, and gives him two cauteries on the two temples if the descent of water is to both eyes together, or on one if the descent is to one.
and cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the heart, and let the cautery be long according to the width of the temple;
and beware of the flow of blood, and if you see too much blood coming out, then stop it with as much power as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in the incision the caution how you will stop it;
and sometimes cautery or a hot iron is applied under the two bones behind.
and if one sees that it is from cold, phlegmatic superfluities, then apply the cautery that I have mentioned at the beginning of the downward flow of the eyes: one cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauteries on the two temples, and two cauteries or hot irons under the two bones; and if more is needed, then cauterize wisely above the eyebrow with small cauteries.
When you treat him according to what we have said in the division, and it does not help, then give the patient three nights' worth of broth to drink; afterward, raise the head, and make a cautery in the middle of the olive cautery; and make two cauteries of the cautery called "clavilis" above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair;
and beware of the artery so that you do not cut it.
And this is the form of the cautery called "clavilis":
When the membrane of the eye is softened by illness and moisture, then cauterize it with this cautery called "olivare". of which this is the form:
And if you wish, make two cauteries on the two eyebrows as long as the eyebrows are;
and do not leave the hand there longer than until the third part of the membrane is burned, according to the manner that I have said.
from hair that pricks the eye Sometimes it happens that the hairs of the eyelids turn inward and prick the eye, and cauteries are made according to two ways: that is to say, of fire, or of burning medicine.
For cautery with fire, instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they grow and are even, then place the patient in your care; afterwards, place on the skin around the eyes a figure that is like a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the sign be beside the hairs;
then place moistened cotton in egg white and persilyon poultice over the eye, then heat the cautery with this shape:
Afterward, cauterize over the figure you have marked little by little many times, until the heart is burned in that place;
and the signs of the health of the work are that you see the skin retracted, and the hairs raised at the puncture of the eye;
then remove your hand, and leave it thus for three days, then put moistened cotton in butter until the burn is gone; afterward, treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if afterward hairs grow and the skin is softened, then recommence the cautery on that same spot, as you did first;
and if the hairs are gone, cauterize until the skin is raised to its natural position, and is even, and the hairs do not prick the eye.
The cautery of burning medicine is that you instruct the patient to let the hairs grow large and even, then make a shape of myrtle leaf from parchment;
then take some French soap and some hot wax, of each one a third, and grind them together well; and do it quickly, so that it does not cool, then spread it over the shape you have made, like the leaf of myrtle, and place it on the skin around the eyes; and if the patient has pain in one eye only, one should work on one, and if in both also. and place under the eye cotton moistened in egg white;
and let the patient's head be on your chest and place your forefinger on the medicine, and press a little and move it every time the patient feels a burning sensation from the medicine, for it feels burning like fire.
When you have done this for a long time, remove the medicine from your finger. And when the burning sensation has passed, lift the place with water, and examine if you see the paper lifted as if it had been lifted by the force of fire or by incision; and if it is so, then it is well.
If not, then put more medicine on the spot where the medicine hasn't worked, until your work is equal, and your eyes are focused;
Then put moistened cotton in butter until the burnt heart is healed, then treat the area with the ointment called "dyafenis" and others, until it is healed.
And if it is necessary, be very careful in your work to prevent any medicine from getting in your eyes.
And if the paper becomes soft afterwards, and the hair pricks the eye, then reapply the medicine to the softened area of the paper properly, as you did before; afterward, treat it until it is healed;
and this is the form of the myrtle leaf:
And know that the eyes of men differ in size, and according to this, adjust your constraints;
and the straight path should not be denied to him who studies this art.
of the treatment of fistula by cautery
When you treat a fistula as we have described in the divisions of illnesses, and your treatments are of no benefit, then you must apply cautery to it in this manner.
Instruct the patient to place their head on your lap; and have the attendants hold his head between your hands in such a way that it does not move nor shift;
then place moistened cotton on a bandage of egg or juice of persillain over the eye;
then heat the cautery which is such:
and is shaped at the head like the shape of a vaulted feather, together with which the cautery is;
if you wish, it may be pointed from one head to the other, and if you wish, it may also be like a tent;
however, this one that is shaped is more suitable for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and extract the pus and dry it; and if it is closed, then open it, and draw out the matter;
Then apply the hot cautery firmly, and hold your hand to the cautery on the part near the eye, so that your hand does not cause harm; and place the cautery on the fat of the eye, and corrupt it.
If you go from the beginning of the cautery down to the bone, it would be good. If not, then repeat the cautery once more, and again if you need to, and leave it for three days;
Afterwards, put moistened cotton in butter on it, and treat it with a drying ointment until it is healed; and if 40 days pass and it is not healed, then apply an acute corrosive medicine until the bone is uncovered. and the treatment according to what would come in its chapter.
And there is a method of cautery for a fistula that some of the ancients said. Understand a fistula, and open the place; Afterwards, put into the fissure a thin camphor, of which this is the shape: and they make it in the quantity of a lead three. and hold your hand on the camphor firmly, and let the patient not move at all, lest the melted lead run into his eye;
and it is necessary that one put on the patient's eye a cotton soaked in egg white or in water:
The lead will burn the fistula's place, and heal it with marvelous health.
And if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have described, it is good. If not, it is necessary to administer openings to the nose, and to return the fistula to the nose's body according to what is proper in its place.
Openings/splits in the lips Often there are splits in the lips, called "poil," especially in the lips of children.
When you treat these splits with what we have said in divisions, and the treatment doesn't work, then heat a small knife cautery according to this form:
And place it quickly in those splits until it reaches the bottom;
after treat the place with a cerote until it is healed.
When an abscess comes to the root of the throat or the uvula, or the palate, or the roots of the teeth, after it causes decay and rot and is aged and becomes a fistula; and you treat it as we have said in divisions, and it does no good: Then it is necessary that you use a cautery according to the size of the fistula; after the opening or perforation of the fistula, and hold your hand until the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and the furthest point;
and do this once or twice, after the treatment we have described in treatments, until it is healed;
and if it is healed thus, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to expose the area and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you find in its chapter.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth move, and you treat it with medicines and it is no use, then place the patient's head on your chest; afterward heat the cautery, whose form will come afterward in this manner, that you place a rod upon the tooth;
and quickly put the hot cautery into it, and hold your hand so long that the patient feels the heat reaching the root of the tooth;
afterwards remove your hand and resume the cautery according to your will;
Afterwards, let the patient fill his mouth with salty water, and let it sit for an hour and wash it out vigorously.
And in this manner, the tooth that was moving is now fixed, and the soft gums are restrained, and the corrupted moisture is dried.
Of the pain of the teeth
When toothache comes from cold, where there is cold or frost, and the cures of medicine are of no value, then there is need for cautery in two ways: and cautery with butter and cautery with fire.
Cautery with butter is such that you take cow's butter, and put the tip of it in an iron or bronze spoon; then take cotton and wrap it around the tip of a tent, and soak it in boiling butter, and apply it to the aching tooth quickly and hold it until it cools;
and do so often until its virtue reaches the root of the tooth, and if you wish, soak wool and cotton in cold butter, and apply it to the aching tooth, and place hot iron on top of it so that the heat reaches the tooth's tip.
The cautery with fire is such that you take a piece of iron or bronze, and make it thick enough so that the heat does not reach the mouth of the sick person;
then heat the cautery, with which the shape will come afterwards, and place it on the tooth and hold your hand until the cautery is cool;
Do this often, for the pain will be relieved either that same day or the next.
And it is necessary that the sick person fill their mouth with good butter in the time of this cautery, and then rinse it well;
and this is the shape of the cautery:
And make cautery of whatever head you desire, and according to what you are able;
And this is the shape of the cautery's form:
of the scrofulas When the scrofulas are of phlegm and cold moisture, and are not obedient to digestion by medicines, then heat the cautery head, of which the form follows, and have two openings for the fumes to escape from the cautery on the other side;
and place the hot cautery on the abscess once, or if it is necessary, until it reaches the bottom of the abscess;
and if the abscess is small, place the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and leave it like this for three days; and place moistened cotton in butter until the burning is removed;
afterwards treat the area with ointments and dressings until it is healed.
When moisture overcomes the channels of the lung, and especially when it comes from a cold temperament, then the patient must first be purged by dissolving medicines;
Afterwards, apply cautery to the root of the throat, and be careful not to reach the throat itself, and do not burn the heart but just a little.
Afterwards, apply another cautery to the junction of the neck to the top of the spine, and let the cautery be called "clavile," of which we have the form before;
and treat the area as we have previously said until it is healed.
When coughs and lung illnesses are from cold moisture, and the patient has neither fever nor dryness, and the illness is longstanding, then apply two cauteries above the ribs in vacant places; and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two breasts;
and let the cauteries, which are called "clavile," be according to the form previously stated.
And if you wish, apply cautery by pricking all the cautery called "poins," of which the form is previously shown in the illness of the ears;
and let the pricks be up to thirty, or more around it.
After treating the area according to what has been said before, and let the cauteries be in three rows according to this form:
And for this reason, the cauteries are lighter, because you make three at a time.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. Afterwards, the patient should be placed on their back and on their side; afterwards, lift the heart that is inside the tittle at the fingers of your left hand;
and if the joint is dislocated inside, then heat the cautery that has two nerves, of which this is the shape:
and cauterize the heart until it pierces it to the side, and the figure of the cautery would be with four cauteries;
and for this, a cautery with three nerves is made, so that the figure of cauterization is six cauteries;
and the nerves are according to the subtlety of a tent, and this is the shape of the cautery that has three nerves:
And sometimes one nerve is added to this, so there are eight cauteries.
After that, put the cautery on the broken pieces with a cloth; after that, make the patient rest, and do not move the limb for a long time until it is well strengthened.
And if it is dislocated above, which thing happens little, then make cautery on the thick part of the cautery clavicle, or many cauteries in pricking.
For the joint is closed, and the moisture is removed, and the patient is healed.
When cold and much moisture come to the stomach such that it forces it out of its temperament, and the catarrh is multiplied in him, and in the usual methods of treatment, and it does not profit him at all, then it is necessary that the patient be placed on his back, and extend his legs and hands. From this, afterwards, make him three cauteries, one under the nipple by the amount of a finger, on the entire cautery clavicle, and two cauteries outside the two sides such that the figure of the cauteries is in three angles, and has such space between one another that they will not join together when they throw off corruption;
and let the cauteries be so deep that they touch the two parts of the heart, and let the figure of the cauteries be according to this form without joining:
And if you want to cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form;
and he who is afraid of this cautery, cauterize by pricking and making a sign on the stomach in that spot according to the amount you want to put in; then cauterize it with the entire cautery which is called "points".
After the treatment of the treatment that we have had before, until it is healed.
When the liver is afflicted with pain from cold and moisture and great windiness, so that it is forcibly removed from its natural complexion by superfluities; and the patient is treated with what we have said about divisions, and it does not benefit him, then the patient must be examined on his own conditions; and apply three cauteries according to this form and this figure and this quantity to the liver, to ward off the hypochondria, where the man’s ribs come.
and have the space between each cautery the thickness of a finger. and let the cauteries be lengthwise along the body, and do not press your hand too much on the entire cautery;
and only half the core should be burned, and the patient should be standing upright on their feet;
and if he cannot, let him lie down, and extend his legs and raise his arms;
And if you wish, cauterize these cauteries with a knife, if you are skillful and wise in the art, and be careful not to burn the entire core, for you would dry up the entire body; and that it does not reach the boil, for the core is very subtle in that spot, and you know this to be true.
When there is an abscess in the liver, and you wish to know if it is in the flesh of the liver or in the membrane: if it is in the flesh, the patient feels pain not too severe;
and if it is in the membrane, he feels fierce pain.
And then, when this treatment should heal the sores, the patient must be supported on their head;
and then drain the area where the abscess is, and then heat the cautery that is like a ray, of which this is the form: And cauterize with the cautery until the core is burned, and it comes down to the surface, until the pus is entirely gone;
after the treatment, according to the treatment of the sores until they are healed;
and it is not fitting for anyone to use this cautery except those who have studied medicine for a long time, and through whose hands these illnesses have run sometimes.
Then he can work boldly, and yet I seem to prefer letting it alone.
about cautery of blisters
The ancients said that one should make cauteries on blisters with roots of aristolochia, and in this manner: Take a long aristolochia root, the largest you can find, and let it be dry, and as thick and as long as your fingers; and soak it in oil, and hold it over the fire, and cauterize with it between the jawbone and the throat, and two small cauteries a little further down in the part under the beard;
and two cauteries between the fifth and sixth ribs, inclining slightly backward; and one cautery in the middle of the breast, and one more on the stomach, and one between the two shoulders, and two on the two sides of the breast, outside the cautery that is between the two shoulders;
and do not press your hand, but do it openly, as if smelling.
And some ancients said that some men used a cautery of iron, like a razor, and heat it and place it between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess; and the pain suddenly leaves, as we have said in the case of a liver abscess.
But in this procedure there is fear, where the patient dies now, or a fistula comes that cannot be healed.
of the mouse
When you treat the disease of the mouse, as we have said in the divisions of treatments, and it is of no benefit, then three types of cautery are relevant, all of which are good.
Of which one way is that you make three, or four, cauteries, by drawing lines along the length of the mouse, according to the shape of the cautery for the liver, which we have discussed before;
and do not press your hand too hard on all the cauteries, and the patient should be often on their back;
and another way of cautery is that you heat the cautery which has two nerves, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder;
and lift the heart which is near the mouse, or where the patient's pain comes from the left, and let the elevations where you lift the heart be according to the heart's position, according to the length of the body, and let the cauteries be along the width of the body.
Afterwards, insert the two inflamed nerves until the heart is pierced on the other side, and then pull out the cautery, and thus there will be four.
And if you wish, cauterize with the entire cautery to three nerves.
After the cure, when it has thrown off corruption for a long time, and this is worth more than the other cures previously mentioned.
Cautery is of no use for dropsy, except in the manner called "asclytes.
When you treat it according to the methods we have described in divisions, and your treatment does not benefit it, then you must make four cauteries around the belly, one on the stomach, one on the liver, one on the spleen, two behind the back on the spine, and one on the breast. And let the cauteries be close to the thickness of the heart.
After that, leave the cautery open to discharge pus for a long time, and do not abandon the treatment of the patient after the cautery. And healing will be hastened, and the two intentions will be together with God's help.
The shape of the cautery for the belly should be the shape that we have shown before. And the one for the back should be olive-shaped, according to what has been set out previously.
When the feet of a person with dropsy are swollen and filled with yellowish water, you should cauterize on the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger. and lift your hand with the cautery without turning.
And do not enter too deeply, lest the yellowish water escapes, and let the cautery be according to this shape:
Then make two cauteries on each leg at the point of the little toe. and let the cauteries be long, one below the knee in front and the other outside, in the middle of the leg;
and leave the cauteries open for a long time without treating them, so that the water may escape;
after the treatment of other cures that we have mentioned.
When bowel looseness comes from cold and moisture, so that the retentive and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines are weakened, and cannot be cured by usual methods; and you see the sick person suffering greatly and of strong constitution, then apply a large cautery to the stomach, according to what has been said previously, or the circular cautery of the stomach; and four smaller cauteries around the ribs, each with a small, sharp cautery, and two cauteries on the hips.
And if you see abundant moisture and the patient suffering, apply a cautery to the armpit, and one cautery on each side, and two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach, because the cure is beneficial when there is good assistance.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids
When the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, one or more, and are old and consist of thick, cold, moist, corrupt humors, and have been treated as we have said in divisions, and it does not work, then apply cauteries: Three on the spine of the back, those which are fully exposed under the armpit, little by little in a triangular pattern, and one cautery under the ribs on both sides;
And if you believe the stomach is chilled, and the food does not digest, and the face swells, then apply one large cautery on the stomach, as previously stated, and one on the liver, and one on the spleen, for all the cauteries to be done carefully. And leave the cautery open for a long time. After treatment, let the area heal.
When you cut the althelul, heat the cautery that resembles a razor, and then put it, fully ignited, on the cut althelul; and hold it there until the cautery reaches the source of the vein, from which the blood flows;
do this once or twice, and if there is much althelul, cauterize each one as we have said; after applying healing ointments until they are healed;
and if you cauterize with a large cautery on the alchatim, it will have greater help.
When the patient cannot tolerate cutting or opening, which we will describe in its place, such an illness comes that cannot be healed except by cautery.
When a fistula develops on someone, and is old and discharges putrid and corrupted moisture, you should probe it with a thin probe, and make sure you know the depth of the probe.
After heat the cautery, which resembles a rasp, and insert it into the fistula according to the amount the probe has entered, and repeat the cautery until that rotten and corrupted flesh is burned, once, or twice, or thrice, according to the amount of its need.
and beware of burning the exposed nerves, and the large veins.
If the fistula goes to the bladder and the intestine, beware of those places, and only apply these strong treatments to the fleshy areas, and consider that it is not fully penetrative.
After treat the area until it is healed, and if the area is sealed, and the materials are removed for a long time, then know that the area is completely healed.
And if the materials are not removed, know that the area is infected, and the bone at the bottom is corrupted. And thus, like one of those we will describe in its place.
When pain from cold comes to the kidneys, and from great flatulence, and does not take the form of a woman's ailment, then you must cauterize the kidneys on both sides with a clavile cautery, as we have previously described.
And if we cauterize in the middle, then there will be three cauteries in a line, and this will provide greater aid.
Of the bladder When the bladder is weak and soft from cold and moisture, so that the patient retains urine, then cauterize on the outer part of the bladder, where the hair of the lancet begins, and one on the right and one on the left, and each cautery should be as long as the nail of a thumb.
And make one cautery on the back outside, or two if you need them.
And let the cauteries be shaped as previously described.
When the marrow is cold and moist, and does not allow for conception, and the flowers are corrupted and their endings delayed; and when they come, there is great pain. Then it is necessary that one make three cauteries around the side, as we have said in the cautery of the bladder, and two cauteries outside the back;
and let the cauteries be sharp, as we have said.
When viscous moisture descends to the socket of the hip, and for this reason it moves from its place, and the sign is that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together;
and if the place of the separation is found empty, then you must cauterize the patient on the hip socket with one cautery shaped like a circle, and mark in front of the place around the socket as it turns, so that the socket is inside the circle;
and let the cautery be like the one with which one cauterized the stomach.
And if this cautery is not present, then make three cauteries of large olive shape, and let the cauteries be as deep as all the cores;
and treat it until it is healed.
of the pain in the hip When pain comes in the hip joint, and it is from cold and moisture, and the patient is treated with what we have said about division, and the treatment is not working, and the illness is old: then it is necessary that you purge the patient of the gross humors with fetid pills, or other similar good pills. After that, apply cautery;
and the method of cautery is thus in two ways: that is to say, with burning medicines, and fire cautery.
Fire cautery is in many ways, of which one is such:
that you cauterize on the hip joint three triangular cauteries according to this form, and make them deep and large, and let there be between each cautery the thickness of a finger, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped;
Sometimes cautery is done in the middle on the head of the hip, so that there are four according to this shape:
And if you wish, cauterize it with the circular cautery that we have previously mentioned in the dislocation of the hip;
but make it in such a way that the circle encompasses the entire hip, and all the flesh in the center is burned.
And this is the manner in which one treats sciatica, when the pain is in the hip and does not extend down to the thigh or leg.
And if it extends to the thigh and leg, then apply two cauteries where the patient says the pain is, and one cautery above the ankle, four fingers, slightly to the left side;
and let the cauteries be deep, and let the flesh in the center be burned.
and if the patient feels the pain extend to the toes or near the heel, then cauterize it where they feel the pain with three or four points of the cautery which is called "points". And if necessary, then make more.
And if the pain is beneath the knee towards the thigh, apply a deep or circular cautery, and be very careful with all your cauteries so that you do not apply the cautery so long that you burn the nerves and major arteries, and do not cause further harm and contraction to the patient.
And I myself have seen many who have applied cautery to the ankle of the foot, and they left it on so long that the leg became completely swollen, and the foot also, and the whole foot was pierced and corrupted. After a solution of the belly from which he died.
And if the pain is in two parts together, apply cautery to each, according to this method.
And the wise men say, regarding the cautery of the hip, that the method is to make a piece of iron that is as thick as a fingertip, or a little less, and with intervals, and that the distance between the intervals is the amount of a thumb's width.
and let the intervals be opposite on both sides, and be like knots, and there should be one iron handle well made;
and this is the form:
And it should be heated until it is all red and throws sparks, and then it is placed on the affected hip, and turned towards the healthy side;
and cauterize it once, then repeat the cautery and leave it for three days; and then make a plaster of butter, and leave the wound open for a long time; after the treatment with ointment until it is healed.
Albucasim says that we rarely use this cautery because of the fear of its effect, and few are seen using it;
and nevertheless, it is a good cautery for those who can endure it, and in the places where it is appropriate.
The cautery of burning medicine is such that you make an instrument with crosspieces into which the handle of the door descends, and it should be of bronze or iron with one long side, and in height have two measures, and there should be between each the thickness of a finger; and be open on the front and on top, and join together according to this shape:
Then place the box of the hip on the patient lying on his healthy side, and press your hand firmly onto the box of the hip; then pour between the two circles of hot water that has been heated in the fire a little, and leave it for an hour, and let the patient endure the heat and burning.
For there is found burning just like fire;
and when the burning is passed, remove your hand with the instrument and lift the hip with soft water, and leave it for three days, and apply butter until that which is black from the scalding is removed; and leave it three days for the corruption to come out;
and that would be the final aid after the treatment with ointments until it is healed.
And if the pain has extended down to the thigh or to the leg, you shall make an instrument that soaks with water according to what you did with the hip likewise;
and that is the manner of hot water, and I have written it in the treatise of the rectification of medicine. Take alkali and quicklime, as much of one as of the other, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot. where it has a small hole to let a point of a razor enter;
where it has a small hole to let a point of a razor enter; and place another pot tightly over that pot, and put alkali and lime and sweet water on top, so that there is a finger's breadth over the powders once you have grasped it well in your hand;
and leave it thus until the water drips down and settles into the tight pot; then take all that water, and pour it back over the lime and alkali as before.
And then it will be very potent and is administered in various medical works and in cauteries for other limbs.
For it works like fire, and there are other medicines for cauterizing the hip well, such as testicles and honey, anacardium and lime with soap, all these things mixed together.
And Galen tells us of a cure where a man was cured of hip pain and sciatica, and praises it greatly, and says that no other cure was performed, and that he was healed in one go when this cure was performed, and he had bathed as he will teach us next.
And says in this way that you take fresh and dry green litharge and grind it thoroughly with a little grease and put it on the hip, thigh, and leg where the pain is, and bandage it.
and leave it for three hours, and by the amount that the patient no longer feels the burning.
And then put him into a bath until his body is slightly wet, and put him into bed, and the pain will leave entirely and he will be healed.
And know that no one should use cautery with such remedies, unless it is after the evacuation of the body.
And Dioscorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with goat's dung, it helps greatly;
and the cauteries must be made in such a manner. Take wool and soak it in old oil, and place it on the hollow between the big toe and the other toe, which is called the foscile.
Afterward, take dry goat's dung, and heat it in fire until it is embers, and place it on the wool, and leave it until it is extinguished;
and repeat this procedure, and do not cease to do so until you think by your senses that it reaches the hip, and that the pain has stopped;
and this manner of cautery is called "cautery of goat.
of the pain of the back
When pain comes to the back, either from falling or striking or from too great an evacuation, or from a spreading cold matter, none of these conditions are helped by cauteries, except for that which comes from the infusion of cold matter.
It is necessary, after the patient has been purged of foul pills or other similar things, to make three lines of incisions on the back, where the pain is located, and in each line, five cauteries or more, according to the strength and the amount that the patient can endure;
and let the cauteries be made according to the cautery called "prick.
and if you wish, make three or four cauteries on the middle cautery-clasp according to this form:
This illness often comes to young children, and the signs of its beginning are that they have a tight chest when they rise, and fear; and you find it in the last spine of the back and on those other spines where it appears.
When you see this and you wish to cure it, cauterize it with a circular cautery according to this form. So that the cautery encompasses each part of the spine equally.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with a cautery that pricks in two or three lines, and let the pricks be close together.
After treating the area until it is healed according to what we have said, and be careful not to administer cautery in a swollen area that is near a nerve.
Of the pain in the joints
When joint pain is from moisture spread throughout the body's members, and when the pain is in the feet, which the doctors properly call "podagra," and when it is caused by cold and remedies cannot cure it, then it is cured by cauteries in this way:
Make many cauteries around the joint of the foot, and let the cauteries be olive-shaped according to this form:
And if it needs to be pricked on the surface of the foot, make a cautery in the whole area called "point. And if the pains reach the knees and other joints, and this happens many times, make three or four cauteries on each knee, of each part, with the entire olive-shaped cautery;
and if you need more, make more, but do not hold your hand there longer than the thickness of the heart is burned.
And if the pains descend to the knee and back, administer the cautery that we have described in this chapter.
And if the pains are in the hands, make pricks around the bone two lines wide;
and if any pain remains in the fingers, make pricks on each joint and on the hair of the hand;
and if the pains come down to the elbows or to the shoulders, cauterize each part, and provide good care to the patient and let him take medicines.
For if you give him good care and purge phlegm, he will be healthy with God's help.
When a rupture occurs in the groin, and the boil descends to the testicles and it is recent, then when you wish to treat it, he must not eat that day. and that he use things that empty the belly, so that the waste descends from his belly;
afterwards make him sit on his back between your hands, and instruct him to hold his breath until the boil has healed, and move them to your fingers, and draw a line under the rupture on the bone of the groin, and make a mark resembling half a circle above the body;
then heat the cautery of which this is the form:
until it is white and throws sparks. Then return the bowels to their place; and let the attendant hold his hand over them so they do not return;
and open the patient's thighs well, and place a cushion under him and an attendant on the thighs, and another on the chest holding his hands;
then place the cautery over the mark with your whole hand, and hold it straight and hold it until you reach the bone, and if you do not reach it the first time, repeat it another time until you reach the bone; and carefully guard against the bowel jumping when you apply the cautery; that you do not burn it; and that by this the patient does not die, or other harm.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your efforts are worthless.
And it is necessary that the cauteries for children be subtle according to their size, and for large people as large according to their size;
after three days, treat the area of the cautery with butter until the burning is gone;
after treating with other ointments until it is healed, and the patient lies on their back for forty days until the wound is well closed;
and it is necessary that his nourishment be lessened for a long time, so that the bowels do not bulge when he attempts to go into rooms.
And after forty days, when he wishes to get up, provide him with a well-made sling, and keep it on for another forty days;
and have good rest, that he not tire himself too much and avoid excessive drinking and eating, and raising his voice too loudly;
and when he follows this instruction, he is completely healed.
And I will now describe the treatment of cutting in this chapter.
When ruptures occur in other parts of the belly and are known, and you see that they are no longer growing, you should apply cautery cauterization according to its size, and one-third of the core should be burned. after the treatment according to what we have said;
and some of the ancients have said that it should be cauterized with a three-angled cautery according to this form:
but first mark the location and draw a line across the width above the rupture, and another outside it, and place your hand in the middle of the entire cautery at the notch.
But the first cauterizations are lighter and milder.
of ancient pain in any limb When pain comes to any limb, whether from falling or striking, and this pain lasts a long time, and the cures of medicine do not help, then it is necessary that it be cauterized with the cautery called "points," and the cauteries should be according to the length of the limb and its smallness and weakness and virtue and location of twists and its pain.
If it is healed from the first cautery, that is good;
if not, repeat another cautery on that one, for such is the custom that it should move to the limb that is closest to it, therefore you must apply cauteries until the patient is healed.
Poultices are sometimes aided by cautery, greatly helping, and especially for those illnesses that come from the putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
When you see it cauterized, watch if the illness is in its beginning stage, and if it is treated according to what we have said in the division, and does not lessen or remain, and you doubt that the corruption will not take hold of the entire patient, then apply five cauteries to the head. One in the middle of the head, and the other towards the forehead at the end of the hair. and two on the two temples, and one behind on the nape of the neck;
and hold your hand there until the cauteries reach the bone, and until the scabs come out so that the vapors of the thick humours may escape;
and cauterize the flesh according to what has been said before.
And if the inflammation is spread everywhere; and if it is clearly spreading, then you must cauterize it with those cauteries that we have said, one cautery on the nose, two cauteries on the spine of the neck, six cauteries on the spine of the back, one large one on the rump and another beside it, and two on the two shoulders; and two on the elbows, and two on the tendons of the chest, and one on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the hollows of the hands;
and beware of the nerves that are above the back and buttocks, that you do not burn them;
and sometimes one cauterizes on the bone of the wrist, and another on the bone of the stomach, and another on the liver.
And know that the more cauteries you make, the more you help him, and the more benefit he gets;
And know that the sick person feels no pain from the cautery as the healthy feel it, because the body is already completely corrupted.
And it is necessary that the cauteries be large and small according to the limbs and joints, according to what you find in various forms of irons.
After the treatment, apply a paste of flour of wheat with honey and other remedies until it is healthy.
When swelling occurs in any limb, and it is treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and it is not yet healed, then apply cauteries to the limb according to its size and smallness.
And let the cauteries be slightly penetrating into the thickness of the flesh; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes cauteries are applied to the hand, foot, and back, at the exit of the nerve that affects the limb, and thus the swelling is removed;
However, no one should intervene unless they are knowledgeable about the limbs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
When the illness called "albaras" is advanced, and the remedies of medicine are of no use, then cauterize it slightly, with a cautery, deeply, according to the amount of the thick layer, until the whiteness is removed, and its colour is changed;
then treat it with flour of vetch and lentils with rose oil and plantain leaves, and blood of a colon and blood of an almond, a part of each; and mix everything together, and bind it with a cloth, and air it in the place until it is healed.
The treatment of a sore by cautery
When a sore begins, and you want to stop it, cauterize it with a cautery that seems like a circle, all around the sore.
And nevertheless, the wise say that one should also cauterize the middle of the sore;
and nevertheless, this does not seem good to me, for I fear that it will be ulcerated and corrupted, and I have already seen it happen on some occasions;
and a more correct thing is that it be cauterized around, with the cautery called "circle", as we have said in many cauteries.
When someone has an illness called "adubelati", and it is slow to heal, either because of the superfluity it causes or because of the age of the sick person when they are decrepit (that is to say, too old) and they have little blood, or because of the time; and you want to hasten its healing: then cauterize it around with many small cauteries by pricking; after that, leave it thus. For it will hasten to heal.
And if you wish to pierce it with the entire cautery, heat the cautery in this shape:
And place your hand in the middle of that ailment, called "adubelati," until the cautery has pierced the core, and let the cautery be such that the patient feels it externally in such a way that the course of the corruption is alleviated.
After that, treat it until it is perfectly healed.
There is another type of illness called "corrodens," which is nothing other than a consumption of the limb, for it consumes the limbs just as fire consumes dry wood.
If you see this illness in a place that can tolerate cautery with fire, then heat the cauteries, small and large, according to what is appropriate for the area where the illness is.
After the cauterization on all sides, until you have eradicated all the corruption and nothing remains of it, so that everything that is corrupted is removed.
And then leave it for three days, and apply soothing poultices with oil to the cauterized areas until the heat from the fire is gone, and all corruption is removed.
After the treatment with ointments that generate flesh.
And if you see after three days that healthy flesh does not grow, it is good.
And if not, then repeat the cautery on the remaining corrupted areas.
And this ailment is sometimes cured with sharp medicine instead of fire cautery;
However, fire cautery is of greater aid, and I have already mentioned the treatment with sharp medicine in the division: Take it when you need it.
of the sores that come to the feet Often, sores called "clos" (in our understanding) arise on the feet from outside causes, and it is a large, painful lump that hurts the foot.
And the cauteries for this illness are of two kinds. That is to say, cautery with fire, and cautery with hot water.
Cauterization with fire is done by heating a cautery iron, shaped like a pointed roof-tile, made of good iron, sized so it can grasp the nail from all sides, and with thin edges;
After that, place it hot onto the nail, and turn your hand all around the nail until it reaches the bottom of the nail; and leave it thus for three days until it begins to cast off pus; then make a poultice of wild mallows crushed with salt, and leave the poultice on all night, and the nail will fall out and be uprooted from its roots.
Then treat the area with a healing ointment until it is healed.
And if they are converted by fire from the body, and it happens many times in hands and feet, then you must apply hot water cautery to them; and it is in this manner: take a rod of brass or iron, or a shard of glass, and put it on the nail and the wart, that is to say for warts; and place the rod over it so that it covers all around, then put a little hot water on it, and hold your hand firmly, and press your hand while turning so that the edge of the rod reaches the root of the nail, and the hot water can find a deep path down to the root;
and let the patient endure a little the burning of the hot water for an hour; then leave it like this, and it will detach itself from all its roots.
Do this one after another, until you have removed all those that are on the body, then treat them with ointments that generate flesh.
When someone trembles from cold nerves, or from a quartan fever or other, you should make four cauteries on the spine of the back, one cautery between each spine; and one cautery on the feet, and one on the stomach with an olive cautery;
This will stop the trembling, and the health will hasten from the cold illness.
Sometimes, external boils or putrid pustules appear, arising from corrupted, large matter.
If, when they appear, it is necessary at first to apply a cautery to each head of the pustule: a subtle cautery of myrtle wood, whose point is heated in fire, or of long aristolochia root, or a lentil-shaped cautery.
And sometimes they are cauterized at the beginning when they appear, according to this method, and they cannot grow further, but the superfluities from which they come are broken up, and they are healed.
But it is necessary that this be done after the evacuation of blood.
Many times there are great bleedings from the artery that is cut in the wound that comes from outside, or in the incision of the abscess, or in the cautery of the limb, and similar things; and it is a very grievous thing to stop.
And yet, when this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the wound of the vein, and press it firmly until the blood is stopped under your finger, and no more drops come out;
then put the olive-shaped cauteries, several small and large, into the fire until they are all red;
then take one, large or small depending on the wound and the place where the artery is broken, and place the cautery on that vein where you hold your finger, and hold the cautery there until the blood is stopped.
And if it jumps out when you lift your finger from the vein, and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another cautery that is in the fire.
And do not cease to do this one after the other until the blood is stopped;
and be careful that you do not burn the nerve that is nearby, and that other harm does not come upon the patient;
and know that when blood flows from the artery, it cannot be well stopped, especially when the artery is large, unless it is by one of the four ways that we have said: or by cautery, or by extraction when it is not treated, or by a strong tying of thread, or by medicines placed upon it that have the power to stop blood; and let it be bound and restrained immediately.
Whoever applies a staunching by tying tightly with cloths or putting burning things on, or other similar things, will not profit much.
And if this happens to someone and they have neither a remedy nor medicine at hand, they should put their index finger over the wound of the vein as we have said, and extend it well until it is stopped above the wound and over the vein; and not to move the finger, but to wet it with cold water often, so that it is very cold until the blood is congealed and thickened and stopped;
and proceed from there with the cauteries and medicines that are needed.
In the first chapter, we told you about every illness for which fire cautery, or burning medicine, is necessary, and the reasons and causes, and the instruments and forms of cauteries;
and I have arranged that chapter from head to foot, and I shall proceed in this chapter in the same way, so that one can more easily find what one wants.
And before I begin this, dear son, you must know that in this chapter there is more danger and fear than in the first on cauteries, and therefore greater caution is needed.
For in the work of this chapter, there is often the evacuation of blood when opening a vein, and incising an abscess, and in the treatment of wounds, and in the extraction of arrows, and in cutting into stones, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and many die.
And I warn you not to undertake foolishness. For many kinds of people come for treatment. so come those who become so enraged with their illness that they die easily due to the frenzy they experience from their disease, and the great extent of their malice; and of these one must be afraid.
And of these there are some who give you their understanding, and say: wait, I am healed"; and the illness is spiteful.
You should not agree to those who come to you with this kind of attitude, but put more value on your honor than on your greed, and do not act foolishly, but wisely, regarding those things of which you are certain, and for which you can receive praise.
and use prognostication and indication in the treatment of your patients, so that health may be restored;
and this will help you acquire good reputation, glory, and a lasting memory.
Dearest son, may our Lord grant you good understanding and uprightness, and if you wish to be inspired by the holy inspiration of his hand, amen.
Now, I have organized this chapter by sections, following the previous chapter on cauteries, which I have described from head to toe, so that you may more easily find what you need.
Know that this illness often comes to children during childbirth, and when the mother presses too hard on the child's head;
and sometimes it comes from an unknown cause.
And I have never seen this illness in anyone but children, and in all those I have seen, death came quickly. And therefore, it seems to me that it is better to leave this kind of treatment alone.
And I saw a child whose head was full of water, and whose head grew larger each day until it could no longer support it.
And the moisture grew so much that he died, and this moisture is gathered under the bone on the surface, between the heart and the bone.
And the treatment is such if the moisture is between the heart and the bone, and the abscess is small, that you should cut a wide opening in the head.
And it should be as long as two fingers, as long as the moisture runs.
And here is the form of the spatule:
If the moisture is more profound, and the abscess is larger, make two openings in the form of a cross, according to this shape:
And if the moisture is beneath the bone, and the signs show you the seams of the head open on each side, and the pus spurts out when you press on it with your hand inside, and this is not resolved: then you must cut the head into three cuts according to this method:
And after the incision, remove all the moisture outwards. Afterwards, bind the incisions with bandages and powders, and apply wine and oil, and leave it like this until the fifth day;
then unbind it, and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and let the head heal evenly, and give the patient dry food with little moisture until the limb is strong and healthy.
And another way of incision is that you look at the size of the abscess, and the collection of water;
for sometimes it is in front; sometimes behind; sometimes to the right; and sometimes to the left.
Then cut there where the abscess is open, and the accumulation of water, and cut it according to what you have the power to do;
and be careful that you do not cut the artery; and if blood flows, so that the patient dies from the outflow of blood and the evacuation of moisture.
When it happens to someone a sickness that is called "catarrh" in the eyes or in the chest, and the sickness is old, and the cure of medicine is not of any use, then the final cure is cauterization, with which one will cut the two arteries.
It is necessary then, when you are about to cut them, that the patient tilts their head back; afterward, he rubs the area with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then the patient strains their neck with all their might; then look at where the vein is, and the locations of both [arteries] are near the ears and little are protruding;
then mark the areas to be incised, then cut one and the other with a sharp scalpel on two sides, until the cut reaches the bone, and this is done with the width of the head.
And if you wish, place the scalpel beneath the artery and cut above it, cutting as you should through.
And when the vein is cut, the blood spurts upward continuously outward.
And if the artery does not appear to the touch, you must measure the distance of three fingers' breadth, then mark the area and cut down to the bone.
and that which must be drawn of blood is six ounces, and perhaps a little more or less, according to what the patient can endure, and the fullness of the artery.
then examine the wound: if it remains on the bone, just a little bit of a surface, then cut it so that no suppurating boils come, then close the wound and bandage, and apply ointment until it heals.
of migraine When long-standing migraine comes, and acute catarrh, because of moisture in the tears and heat in the temples and long-standing madness and similar things, and he is treated with various medical cures and none of it helps him, then we will open the arteries of the temples and cauterize them, as we have related.
And the method of extracting them is that the patient should pull back the hair on his temples, and locate the artery that is visible in the temple, for it is easily seen by its pulsation, and is not often visible externally except in some very cold people.
and if it is visible, the patient should tie its neck with some bandages, then rub the area with a rough cloth, and warm the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly. then take the spatula, of which this is the shape: then scrape the skin slightly until you reach the artery, then pull it upward with forceps, and separate it well from the tissues beneath it on each side;
and if the artery is thin, twist it with the tip of the hook, then cut it off on that side according to the size of two heads. For if it is not cut, the blood will not fully stop.
And draw blood from the 6th to the 3rd;
and if the artery is large, you must tie it in two places with a strong double silk thread, so that no pus comes before the wound is closed, and bleeding does not occur.
then cut the excess that is between the two ligatures at the same time, and then, if you wish, cauterize it with a sharp cautery iron to the bone until the heads are cut off;
and that is the better work, if the patient does not have a fever and is of a warm complexion. For cauteries are a help to finish the moistures: Therefore, it is of greater help for moistures.
Where it is necessary for the extraction of arteries that one fill the place with old cotton and place on top well-made tents;
and when one loosens them, they should be treated with dry medicines that cause flesh to grow, and with dressings, until they are healed;
and if blood flows from the artery as long as you work on it, then quickly stop it by cauterizing, or fill the place with vitriol and hold it with your hand so the blood is stopped; and if you do not have this present, then place your finger over the place until the blood is congealed, and wash the place with cold water until the blood stops, and hold it tightly as is necessary;
And there should be one finger's width of space between the two blades, and then when you have marked the two places, and you put the burning iron on them until it reaches the bone, and cut the vein in two places; and they should be separated between the two sides, for it is not entirely welded together by this cautery.
and this is the form of the cautery:
And the gentler and easier method for extracting the artery is to cauterize the vein with this sharp cautery from two sides, but the sharp edges should be thick to hold their heat longer. For when the instrument is too thin, it holds its heat less.
of tears When the tears from the eyes run down the veins that are on the top of the head, and no medicine applied to it is of any use, and you see the patient's face turning red, and feel a tremor in the forehead, like shivering; and the skin around the eyes is thin and moist, so that the hairs on the eyelids have fallen out, and the eyelids are inflamed and scorched by the heat of the tears, then this treatment is necessary. And the ancients called it "contused treatment," and it is done for the patient suffering from this ailment by removing the hair from their forehead, and then making three equal lengthwise incisions on the forehead;
And the ancients called it "contused treatment," and it is done for the patient suffering from this ailment by removing the hair from their forehead, and then making three equal lengthwise incisions on the forehead; and one of the incisions should be about two fingers' breadth down the middle of the forehead, and the other two should be on either side of the eyelids, and be careful not to cut the arteries that are on either side of the eyelids.
and keep your hand away from the junction of the two jawbones, and each incision should be about three fingers' breadth in length.
and have prepared a piece of sponge and many cloths to wipe away the blood, then apply the sharp spatula from two directions.  This is its shape:
from the incision near the temple to the second incision; and scrape away all the flesh that is between the two incisions, on the entire surface that is above the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second one, and then withdraw this spatula. then place in the first incision the instrument called a "knife," and it is very sharp on one side, and on the other side is blunt, not sharp, and this is its shape:
And place the cutting side of the blade against the flesh, close to the flesh, and the blunt side towards the bone, and insert it until it reaches the middle incision.
And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous to where it appears from the flesh, and then do the same in the middle incision until the other incision;
and then draw out the blood equally, and press the area for the blood taken;
then put in each incision a tent of old cotton, and place over it cloths soaked in wine, oil, and vinegar, and be careful that hot abscesses do not come;
and on the third day untie the bandage, and apply a great amount of warm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and other treatments used to heal wounds, until it is healed.
When an acute catarrh comes to some, and you see the eyes strained and small, and the eyesight weakened, and the eyelids burned; and the hair falls out, and the head has sharp pain, and the patient sneezes; Then know by these symptoms that these matters and this catarrh come only from many veins, and the best cure for it is this.
And it is that you command the patient to lean back, then make a large incision across the forehead, and another of a wide V shape. And begin from the incision of the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision go down to the bone; and keep your hand away from the nerves of the temples that move during eating;
and when the bone is exposed, wipe away all the blood with a sponge, then separate between the two sides of the incision and place old cotton and linen strips; then tie over it cloths soaked in wine and oil, and be careful of a hot abscess;
When it is removed, you should rub the bone until flesh begins to grow, then treat it with drying substances that cause flesh to grow.
In this manner: take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and make a poultice; and apply it to these wounds to cause flesh to grow everywhere.
of the stoppage of the ears
Everything that falls into the ears is one of the four things: or grains, or vermin, or a piece of ore or similar things such as iron; or seeds, such as mustard, beans, peas; or things flowing, such as water and snot and similar things.
When a stone or some other thing that does not adhere to the ear nor grow in the ear falls into the ear, place the ear in the sun.
If you see the stone, then distill a small amount of violet oil or oil of sisamum, and then administer extraction; and make him sneeze with an object, and plug his nostrils when the sneezing comes, and place pieces of cloth or wool around the ear; and extend the ear upward.
Often this treatment brings forth pus.
and if it does not bring forth pus, administer extraction with fine tweezers, of which the form is this:
If it begins to discharge pus with the tweezers, it is good;
otherwise, administer extraction with a fine, small double-edged lancet;
and if it does not discharge by that, make a copper wire and push the head of the wire into the ear opening firmly, and seal that around the wire with soft wax so that wind cannot enter with the wire; then pull it out forcefully, for often it discharges pus as we have said;
and if it does not discharge in such a manner, take a glue with which birds are caught, and place some instrument which is prepared for this on it, and put a little cotton around it; then press the glue onto the stone or whatever it is, and pull out the pus.
And if it does not discharge pus from all these things that we have said, hasten to open the ear before a hot abscess comes there and causes spasms;
and the manner of opening it is that you first make the patient bleed from the cephalic vein, and draw out blood according to its strength, then make the patient sit between your hands and turn the ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear, at the fat or dependent place; and let the incision be like a crescent moon, until you reach the stone, then remove it according to your power, and suck it quickly into your mouth;
and treat it until it is healed.
And if it is grains that are within and it swells, administer extraction;
and if it cannot come out, administer a subtle, thin spatumile according to this form: and administer an incision of that grain.
But do not do this when you think the grain is moist because of moisture from the ear, until you have made many pieces;
then extract with fine tweezers and by sucking, as we have said, so that the extraction is made easy.
In the water that falls into the ear, the patient should first use a sneezing remedy, and plug the ear with old cotton. And let them lie on that same ear where the water is. If it jumps out by that, it is good.
If not, then take many small, light stones, the length of your finger, and warm them a little in the fire; and place one in the hole of his ear, and step up on it with his feet on the other side, and hit with another stone on the stone that is in the ear; and do not stop hitting stone on stone until the water comes out completely, and so it will jump completely out;
and if you wish, take a reed, and put one end in the ear, and the other end hold over fire until the softer part of the reed is burnt;
then do the same with other reeds until the water comes out completely, as we have said with the stone.
In extracting a creature, if it is small, like a flea and similar things, treat it as we have said in the division;
but if it is large enough to be felt, administer extraction with tweezers; and that is the easiest thing to remove that is in the ear.
In extracting worms lodged in the ears, when you treat them as we have said in the division and in the treatment of distillations, and the treatment does not work, you must look at the ear in the sunlight: if any worms appear, remove them with fine tweezers, and if they do not appear, take the implement whose form is like this:
And it is narrow underneath and wide above. And insert the finest end into the ear according to the patient's suffering, then suck forcefully with the entire implement; do this repeatedly until all the worms come out.
And if they do not obey to come out, then stuff around the implement with cotton as I have said about the stone;
and if they do not jump out as we have said, then administer distillations that the ancients have tested for the killing of worms, and you will find them in the treatment of distillations;
and distill your oils and medicines into the ear using this instrument, of which here is the shape as you see: And it is of silver or bronze, narrow below at the small holes, and above open for distilling;
and to press the distillation with an instrument of well-made bronze for this, and if you wish, take a scraper and wrap cotton around the sharp point; then pour your oil or juice, and whatever medicines you wish into the channel, and the channel be in the ear;
then put the scraper with all the cotton inside, and press your hand firmly until the oil is distilled into the end of the ear; and the patient smells it inside, and let the distillation be a bit warmed by the fire beforehand as one distills it into the ear; and take care that it is not too cold, for the medicine would not be so good.
of the stopping of the ears
No children are born who do not have any holes in their ears;
and this same thing happens to men through stoppage of a wound, or of flesh born inside the ear, and these stoppages sometimes go deep into the ear, so that one cannot see them;
and sometimes it is a little bit away from the hole, and one sees it well.
That which goes deep, so that one cannot see it, requires a serious healing in many conditions, and in that which one sees, you must place the patient's ear in the sun; and look inside: if you see the blockage apparent, then treat this entire collection of pus as follows:
And let it be sharp and cutting in front and behind, all smooth, so that it does not pierce the ear;
If the blockage is from flesh born on or within the ear, then hold it with fine forceps, and cut it slightly, until all that flesh is removed.
And if the blockage is deep inside the ear, then take a fine, light scraper and heat it a little in the fire, then place it inside the ear.
If you sense the blockage, of which the patient feels pain in hearing, pierce lightly, and take care not to injure the nerves of the ear;
Then place a tent in the ear according to the width of the opening, and soak it in Egyptian ointment. Do this for a few days until the wound is closed, or take a tent and soak it in rose water and powder it with crushed vitriol;
And if you see the ear swollen, then it is necessary that you remove the tent and replace it with another tent soaked in cerote made from rose oil and wax, until the swelling is removed; Then treat it until it is healthy.
And if a discharge of blood comes, then dip a sponge and cloth in cold water, and place it on the ear, and use other treatments that stop the blood discharge which are found in the treatment of bleedings.
This ulcer that comes from papers on the eyes when they are moist and dry, then it is necessary to remove them with nippers and tweezers, and cut it with a spatula from its roots; then put powdered vitriol on the area.
And if blood flows, cauterize it with a thin, lentil-shaped cautery iron, and the cauterization after the incision will be beneficial.
and many times it returns, because some part remains of its roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
of hail Many times there come from the eyes a thing that resembles hail in its shape and hardness, and for this reason this illness is called "grandine," and is a mass of thick moisture within the eye's membrane both above and below. the work is such:
the work is such: Watch if the grandine moves from one side to the other, and it is an easy thing to know.
Then, cut it [the grandine] with a wide instrument, then lightly scrape it from each part, then grasp it with tweezers and cut it.
If you cannot cut it without piercing the membrane a little, do not worry the patient.
And if the fissure is large, join it with stitches and heal it until it is sound.
And if it is small, do not exert any force, for the ointment will quickly restore it and generate flesh.
And if the granulation is descending into the inside of the ear towards the upper part, reverse the membrane, and extend the granulation with tweezers, and cut and press it from one side and the other;
And if the membrane is moved away by the incision, that does not cause any pain.
And when the granulation is cut, raise the eye with salt water, and heal the area with that which generates flesh until the patient is healthy.
From the fat of the eyes Exinach is a fat that is generated in webs of membranes above, and this happens more to children than to adults, and it greatly pains their eyes, and they get catarrh in the mornings, and cannot look at the sun's light because tears rush to their eyes;
And therefore they often lie on their faces and sleep, and their membranes under their eyebrows are moist, so that the inflammation and the appearance are covered by the exinach which appears in the eye. And when you press the area with your fingers and feel the exinach within.
And the method of the treatment is that the patient places their head on your breast;
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the shape of a circle according to the amount of exinach in each part, then place it over it; and press with your fingers on one side and the other, so that the exinach is gathered within the circle;
then cut a slit in the middle of the moisture with a sharp spatula, and it should not be any larger than the incision made in opening a vein;
and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach; and in many places exinach comes from the incision, in the shape of a piece of white fat.
Then remove it completely with a piece of cloth tucked between your fingers, and turn your hand to the right and to the left until it is spread out;
and be careful not to press into the incision, so as not to bring the entire spatula up to the eye, so as not to injure it.
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the incision, slightly enlarge the incision a little until it appears;
then remove it as we have said, then moisten cloths with oil and water, and place over the area, and bind with bandages.
And if there are such men who grind seeds and apply them to corrupt the moisture that remains.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if there is a hot abscess in the area, treat it with soothing poultices until it is healed.
of the hairs of the papers When hairs grow on the eyelids in addition to the natural ones, and they are old, they harm the eyes and cause various illnesses such as habitual tears and softening of the eyelids and albugine, so much so that it causes the destruction of the eyes;
and the cure is according to four ways: or by cautery with fire, or by sharp medicine according to what is before or the chapter on cautery, and it is done either by incision and stitching or by cauterization, according to what I will say.
You must place the patient's head on your chest, then turn the eyelid to your left hand;
if it is turned, it is good; if not, then stick a needle to the entire thread above; and let it be next to the edge of the eyelid where the hairs grow next to these hairs, and pull the thread above the entire eyelid, and turn it with the scraper;
then cut in the part below the eyelid, below the attached hairs, across the entire space, from the large tear duct down to the small one;
then remove the thread, and place a small tent of cotton and cloth under the eyelid, then apply a shape of an incision to the eyelid, like the leaf of myrtle, and nonetheless it is necessary that the shape be according to the amount you want to raise the eyelid that is divided into all.
And if there is such a need that a large amount of the eyelid is cut according to how soft the eyelid is;
then cut across the entire space above the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the large tear duct down to the small one; and let one of the incisions be close to the natural hairs the thickness of a root, then place the hook into one of the two angles of the core, then scrape it all;
then assemble the two edges with a stitch of a fine wool thread needle, and wipe the blood, and dry the excess threads above the two eyebrows with any gluey things, if you wish to do this;
and if not, then do not care for it, then leave the stitch and the threads for three or four days;
then treat the wound without stitching with dry and constricting things, for the paper heals the wound and its joining, but the stitch is weaker (as the ancients said), and this is a work without fear; and if there is another way:
and if there is another way: and it is that you shape the paper into a figure like a myrtle leaf, as we have recounted, with three separated incisions according to the shape shown here:
then cut what is above with small equal forces according to the shape shown here:
And if you lack the power to hold the tongs, and the things are not equal, take a needle with one thread and put it in the middle of the figure; and put another thread next to the large tear, and the second thread next to the small one, and hold the threads together equally between your fingers;
then raise your hand equally, and raise all the skin upon which you have marked, as we have recounted, then stitch the two edges of the wound together, and cure it until it is healed;
and if an abscess comes to your incision, soothe it with ointment and similar soothing ointments;
and sometimes it happens that the hairs of the paper are converted:
if so, you must use what we have said about the incision;
but the stitches in one and the other are more artificial.
The treatment of canes is thus according to this form: and it is that you convert the paper and the slit within it according to what I have said, and then make two canes by art, and two thin strips just as long as the paper and the width of the spatula is; and cut as two heads from two sides where you hold the threads;
then assemble one and the other subtly over what rises from the paper of the eye, and bind the two canes from the two parts tightly; and leave it thus for some days, and the skin that is bound will die and darken and rot, until it falls off by itself.
If it delays, then cut it with force, then treat it until it is healthy;
and when the wound is healed, and the paper is removed, and the hairs will no longer prick;
and this is the shape of the two canes that you will make according to this figure, and according to this quantity of length and width:
The work is such that you take a fine needle, and put a fine soft silk thread in it; then assemble the ends and tie them together subtly, and let the length of the threads be one palm in length;
then arrange another fine silk thread briefly in the chase, and tie the ends of the thread;
then place the patient's head in your hand;
and let it be beside the sun so that the work is clear, for it is a subtle and delicate work, then insert the needle all the way through the chase into the root of the hair, and make it pierce the paper quickly so that you pull it through the natural hair;
then pull the hair out up to the chase, and put that hair into the chase, if there is one or two or three or more;
then remove your hand so that the hairs come out all the way through the chase into the paper along with the natural hair.
And if the chase is pulled and the hairs do not come out with it, then you shall pull the chase downwards along the thread that you have ordered, until the chase comes out from the hole above and you see it through the vision of the eye;
then you shall pull the chase and the thread, and close the eye and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair settles in its place and the flesh grows over;
and if the hair is small, then attach one long hair from the natural hairs, and let it grow along with that one until it is elongated, and then remove it.
of the corruption of the eye When this illness, called "aleacrati" or corruption, comes to the eye, there are two kinds of it:
one natural, and the other unnatural.
And it happens through a wound, or cutting, or cautery, and similar things.
And the way of the treatment is that you split the scab, and separate the edges of it, and put in linen bandages, and bind it until it is healed;
and it is not necessary for you to use in its treatment things that dry and restrain. For if you do that, the sickness will return worse than the first;
but work with softening things, such as fenugreek; and water or boiled flax seed, and melted diaquinon ointment in any of the oils, and wrap it in a bandage, and treat it with this.
And the secret of your treatment is that you must guard against it not healing in the form it was before;
and these treatments we have mentioned are only for managing this illness so that it does not return in the form it was before.
This illness, which is truly called "axacrati," is both natural and accidental.
The accident comes from wounds and cuts and cautery and similar things;
and the method of treatment is that you take a needle, on which there is a double thread, and pierce it into the flesh, and make it pierce from the left tear duct to the right, so that the thread comes out in two ends of the flesh;
then pull the flesh over the entire needle, and cut it with a spatula wide. And if the appearance of the paper returns according to what is necessary, it is good;
if not, take a scraper and put it in the cut, and turn the paper, and make two cuts on the inside of the paper;
and let the ends of the two cuts be at the two angles of the incision you have made, and form angles such that when they are joined together, the shape is like the shape of a letter called "a Greek letter I";
then remove that flesh, according to the amount that its edges are sharp below, from what is underneath the paper, then join the two separated parts, and stitch them with a wool thread;
then treat it with what we have said about softening medicines, and with poultices, until it is healed.
And if the illness comes from a cut or suture or cautery, then you must make a smooth cut beneath the hairs of the papers, and according to what has been said before; then separate between the two flaps of a poultice, as I have said;
then separate between the two flaps of a poultice, as I have said; and one must perform the work according to the form of the illness, for it is very diverse in form, and the wise masters prepare remedies with all their power, how to return the shape to its natural form;
and the sick person themselves, according to what work and instruments are required in various conditions.
When this adhesion occurs to humans in such a way that the paper on top is glued to the white of the eye and cannot move or perform its natural functions, then you must put the point of a razor under the paper and lift it up;
and stretch it with forceps, so that you cut what is adhering to the delicate skin, that it be neither too sharp nor too sharp, so that the patient cannot suffer the too sharp spatula from injuring the eye;
and your incision, with which you scrape that sticking together, should be gentle, so that the paper returns to its natural shape;
and that entire sticking together is healed, and sometimes they use a sharp salty water, and remove it with fresh water, and with a poultice;
then put a linen tent between the paper and the eye, and put wool soaked in abundant egg white over the eye; and after three days use a poultice and softening things until it is healed.
Know that the nail is according to two ways: It is nervous and resembles hard skin, and another which is not nervous, but resembles frozen white moisture, that when one touches it with iron and tries to tear it with pincers, one cannot.
And both types begin near the large tear duct, and grow little by little until they cover the entire sight, the entire light, and the movement of the eye.
And the method of the incision is that the patient puts their head in your grasp, then you open their eyes; and lift the paper to your hand, then grasp the nail with small-doubled pincers, and stretch it upwards; then take a needle, and put a horsehair, or cowhair, or oxhair, and a strong thread in it; and double the needle's point a little and insert it into the nail, piercing it completely with the needle, and tie the nail with a thread and stretch it upwards, and remove all hair from the nail's side that is next to the pupil and the silk around the hair all the way to the head, then cut the remaining in the root of the tear duct with delicate and small forces, and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct so that the body of tears will not usually come from the incision;
and sometimes the nail is stretched with the forceps alone, and with the thread, as we have said; then one removes it with all gentle finesse, by which the form is here:
And be careful that the finesse does not touch and break the fleshy tissue, and that the pupil is not pierced;
and after the incision, put a little bruised sil and some colerium made of litharge into the eye, and leave it until the next day; then treat what is necessary until it is healed.
And if the nail is not nervous, and you cannot push the needle, and the forceps cannot enter, this kind of nail is often cured with medicines;
and grow as I have recounted in the division, and if you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye and take a small, sharp scalpel according to this shape: And carefully cut the nail, and if you see that it diminishes and the inflammation approaches, then distil litharge-based colerium and red colerium and bruised sil into the eye from your mouth, and plug the eye until the next day;
If nothing is wrong in the eye, such as a boil, then leave it, and first treat the boil until it is healed, then restart the procedure as before, until it is healed.
then restart the same procedure until it is entirely removed.
And if the appearance of the tear duct flesh hurts the eye greatly, then suspend it from the hook, and cut off a part of it, not all of it, so that the tears do not come out;
then distill red colerium made from litharge into the eye.
In the eyes of some men, sometimes red flesh grows and covers the pupil and tightens over the eyelids and turns outwards, and it looks like a rose of a bullace;
and the treatment is that the patient puts his head in your lap, then opens his eyes, and pulls all that flesh onto appropriate hooks, and holds it in place with force;
then cut away the first flesh, and continue cutting with the razor until the end, and be careful not to injure the eye in the process;
and let the incision be like the spatula we have described in the incision of the nail and use small forces to remove the scab, as the form after this chapter demonstrates;
and when the incision is complete and all the flesh removed, then apply oil of broiet or red-colored collyrium or similar corrosive medicines, and place a linen bandage over the eye, secured with egg white, so that any hot abscess is contained;
and if anything remains, and the blood runs hot and you suspect a hot abscess, leave the eye and treat the abscess with things that calm hot abscesses;
then return to your work until it is healed, and thus do when other flesh is added to the eye in this manner.
However, you must also lighten the treatment of each eye with the natural path; and from the accidental path, in iron work;
and do not put your hand into any of these works until you see that these limbs are enduring that work.
Red veins are those that are covered over the eye, and impair its function and weaken the eye daily.
Therefore, it is necessary for you to first look to see if the eye, in which the redness is, is strong, and there is no other illness besides the redness; then treat it in this manner:
instruct the patient to place their head in your hand, then suspend those veins to the entire forehead according to your knowledge, and let the bandages be fine and doubled according to this form:
And let there be two bandages in degrees on the forehead according to this form:
then gently press on the inflamed veins, and wipe the blood drop by drop, until you see those inflamed veins move away from the eye;
and take care not to injure the eye with the points of the spatulas, and perform this work at midday in front of the sun, and be very diligent in your work so that you do not cut anything but those veins;
and when you have done this, distill into the eye green and red colic to corrupt what remains of the inflammation.
And if you are unable to collect all of it at that time, apply a poultice to the eye of things that soothe eye pain, and leave it for a few days until the pain has subsided and any hot abscess has resolved, then resume according to this method which is described before until it is healed;
and this is the form of the application:
The mirrors are called "arissati" fistulas:
When you treat it with cautery and with burning sharp medicine, according to what I said before, and it is not healed, there is a way to open the abscess, where it should remain, and remove all the moisture that is there, until the bone is exposed.
And when the bone is exposed, and you see the corruption and the blackness, then you must remove it with all the tools that are listed in this form.
and is called "asper chief," and it should be made of iron with a pointed end, and be pointed like a file, as it is in the present form.
And place it on the area of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little until you know that the corruption is removed.
and do this several times, then restore the area with drying medicines.
If the area is healed, and flesh grows, and the body of the wound is healed, and remains thus for 40 days, and it does not reopen and is not infected, and no bad accident occurs, know that it is healed.
If not, there is no other remedy than to bring the fistula back to the opening of the nose according to this form: and it is that you expose the bone a second time with iron, and with sharp medicines, and when it is exposed, then take a drill according to this form, and let the iron point have three angles, and the shaft be thin to the tip as you see here:
then place it on the bone next to the tear duct, and move your hand away from the eye a little, then turn the entire drill until it pierces the bone, and the patient feels it because wind comes out if they hold their hand over their nose;
and then restore the area with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the area hardens, the matter goes to the nose; so it is a lighter thing for the patient.
When the eyes are fully open, and there is no disturbance to the nose, nor any diminution, then you must bind the patient;
then heal it, then apply leeches or a cupping glass without striking to draw the liquid, then place a bandage made from asafoetida, aloe, frankincense, and sarcocolla on the eye, and then hold the eye closed, and place the plaster over it with bandages and cloths;
and the manner of the cloths is that you take sufficiently soft cloths, and double each one in four, and then place one over the other according to the quantity the eye needs;
then bind it over with a firm hard bandage, and renew the cupping glasses to draw the liquid without striking;
then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye bound day and night, and if the bandage softens, then you must bind it tightly;
then remove the bandage after the day and night, and if you see the eye recovering, it is good;
if not; then renew the plaster, bandages, the binding, and the cupping glasses until it is healed.
about the tearing of cloth or linen When tearing occurs in the cloth or linen, then it appears, and it oozes out from the threads like grains of resin, and is frightening to see;
Then, if you see it cut, the work is such that you insert a needle into the root of the part below, all the way up, then insert another needle where there is a double thread from the part of the tear; and pierce it, and leave the first needle according to its placement;
then cut the double thread and tie a part of the linen around, and tighten it well, then pull out the needle and put on a wet linen cloth soaked in egg white;
and leave it until the thread is pulled out with the linen, then treat the eye with comforting things until the wound is healed;
and sometimes the wound is contained by a linen bandage on all sides in a circle, until it is healed.
And if the eye shows great inflammation, pierce it with a fine needle that goes deep into the eye, and drain the white mucus, and the eye will descend, and then enter it quickly;
then drain it until it is healed.
This illness, called "alcunnati," is nothing more than swelling accumulated in the eye, resembling a descending boil, and it is not a boil;
and the method of treatment is to have the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, then take the head between your hands on both sides, and move it so that you see the swelling come towards your eyes; then it be embedded, and not descend and the light be unblocked, and the patient see things as they used to;
and if it does not descend beneath, know that it is a boil, and if the descent of the swelling is not prepared as we have said.
then have the patient sit between your hands, then take the thin spatula and make a cut on the cornea through the continuity of the conjunctiva with the cornea and the crown, until the swelling comes out;
and when it is out, then instill into the eye warm water mixed with honey, or water or fenugreek boiled and honey, then be treated with another treatment until it is healed.
of the eye's boils We have already described the appearance of boils in the division, and what is necessary to pierce them; then work according to the health.
You must make the sick person sit between your crossed hands, out of the light of the sun, and bind the healthy eye and hold it very tightly;
then place the paper of the eye in your left hand if the eye is left, or in your right hand if the eye is right;
then take in your right hand, if the eye is left, the instrument that is called "almagda," or in your left hand, if the eye is right;
then place the point of the instrument next to the crown by the thickness of a hair in that white of the eye at the part of the lower tear duct, then push the instrument that is called "almagda" vigorously, and turn your hand until it pierces the white of the eye, and feel that the almagda goes to the empty space;
and it is necessary that the measure of the almagda's passage be at the depth of the space that is from the pupil to the end of the blackness; and that is the crown of the eye;
then you will see the bone in that membrane due to the clarity of the cornea, and you can place the instrument to where the point is, then press it from under one way after another.
if the point descends now, the patient will see in front of him and the instrument in his eye.
After resting a little, and if the point ascends the second way, apply force with the instrument, and when it is firmly fixed and it does not rise, extract the almagda gently by turning your hand little by little;
and then put a little bit of gem-salt into the point, and lift the eye from that. Then apply externally to the eye, bandages or wool soaked in rose oil and a plentiful amount of egg, and bind with the sound eye.
We, and those of our time, put on a common compress with a plentiful amount of egg.
And if the almagda cannot enter the eye due to its hardness, for there are such people with excessively hard eyes, it is necessary that you take the instrument called "alberit", of which this is the shape:
And then pierce only the conjunctiva, and do not go too deep, but make a subtle opening, then put the almagda in, as we have said;
and at the completion of the work, prepare a suitable bed for the patient, in which he will sleep on his back in a dark place;
and be deprived of all movement, and eat light foods, and do not move his head either to the right or to the left, and be bound according to his condition until the third day;
then unbind him in the same dark room, and test his vision, and make him see some things, and then put the bandage back on until the seventh day;
and it is not necessary for you to do this during the time of treatment or immediately after the incision, but you must delay this, because the inflammation rises quickly.
if an inflamed abscess comes, that you unbind the eye before the seventh day, and direct it to those things that soothe the abscess;
and when it is calmed, unbind the vision and put a bandage on his face to cover it for some days, and let him remain in that dark room.
And then let him leave the room gradually, and return to his activities.
And know that no disciple should intervene in this case. And one came to us from Iraq, who told us that in their land people made an almagda, a thing with which one sucks out water, but I have never seen one in our land, nor have I ever read about it in the books of the ancients; And perhaps it is a new thing.
And these are the appearances of the forms of almagda, so that those who do not know them may see them;
and are properly of bronze: And let their heads be of this same fineness, and their tails in three sharp angles.
Sometimes there appear on the nose various added fleshy growths, some of which resemble scorpions with many legs;
and some have flesh that is deeply embedded and dark in color, and some have soft flesh of good color. In that one of these fleshy growths, which is soft and not embedded, you should have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun;
In that one of these fleshy growths, which is soft and not embedded, you should have the patient sit between your hands facing the sun; and open his nostrils, and apply the lancet to those growths, and draw them out; then cut away what you can remove with a sharp, thin lancet, until you know that the flesh is completely removed.
And if anything remains that cannot be cut, you shall work at it with all the instruments delicately, so that nothing is left; and if it is without suppuration, or has a suppurating abscess, treat it accordingly;
and if it is a malignant abscess, hurry and cauterize it until the blood is stopped and all the flesh is removed, then pour in fresh vinegar or wine. If the vinegar works, and moisture flows out to the palate, know that it is cured;
and if the moisture does not appear as it should, know that there is new flesh growing on the bone above, which the instruments cannot cut through:
Then you must insert a rather thick flax thread, and tie it by hand, with a space of a finger or less between each knot. and have the patient pull the thread into their nose to their full ability, and pull it by smelling until it emerges through the inside of the nose into the mouth;
and many children do this in schools, and it is an easy thing for anyone who wants to do it;
Then hold the end that comes out of the nose in one hand, and the other end that comes out of the mouth in the other hand, and draw one after the other, holding onto the knots that are on the thread.
Do this until you know that the knots have dissolved the flesh, then pull out the thread, wipe away the blood, and moisten the thread in Egyptian ointment, and replace it in the nose as before;
Do this for three days or more, until the ointment corrodes all the remaining flesh;
and then place a lead strip in the nose for a few days until it is healed, and if it needs drying medicines, then use them;
and this is the form of the instrument for purging the head, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nose:
And it is of silver or bronze, similar to an open lamp, like a pipe, and the conduit also;
and if you wish, make a closed pipe, and let the instrument be full to purge the head;
and let it have a handle at the top to hold it when one heats the oil or any liquid.
from the skin over the nose
Many times a disease called "telul" arises on the head of the nose, and it grows and becomes large often, until it is a visible thing to look at;
and for this, you must cut it at the beginning, and remove it completely, then place the cautery or burning medicine on the spot;
and if one delays cutting it until it is large, take care if it is hard, of a foul color, of poor sense:
if it is not touched with iron, for it is a festered abscess, for when it is cut sometimes, much harm comes to the patient;
and if the abscess is of soft touch, not of foul color, and you see that it can be completely cut, empty the patient and cut it without fear, and treat the spot with drying and tightening things.
Know that when a solution of continuity comes to one of these cartilage operations, it profits little, except in some men.
It is necessary then, when this happens to someone, to see if the wound is fresh, with all its blood; and then join the two edges with a stitch, and then treat it until it is healed;
and if the edges are already separated on one side and the other, you must cauterize all parts of their edges until they bleed, then bring the two edges together with a stitch, and bind it, and put powder on top of powder of dragon's blood, and crushed incense; and place a piece of strong or other uniting plaster on top of the powders, and leave it until it dries by itself, then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
The manner of the stitch is that you assemble the solution: or with needles, as we have said in the stitching of the belly; or with thread, as I have shown you.
of abscesses of the lips
In men, hard abscesses occur within the lips, resembling grains of millet, and smaller and larger;
Then you must turn back the lips, and make an incision on each one, and grasp it with forceps and cut it in each part;
then fill the place after the incision with crushed vitriol, until the blood is stanched;
and then lift it away, and treat the place with dry things until it is healed.
Many times, extra flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients called "albulus";
if so, you must hold it with pliers, and cut it at its root, and allow the pus or blood to run;
then put powdered vitriol, or other astringent and drying powders, on the place;
and if that flesh returns after the incision, and this happens many times, cut it a second time, and cauterize it: if it does not return after the cautery;
Sometimes there are gatherings at the head of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, scabs that are ugly and rough; and sometimes the teeth are black and yellowish and worm-eaten, so that corruption reaches the gums, and the teeth are foul-smelling;
if it is necessary, make the patient sit between your hands, and his head is in your saint, and scrape the teeth or scabs where they appear, until nothing remains; and thus do with the blackness and greenness, and the yellowness and other blemishes, until they are cleansed;
and if one removes what is there on the first occasion, that is good; if not, then begin again on the second and third days, until you have scraped everything;
and know that teeth require different types of instruments for scraping, according to what the craftsman shows, because the scrapers used to scrape the teeth have different shapes than those used to scrape between the teeth; and these shapes and others be with you prepared.
It is necessary when you cure a tooth of its pain that you delay the extraction as long as you can, for this should not be done at all; for it is a very high substance until such time as one has no excuse for scraping.
Then, when the patient is forced to extract it, it is necessary that you are certain of the aching tooth. Many times the pain deceives the patient, and they believe it is in the healthy tooth, and they have the good tooth extracted; and yet the pain does not depart by that, until the bad extraction, for we have already wanted to do this to those nobles;
and when you are certain of the aching tooth, it is necessary that you cauterize around the tooth with a strong spatula to protect the gums on all sides;
then move it with your fingers or with delicate pliers in the first place and then, until it is properly loosened, and then firmly hold the pliers; and let the patient's head be in your holy place between your knees, and hold it well so that it does not move.
After extract the tooth straight without breaking it, and if it does not jump out, take any of these instruments and gently push it from each side, and move it as you did before.
And if the tooth is pierced and decayed, it is necessary that you fill it with bandages where the holes are; and if you gently hold it with pliers, so that it does not break when holding it;
and it is necessary to work very carefully around the gum to loosen the tooth.
And be very careful not to break it, and leave a part of it, and return to the patient with more pain from the root's malice than the first.
And beware that you do not act like the ignorant masters, who through their haste and boldness sometimes break the jaw, and do not bring about what we have described;
but sometimes cause great illness through the damage to the remaining roots, or by breaking the jaw, as we have often seen;
and when the tooth is drawn, wash the area with wine or oil and salt;
and if bleeding occurs, which often happens, fill the area with powdered vitriol;
and if that doesn't work, cauterize it.
The shapes of the instruments, with which one first moves the tooth, should have long points and thick handles, so that they do not bend when you pull the tooth;
and these are the shapes: And they should be of large members so that they do not bend when pulling, and they should be of well-made, strong iron, and have teeth to hold the tooth.
of the root of the teeth When the root remains when pulling, you must place moistened cotton in butter for one or two days, until the place is softened, then place the pliers called "algefri", with which the head seems to be a beak of a bird, on it;
and they should be made like a file, and this is the shape:
And if the roots do not want to come out with all these pliers, you must uncover the flesh all around the root, and place the instrument called "althali", that is to say, a pick, of which this is the shape:
And it should be strong and thick so that it does not break, and if the root jumps out with this, that is good;
If not, use all the instruments, of which the shapes come after:
And one uses this instrument that has two blades, of which this is the shape: and other tools that are before in the arrangement of the teeth, and of this instrument that resembles large pliers, of which this is the shape:
And let these instruments be strong so that they cannot break, and know that many instruments of teeth are: and also other instruments, which are not counted:
and the skillful master himself finds his instrument, according to what his work and the illness shows him, for there are such illnesses where the ancients did not teach any instrument because of the diversity of others; and if one breaks a carriage or other bones, or if it should, then he seeks the instruments that are needed, which I have told you, and aids himself with the gestures, of which this is the shape:
And let them be large and well-holding to hold the bone, so that it does not escape, but he can hold and remove it;
and then restore the place with medicines suitable to it, and if there is rottenness in the bone, and it is small, then remove it with this whole instrument:
When the teeth appear not according to the natural body, and the form is ugly, and especially in maidens, you must know if the tooth is born after the tooth, and is not in the right place, and it cannot be filed or ground:
Then remove it; and if it is hollow with the tooth, then take this instrument, whose form is like a small beak, and is made of sharp, tempered iron at the tip:
And cut it little by little in several days because of the hardness of the tooth, and so that you do not move the other teeth, and if it appears that it can be filed, file it with a file like the one shown here:
and it is also like the file with which needles are made;
and file the tooth little by little in several days gently, so that it does not move while it breaks;
then, finally, smooth it all with a file, and if the tooth is too sharp and it hurts the tongue, it is necessary to file the sharpness until it is even, so that it does not hurt the tongue nor corrupt speech.
When the front teeth ache, either from a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot bear pressure on what they eat without pain, and you have treated them with astringent medicines, and this is of no use;
then they must be bound with a gold thread, for silver thread turns green and rots, but gold never changes.
and let the thread be neither too thick nor too thin, according to the amount of space between the teeth;
and if you want to straighten the teeth, take the thread and place it double between the two healthy teeth, then put the ends between the loose teeth, if there are one or more, until you have carefully reached the healthy tooth on the other side; then repeat the covering back to the place where you began, and gently and carefully tighten your hand until it does not move at all;
and let your binding be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape.
Then cut the ends of the thread with pliers, join them together, and place them between the healthy tooth, and position them so that they do not injure the tongue;
and then leave it as tight as it can remain, and if it loosens, or the thread breaks, then tighten it with another thread;
if it remains and serves thus for all its time, and this is the form of the teeth and the method for straightening two healthy teeth, and two misaligned ones, as you see:
And when the tooth falls out, it is put back in its place, fresh and fresh, as we have said;
and no one should interfere unless they are wise and skilled, and sometimes a tooth shape is made from cow bone, and it is placed in the place where the tooth is missing, and it is tightened as we have said, and remains and serves thus for a long time.
Sometimes this ligament arises below the tongue by nature, so that one is born this way; or by accident from a healed wound;
and the procedure is such that you open the mouth of the sick person, and hold their head steady, and lift their tongue;
then cut the thick ligament, so that the tongue is freed from its attachment, and if there is hardness or a knot, and it is from a healed wound, then use the hook and cut that ligament widely;
and be careful that the incision is not too deep, because of the artery that is underneath;
and when you have done this, lift the spot with rose water and oil, or with cold water, then place a linen tent under the tongue;
and the patient should wet it every night, so that the wound may not close.
And if a bleeding occurs, place powdered vitriol on the spot; and if the blood resists, cauterize it with a lentiginous cautery, which is good for this; then treat it with other remedies until it is healed,
and if you see a spot of a different color, whether black or hard, such that the patient does not feel it, do not touch it, for it is a cancer;
and if it is tending towards a whitish color, and there is moisture, one should place the lancet and cut it with a thin scalpel, and release it from one side and the other; and if the blood resists your work, apply powdered vitriol until it is stopped, then return to your work until you draw out all the pus;
then clean the area with vinegar and oil, and treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
of abscesses of the throat Sometimes there are boils in the throat called "godath", which are properly called the two tonsils.  And when you treat them, as we have said in the division, and they do not heal, be careful:
if it is a hard abscess of small size and dark color, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is large, do not touch it with iron, also because of the discharge of blood; but leave it until it is ripe, and then you will lance it, or it will break open by itself;
and if it is of a pale color and the root is small, prepare your instrument for cutting, but first check if the abscess is warm and has settled down.
Then make the patient sit in front of the sun, and his head is in your hand, and let him open his mouth and the sergeant hold the tongue between his hands, and press the tongue beneath the whole instrument, of which this is the form;
and it should be of fine silver or bronze, like a knife:
When you press the tongue with this instrument, and you see the abscess, take the lancet and insert it into the swelling, and pull it upwards as far as you can;
and pull out any matter with it, then cut it with the instrument, of which this is the form, which looks like a wedge; and however, the points are curved, and one toward the other, and are very sharp, and are made of hard iron or steel:
And if you do not have this instrument available, cut it with pliers, of which this is the form: And let one side be sharp, and the other not sharp;
and when you have cut one of the almonds, cut the other in the same manner, and after the incision, the patient should gargle with hot, sharp, and mild water, and if bleeding occurs, the patient should gargle with water, or with boiled pomegranate rinds, or myrtle leaves, and similar things, until the bleeding stops; then treat it until it is healed;
and sometimes other abscesses form in the throat besides the two almonds, then cut them just like the two almonds in the same way.
And I treated a woman for an abscess that had formed in her throat, namely a small abscess;
and it had almost completely closed her throat, so that the woman could not breathe through the blocked passage, and could neither eat nor drink, and would have died if she remained like that for one or two days.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had forced out two veins through the two nostrils.
I quickly acted, and inserted a lancet into one, then pulled it out, and extracted a large portion of pus;
then I did the same in the other nostril, and I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue;
after inserting the lancet into these abscesses, and cut off a portion of them, and only a little blood came out; and thus the passage of the woman's throat was cleared, and she now began to drink water and then wine, and I did not cease to cut this abscess for a long time;
and the abscess would repeatedly grow back, and fill the space I had emptied, until it became quite large;
then I incised it and cauterized it inside the throat: thus it remained without growing;
and I departed from those parts, and I do not know what God did to her after me.
of the eye
When rheum descends into the eye, and it is swollen and elongated, it is called "perpendicular";
and if it is underneath, large and round, it is called "eye".
When it is treated as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not work, and you see that the inflamed abscess has calmed down, and it is small, then you should cut it open.
and the one that is round, gathered, and not elongated; and if it is bloody or of a dark color or black, you should avoid cutting it open. For there is great danger to the patient.
Therefore, when you see it, according to the manner I have described, its whiteness and length, you must have the patient sit in front of the sun, and press the tongue with the instrument of which we have already made mention; then insert the hook into the uvula, and pull it downwards, and cut it with one of the two instruments I mentioned in the incision of the two almonds.
And you must not cut more than the excess that is beyond the natural limit;
for if you cut more, you injure the voice and the speech;
and after the incision, use what we have said about the incision of the two almonds, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the patient is afraid of the cutting, you must use a remedy for the fear of pain.
And the method of cautery is sharp and acute. And have the patient place their head in your lap, then press the tongue against the instrument we spoke of in the chapter on cautery, and cauterize with hot sharp iron, neither too thick nor too thin; and fill the end of this instrument, whose form is this:
And have at the head a cavity where medicine is placed, like the bowl of a spoon, and place the instrument with all the medicine over the wound;
and the patient lie on their side, so that the saliva and phlegm flow from their mouth into the medicine, so that it does not descend into the throat, and injure it;
then hold your hand over all the medicine and press it onto the wound for the length of half an hour, until you see it healed and the biting of the medicine is calmed;
and if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around an instrument, and soak the cotton in the medicine, and place the instrument with all the cotton on the wound, so that the cotton adheres to the wound;
and do this often, until the cauterization is complete, then leave it to dry, and it will fall off after four or five days.
And if you need to reapply the cauterization with the medicine, reapply it, and after the cauterization, wipe around the wound with cotton dipped in butter, and cleanse what is around the medicine;
and it should be rinsed with cold water, and be treated with gargles until it is healed.
This treatment is more effective for an incision than cauterization;
If it is treated with fumigation in this manner, take calamint and ysop and origanum and rue and chamomile and avronne and similar herbs, and combine them all or some of them in a pot, and add water, and boil them;
and the pot should be tightly sealed with strong clay, and inside the pot should be an instrument placed in this manner: And it should be made of silver or brass, and one of its ends should be placed in the patient's mouth so the vapor rises to the eye through the channel, until the eye is deadened;
Afterwards, repeat often, until the eye dries, and be careful not to do this at the beginning of a hot abscess, for many things can happen; and do not apply this treatment except during the decline of a hot abscess.
And if this instrument is not available, take a tube and put a piece of an egg shell inside the end, so that the patient's mouth is not too hot; because the egg shell does not allow the vapor to burn the mouth, and it is a good and safe cure together.
Many times a fish bone or spine, or something similar, lodges in the throat;
So you must remove whatever you can see, and press the tongue towards the sun using the entire instrument, so that you can see the object move;
And what you do not see, and is hidden in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is cooked in the stomach; Perhaps the lodged object will be expelled by vomiting;
or if the patient swallows a piece of sponge, or a piece of navel, or a piece of lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; and ties a thread to the sponge, and then swallows it; and when it reaches the spot, it will harden, and then you will pull it out;
and if it does not come out with what we have said, then take an instrument of lead according to this shape:
And let the instrument be bent at the head so that it can more easily enter the throat, and have the head raised upward; and beware that you do not touch the epiglottis, lest the whole thing be harmed, nor push the bone inside;
and it is better that the patient pushes the instrument, so that it may be known where the thing is fixed; if it pushes down, or he pulls it out with the entire instrument equally, until it is out.
of the leech of the throat
Sometimes the leech is treated, as I have said in the division, by the cure of medicines; and when this does not help at all, then look into the throat of the sick person in the sun, then you press his tongue with the instrument I have told you.
And if you see the leech, pull it out with a very small hook, or with delicate pliers that are suitable for this.
And if this doesn't work, take a heated iron chain, and put it in the sick person's throat, then put the hot iron on the end of the chain, and do this often. And if the sick person is feverish all day.
then take a full glass of cold water, and open the mouth, and pour it in without swallowing, and move it with their hand often; and as soon as the leech senses the water, it falls off.
And if it does not fall off as we have said, then fumigate the sick person with asafoetida, using the instrument I mentioned in the fumigation of the eye;
do this many times, for it will fall off without delay.
And the method of fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are burning coals, and let the bottom be covered with a lid pierced in the middle, and in that hole is the tip of the instrument;
then put your fumigation in it, and let the sick person put the head of the reed in their mouth, and close the mouth, so that the smoke does not come out, but goes down to the leech;
and the leech will fall now, and if it does not fall, then repeat the fumigation many times;
and let the sick person suffer thirst, and eat salty and bitter things, and drink no water;
and then it will be necessary for it to come out strongly by this treatment.
And the shape of the instrument with which one pulls the leech is, when one can see it, like curved tongs to get into the throat; and it has the appearance of a bird's beak, and there is the roughness of a file, so that whatever it takes, it cannot let go;
Many are the types of abscesses, according to what the memory brings here after one or another in this book, and they differ in perforation and incision;
and it is in two ways, one of which is in its own appearance, and of what it holds of moisture.
And the second way is because of the places where they are in the body.
For the abscesses of the head are different from those of the foundation, and the abscesses of the fleshy place are different from those that occur in joints, and each has its own judgment in the work.
And there are abscesses that should not be pierced until the swelling is ripe according to its completion;
and there are some that must be pierced when they are swollen, and do not mature according to their completion, such as abscesses that are near joints.
For when an abscess comes near the joints, and one leaves it until it is rotten around, it may corrupt the ligaments and nerves of the joint, and thus cause contraction in that limb.
Where the abscess is near the main limb, and if you delay the perforation until it is ripe, it will harm the main limb;
or if it is near the foundation, it is pierced before it is ripe;
and you should not pierce a swollen abscess without complete digestion, except that which is near the foundation, lest it rot deeply, become elongated within, and a fistula result; and cannot heal in a long time.
And you must know the time for perforating a ripe abscess according to completion, and this is when the pain has subsided, the fever has lessened, the pain and redness have diminished, and the throbbing and sharpness of the abscess head, and other signs;
and you should make the perforation in the most dependent part of the abscess, and where it appears to move.
and the perforation should be along the length of the body, and if the abscess is on the hands or feet, or in joints and nerves and arteries, and in all places equally where there is no membrane. In those that bend, according to that limb.
And when the abscess is in a fleshy area, it is better to leave the perforation until it is confirmed in complete digestion, as we have said.
For if you pierce it before that, the body of its venom will be spread, and is full of foul matter; and perhaps the lips will harden and its depth increase.
And if there are any abscesses that are pierced according to the width of the body, according to what the limb needs.
And you should make small abscesses, small openings; and in large abscesses, large openings, and many slits according to the appearance of the size of the abscess;
and if there are such abscesses where it is necessary to cut into the core, and to cut; when it has become like a flag, and is softened, then you should do as one does with boils:
and if there are some that are split into three angles, and if there are some that are cut like a myrtle leaf, like abscesses of the groin;
and if there are some where a round incision is made, and other incisions and similar cuts.
Those that have no head, like a superficial, soft abscess, it is necessary that you pierce it completely;
and it is necessary when the abscess is large, and it has collected much pus, and you pierce it, you should not remove all the pus at that time, but remove a portion; then bandage the abscess until the next day, then remove some more pus again; do this repeatedly, little by little, until all the pus comes out;
especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or young children, or old, decrepit men. For the spirit sometimes jumps with the discharge of pus, so that perhaps the patient dies, and you do not realize it.
Therefore, avoid this chapter with great caution, and when you have pierced your abscess, wipe the wound, and see if the wound of the abscess is small; and if it is a full-sized wound, apply linen or old cotton bandages; and if it is a large abscess, and there are many openings, you must place a bandage in each one, so that they meet each other;
and if you have cut part of the skin in the abscess and have stitched it together, you must fill it with old cotton or linen rags without moisture, and bandage it for up to three days;
then remove it, and treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs during your work, apply cold water and ease, and soak a cloth, and place it repeatedly over the bleeding area.
And if the bleeding persists, apply remedies and treatment, and the powders that I have mentioned in this book, and if it is in winter, and the area where the abscess is is very sensitive, then you should place bandages and cloths soaked in warm wine and oil;
and if it is in summer, and the area is fleshy, you should place cloths soaked in water and oil, or in cold wine and oil, for up to three days, as we have said;
and then drain the abscess, dry it, and treat it, as appropriate, until it is healed.
And this is what must be universally known in treating abscesses:
or I have told you how one should proceed with the treatment of abscesses, and here is the chapter.
Where sores on the head come, small abscesses are, and there are kinds of them that are in patches, like the yolk of an egg, and many similar ones.
There are some that are fatty and others where there is moisture, like pimples;
and there are some that are hard and stony to cut, and there is no doubt if the artery is not in the way.
And the work of the cutting is that you examine each instrument called an "entromissoire", from which the shape comes afterwards, what things it contains.
For if it contains moisture, then split it open lengthwise.
And when the moisture is emptied, then remove the skin without leaving any part that contained the moisture, for it returns often if anything is left.
then dip cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is present; if not, in vinegar and salt, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day; and those that remain from the night will run.
And then reapply the cotton, as before, on the second day, and the third, until you know for certain that nothing remains from the night;
then treat the wound with suitable ointment, until it is healed.
And if the abscess has a thick pus, cut it along this form, lengthwise; and scrape its skin, and peel it from all sides, and apply all your treatment to draw out the pus where it lies;
and if the artery opposes you, do as I told you afterwards.
And also do the same for the abscess if it is hard, and to cut and cure it as I have told you.
And cut into the hard and moist abscess; it is easier, because they contain little blood. And if any of these abscesses have no moisture, and of these was the abscess which I cut on the head of an old woman;
and I found the abscess like a hard, rough, and white stone, and could not break it; and if one had struck any of them, one would have caused as much injury as with a stone.
In other abscesses coming to the head, except those which come to the heads of children and to the roots of the ears, the opening should always be in the most dependent place, to allow the pus to escape;
and treat them as necessary.
Many times these abscesses appear on the neck, and under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes come elsewhere on the body, and are numerous, and are intertwined with one another.
And each scrofulous sore is properly within its own part, like the boils and abscesses of the head, as we have said; And the appearances of these scrofulas are many.
And the appearances of these scrofulas are many. There are some that contain moisture, and there are malignant ones that will not obey the healing arts.
In those, then, that you see of good disposition to the touch, and are of a color like the body's, and smooth on every side, and are not inflamed on the nerves of the neck or the artery or the conduit, and are not deep;
Then you should cut it off above, and scrape it off from every part, and spread the two lips of the sore with compresses, if you need them, as we have said in abscesses of the head;
And scrape it little by little, and be sure that you do not cut the nerve or the vein, and let the instrument not be too sharp or cutting, so that the hand does not slip, and do not go too far, so that you do not cut what you should not.
And if you cut the vein or artery, and this prevents you from working, then put powdered vitriol, or some powders that stop the blood, into the wound, and press the wound. And leave it until the abscess is calmed, and the wound is softened, and begins to rot.
And when the blood is stopped, return to your work until you complete it.
Then, with your index finger, see if any small scabs remain, and cut and clean them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scab, you should not cut the scab at its root, but tie it with a strong doubled thread and let it fall off without harming it.
Then fill the wound with old cotton dipped in Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
And if you cut the entire scab, you should bring together the two edges of the wound and stitch them now, since there is no excess remaining due to the size of the scab. You should then cut the root of it, and pull it out, and stitch it as we have said.
You should then cut the root of it, and pull it out, and stitch it as we have said. Those scabs that hold excess, pierce them where they appear ripe.
and pierce them like the one previously mentioned, hanging it down, then apply dressings with ointment and similar things so that it destroys the remaining corruption. And when the wound is well cleansed, treat it with ointment that encourages flesh growth, until it is healed.
The ancients said and spoke of the incision in the throat; But I never saw anyone in our land who did it, and this is the record of their words.
For those with squinancy, it is necessary that the slit in the throat, called the "epiglottis," be healed. and one should not give aid by those means, because all the veins and the flesh of the sick person are affected by those with a hot abscess in the mouth, or in the throat, or in the two tonsils.
When the sickness is in the channel of the lung, it is necessary to cut the epiglottis to avoid the death that comes from strangulation.
Therefore, when we want to cut the epiglottis, we should cut it below three or four small transverse slits between the two circles or by the width of the slit from the surface, not into the cartilage;
and that place is so suitable for the cutting of the epiglottis that there is no flesh there, and the vessels are far apart.
And if the master is afraid, then he should stretch the skin of the throat on the entire instrument, then cut the skin until he reaches the channel; and clear the vessels of blood, if you see anything, and then cut the surface, as we have said;
and it is demonstrated by the section of the phlegm from the channel that jumps out through the broken place, and by the failure of voice;
and leave the wound open for a while.
And when the time has passed of which one doubts the strangulation, bring together the two lips of the wound in the skin, and sew it all alone without the cartilage;
then administer medicines that cause flesh to grow, until it is healed.
Albucasim says that one should not do this until the throat is completely closed, and the patient is judged to be dying, and the breath fails him. Then one cuts the epiglottis so that the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is saved from death;
and for this the ancients commanded to leave the wound open until the malice of the disease has passed, and it passes in three days or four.  And then they commanded to sew up the wound and heal it, until it was healed;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw that a young lady took a knife and stabbed it into her throat, and cut part of the channels of the windpipe;
and I was called to treat her, and I found her as if dead.
I uncovered the wound, and found the blood that had flowed from it, and indeed, she had not cut a vein nor an artery except the throat, and the wind escaped through the wound.
I hastened, and sewed up the wound, and treated it until it was healed;
and it happened to the young lady only that she was hoarse of voice, and returned to her condition afterwards;
Therefore, I say that in the incision of the epiglottis there should be no fear.
This abscess is called "throat hernia," and is a large abscess the color of a jaundice, and is very common in women;
and is according to two manners: natural, and accidental;
where natural has no device.
And the accidental is according to two manners, of which one is similar to a fat tumor, and the other manner is similar to an abscess that comes from an artery; and if there is fear, one should not operate with strong blows except on the small one, and one should prove and search throughout the entire space: if you find it like a fat tumor, and it is not connected to any vein, cut it like one cuts tumors, and take it out completely if it has a cover. and carefully search everything, and treat it as is appropriate until it is perfectly healed.
Many types of tumors there are, of which I will describe all the appearances;
and here it is necessary that I describe the entire difference between a tumor and a boil.
I say that a boil is accompanied by heat and fever, as long as the boiling is in progress and the pus is complete; then the fever and heat subside.
A tumor, however, has neither heat nor fever nor pain, and contains a fluid that is its own sac and is the same colour as the body, and begins like a blister and grows larger;
and they come in two forms, either oily or moist, and many colours, as I have described in the classification.
When you treat a tumor, you should first test it with an instrument called an "entromissoire," according to the form described in the next chapter.
And the method of investigating tumors' abscesses is to find the moistest part of the abscess, and gently press your fingers until you know the instrument has pierced the core, according to the size of the abscess;
then withdraw the instrument, and be careful of any discharge.
If moisture runs freely, of whatever color it is, treat it as I have described for other abscesses;
and if no moisture comes after the instrument, know that it is greasy; then lance it in a cross shape, and take it with tweezers, and slightly scrape it from each side, and watch the skin where it lies, so you extract it healthy with the tumor;
and if you cannot remove it whole, then remove it in pieces, so that nothing remains.
For if anything remains, the tumor will return many times;
and if a little remains, and the blood bothers you, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders, constrict the wound, and apply soothing things to the hot abscess, and treat it with other remedies until it is healed;
and if the tumor is large, then stitch the two edges of the wound, and treat it with those things that generate flesh.
and if the throbbing vein is contrary or otherwise, then hurry and fill the place with pulverized vitriol, and leave it for two or three days, until the wound rots, and the blood boils subside; then return to cauterize what remains of the night.
See here the forms of the intrumental tools, and they are of three types: large and medium and small;
and of them there are three squares which are called "albaret", and one which is called "breb", and of them there are three types: large, medium, and small, for searching for fistulous abscesses;
and are also like the needles with which one sews sores, and are of yellow bronze, or iron, or silver, and those which are yellow are more effective, and are more tested with black lead for searching for fistulous sores;
and are of three types: large, medium, and small, according to the quantity of the width of the openings.
The shapes of the probes are of many likenesses, as you see here:
and some probes have two curves of three types as well;
and some probes have three curves, and are also of three types;
and some probes have two curves, and probes of one curve only, and are of three types;
and all these are necessary in their place.
The head of these, with which one cuts, is sharp, and some of them only cut on one side, so that one can scrape the flesh, so that one does not cut the vein or the nerve;
and among these instruments are lancets set into handles, so that the patient does not feel them when opening abscesses;
and they are of three types: large, small, and medium, as you see;
and one does not use them except on fleshy places, such as legs, and arms, and breasts, and buttocks, and similar places;
and sometimes one makes another small instrument, similar to the scales of fishes, according to this shape, with which one stops blood: and it is placed sometimes at the place that bleeds from cuts in the veins, and arteries, and sometimes again according to this large form:
Sometimes the breasts of some men swell when they begin to be corrupted, so that they seem like a woman's breasts;
and remain ugly and swollen, and whoever wishes to cure them, should do so according to this form of this line .b. up to .g.: then scrape off the fat, and fill the wound with a healing medicine, then bring together the two edges of the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed;
and if the breast slopes downward, and is softened by its size, as happens to women, then slit it open into two parts above, with two similar cuts; so that one is joined to the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller one according to this form, from this line .b. up to line .g.; then scrape off the skin that is between the two edges, and remove the fat, and apply what we have said about stitching and powders, and whatever is necessary in the treatment, until they are healed;
and if it is not healed, or the incision is not completely made, because the patient does not want to rest, or due to the flow of blood, then you must fill the wound with cotton moistened in a corrosive ointment; and leave it until it consumes the remaining matter and fat, then treat it until it is healed.
These abscesses that come from under the armpits are like hard scrofulas, or they have ridges, and some contain moisture.
Those, therefore, that contain moisture should be cut along this form, from line .b. to line .g.: And when all the pus in the abscess is emptied, fill the wound with old cotton, and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is like scrofulas, slice it as we have said in the cleaving of scrofulas, and if the wound returns pus, apply cautery as we have said before.
When the artery is ruptured, and the skin is sealed over it, there often follows abscesses, and likewise this happens to a swollen vein and abscess.
And if one recognizes it as being due to the artery, the abscess is long and deep. And when you feel it with your fingers, you feel constriction.
And when it's due to the vein, swollen and inflamed areas are apparent.
And it is foolish to cut this abscess, especially when it is under the armpits, or in the groin, or in the neck, or in many other places, and is very large. Therefore, one should avoid iron treatment, and also that which is at the head, and in that which is swollen from an artery, a cut should be made above the skin along it.
Then make a cut with a lancet, and carefully separate the artery from the tissues, until it is exposed.
Then place a needle beneath it, and pierce it all the way to the other side, and tie the artery with a double thread in two places, according to what I have taught you in the extraction of the two arteries in the temples.
Then prick the place between the two ties with a probe until the blood that is in it comes out, and the abscess be released.
Then apply the cure that promotes suppuration, until the tie falls off. Then cure it with a suitable ointment, until it is healed.
And if the abscess is near the vein's incision, you should hold what you can of the abscess with your hand, then place the needle underneath where you are holding, and pierce it, and use one double thread, and pull it from the other side. Then tie the abscess, as I told you, or tie one of the two ends of the thread to the two ends.
And if you doubt that the thread won't stay, then insert another needle through the thread underneath the entire abscess, at the incision of the first needle, and tighten the threads in four places.
Then cut the abscess until the excess comes out, then cut the excess from the core and leave what is tied.
Then place a damp cloth in wine and oil, and then administer cures of poultices and ointments until it is healed.
Just as abscesses come to the artery and vein, abscesses come to the nerves when they are struck, or through excessive labor, and similar things.
And this happens more often to the shoulders and hands and in all places where there are joints, and it is a grievous abscess, and its color resembles the color of the body, and is in many dispositions without pain;
and when it is squeezed tightly, the patient feels pain, and it is not deep within the body, but beneath the heart;
and moves well in all directions, and does not go forward or backward, or below or above, and that which is in the joints should not be cut with iron: perhaps contraction would result; and that which is on the head or forehead, split the skin with a spatula.
and that which is on the head or forehead, split the skin with a spatula. If the abscess is small, hold it with tweezers and cut it at its root;
and if it is large, suspend it with forceps, and scrape it, then remove it and stitch the wound together, and treat it until it is healed.
Sometimes it occurs in the belly and nowhere else, a disease called "fungus" because of its resemblance to mushrooms, and the root is subtle, and the head large;
and some are small and some very large;
and I saw a man who had two in his belly that were more like fungi than anything else, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had fine roots, and were slightly split, and moisture often ran from them.
I cut them and found eighteen ounces in one, and six in the other, and the work in the incision is such that you look to see if the patient is moist, and the color of the fungus is white and moist and of subtle roots; if the cut is wide, and the cautery iron is present.
if the cut is wide, and the cautery iron is present. For in the cutting, there are often excessive flows of blood, and if the blood overwhelms you, then hasten to cauterize;
and if you see the patient terrified and fearful of the incision of the iron, then take a well-made lead thread, and bind the fungus to it as we have said, and leave it for two days;
and then restrain it, and do not cease to restrain the lead thread until it cuts the fungus and falls off effortlessly.
and if the roots are large, there is fear in cutting, especially toward the belly, but you may well cut half of it, then cauterize it so it does not return;
then treat the wound, and be careful that you do not cut the pellicle which is of a fixed color and of poor sensation and milky appearance.
For it is a festering abscess, and I will come to the treatment of ulcers later.
when the boil is mature If the appearance of the boil comes from a cauterized wound or a split surface, and is on the belly, and some boils arise, as happens in other ruptures, or from blood flowing from veins or arteries according to what is stated above, or from wind;
and if it is from a split surface and the boil's emergence, the color of the abscess resembles the body's color, and is a slight thing without pain, and appears with diverse emergence. And if it is because of the emergence of the intestine, then it is more diverse, and when one presses it with their fingers, it will recede and then return, and perhaps it is hard, and grows greatly at the entrance of the bath and from hard labor.
And if it is due to moisture, it is a slight thing, and appears well when you press it with your hand, and does not constrain it at all;
and if it is due to blood, the abscess appears large and hard by these signs, and is fixed according to a quantity; and if it is due to wind, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you look to see if the appearance is due to the blood of the artery, or the vein, or wind.
and if it is due to wind, it is soft to the touch, and the work is that you look to see if the appearance is due to the blood of the artery, or the vein, or wind. Then you should abandon the treatment. For there is doubt and fear, as I have told you in the chapter on abscesses, for the artery and for the vein.
And if the appearance is due to the intestine or the bowels, you should instruct the patient to hold his breath and lie straight, then mark all around the area; then instruct him to lie often between your hands, then go around the area you marked with all the spatulas, then extend half of the abscess upward with the entire large forceps; then bind it around with strong thread, or a strong silk cord tightly, and let the wound be free from the bandage;
then open the extended half of the abscess above the bandage, and put your index finger in, and search for the intestine; if you find it caught by the bandage, untie it, and push the intestine outside the belly;
and if you find the bowel, take it with the forceps, and cut off the excess;
and if the artery or vein opposes you, go around carefully, then return to your work and take two needles, and put two strong threads in them, and put the two needles around what you have done in a cross-shape so that you make it pierce;
then tighten the abscess in four places over the needles, and if you wish, remove the needles, and leave the place until it rots, and the dead flesh will fall away by itself; or you cut it when it is softened and rotten, then treat it as necessary, and heal the abscess as we have said;
or you cut it when it is softened and rotten, then treat it as necessary, and heal the abscess as we have said; and draw out the blood or moisture that you find, then treat the place as necessary, and close the wound.
about chancre We have discussed the types of chancre, and how one should treat them with medicine, and how to avoid using iron for treatment;
and we say that chancre develops in the breast, and great care is needed in its treatment, and the ancients said that when a chancre is in a place where it can be scraped off, like a chancre on the nipples and in the thigh, and similar places, it should be completely removed when it is in the early stages;
No one has ever cured one before me.
And the treatment, when it is in a place where it can be removed, as we have said, is that you purge the patient of black bile on occasion;
then bleed him if there is obvious fullness, then prepare the patient in a good place to do the treatment;
then throw away your lancets or cauteries, and the scab from all sides, and remove it from all sides without leaving anything;
and let the blood flow freely, and wipe the place well with your hand or some object, and if the bleeding makes you oppose the incision of the artery or vein, cauterize it until the blood is stopped; then treat it with another treatment until it is healed.
of dropsy We have already discussed the various types of dropsy, how water collects, the signs of each type, and the treatment using medicine and iron:
and one should not use iron in these two types: that is to say, tympanites and yposarche, for it is a deadly thing;
Therefore, when treating this type of dropsy called "eclites" with medicine, and the treatment is ineffective, check if the patient is weak, or if they have another illness besides dropsy, such as a bowel issue or similar problems; if you should not touch it with iron, for there is danger;
and if you see a patient of strong constitution, and they have no illness other than dropsy alone, and they are neither too young nor too old, you should proceed as follows: Raise the patient upright in your hands, and the attendant should press on the belly, forcing the water to the lowest part of the chest, then take the spine-shaped spatula according to this form: And let it be sharp on both sides. pointed, and yet not so deep that it can reach the intestines when inserted, and cannot cause injury;
then see if the dropsy is lodged towards the intestines: if so, you should cut into the cavity, three straight cuts below the knife; and if the dropsy is due to a liver ailment, let your cut be on the left side of the cavity, three cuts;
and if it is due to the spleen, let it be on the right, and it is not appropriate for the patient to lie on the cut so that the superfluities do not flow to that weak spot;
then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and apply it, and lift your hand through all the space between the skin and the surface, just as in skinning, to the amount of a fingernail or even more;
then pierce the surface until the space reaches the empty spot, and that is the place of the water, then draw it out, and apply this instrument, of which this is the shape: And it is similar to a chain of fine silver, and is of bronze or light bronze, and has a small hole at the bottom part; and on one side there are three holes; and two on the other side, and one on the other;
and the head is cut like a feather, and this is the shape of the incision with which the scribes cut the feather:
at the top is the nozzle, so that when the instrument comes to the water, it immediately descends upon the instrument;
empty then one-half or one-third, for if you empty more than is fitting at that moment, perhaps the patient will die from the resolution of his spirit from the wound, or he will collapse, or he will approach death;
but empty according to the quantity of its virtue, and according to what the dispositions of the patient's virtue signify, and his pulses;
then withdraw the instrument and retain the water, and it is now retained due to the heart that stops the hole that is on the surface, of which I have spoken, that you pierce in this manner;
then repeat the instrument the next day, if you see the patient suffering this, and draw a small quantity of water;
do this for some days, and be careful not to overdo it so that only a little water remains.
And if you doubt about the patient, and you leave too much water, then cure him with a hot grave or hot sand, and through much sweating or baths and the sun, and have him drink; and cure him with drying medicines until he is healthy, and cauterize on the stomach and on the liver and on the spleen after the water extraction, as I said before.
Sometimes children are born who have no opening in the penis, or the opening is small, or it is not in its proper place.
If it is necessary, quickly pierce it with a very thin needle according to this shape:
then place a thin lead plug in the opening, and bind it and keep it like this for three or four days.  When he wants to urinate, remove the plug, and let him urinate, and then replace it;
and perhaps it is not necessary, for the urine that comes to flow will not leave it closed.
Those whose opening is small, are treated with a lead plug, as we have said, and it will enlarge.
Those whose opening is not in its place are wounded, for some are born with the opening at the head of the penis, so that they cannot urinate before raising their penis; and they cannot conceive because the matter cannot reach the womb, and that is a bad illness.
And the manner of the work is that the patient lies often on their back, then extends the head of the penis and cuts it as if the size of a feather, so that the opening falls into the middle, as is appropriate;
and beware of the bleeding that often occurs, and if it happens, stop it with what stops blood, and heal the wound until it is healthy.
of the sores on the penis Many times these sores appear on the penis, and it is an unsightly appearance of flesh;
and some are malignant and some are not;
so you must take them with a fine forceps, and cut and clean them all, then put moistened cotton on Egyptian ointment; then treat with Diafinicon ointment until they are healed.
And if the sore is malignant, of foul color and stinking, you must apply cautery.
When you have cut it, and if the ulcer is partly on the shaft and partly under the skin, you must first remove the part of the ulcer that is inside. and when it is closed, treat the part on the outside.
For when you treat it together, the shaft of the penis is not safely healed, it may be pierced, and blackness and corruption come to the penis and the testicles.
You must remove all that is black and corrupt, then apply a plaster of honey and flour, made from pomegranate bark and herbs, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
And if a discharge of blood comes, administer the lunar cautery according to this form:
The cautery aids two conditions together: that is to say, to the discharge of blood, and to the corruption;
And if the head of the penis is corrupt and retracted, you must place a lead tube or conduit on the penis, and the patient must urinate through it;
And when the skin is inflamed at the head of the penis, which happens to those who have not been circumcised, or it happens due to a wound or abscess, then you must cauterize it with a sharp instrument, until the adhesion is broken, and the head of the penis is freed from all sides;
And if it is a serious matter to divide it, you should cauterize a small area on the head of the penis and the surrounding skin;
Then carefully separate them and place a thin, soaked linen cloth over it, to prevent further inflammation.
Circumcision is not simply a separation of the continuation like other wounds; However, when we perform this operation of our own volition, and especially on children, it is necessary that we perform the best and least harmful operation.
I say that the ancients did not prescribe circumcision for their children, for they do not use it in their law, and we have only what we have acquired through experience.
For I have seen the greatest part of the masters and noblemen who performed circumcision with a knife, and by force, and with a whole new razor;
If the heart fled because there are two blades, and perhaps one above is cut, and the one below remains. Or it must be cut again, and the pain is doubled, and the cleansing of the instrument does not ensure the tip of the limb;
and with the cleansing of the nail, perhaps the iron slips, and the work is ruined, and many times they are born such that they do not need cleansing, and I have seen it.
Of the cleansing that is done with force, to the entire thread of the wire, I have found the goodness of the experiment, for the force cuts just as well above as below.
For when you press your hand, it cuts equally in one whole instant; but let the wire be well tight around the skin;
and let the manner of the first work be such that you make the child, if he understands, think that you are only tying the thread around the rod, and then you can make him happy in every way you can;
then place him between your hands upright, and hold the forces between your hands or under your feet so that the child does not see them, nor any of the instruments;
then place your hand on the rod and blow into the heart, and pull it up until the head of the rod is in; then clean it well of the dirt that has gathered there, then tie the marked place with a double thread, then tie it below one stitch to the other stitch;
then clean it well of the dirt that has gathered there, then tie the marked place with a double thread, then tie it below one stitch to the other stitch; and hold it with your two fingers by the second stitch at the thumb and index finger, and cut between the two stitches, then lift the heart quickly and pull the head of the rod; then let the blood flow drop by drop, for that is the remedy; and put powder on and on top of the powder a cloth dipped in a mixture of a boiled egg tempered with rose water, mixed with good fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with another treatment until it is healed.
The form of strength for cleansing is this:
the two blades should be taut and sharp, and the blades should also be as large as the handle equally:
The error in the cleansing is when the heart is inside the incision;
Then you must extend it to your fingernail, so that the place does not form an abscess;
and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it to your fingernail, hold it with pliers, and then cut it.
And if three days pass, and that which is beneath the rod is swollen, let it be until the hot abscess is calmed, and lightly scrape it;
cut it as you can, and be careful of the part of the rod, this will not harm it at all.
Then cure the place with things suitable for wound powder, as we have said in treating powders, and if one cuts too deeply into the heart, and it goes above, it will not harm.
Then cure it, as we have said, until it is healed.
Concerning the retention of urine
The retention of urine is due to blockage by stone, or congealed blood, or pus, or dead flesh, or similar things, as we have said in the division.
And if the urine is not released, and you see the retention is due to a stone lodged in the bladder's neck or opening, then the patient should be bent over their knees. And their feet should be placed on their back, and they should extend their abdomen from the upper part of their back, and the patient should contract their abdomen as much as they can. And then the neck of the bladder is constricted, pushing the stone upwards, so that the urine is released.
And if it does not come, as we have said, and the patient feels great pain, then you should apply extraction with an instrument called a "syringe," of which this is the shape:
And it should be made of fine, light silver, like the feathers of a bird. And it should be one and a half palms long, and thin at the head.
And the method of releasing the urine is that you take a double thread, and tie a small piece of wool or cotton to the end, and insert the end of the thread into the syringe.
And cut the excess wool, and push it to the tip of the syringe, then anoint the syringe with oil or butter and egg white, and make the patient sit on a stool, and lubricate the bladder and penis with moist oil and olive oil and warm water.
Then gently insert the syringe into the penis, until it reaches the root of the penis, then pull the penis upward towards the groin;
Then push the syringe forward towards the bladder, and the patient feels it coming up to the empty space, and this is not done correctly unless the channel it goes through is twisted;
Then pull the thread with all the little bit of wool, and the urine follows the wool, then pull it out, and make the urine flow;
And repeat the syringe until the bladder is emptied, and the patient is relieved.
When burns or blood comes into the bladder, or rot is gathered there, and you wish to instill liquids and medicines, do so using the entire instrument called a "clepsydra," and this is its form:
It is closed, and has three openings: Two on one side, and one on the other, as you see;
and the channels through which the medicine flows should be such that they seal well the urethra without additional support, so that one can draw out moisture, and insert it when necessary;
And when you wish to put your medicines into the bladder, place the tip of the instrument into the moisture, and pull on the string inside;
so you will draw the moisture into the instrument, and then forcefully push the string back inside; then the moisture will enter inside, and will go to the bladder immediately, so that the patient will feel it;
and this is the form of the subtle enema with which one enemas the bladder:
And it is of silver or of arch, and the head is higher;
and below at the breast where the ligament falls;
then take a sheep's bladder and put in the moisture with which you wish to enema the bladder, then tie it between the two breasts using a well-made double thread, and heat the moisture a little over the fire;
then put the head of the clyster into the rod, then hold your hand over the bladder, allowing all the moisture to enter, until the patient feels that the moisture has indeed reached the bladder;
and if you do not have a bladder, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle of it, and pierce it roundly around; then put a strong thread in these holes, then assemble the circle as one would assemble a tile, and put within it what you want of oil and moisture and water, and tie it in the instrument;
and do as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture comes to the bladder.
of the stone
We have already said in the division the kinds of stones, and the extraction together with medicines;
and have spoken of the difference between stones formed in the kidneys, and all the signs, and in which stone one should work with a cutting tool; and in the bladder, and in the penis;
and I will tell you openly and briefly.
I say that the stone formed in the bladder happens more often to children, and this is a sign that the urine leaks from the bladder like water in its subtlety;
and there appears gravel, and the patient scratches his penis, and it hangs down many times, and then stiffens; and from much of this leakage the foundation [of the body] weakens;
and the healing is easy in children until they are four years old, and is very difficult in old men, and is moderate in young people, in those who are between youth and old age;
and the cure is easier for those who have large stones than for those who have small ones.
And when we come to the cure, it is necessary first to cleanse the patient with a clyster, to remove all the filth which is in the intestines. For it sometimes hinders in seeking the stone.
Then take the patient by the feet, and lift and move him downwards, so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, and sometimes comes out from a high position.
then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hands are under his thighs, so that the bladder is completely inclined downwards;
then seek and touch it inside;
if you feel the stone in the space, then hurry now to cut above the stone.
And if it does not fall out upon touching it entirely, then moisten your index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is a child, or your middle finger, if the patient is a fully grown young man; and put it into its base, and seek the stone, and when you feel it with your finger, then draw it to the neck of the bladder;
then press against your finger, and push it out to the place where you wish to cut.
And order the minister to press the bladder with his hand, and order him to stretch his right hand up to the nipples, and with his left hand to remove the skin underneath the nipples in the part where the incision will be made;
then apply the spatula, the shape of which is this: And make an incision between the nipples and the fundament, not in the middle but along the left side;
and it should be straight over the stone, and your fingers should be on the fundament, and the incision should be wide at the outer edge and narrow inside, according to the size of the stone, not too large;
perhaps the pressure from your fingers on the fundament will make it jump out without difficulty;
and know that there are stones that have angles and edges: if it is difficult to remove;
and there are some that are smooth, like a ball, and round, whose removal is easy.
For those with angles and edges, make the incision larger;
and if it does not come out, you should use pliers that are like a file at the head, to tightly grasp the stone so that it does not escape; or you insert a subtle, curved instrument under it;
and if you cannot thus extract it, widen the opening slightly, and if the blood flows, cauterize it with vitriol;
and if there is more than one stone, first remove the largest one from the bladder's neck, then cut, then pull it out forcefully, and remove the smaller ones afterward, if there are any more.
And if it is very large, it must be chipped away, and a larger incision made. For two things happen to the patient: either he dies, or his urine comes out constantly because the opening cannot heal;
but nevertheless, try to pull it out, or break it with pliers, until you pull it out in pieces;
and when you have completed your work, fill the wound with frankincense, aloe, and dragon's blood, and compress it, and place a damp cloth soaked in oil and wine, or oil and rose water and cold water, over it to soothe the hot abscess; then bind the patient's neck, and do not loosen the bandage until the third day.
And when you loosen it, wash the area well with oil and water, then treat it with diafinicon and basilicon ointments until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses come to the wound and corrosions, and congealments of blood in the bladder, and be thus retained the urine, which is known in such a way that without interruption with the urine: Then put your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains, it will corrode the bladder and rot it;
then wash the wound with water and herbs and salt, and assist him in every way that you can, until he is healed;
and it is necessary that every time you treat him, that you bind his two thighs together, and gather the medicines on the area.
And if the stone is small, and it is in the passage of the penis, and stuck inside, and the urine cannot exit; if you treat it as I have said before, that you cut it many times, one is excused from the cutting through this treatment. I have already proven it thus.
Take an iron implement according to this form and let it have three angles fixed into a single point.
then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, so that it cannot return into the bladder;
then insert the implement into the penis gently, until it reaches the stone; and turn the implement in your hand against the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone on the other side;
then the urine will come out quickly, then press your hand on that which remains of the stone inside the penis. Then it will quickly break, and jump out with the urine, and the patient is cured;
and if you cannot do this for any reason that prevents it, tie a thread under the stone and another above, then cut the penis at the stone between the two threads, then pull it out, and untie the thread, and cleanse the congealed blood that is in the wound; and treat it until it is healed.
of the stone of women
Sometimes a stone is embedded in women, and if this happens, the cure is difficult, and is forbidden for three things:
one is that perhaps the woman is a virgin;
and the second is that one cannot find a woman knowledgeable enough to reveal herself to healers, especially if she is chaste.
And the third way is that perhaps one cannot find a woman knowledgeable in this art of hands;
And the fourth way is that the stone in a woman is deeper than in a man, so it requires a deeper incision, and there is great fear.  And if necessity requires this, you must take a skilled healer, and it is difficult to find one. And if you find none, seek a subtle, skilled healer;
and present a wise woman experienced in women's health, or a woman who knows part of the art, and instruct her to do what you command regarding the examination of the stone; and look closely if the woman is a virgin:
and look closely if the woman is a virgin: Then she must insert her finger into the opening and search for the stone;
And if she finds it, she should hold it under her finger, and she should be instructed to place her finger on the affected area, and press her left hand firmly against the bladder.
If she finds it, she should move it gradually from the entrance of the bladder downwards, until it reaches the root of the thigh;
Then cut into the stone at the root of the thigh, opposite the middle of the opening, where the stone appears to be positioned, and feel for the stone in that area; and do not move her finger over or under the stone, and let the incision be initially small;
and do not move her finger over or under the stone, and let the incision be initially small; Then insert the instrument into the incision; if you feel the stone, enlarge the wound until the stone can be forced out, and know that there are many types of stones:
that is to say, small and large, rough and smooth, long and round, and those that have ridges.
So recognize the signs in order to know the outcome.
And if the blood overwhelms you, place powdered vitriol on the wound and hold it for an hour until the blood is stopped;
then return to your work until the stone is forced out, and have the instruments that I have told you about for the extraction of stones, to help you with your task.
And if the blood overwhelms you, and it's from a cut artery, place the powder on the wound and bind it with cloths and bandages, and do not continue this, and leave the stone and do not remove it, lest the patient should die. Then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the blood has subsided, and the wound is healed, then return to your work, until the stone is forced out.
Watery hernia is nothing other than an accumulation of moisture or white pus, beneath the curvature of the testicles, which contains the testicle;
and is called "pus", and sometimes is properly in the tissue of the testicle, so that one might think it is another testicle; and it is the skin of the testicle between the white pus that we have mentioned;
and this happens rarely. And the generation of this hernia arises from weakness in the testicles, and that matter is spread.
And sometimes it comes from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture has many colors: where it is a color declining to jaundice, or it is without redness, or black, or watery white, and this happens more;
and these are the signs to recognize this assembly, for if it is as white as we have said, the abscess is round, and not long, like the shape of an egg, and the testicle is not apparent, because it is surrounded by moisture.
And if it has moisture within its own tissue, the abscess is round with a part of the egg, and therefore it is thought to be another egg.
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white surface, one feels it well.
Therefore, when you wish to know the color of the moisture, you test throughout the entire cavity, the shape of which is described previously. According to this, therefore, which comes after the cavity, judge of what is within.
And when we treat it with iron, it is necessary that the patient be healed according to his power and the fullness of his body.
Then place him on his back, on something a little high, and put many cloths underneath him;
Then sit on his left side, and command the minister to sit on the right, and extend the rod to one of the two ribs of the heart of the testicles;
Then take a sharp instrument, and cut the skin of the testicles in the middle of their length as far as the point, and let your incision be perfectly straight, dividing the skin of the testicles until white tissue is visible, and carefully scrape it off according to your ability;
Then pierce the white surface with a large hole, and drain all the water, and then put your hooks, and pull the surface upwards;
and do not touch the heart of the testicles, but only the surface; Cut it entirely or in pieces, even the side subtly, that if you do not cut it wisely, the water will return;
and if the testicle should pop out during your work, then return it to its place when you have completed the work on the surface;
then join the two layers of the heart of the testicles with a suture, then treat it like other wounds, until it is healed.
And if you find the testicle corrupted by another ailment, you must tie the vessels that are suspensory, fearing the flow of blood;
Then cut the testicle with the entire suspensory ligament, and remove the testicle, and treat it as we have said.
And if a wound is joined in two parts together, know that these are two branches; Then cut the other part as you did the first equally, then wipe away the blood, and place wet wool in rose oil on the wound;
Then cut the other part as you did the first equally, then wipe away the blood, and place wet wool in rose oil on the wound; and put another wool soaked in wine and oil over it, and put it over the two testicles, and put doubled cloths on top of that, and bind it over with all the bandages according to this form:
Then take two cloths, and fill them with charpie wool according to this resemblance, and let them be joined by stitching at the crotch of the breeches, and one of the ends should be placed over the buttocks down to the back, and the other to the side of the groin;
and the other two ends over the two angles, and let the whole binding be gathered together in the buckle of the breeches;
and sometimes this part is treated with cautery instead of an iron cut, and you should take a thin surgical cautery, and cut the skin of the testicles, and heat it as we have said, so that the white surface that contains the water is exposed;
Then take the cautery according to this form, and pierce that surface with the prongs, and scorch it with this hot, thin cautery:
And cut it in every way you can, until you have removed it all;
and be careful that the fire does not touch the testicle;
and know that this work is more healing; and be cautious of blood flow, and be aware that the work of cutting is delicate;
and if anything opposes you, whether an abscess, or blood flow, or something else, then cure whatever opposes you, according to what has been said before.
And if the patient is fearful, and does not want to undergo this procedure due to its terrifying nature, then administer a perforation, as I tell you, and if you are certain, based on the signs we have discussed, that the watery humor is indeed present, then make the patient sit on a raised seat; then pierce the abscess in the lower part, through the entire breadth, and place the perforation along the length of the body;
and let the opening be wide, so that all the fluid flows out;
then place cotton over the area, and bandage it, and let the remaining fluid drain, then treat it until the wound is healed;
and if the linen bandage does not allow the fluid to exit through the wound opening, then you must insert a reed or the instrument used to draw fluid from hydrops, of which the form is shown previously;
and enlarge the wound's opening, and know that the fluid returns, and gathers after six months or so, and when it has gathered as before, and thus the patient will pass his days.
Know that in the treatment of this affliction there is fear in many cases, so I think it's better to leave it alone.
and I will tell you the treatment and the characteristics of the abscess.
I say then that many abscesses arise in the body, and especially in the testicles; and it is in many cases.
This is to say, by a surplus of sharp and acute humour, spread to the testicles, or by percussion;
and the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body; and it does not find any pain, and is a grievous abscess;
and perhaps there is a grievous, fearful, and painful abscess, and of a fixed color, and sometimes comes from a broken artery, or from a vein swelling.
When it is by a broken artery, it is known by the hot disposition of the abscess when you press it with your fingers; and you should not touch it at all.
That which is made of vein swelling is known by its disposition to the touch of fingers, and one may well make the incision upon this likeness, and upon the other flesh; and it is that you cut the base of the testicles, then raise the testicle upwards, and pull the white sac away from it, and release the suspensory ligament from all parts of the testicle.
If the testicle is already stuck to the surrounding tissues, then you must pull and cut the testicle;
and if it is exposed on the surface, or within the vessels, you must release all the tension and cut it smoothly.
And if the tissue’s origin is in the rear, you must cut it all away and extract the testicle, as we have said.
And when your work is complete, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
This is an abscess enveloped by a covering similar to a boil, with softening of the testicles, and the patient suffers greatly when he moves.
and the treatment for this illness is just as difficult and frightening as the previous one, and yet we will tell you its method, according to what the ancients did.
You must have the patient sit on a raised seat, then put the supporter for the testicles down to your fingers, encompassing all the vessels close to the penis, and the master shall grasp them and stretch them firmly.
Then, cut with a sharp, broad scalpel through the vessels in the middle, until they are exposed, and then cauterize from each side, as we have described in the extraction of the arteries that are in the temples;
Then, insert a needle where there is a double thread, and tie it to the first place where the wound occurred, and tie it again to the other end; Then cut them in the middle straight, according to the length of the body, and remove the corrupt moisture;
Then treat the wound as the others, where pus is generated, so that no vessels spill out to nourish one of the testicles;
For by this, no harm comes, and if pus comes to all the vessels, then the testicles must be removed from all the vessels; So that the testicles do not lose their nourishment due to the incision of the vessels, and dry up and cannot be helped.
The occurrence of this injury is through the incision that comes in the surface, or the extension on the belly in the groin area, so that the intestines descend from that rupture to one of the testicles;
and this rupture is of the surface, or of its extension, and these two types come from many causes:
or from percussion, or from a jump, or from a fall, or from lifting a heavy load, and by similar things;
and the signs when it is from the extension of the surface, are that it happens little by little, over a long time, and does not come suddenly; and the abscesses are equal down to the depths, because the surface presses against the intestines.
And the signs when it is from a cut on the surface, are that it causes sudden pain at the beginning, and the abscess appears differently, under the skin close by, and this is because of the exit of the intestines and the body away from the surface.
And sometimes the intestines descend with the pouches, and are retained within, and cause great suffering to the patient, especially when they are pressed.
And in these iron treatments there is fear, therefore they should be avoided.
And the method of the treatment is that you instruct the patient to push the intestine back into the wound with their hand, if it can be returned; then let it be held on his neck, between your hands, and raise the thighs;
then stretch the body upwards, and cut all the skin of the testicles lengthwise; then put inside the leavres (lips) of the groin, incisions according to your need to open the wound, and let them be such that the pus can exit;
then scrape the surface that is under the skin of the testicles, until the hard white surface is exposed on all sides;
then put your index finger into what follows the testicle, into what is between the white surface that is beneath the skin of the testicle, and the second surface, and separate what is behind the testicle, and between the second surface;
and then pull with your right hand inside the body of the testicles, and stretch the white surface upward with your left hand, and lift the testicle with all its surface towards the groin; and instruct the attendant to extend the testicle upward, and loosen what is above and behind the ligament;
and check with your fingers if there is any part of the intestine wrapped around the hard white surface, and if you find anything, put it into the abdomen below;
then take a needle with a thick thread made of X threads, and put it into the back part of the surface, which is behind the skin of the testicles; after the groin, then cut the threads that appear from the threads, until there are four threads; then assemble them one over the other in the shape of a cross, and tie the surface, of which we have spoken, which is under the skin of the testicles, with a strong tie of two parts; then wrap the threads around the threads, and tie them firmly in two parts, so that none of the vessels that nourish them can enter them, so that a hot abscess does not form; and put the tie again, according to the first tie, long two inches from that one, and after these two ties, leave of the surface that is under the skin of the testicles the width of one finger; and after all the other, according to the roundness that the testicle bears;
then cut in the part that is under the skin of the testicles, as much as the blood flows, and it bows, as we have said before;
then apply wool soaked in oil, and place it on the wounds, and apply the bandage that we have mentioned. And sometimes the white surface that we have mentioned is cauterized after the incision, out of fear of excessive bleeding. For this happens many times, and leave the bandage until it falls off by itself;
and if it is slow to fall off, it should be soaked with hot water, and apply what we have mentioned, until it falls off;
then treat the wound with another treatment, until it is completely healed.
of fleshy hernia
In this remedy, I have never seen anyone dare to perform the cure with iron.
And the ancients said that it is done like the remedy that is with the wound, in such a way that you tie the vessels, after the incision above or slightly below;
then cut in half, and treat the abscess of that which opens, until the vessel bleeds;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the ribs, as we have said, and the place opens;
and none of the intestines descend into the groin, and if any do descend, it is little, and returns at all times;
and nevertheless if it remains too long in this state, the wound or abscess grows until the intestine descends;
and this happens by the spreading of the abscess that is on the ribs, as we have said, for it is spread, then the place is softened and swollen and open;
and the cure is by cautery, as we have said before;
and sometimes it is cured by iron in this manner: and is that the patient lies often on his back between your hands, then cut the place of the inflamed rupture from the wide according to the quantity of three fingers;
and then pull out the abscess that is under the skin that covers it, then take the rag and place it on the visible area of the abscess;
and press it to the deep part of the belly, then stitch the two visible places of the abscess over the top of the rag, and stitch one and the other;
then remove the top of the rag, and do not cut the abscess nor stretch it nor anything else, as I have taught you in the cure of the rupture of the intestines; then cure it by the cure of wounds.
then cure it by the cure of wounds. And when you cut the threads, then cleanse and cure the wound, until it is healed.
The abscess is constricted, and has no appearance in the rupture, and the cautery is milder in this place, and closer to healing.
of the softening of the skin of the testicles
Many times the skin of the testicles is softened in some men, because the flesh within is softened, and it is easy to see;
and it is necessary, when one wants to cure it, that one make the sick person lie on their back, and cut the softened skin over the natural skin;
then bring the two edges together with a stitch, and if you wish, first stitch the excess softened skin with three or four firm stitches;
then cut between the stitches, and cure it like other wounds, until it is healed, and the thread falls out.
of the chastening
Know that chastening is forbidden in our law, and for that reason I would not speak of it in this book;
and is only necessary for two reasons:
one is that the pupil should be able to answer when asked, and know the cure;
and the other, because we often need to chastise some animals to help us, such as goats and sheep and cats and other animals.
I say therefore that chastening is done in two ways: or by pulling, or by slitting.
In that which we do by pulling, we make the beast sit in hot water, until the testicles are softened and hanging. then take them in your hand, until they are reset and you no longer feel them.
Of the castration of the tail: you must restrain the beast, and press the skin of the testicles with your left hand, then tie the suspender, and cut above each testicle in one stroke, when you have well scorched them;
and leave some small spot of the surface and the subtle surface that is over the vessels;
and this method of castration is gentler than that done by pulling, because with pulling, perhaps some of the testicles remain, causing the animal to desire lust;
then cure the wound until it is healed.
of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism is according to two ways in men: one is that between the two testicles appears also the form of a woman's nature, or there is hair, and sometimes urine flows from it.
And the other way is in women, and they have a penis-like thing on the pubic area and two testicles.
And the treatment for the man and the woman is that you cut away all the added flesh, and treat it like other wounds;
in the second way, of men whose urine leaks through the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
Tentigene is an added flesh on the natural part, as long as it is too unsightly to behold; and some women have it as large as a hand, and that is the treatment.
You must cut the excess tentigene with your hand or with shears, and cut it lightly;
and do not go too deep, lest a flow of blood come, then treat it with other remedies until it is healed;
and another flesh that arises at the mouth of the wound, and fills it, and perhaps bursts forth, and resembles a boil, and therefore the ancients called it "boil-disease". If necessary, cut it, as we said of the tentigene, and treat it until it is healed.
Errant is when the nature of the woman is not perceived, or the opening is small; and is born from nature or by accident through sickness that comes to it;
and is born from nature or by accident through sickness that comes to it; or it is by added flesh, or from a subtle or thick skin, and is made deep within the wound, or on the sides, or below, or wherever it may be;
and hinders conceiving, childbirth, and perhaps the ability to bear flowers;
and the knowledge of this is by looking at the swelling.
If the numbness is clearly apparent, look with your fingers or a stick.
If it is from a thin layer and is near the two lips, then hurry and do this:
place your two index fingers together, and the woman be on her back, her legs spread;
then stretch the two lips widely, so that the thin layer is gone, and the numbness is gone;
then take wool, and soak it in oil, and place it on the spot, and let the woman lie on her side each day, so it cannot heal.
And if the layer is hard and thick, you must cut it with a scalpel, like a myrtle leaf.
If the numbness is from newly-formed flesh, then suspend it from a hook and cut it.
and have blood-stopping medicines, such as dragon's blood, frankincense, and a quantity of egg white;
then apply a wide lead band, so that the wound cannot heal;
and keep it for a long time, and apply a tent of dry linen;
then be treated with other remedies until he is healed.
And when in the flesh there comes dead flesh, it must be cut away in this manner, unless it is festering boils. For a festering boil that is in the flesh, one should not use fire.
of hemorrhoids Hemorrhoids are openings of veins from which blood flows habitually, and when the hemorrhoids are old, they become ulcerated.
and we have already said in the division the likenesses of them, and the signs, and I shall now say those which receive a cure.
I say that hemorrhoids and ulcers, when they are deep within the flesh and are not apparent to the touch, should not be treated with fire.
Those which are at the opening of the flesh, that one can feel, are those which can be cured.
It is therefore necessary that you place the woman in a cold room, then grasp the ulcer with tongs, and cut it at its roots, then powder on medicines that restrain blood, such as oak galls and dragon's blood and frankincense, and similar things;
then place her feet against the wall for an hour, then put her in cold water;
and if a discharge of blood comes, then have her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate bark and galls and similar things, and then take barley flour, and mix it with honey and oil, and make a poultice for her back.
And if it stops, that is good. If not, apply leeches to the back and breasts without causing injury;
Then take wool, and soak it in plantain juice or elderberry juice with old wine, and apply it to the area.
And when the abscess subsides, treat the area with ointment until it is healed;
And the one called "albathir," which is red, and is similar to a rough head, should be cut as I have said of the boil; and then treat it until it is healed.
Many kinds of abscess come in the marsh, such as ulcers and stony abscesses and herpes and boils and fistulas and hemorrhoids and hot abscesses, and many other illnesses that I have spoken of in the division.
It is therefore necessary for me to describe in this treatise the hot abscess which arises in the marsh, which is not among the abscesses that collect pus;
and if you wish to know the treatment for it, observe if the abscess is sharp at its beginning, full of heat and fever, and if it turns red, if you can see it. Then do not hasten to pierce it, but let it mature until the pain is calmed;
and then make the sick person sit on a seat, and have two small seats where he leans, and rest on his back and bring his feet to the parts of the leg opposite;
and let his thighs be spread out, and let him put his arms under his knees, and bind them well with a good bandage;
then suck the wound toward the right side, and administer the instrument with which one opens the mouth of the sore, of which the form follows after;
and it is necessary that when you wish to administer this instrument, that you first insert the rod to know the depth of the sore, so that what enters inside the instrument does not go deeper than it should, and does not injure the patient; and if the instrument is larger, then it is necessary to cover the depth of the sore with cloths, so that the instrument does not harm it;
and it is necessary that he place the horn of the instrument above, and that he hold the instrument.
And when the abscess is open, and one cuts it with a soft hand, then it must be cut at the top, at the level of the spatula.
And when the boil is emptied, it is necessary to put in the wound soaked cloths in rose oil, or in dried green oil.
And put the cloth deep into the wound, and place above the wound and above the wound a clean, soaked linen cloth in water or boiled mallows.
Then treat it after two days of suitable ointment, until it is healed.
And sometimes the wound is cleansed with a clyster of water and honey, and then with water or boiled roots of lilies and aristolochia. Then return to the ointment.
And if the wound is replanted in the wound, you must avoid iron cautery, but treat it as we have said in the division.
of childbirth It is necessary for the midwife to first understand the natural process of childbirth, and the signs are when you see the woman straining downwards and desiring to smell the air.
Then the child hastens to emerge. Then know that this childbirth is according to the natural process, and the issue is beneath its head, and the afterbirth with it.
And when you see these signs, it is necessary to gently press her abdomen, so that the child emerges quickly.
For when it descends onto its head, the afterbirth issues with it, and the mother is cleansed of her superfluities by good cleansing.
And that which comes otherwise does not come naturally.
For it comes sometimes on its feet, and comes out from the body or shoulder, and the hands, or it comes on its stomach, or often, and it is turned by chance on its neck, and by other bad positions.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and subtle in these things, and to guard against error and deception, and I will show you all the positions how one should help her.
If the child comes onto its head through a natural passage, and the woman labors greatly, and her strength is weak, then have her sit on a stool, or have women hold her.
And apply oil or fenugreek that is cooked, and then have the midwife place the small spatula, of which this is the form, between her fingers. And sever the afterbirth, and cut with her fingernail until the moisture that is within flows out.
And grasp the woman's abdomen until the child descends, and if it does not descend, then it is necessary to enema the woman with fenugreek mucilage with sesame oil.
Then have her take and sneeze with condisi, and hold her mouth and nose for an hour. Then the child will now be delivered.
And if the two hands are pulled out forcibly, then you should gently reposition them little by little. And if they cannot enter, then place the woman on a seat and lift her feet upwards. Then lower the seat to the ground, and hold the woman so she does not fall when it is lowered.
And if the hands cannot enter, and the child dies, then cut the hands with the knife previously mentioned, and remove the child, and reposition it equally.
from the child's emergence from between its feet When the child emerges from between its feet, it must be pushed upwards; and then turn it slowly, bit by bit, until it is even;
then take it by the feet and extend it slowly.
If it leaps up to the thighs, then instruct it to grip, and make it sneeze with a condition; if it jumps free, if God wills.
And if it does not jump free as we have said, then turn it slowly, bit by bit, until it is according to the natural shape. For then it is easily done.
And if it does not come free as we have said, then take a linen cloth, and oil of cedar, and melted gum, and grind everything in a mortar; and put on the affected part of the woman this ointment, then make her sit in warm water up to under the ribs;
and when she is softened underneath, make her a poultice of myrrh, and place it underneath, and leave it for an hour; then make her sit on a seat, then make her sneeze and pinch her mouth and nose, and gently press her belly, because the child will now leap out.
of the child's issue onto her knees When the child comes in this form, the midwife should place her hands gently, little by little; then be supported on her neck, and let her feet hang down, and be lying on the bed; and gently fold her hands, and then grasp her hands on her belly, and remove the cushions underneath, until she is positioned downwards; and if the child does not jump, then take her feet and move them forcefully, then move her belly upwards, then put your hands there; and draw the child gently. and tell the woman to push until the child comes out.
from the child's birth, one hand hanging down. it is necessary to devise a way to bring the hand back. if it cannot be brought back, have the woman stand up and walk.
if she cannot walk, have her lie down on the bed, and straighten her legs firmly.
then administer the medicine that I have described;
and if she does not give birth, have her sit on the seat, then try to bring the hand back; and draw the child according to its natural form, and make her sneeze, and instruct her to strain until the child comes out forcefully.
of the child's exit from her neck, and have her hands outstretched, and her face turned towards her mother's back It is necessary for the attendant to hold her hand, then turn it little by little, and draw it gently;
and when it is equal, put on the natural mucus of the aloe and oil, as we have said, then instruct her to move little by little;
and when you have done this, make her sit on the seat, and instruct her to strain; and make her sneeze. in this same manner for the entire afterbirth
in this same manner for the entire afterbirth When it comes forth in this manner for the entire afterbirth, cut the afterbirth with your fingernail, until the moisture is emptied;
and if the infant hangs on its face and neck, then cut it from the body, so that it is not retained, and the infant may die;
then place the child inside, until you have placed it as it should be, and instruct the woman to take it occasionally:
of the issue of twins Know that twins are born many times, and sometimes three or four are born; and that is not a strange thing, and it rarely happens. Two are a strange thing, and do not live long, if at all.
Two are a strange thing, and do not live long, if at all. I know that they are multiplied, and are separated by the surface that divides them, which is attached to the womb;
and sometimes they come out as naturally as one single child, as we have said.
And if they come out badly, treat them as we have said, and let the hand be delicate, and do quickly and easily what it does; and do so as it merits to be healed. of several children
Sometimes they are formed in the womb in one, two, three, four, five, six, or seven, or many up to fifteen, and are all formed in the shape of a child by the measurement of the wise glorious one, and the hand should know all this, for perhaps similar things happen; so do according to what is necessary.
of the dead child
When you treat a woman whose child is dead within her belly, as I said in the division, and it does not come out, and you are constrained to work with your hands; if it is necessary that you know if the woman is of sound virtue and has no accident or fear of death;
if it is necessary that the woman be laid on her back, with her head inclined downwards, and her legs raised;
and the minister should hold her in two places, or she should be bound to the bed so that she is not pulled down during the child's expulsion;
then rub the mouth of the child with moist oils, with the mucilage of mallow and fenugreek and flaxseed, then anoint the child's hands with these oils and these mucilages;
then gently insert them into the child's mouth, then seek a place where she can place the instruments that are suitable for this, and take care that the child is positioned so that it descends on its head;
if she places the instruments in its eyes or neck or mouth or palate or under the chin or in the throat or near the sides, and if the descent is on its feet, then she should place them in the legs or the ribs.
and it is necessary that she hold the instrument in her right hand, and place the curve between the fingers of her left hand, and gently insert it with her whole hand, and place the instrument in any of these places that we have mentioned, until it reaches the empty space.
then insert another instrument, or a third if you need it, so that the extractions are equal;
and then stretch it equally by moving it from one side to the other, to extract it, and let the instruments be toothed to hold the substance, as is this form:
And if a part remains, then grease some of his fingers with oil, and put them in that part, and pull the other part;
and if any part remains, then put this instrument in a higher place, and do so until it is completely removed.
And if one hand comes in front of the other, and it cannot be brought back due to the constriction, then you must wrap it in a cloth until it is completely out; then cut at the joint of the palm or with a knife, and thus you must do to the other hand, and to the two feet.
And if the child's head is large and the passage is narrow, or there is a sharp object stuck to the head, then you must put the pointed instrument between your fingers, and cut open the head and remove the object; or you use the instrument called "almidach," by which the form comes with the instruments in the chapter that follows this one;
and likewise do this if the child has a large head naturally;
and then pull the bones with pliers, and if the head is stuck and compressed by force, it should be cut open, so that the moisture that is in the pus escapes;
and if it cannot escape, then cut it in pieces as much as you can;
and if it is swollen in the belly or under the ribs, then you must pierce it until the moisture runs.
And if the child is on its feet, the traction is light, and the straightening to the mouth of the wound is light.
And if it is tight in the belly or breast, then you must pull it out with a cloth wrapped around your hand; and cut the belly or breast until the moisture that is in it runs;
and if the other limbs are removed, and the head remains, then the surgeon puts his hand deep into the wound, and pulls it until the mouth of the wound; then he puts a hook or two in it, and pulls forcefully;
and if the mouth of the wound is narrowed due to a hot abscess that has formed there, then one should not work on it, but instead administer moist and greasy things; and apply plasters, and soak with soft and moistening water.
And if the child is on its side, and you can place it upright, then administer what we have said about the living child;
and if one does not have the power, then pull it forcefully in pieces, and leave nothing of the afterbirth.
And when you have done this, then administer what we have said about hot abscesses that come in the wound;
and if a discharge of blood comes, then it should be placed in constricting water, and administer other treatments.
And I saw a woman in whose womb a child had been dead, then another one was sewn on top of that, and the other one died. After a long time, an abscess came on the belly, and swelled until it opened, and began to greatly fester.
I was called to treat it, and pondered long, and could not close the wound.
I applied a strong-pulling plaster, and from it came one bone, and after a few days another. I marvelled greatly, because the belly has no bones.
I thought it was the bones of a dead child.
I examined the wound, and pulled out many bones, until the woman was in better condition; and the woman lived a long time like this, and sometimes a little pus would come from the place;
and I have only recorded this chapter because, when the master finds a strange thing, that he might know how to provide help.
Here after comes the form of the press, with which the books were made;
and with two turns to the two ends of the two hinges. However, the horns should be finer than the restrictor, and should be made of ebony or boxwood;
and let the mouth of the tube be one finger in width, and the margin of the trees one finger, and in length one palm and a half; and in the middle of the two hinges be two joints of this same tube, which should be fastened on one and the other, half a palm in length, or a little more;
and these two joints are inserted into the mouth of the marrow in order to open when one turns the two horns.
Another form, more delicate and lighter in its appearance, should be made of ebony or boxwood, similar to pliers; and have at its two ends two joints, as you see, one palm long, and two fingers wide;
and when you want to open the marrow with the whole instrument, make the woman sit on a bed, legs dangling and knees open, then insert the two joined joints into the marrow, and hold the head of the instrument beneath between her thighs; then operate your hand on the whole instrument, just as you did with the pliers, according to the amount you want to open the mouth of the marrow, until the bone does what it wants.
These instruments are all superior, and their forms are multiplied; and when the master has prepared them, the work is faster and more highly regarded by men for their quantity.
Do not neglect the instrument until you have prepared it, for their necessity is not excusable.
When the afterbirth is retained during childbirth, you must instruct the woman to hold her breath, then make her sneeze with condiments, and hold her hands over her mouth and nose. and if she jumps due to this, it is good.
If not, she takes a pot and makes a hole in the cover, and puts herbs that can open the womb, such as calamint, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia, and centaury; all these herbs, or some of them, should be boiled in water over the fire;
then put one end of the cane into the hole of the pot, and the other end into the mouth of the womb, and let it remain until the vapors come into the womb;
then make her sneeze, as we have said. Then the afterbirth will come out quickly.
And if it remains after this treatment, and does not come out easily, instruct the woman to moisten her left hand in oil of sesame or in marshmallow paste, then place it in the area, and search for the afterbirth; and when she has found it, she should take it and gently and carefully pull it out, so that the womb does not rupture during the extraction;
but it should be moved gently to the right and left, and then pulled; then it will come out and detach itself.
And if the opening of the womb is too narrow, we have described the treatment with sneezing and the fumigation of herbs;
and if it is not from any of what we have said, be careful not to force it during the pulling;
but it is necessary that whatever is at the opening of the womb, you tie it to the woman's thigh, then administer a four-drug ointment clyster; if it will fester and return, and will come to an end;
However, when it festers, a foul odor comes to the stomach and head, and harms the sick woman. Therefore, appropriate fumigations are needed for this:
None of the ancients have tested fumigation with cress and dried figs.
The shape of the instrument with which one fumigates the woman concerning the retention of the flowers and the afterbirth is this:
And it is like a chain in appearance, and one places the slender end in the nature, and the wide ends over the fire;
and let the fumigations be over the coals, and the sore until it is gone, and begin another one.
Many children are born who do not have the fundament pierced, but rather have it stopped by a subtle membrane: If so, then the midwife must pierce that membrane with her finger, and not pierce it with a sharp instrument, and keep the incision small so it is not too deep.
then place moistened wool in wine and oil, then apply a healing ointment until it is healed.
And if you doubt that it will not close up again, place a lead chain in the opening and leave it in place for several days, and it should be removed when the child is ready to go to the rooms.
And sometimes these blockages result from the closure of a wound or an abscess; if it is necessary to cut through that blockage. then it should be treated as we have said, with the lead chain.
Fistulas that come from under the fundament are knotted, and swellings that come from beside the fundament, or in the space between the two parts, have one or more fistulas.
And when that swelling is old, it opens, and sometimes yields a whitish or subtle pus, and sometimes these fistulas are penetrating.
And they are recognized by the fact that either discharge or flatulence comes out when the sick person discharges, and perhaps a worm jumps out.
And some fistulas penetrate as far as the bladder, and even to the midpoint of the penis. And they reach as far as the hip joint, and the root of the thigh.
And thus one recognizes a penetrating fistula of the fundament, and not a non-penetrating one. And it is that you place your index finger in the fundament, and insert a thin needle of bronze or iron into the fistula when there is no twisting.
And if there is twisting, insert a thin lead tent, or a horsehair, until you feel the tent or hair against your finger;
and if you do not feel it, and it does not come from the opening in the way of expelling anything, wind, or pus, as we have said: know that it does not penetrate. so hurry to cure it.
And when the fistula pierces to the bladder or to the conduit of urine, the urine leaks out, and cannot be sealed by medicine.
If it is pierced to the joint of the thigh, the tent goes down to the place; if there is no twisting and the source of the pain is around it, then it often produces a boil, and no medicine or ointment is of value to mend it;
and in these penetrating fistulas, there is no cure other than labor, and the folly of the many pretenders who meddle with them.
In the one that is not piercing and is not ancient, there is hope for health through iron, as I have experienced, and it is that the patient lies on his back between your hands;
and he raises his legs up to his thighs, and has his thighs inclined to his belly; then put a tent of copper, or of lead if there is twisting, until you know where the tent arrives.
If the patient feels it around the fundament, you must place your index finger there, then you will feel that the tent has pierced it.
and if you feel the surface or flesh between your finger, then know that it is piercing; if you don't work on it, you cannot cure it.
However, they say that some can be cured, but this happens rarely.
And the help that is done, is to heat the subtle cautery according to the width of the fistula, as it is said before; and place it, hot, into the fistula, until it comes close to the base; and do this two or three times, until you know that these false flesh are burned, which are like a bird's feather;
and then treat with tents moistened in butter, until that flesh comes off, then treat with an ointment that generates flesh and heals.
If it is thus healed, it is good.
If this, in no other way can be healed;
and if the tent is between, and does not pierce to the finger that is at the foundation, and between your finger and the tent is a thick covering of flesh or skin, and you see the fistula to what followed the covering of the heart; if you cut the beginning of the fistula, and push the tent forward, and then cauterize afterwards, until it reaches the head of the tent; and the tent will be released, and fall.
then cleanse those misshapen tissues that resemble a bird's feather, and leave nothing behind.
And if the blood overcomes you, and flows between you and the work, cauterize it with fire or sharp medicine.
For fire cauteries assemble two good things: that is to say, the burning of these added tissues, and the stopping of blood and the drying of moisture;
then treat with tents soaked in butter or in ground spices, until the place expels pus, and the burned tissue falls off in the pus;
then treat the wound with ointments, strong and effective for hard tissue, and these are dry medicines.
For when it is restored, it is healed and does not return.
And if a fistula reaches deep into the foundation, and is distant from the body, then put your finger into the foundation and investigate it.
If you feel the tent, and between it and the cloth or the surface or tissue, where it is near to piercing, there is nothing but a path of trust and hope, by the administration of one of the three methods:
or you cauterize it as we have said, or you cut it to the bottom, or if you can, put tents in it and treat it as before;
and do not go too deep, lest you cut the tissue that holds the foundation, and the effusion come forth without your will; then treat it, as we have said;
then treat it, as we have said; perhaps it will be healed, or you remove that covering and clean it since it has been cut beside the foundation, either with a tent or another appropriate instrument; then cleanse the diseased flesh that is in the wound, as much as you can; then study to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula outside the foundation;
then study to restore the wound, and to keep the fistula outside the foundation; it will be a lighter thing for the patient.
And sometimes fistulas are like this: and it is when you place the tent in the fistula, and it is on the side of the foundation next to the skin above, take a tent pierced at the head according to this shape: And put one thread twisted into two, and place the tent with all the thread in the fistula until it is at the head.
If it is piercing into the margin of the foundation within, then pull out the thread from that hole, as if you were placing your finger in the foundation;
and pull the head of the thread, and bring the two ends together, and tie one to the other, and leave it one or two days;
and restrain it sometimes, so that the thread cuts the flesh that is between the two, and it falls away;
then treat the wound until it is closed and healed.
If the fistula does not pierce, then make it pierce in all the ways that you can, if it is not too deep within. For it is not necessary to make the incision so deep by the lacing, and then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The form of the pointed spatula with which one opens the fistula is very sharp on one side and cutting. and on the other side not, so that one does not cut what one should not cut, as you see here:
Hemorrhoids are according to two types: or they are inside the fundament, like a resin grain, and there are small and large ones, and blood often flows from them, and there is one or several, and they are beneath the fundament and at the top of the fundament;
but those that are beneath have little moisture, and often a little yellowish water or a little blood, and have the color of the body;
and the treatment for those who have them inside the fundament is that you instruct the patient to strain himself to go to the chambers, so that the fundament is outside, and the filaments appear; if you hurry, and you hold it with pincers, or you hold it with your nail, then cut it at its roots;
and if the hooks cannot hold them because of their moisture, then take them with a linen cloth, or cotton, or a piece of chamois leather; and pull them out with your fingers, then cut them, and powder on top any hot powders that are in place of cautery; or you cauterize them as it is said in the chapter on cautery, then cure them with other cures until they are healthy;
and if the foundation cannot come out, then administer to the patient a biting and harsh clyster to wash that which is in the foundation, so that it may come out openly; If the patient complains, and if the threads are strong from the foundation, then the cure is easy;
If the patient complains, and if the threads are strong from the foundation, then the cure is easy; and that you take them with your nail or with pliers, and cut them, then cure them as we have said, until they are healed, and that they fear the incision by iron. Then it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner:
Then it is necessary that you administer the suture according to this manner: Take a twisted thread, and put it in a needle, and then draw the thread above and make the needle pierce on the other side, and turn the two ends of the thread beneath the needle, and let it be wide.
and tighten the thread firmly, then tie the thread, and pull out the needle, and do thus with all the others, and leave one for the excess of blood;
then put over the foundation a dampened cloth in rose oil or in cerote, and place it on the foundation, and order the patient to rest;
and then leave it until they fall, and when they are fallen, treat them with ointment and other remedies, until they are healed.
of the drying of the wound or foundation Many times there is a drying up of the humours in the intestines, and due to the constriction of nature, and when the illness is old and medicine is of no use. If it is necessary that you scrape with a spatula or your fingernail the scab over it, which does not let it moisten; then treat it until it is healed as is fitting;
and if it cannot heal, then resume the scraping more forcefully than before, until it bleeds a great deal and is scabbed over; then treat it until it is healed.
there trembles A formice is a small, deceptive appearance on the body, and goes very deep;
and sometimes it shows itself as cold, and it is felt as if trembling, and spreads throughout the body, and more in the hands than elsewhere.
And the cure is that you take a stick of goose feather, or a strong vulture feather, and place that stick on the tremor, so that the circle surrounds the tremor entirely; then turn your hand over the entire stick until you cut all around the tremor, and drive it deep, and eradicate the tremor from its roots.
And if you wish, make one of brass or iron according to this shape, and be thin underneath and pointed on top: not piercing, in order to hold it on the finger, and press it.
And if you wish, cauterize the tremor, as it is described before in the chapter on cautery.
Sometimes one makes a clyster of silver or bronze, or of molten or hammered brass;
and sometimes one makes them small or large, according to those to whom they are administered. Those then that are administered in the treatment of children and those who are weak and sorrowful, are small.
Those then that are administered in the treatment of children and those who are weak and sorrowful, are small. The form of the small and large clyster is thus wider above, where the belly is tied in this manner:
and there be a separation where the belly is tied, as you see, and the clyster be pierced within;
and have two holes on one side, and one on the other;
and the belly, where one puts the medicines, be of an animal's bladder or parchment, and be pierced all around with small holes, and have one thread of space between each hole, then put into these holes a strong thread of coarse thread twisted in an X or spiral around, and assemble the belly as is a goat; and when the medicine is within, tie it to the instrument in front with a strong thread, then administer the clyster;
and this is the form of the circle:
And let the medicine be neither too hot nor too cold, and anoint the head of the clyster with oil or egg white, or something similar, then introduce it gently; then the minister presses it with both hands together until it is all emptied, then remove the clyster, and the patient raise their legs to the wall, and if the medicine wants to come out, keep it as long as he can; and if he sleeps a whole night soundly, it is of greater help.
And if you clyster him in a disease of looseness of the belly, and the medicine hastens to issue, repeat it until he is cured.
And if the hemorrhoids are in the fundament, or abscess, let the clyster be as subtle as for a child;
and this is the form of the subtle clyster upon which the skin is to be tightened:
We have already said in the division the cure of wounds;
or we will tell you the cures of hands and medicine, according to the accomplishment.
I say that wounds are diverse according to what they are made, and according to the places where the wounds are made, and of what they are made.
The things by which wounds are made are by throwing stones, and the cutting of swords and knives, or of lances or wood or arrows, or similar things;
or that are made according to the places of the body, like a wound that falls on the neck, or on the head, or the chest, or the belly, or the liver, and similar members;
and I will tell you the cure for each wound, and will begin with wounds of the head, simple, for the remembrance will come in its chapter.
I say that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, take care if it is from throwing a stone or similar things, and the skin is nonetheless broken and the wound is large, and you fear the rise of a hot abscess: if you make it bleed immediately from the cephalic vein, especially if little blood comes from the wound, and let the bleeding be on the opposite side of the wounded part;
and avoid the patient's repletion of wine and heavy foods.
And if he does not want to bleed, let his food be reduced, and let him drink no wine, nor eat any meat;
and place on the wound, if a hot abscess comes there, cotton moistened in rose oil alone, or in astringent wine;
and if there is no hot abscess, then place on the fresh wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it has not been affected by the air, a powder, which I will tell you a little later;
and if the burn has affected it, then place some ointments on it until it is healed.
And if the wound is large, like that of a sword cut and similar, and the edges cannot be brought together by sutures, bring them together by stitches, as I will say for wounds of the belly and of the ribs.
If the wound is open to the bone, and hangs, and holds only by a little, cut it. then treat the wound with medicine, and restore hard flesh in place of skin, and instruct the patient to eat hearty foods, such as roasted meat and cooked wheat, and similar things.
And if you find rot in the skin, and it does not reach the bone, cut all the rot away and throw it out, then treat it.
and if there is an artery or vein in the wound from which blood flows, and it cannot be stopped by medicines, tie off the artery, and if you find it loosened, tie it with a thread. and if this does not help, cauterize it.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the cure is light. and that you put this powder in, so that the wound will be healed before the burning has subsided.
And the manner of the powder is: take frankincense one part; dragon's blood two parts; living coals three parts, and powder it finely, and fill the wound, and bind it firmly, so that it heals well and joins with all its blood;
and then bandage it well, and leave it without unbinding, if it doesn't swell; for one does not remove the medicine until it is healed.
And sometimes one uses only coals, when one does not have incense or dragon's blood, but only if the burning has not changed the wound.
And if the burning has changed the wound, especially if it is deep, one does not put this powder in it.
but puts on some digested ointments, or poultices of barley flour made with water and honey, until it gives off pus; then treats it with other remedies until it is healed.
And if a bone fracture comes with the wound, and it is small, then extract it with fine pincers;
and I will tell you later about the fractures of the head.
of the wound of the neck
If a wound comes to the neck and it is simple, it has no difference from one of the head; but if the nerve of the neck or the artery is cut.
If it is the nerve, there is no other remedy than to let the wound heal, and not to put anything constricting on it, for it harms the nerves and causes them to retract; and do not put anything cold on the wound, for the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuation is also with the brain, which is the highest part of the body;
but let the medicine be warm, like warmed water in sweet water, and mixed with rose oil, and boiled water also in sweet water, and other mineral stones according to this manner, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is large, stitch it and bind it with bandages, then treat it until it is healed.
And if the wounds are deep and it is swollen and full of pus, then pierce it in the lowest part;
and if the artery is cut, and bleeding comes, then tie it off, and sew it up, and cauterize it if necessary;
and if the spine in the throat is cut, or the heart, and the passage is guarded, through which the food goes, then sew the heart onto the throat's lining, and do not touch the throat, but return it to its natural form; and then restrain the swelling, and leave it for a few days, then treat it with drying ointments until it is healed;
and if the wound has made an impression on the bone, then seek it out; and if there are pieces of bone, remove all that you can, and those that you cannot get, leave until the wound decays, and the exit is separated and lightened;
and if the wound is fresh, then powder it with the powder that I have mentioned. And if there is bone in the wound and it has a fistula, treat it as I have said in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or a knife, and the wound is deep, look to see if wind escapes from the wound as the patient breathes: then know that the wound is fatal;
and if it is not deep, and it is fresh with all its blood, do not put powder on it at the first hour, nor tie it to stop the blood so that it does not linger deep and return to the heart and kill the patient; but put attracting ointment on it, and bind it twice a day;
and if you do not have ointment, put old cotton in the wound to suck out the moisture, and make the patient sleep on the wound for three or four, or more days; so there will be no spasm, nor tremor, nor squeezing of the sinews; and when you see the good conditions, know that the wound is healed. Then cure it with dressings and other remedies, until it is healthy;
and if it cannot heal, and opens again, know that there is a fistula;
if the cure is done as it should be. And if the wound is from a sword or knife incision, and it is simple, or on the chest or back, cure it as the wound on the front; if it is large, by stitching;
and if it is small, with powder, and if it has entered the bone, and broken pieces, then trim the wound, and pull out the splinters if they are separated; and if they are not separated, let the wound fester, so the extraction will be easier;
and for other wounds on other limbs, the judgment is as we have said.
of the rupture of the belly
The ruptures of the belly are large, medium, and small;
from the large wound sometimes the intestines, or the nerves of the intestines, jump out, which causes their intrusion;
and the treatment is more difficult, and sometimes a small wound is worse than a large one, because one puts the intestines back in with more difficulty if one does not put them back in immediately;
because the intestines swell as soon as they feel cold, so they are more difficult to return, and therefore a medium-sized wound is worse, because one returns the intestines to their place more difficult than in other wounds.
And know that the rupture of the belly is according to four manners:
The two common treatments occur in the treatment of the belly, and the treatment of other wounds of the body, and two other specific treatments are common to other wounds;
and nonetheless they are more specific to the treatment of the belly, and I will describe each one and explain it.
I say that when the wound is small, and some part of the intestine is protruding, and it is difficult to return it, this is done by one of the two methods: or because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen from the cold.
And when it is cold, warm it in this way: wet a sponge or similar cloth in just lukewarm water, or boil it in water with cumin, cypress, and spikenard, and warm the intestine until the swelling is removed;
and sometimes use astringent wines, and are more effective than water alone for reducing swelling.
And when you see the swelling subside, moisten the intestine with water or boiled mallows and other herbs, for this alleviates the inflammation easily.
and if it cannot enter, then slightly open the wound with the instrument used for cutting hemorrhoids;
and the first treatment is better than cutting, which no one should do without great necessity;
and this is the instrument for splitting it:
so cut inward along the curve and not outward, and see here the form: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine bursts out, then return it back according to the natural form to its proper place, if you are able, for this is worth much.
When the wound is large, and it is in the part beneath the belly, then you must make the sick person lie on their back, and put their legs higher than their head; and if it is in the part beneath the belly, then put the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and likewise if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts, then concentrate on making the injured part higher than the other;
and thus it is necessary to administer what I say in wounds, large and small.
In small wounds, apply what is prepared for you, then have between your hands a compassionate assistant who holds the entire rupture in his hand, and brings the edges together;
and this is the common manner of sutures, and you should take a needle or several, according to the size of the wound, then leave a finger's breadth from the beginning of the wound, and place a needle or several with strong thread; and pierce the two edges of the skin with the two edges of the underlying skin, until you have pierced through that part, and bring the two edges of the underlying skin together;
then draw a double thread around the needle from both sides, then bring the two edges of the wound together, and then leave a finger's breadth and place another needle;
then tie the thread as you did with the first needle, and do not cease to do so according to the need for needles until the entire wound is drawn together;
and let the needles be of medium size, between fine and coarse, for fine needles cut all the flesh, and those that are too coarse cannot enter well: therefore they must be medium;
and one should not push the needles too far into the flesh and skin, lest they cut and disturb the wound before the closure;
and then cut the points of the needles, so that they do not injure the patient when they sleep, and put bandages or strips at the points of the needles to keep them in place, and leave them until the wound is closed;
and this method of sewing with needles is more suitable for small wounds, for one or two needles will suffice.
The second method is common, and it is that you bring together the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the flesh together with one needle and a strong medium thread.
And when you have pierced all four edges together, then bring the needle back to the point where you began, in the manner one sews cloth.
And put space between each stitch the size of a little finger.
This method of sewing is known to men, and I sewed a wound a man had in his belly, which had been cut by a knife, and the wound was more than a palm in size, and intestines were protruding about two palms in size, and the wound was in the middle of the belly.
I brought back the intestine after it had been out for twenty-four hours, and the wound was closed after fifteen days, and I treated it, and it was healed.
And the doctors had judged that he would die, and this was a miracle.
And I did not treat it with any ointment, for I was in a place where one could not find any, nor any other medicine. And I placed old cotton on the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until it was healed.
Or I will tell you the two proper ways of stitching:
Take the needle and thread it from the outside to the inside;
When it has pierced the heart of the right into the right, then leave the head of the thread or stitch where you have threaded the needle, and make it pierce from the inside to the outside;
And the understanding of this stitching is that you stitch as the leather-workers do leather, and that you leave one side of the thread, and pick it up again on the other, until the stitch is complete.
The second way of stitching, which Galen calls proper, is as some do, who join the two parts naturally, and bring one end of the thread to the other end, in this way:
Insert a needle into the nearby end of the wound, and pierce only that spot, and leave the two ends of the thread; Then turn the needle, and make it pierce from the outside to the inside, at the two ends of the thread;
Then pierce each from the outside to the inside, into two other ends of the wound on the other side;
and that is the most subtle way of stitching and the most common.
Galen said this, and some testify, that one should stitch the belly with two needles, with a thread in each.
and one should push one needle from one side, and the other from the other, in the manner of those who sew leather straps;
and know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the stitching is more difficult than in other parts of the belly.
The judgment of the wound is like the judgment of other wounds:
and it is that when you find the wound fresh, with all its blood, before the heat has changed it, you replace the intestine and stitch it.
then put on a powder of healing char, and if the heat has changed it, put on any ointment that is available until the wound heals. and cut the threads, and let the seams and the stitches be well sealed. then treat the wound like the others, until it is healed.
and if you lack medicines, then as soon as it begins to heal, put on old cotton, and move it twice a day until it is healed.
For you do not need any other medicine in many cases when the wounds are simple;
And if you fear the wound might spread to the main limbs, then you should soak light wool in tempered oil, or rose oil, and place it around the joints and under the armpits;
And if he feels pain or decay in the boils, and this often happens, then irrigate them with warm black wine, especially if the decay reaches the intestines;
and pierce it, and know that when it is the large intestine, it is easier to heal than the small one.
The intestine called "jeun" cannot heal when wounded, and this is because of the multitude of veins that are in it, and because of the subtlety of the whole body, and the closeness of its nature to the nerves.
And if the ulcer bursts from the wound, reset it back just like the intestine, while it is fresh;
and if it is old and become dark or black, you must bind the blackened area so that no blood flows, for there are veins and arteries there;
then cut what is between the binding, and hang the two ends down from the part below the wound, all the way to the end, to make the extraction easier when the ulcer falls, and the wound heals.
of the rupture of the pouch
When the intestine is round, and the wound is small, it can be restored in some people, because I saw a man who was wounded in the belly by a lance;
and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and it festered and became a fistula, and from it came the expulsion and the flatulence;
I applied treatment according to what I could, and I did not cease to refine it until it was healed, and the place was closed.
And when I saw it close, I feared that the patient might have pain in his belly; and he had no pain, but remained in better condition, and eating and drinking;
And some experimenters said that when there is a small wound in the intestine, it should be bound in such a way: take a large piece of linen, then bring together the edges of the wound, and when the linen has opened its mouth, place it over the two edges so that it tightly closes its mouth over them;
and then cut off the linen's head, and this is held so that it cannot untie, then place another piece of linen afterwards in the same way as before, until the wound is completely closed; and stitch the wound.
This head will burn in the intestine, and no harm comes to the patient, and one can bind the intestine with a thin thread that is cut from the intestine of an animal, in such a way:
take the head of this intestinal thread that is very thin, and then tie to the head of this thread a thin linen thread twisted, then put the thread into the needle, and stitch the intestine, and draw it back into the rupture;
and this manner of stitching with linen threads is no stronger than according to the way of trust and hope;
and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the large intestines, there is no device or skill, but only subtlety.
of fistula or that it be Know that every wound or abscess, when it becomes chronic, is universally called a "fistula," especially when it is festered and discharges pus.
And a fistula, according to the truth, is a hard, white, knotty swelling where there is no pain, and is as festered as a bird's feather;
and sometimes it discharges clear pus, and other times thick pus; sometimes small, and other times large;
and I have already spoken of this in the division of wounds, that every wound which is not healed, and in which there is no flesh, is only due to one of the eight causes: that is to say, by the smallness of the blood or the body; or because of its malice; or because there is hard flesh inside, and on the edges, that does not allow flesh to grow; or there is too much pus; or the area is rotten, and the material is of poor quality; or the medicine is not good in the treatment; or because the corruption is a type of pestilence; or because the property in the region is slow in digestion, and delays health, and swells by nature; or there are veins or bones:
and I have already shown all these causes, and the signs, and the cures of medicines in the division.
Now it is necessary that I make you know the cure of a fistula that is made by the work of hands.
Know that fistula happens in all members of the body; for there are fistulas that come to the large veins, and to the arteries, and to the nerves, or to the surface, or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to some of the ribs, or to the spine of the back, or to any joint of the hands or feet; and some come to the property of the principal member, and to similar places.
And all the fistulas that are of this kind are of difficult healing, and there is only labor and ignorance;
and if there is any fistula that does not come to the place I have mentioned, and you are confident of the cure, and you want to know it, take a tent of bronze or iron, if the fistula is straight, seek it;
and if the fistula is twisted, seek it with a thin tent of lead, for lead bends readily around the twist;
and if the fistula has many openings and you cannot properly seek it with tents, then irrigate it through one of the openings, for the moisture will run from one opening to another, and cleanse it;
then seek it wisely to your ability, so that you know if there is bone or nerve, and it is deep-seated, and ask the patient carefully about the pain they feel when you press your hand, and the place where they feel it;
and when you truly know the place where it is, and if it is far from a joint, or a nerve, or an artery or vein, or in any of the places I have told you, then cut it according to what I have told you, and remove the pus and the corrupted flesh that are within;
and then treat it until it is healed, and if the fistula is deep and straight, then you must cut deep, as far as you can, then put moistened tents in sharp medicine and push them to the head of the fistula, so that the medicine corrodes the excess that remains at the bottom;
and then apply ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed;
and if it is not healed by this, then cauterize it as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted by the fistula, then cut it.
If a vein or nerve is in the way of the principal limbs, as we have said;
And if the bone is exposed, and there is corruption and blackness, then scrape it until all corruption is removed, then treat it with things that generate flesh until it is healed;
And if it is not healed, and returns to a boil as before, know that you have not yet reached the source:
so dig and search until you are at the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then restore the place;
And if it is thus healed, that is good. If not, know that the corruption is too deep for you to reach; if there is no other remedy than to leave it to nature;
and if there is a small bone corrupted, and you can remove it with pliers, remove it with a suitable instrument; and if there are many bones, remove them all, and leave none.
and if moisture resists you, and there is no mistake or fear, cut the moisture and flesh, and expose the bones.
And if you cannot remove them at once, place something on the wound that causes putrefaction, and leave it until the area around the bones is rotten, and then the bones will be more easily removed.
And if it is a large bone, such as of the leg or thigh, delay the corruption just until the blackness is entirely gone, then restore the wound.
and if there is a large portion that is corrupted, and it reaches the marrow of the bone; if it must be cleaned and cut right down to the corruption, and then treat it until it is healed.
and I will tell you about a fistula that happened to a man in his leg, so that you may take example and assistance in your work.
There was a young man around 30 years old, who had pain in his leg from a cause that came from within the body, so that the matter came to his leg, and it was swollen with a large abscess, and had no apparent cause to avoid opening it;
But the doctors, in their folly, worked so hard on it that the abscess opened, and much matter flowed out, and it became a fistula, and many holes came out which all discharged pus and moisture from the body;
And many doctors applied treatments for around two years, and there was no wise person in the art of hands, until I was called, and I saw his leg and the medicines with which they treated him, and that which flowed from the holes to a great extent; And the young man's body became red, and had a yellowish color.
I inserted a tent into one of these holes, and then searched all the holes, and found that one was coming against the other from all parts of the leg.
I then hastened, and cut into one of the holes until I uncovered a part of the bone, and found it corrupted and pierced, and the corruption reached down to the bone within;
I cleaned away what appeared to me of the corrupted bone, and thought that there was no other corruption, other than what I removed;
and began to restore the wound with soothing medicines for a long time, and it could not be healed;
and then I began again, and uncovered the bone as before, and found the corruption continuing into the bone, and cleaned it, and then removed it, and tried hard to heal the place; but I could not, until I cut around a palm's width of the bone, and it was utterly destroyed, then restored it with medicines; and it was healed and joined quickly, and it was no longer necessary to begin the work again except for the weakness of the sick person, who could not endure, and for the fear of death that I had for him. For because of the evacuation, he often coughed, but he was completely healed, and hard flesh grew in place of the bone, and it was of good disposition and caused no harm or opposition at all, neither to the air nor to the coming.
And if the bone is broken in any place of the body, it should be treated in this manner: Take a bandage, and bind it to the head of the exposed bone, and instruct someone to stretch it upward; and place another bandage of wool thicker than the first bandage, and bind it over the flesh that is over the bone, and stretch the head, so that you pull the corrupted flesh downward, and uncover the flesh above the place where you want to be, so that the thread does not injure the flesh;
and place a hot ember or a plank under the bone to more easily cut away the corrupted flesh;
and you should continue this until you can see and feel the corruption, and do this again.
And if the bone is corrupted, and does not show, and the corruption is in the middle or in a part, then uncover all of the flesh;
then place hot embers underneath, and then cut from one part to the other the corruption, and let the incision be the length of the corruption, a little, as we have said;
and if the corruption is in the joint, cut the corrupted joint, and cut the bone where it contains it on the other side;
and if the corruption is in the continuation of the two joints, there is no other remedy than to cut [it];
and if the corruption is in the nail of the hand, or in the nail of the foot, that is a very strong thing, but nonetheless you must inquire into that corrosion, how it appears to you; and cleanse it in every way you can, but let the vein or nerve not obstruct you;
and know that the instruments and blades for cutting these bones are many, according to the arrangement of the bones and the appearance of the [bone], and their thickness and thinness, and their size and smallness, and their hardness; and for this, it is necessary to prepare an instrument for each type of work;
and know that the work will show you the instrument you will need, according to the knowledge of this art, and the evidence of the types of illnesses; therefore consider the instrument you need according to what is appropriate.
The shoulder could dislocate either due to internal causes, or due to external causes;
and when you have treated that corrosion with medical cures, and they are of no use, then it is necessary to amputate that limb up to the place where the corrosion is, so that the patient escapes death, or the worse evil, the loss of the limb;
and the sign of this is that the limb turns black, so that it appears to be burned by fire, and after the blackness, this corrosion spreads from limb to limb, and takes over the entire body;
if you hurry to amputate, and if it is due to the sting of some venomous creatures, such as sea scorpions and vipers and the like, if the corrosion is at the tip of the finger, amputate it and do not give it time to spread to the hand.
And if it reaches the hand, amputate it at the joint, so that the corrosion does not reach the arm;
and if it reaches the arm, amputate it at the elbow;
and if it passes the elbow, it is death, and no strong remedies are of any use except the measure of their virtue.
and similarly do when the corrosion comes to the foot: if it comes to the first joint, amputate it after the other joint;
and if it comes to the foot, amputate the whole foot; and if it ascends to the leg, amputate at the knee joint;
and if it comes above the knee, there is no other remedy than to let the patient die;
and the method of cutting or removing the limb is that you bind it above and below, and let one attendant pull one of the bands down and another attendant the other band up, and you sever the flesh that is between the two bands a space of one span wide, until the bone is uncovered;
then cut or remove it, and put on each side a strip of linen, so that the removed part does not touch the healthy area, and cause the patient further injury and festering abscesses.
And if a flow of blood comes when you work, cauterize the area quickly, or put on some astringent powders;
then return to your treatment until it is complete, then bind the wounded limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed;
and I will tell you that it happened to a man in his foot:
he had a blackness that resembled a burn from fire, and that corrosion first came in his toe of the foot, until it affected his entire foot;
and when the man saw the corrosion, he quickly cut off the foot, and was healed;
and a long time later, the corrosion returned to the toe of his hand, and he came to me, and I put upon him things that repel after the cleansing of the body, and the corrosion could not cease;
and he wanted me to cut off his hand, and I did not want to, because I had hope of repelling the matter; and also feared that if I cut off his hand, that he might die, for the man's strength was weak;
and he despaired completely, and returned to his land, and quickly cut off his hand, and was healed;
and I have not recorded this except for the reason that one might do likewise if needed.
Sometimes an abscess develops in a fleshy area, and lingers so long that it gathers a great amount of pus; and then it bursts and opens, and the pus escapes, and the place remains empty, like a vessel; and the skin above is as delicate as fine cloth, and does not reach down to the bone, nor to the nerve, and such an ailment is called "sain," and not called "fistula";
but if it extends so far that it reaches the bone deep within, it is called "fistula";
and the skin is such that you should cut the skin all around, and especially when it is delicate, like a cloth; and it does not heal because of its corruption.
And if you are sure that the skin will heal, and the corruption is not deep, and the skin is thick with flesh, treat it with an enema thus:
Look if the swelling is large, and the discharge from it has a foul odor, then treat it with an enema of Egyptian medicine which is made like this: Take honey, oil, and litharge, equally, and put them in a vessel over a fire until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey;
Then take of this according to your need, and mix it in water and honey, and give it as an enema to the swelling, and bind up the opening; and leave the medicine in for two hours, then remove it by squeezing;
Do this many times, until the swelling is healed, and the foul odor is removed;
And sometimes an enema of ash water is used when this medicine is unavailable.  Take ashes from a vine's wood, pour water over them, then drain it, and use it as an enema, until you know the swelling is cleansed.
And if the patient cannot tolerate it, neither the Egyptian medicine nor the ash water, then give an enema of water and honey with a little ground litharge; or you can give an enema of honey and diluted wine, since honey has the property of cleansing and washing, and the wine dries the swelling;
And when you have done this, and you are certain that the swelling is well cleansed, give an enema of that which causes flesh to grow there; and you take a diaphanous plaster, made with rose oil and wine;
or you give an enema of certain medicines and ointments, whose properties I have described when discussing ointments;
And if the opening of the swelling is small, and the nozzle of the enema cannot enter, enlarge it a little with an iron, and insert a tent of Egyptian or basil ointment until it is enlarged;
And if the wound is too large, close it, leaving only the area where the enema can enter; and if the opening that discharges pus is on top, cut it or another lower opening that exists.
And if you cannot cut the swelling from underneath as you wish, prepare it in such a way that the pus runs to the lowest opening there, for when the pus is deep, it does not allow the flesh to grow there; and if you cannot cut the swelling from underneath as you wish, prepare it in such a manner: So that the pus runs easily downward, and leaves nothing of the pus;
So that the pus runs easily downward, and leaves nothing of the pus; and take consolidating medicines to put over the swelling, and spread over it a linen cloth that covers all the swelling; Then cut as forcibly in the middle of the swelling, a little wider than the first one; then spread a soft ointment over another cloth according to the size of the opening, and put it over the swelling's opening to ease the pus, and do not remove the large cloth for several days at once.
And the one over the swelling's opening, remove often to remove the pus, and know what runs from the pus, whether it is venom or a little or enough, or digested or undigested;
And watch if the patient feels pain or not, and if there is an abscess or not, and when your medicine has spread in such a way and you see the nature rising on the opening of the swelling, then know that the swelling is already healing, and health is approaching.
And then unbind it in the morning, or on the third day, and when you unbind the wound, change another cloth, and renew the ointment.
And if subtle venom flows after a long time, do not despair of health, for health approaches.
For there are men whose flesh takes a long time to heal in their wounds, and others who do the opposite;
And if undigested pus bursts from the swelling after many days, know that the swelling will not heal;
And if the swelling is slow to heal, and is prolonged, add drying medicines, moist in substance but dry in virtue, such as diafinit ointment, for it contains a great deal of vitriol, and it is the last medicine;
Take diafinit ointment, and it is made with rose oil, and it is sprinkled with equal parts of old wine in substance;
Then it is applied and used;
And this same method works better for inflamed swelling, when diafinit ointment is not available, or take myrrh, aloes, and frankincense, and grind it, and powder it over honey when it is on the fire;
and then glue it into a drape, and spread it over the swelling, and sometimes an experienced herbalist adds long, celeste lily roots, which are like the flour of vetch and centaury; and use it in simple or compound forms: Grind them, and make powder, and put over the honey I mentioned, and use it;
And if the treatment is prolonged, and is not cured by this treatment, then know that the corruption is deep, and creates an impression on the bone, or the hard parts, or the ligaments; if the treatment for a fistula, as we have said before.
A whitlow is an abscess that arises beneath the nail of the finger, or the toe, or perhaps arises in other digits;
and when it is old, and no care is taken, it becomes a hot abscess, and it swells and sheds pus until it reaches the root of the nail, and perhaps even consumes the entire nail;
and the corruption reaches the bone, so that a foul pain arises, and the fingertip is swollen, and the color is dark.
When you treat it as we have said in the division, and the treatment does not help, then you must cut away all the excess that remains of the nail with a hot iron, and then cauterize the wound afterwards. Cauterization is of great help if the bone is sound and the nail is sound;
and if the nail presses on the flesh, begins to prick it, and wounds it, you must place a spatula under the nail that pricks the flesh, and lift it up, and carefully and gently cut away the flesh, and apply burning and corrosive medicines to the remaining flesh to remove all of it; then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the corruption is in the bone, cut it and remove the force, for as long as the corrupted bone is there, it cannot heal;
and if you see the finger decaying, cut it in the form of a Y as previously described, then treat it until it is healed;
and if it is struck and bruised, and it feels great pain, you must first heal it;
then cut the nail of the spatumile acutely by cutting across the top, and be careful that the cut does not reach the flesh beneath the nail, for the patient would feel too much pain;
and if it happens, put something on that soothes.
The swelling that arises in the hands of some people by chance is all fleshy, and sometimes there are bones, and sometimes there is a nail, and some of them arise in the root of the joint, or the beginning is in some of the fingers.
The ones that arise in any part of the finger do not move, and the ones that arise at the joint of the finger, by chance do move;
The size of the one that is fleshy is so light, in this way: Cut it at its root with a wide spatula.
The one that arises at the root of the joint is difficult to cure: So hold yourself from cutting.
In the one that arises or should be at the back end, you must first cut the flesh roundly down to the bone, then cut the bone with a suitable knife for it, and then cure it until it is healed.
The swelling that comes to the fingers together comes from birth, or from the healing of a wound, or from burning with fire, or similar things.
You must cut that swelling so that the fingers return to their natural shapes. Then place between them cloths or soaked bandages in rose oil, so that they do not adhere. or you place between two thin pieces of lead until the place is healed, as is appropriate.
If swelling comes to any of those fingers with the palm, cut that swelling as appropriate.
The veins are large, wrapped and full of melancholy superfluities that come to many parts of the body;
and more happen in the legs of those who walk and work and carry, than in others.
Therefore, you should administer a purging of the bile, and then a salve from the basilica.
The iron cure is according to two manners: one is that they are cut, and black blood is drawn out; and the other manner is that you tie up the vein, and draw out all of it.
The incision is according to this manner: First, apply a very hot water to the leg, until the thick blood is thinned, then bind the patient's leg from above the thigh down to the part below the knee;
then cut the vein in one place, or two or three, with a wide incision, then raise and draw out the black blood with your hand, from one end to the other, until as much blood flows out as the patient's strength can bear;
and then bandage it, and instruct him to eat foods producing black bile;
and resume the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are full, and harms the patient.
The raising of the limb is according to this method: raise the patient's leg, if it has a lot of hair, then put it in a bath, and warm the leg with hot water until it becomes red, and the veins swell;
and if you do not have a bath, then warm it over the fire, and then cut along the vein from the top of the knee, or in the part below the ankle;
then open the skin with a knife, and scrape the vein from each side, until it appears when you feel it;
and it is seen red and black, and when it enters the skin it appears like a white string;
then put a rod underneath, until it is raised from the skin, and then cut it lightly with a knife, then cut it in another place above three fingers;
then scrape the skin over the vein until it appears, then lift it with a rod, as you did, and cut it with another knife, as you first did;
then cut another incision, or more if you need them, then lift it, and cut it at the finger of the foot, then pull and lift it down to the second incision;
then pull it from incision to incision, until it is completely free, then cut it;
and if you cannot pull and lift it, then put a needle with a very strong double thread, and tie it, and pull it, and put a rod underneath, and turn your hand to one side and the other, until it comes out; and watch that it does not cut, for if it cuts, then it cannot be pulled or lifted, and harm comes to the patient;
and when you have pulled it all out, place wet wool on the wound site soaked in wine and rose oil; and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted, twisted, and wrapped together, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you must split it with twisting, but do not cut it; and pull it as we have said before.
The shape of the iron with which one cuts the vein is curved, and does not cut straight, so that it does not cut the vein;
and is of large curvature, for if it were subtle, it would cut the vein, but let it be large, as we have said, and this is the shape:
This vein is entangled in the legs, in warm parts where no herbs or trees grow, and in dry earth where there is no moisture;
and perhaps it arises elsewhere than in the legs, and this happens from the rot that comes under the skin, as it comes inside the body of serpents and worms, entangled between skin and flesh.
And if the signs of the beginning of this vein are that a very great inflammation comes to the leg, then the place changes, and the vein begins to protrude, like the root of a plant.
When the head appears, you must wrap around a piece of lead of one and a half to two ounces, and the knot, and leave the lead hanging on the leg, and every time any comes out to the outside, wrap it around the lead, and the knot.
and if it is too long, cut off a part of it, and wrap the remainder, and do not cut it at its root until it is all out. for if you cut it, it will return into the flesh, and cause an abscess and rot in the place, and a bad illness.
because of which thing it is necessary that it be treated little by little until the end, and nothing remains in the body.
and sometimes this vein, when it is treated, is five palms long, or ten, and a man came to me, from whom it emerged ten palms long, and when you cut it, you push one reed or a quill, and pierce it to the bottom, so that all comes out.
and let the matter within be emptied, and administer healing medicines to the place to prevent rot for a while, then treat it like any abscess.
And sometimes this vein has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot, and there come many openings, and from which it sprouts branches.
Then treat it as we have said before.
of worms which arise between skin and flesh This illness is called in our land "cattle disease", because it happens frequently to cattle, and is a small worm that arises between skin and flesh, and travels throughout the body, moving up and down, and one feels it well by the movement of the limb from limb, until it breaks through the skin where it goes, and causes sores.
and is engendered by the corruption of certain humors, as worms and snakes and maggots and ascarides come in the belly.
and one doubts its malice, for when it travels through the body, and it ascends to the head, and it comes to the eye, perhaps it returns, and destroys the eye. and this happens many times.
When you wish to cure and draw it out, one can only do so when it moves.
if so, then you must tie the place above and below with a strong bandage tightly, then cut above and draw it out forcefully, and if the worm is deep in the flesh and you cannot find it, then cauterize it with fire above, until it burns.
and the greatest harm it does is that it runs the eye, as we have said.
and if you see it coming near the eye, then press the eyebrow firmly below it, then cut above it, and draw it out forcefully.
And it is necessary to use the patient with cleansing of the body with dissolving medicines for the foul humors, and to avoid foods that cause putrefaction.
Of the pain that comes from wind. This illness is called "vakirir" in our land, and is a pain that comes in certain limbs, and may move from limb to limb.
And I saw what I tell you. I was called to a sick woman, and she uncovered her arm, and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm.
and shortly after, I saw it rise like a worm on the shoulder, faster than anything, like swift silver when it rushes from one place to another;
the pain departed from that place, and settled in the shoulder, and then a short time later ran throughout the body, until it came to the other arm;
then she told me that it was turning around the body repeatedly, just as I saw it.
I marvelled greatly how it moved thus from limb to limb, for I had never seen this illness in this way before. However, I had seen many who had suffered pain moving from one place to another, but I had never seen it like this, as I saw in the woman;
and I thought it was because the woman had a thin body, and exposed veins, and for this reason the windiness was evident;
and it is not apparent in this way to those who are plump, and have moist bodies and full veins.
And when you wish to cure this illness, and the patient feels this pain, if it appears as we have said, then gently cut over it and under it, and then cut over until that constricted windiness is released from the place; and cauterize the place;
and if you do not see it with your eyes, then cure it with things that expel wind, like foul-smelling pills, and pills of centaury, and similar others.
Arrows are diverse, according to their appearances and according to the places on the body where they strike.
Their diversity is such that some have large points, and small, and barbed, and sealed; and some that have two angles, and some that have tongues, and some that have pieces;
and the one that strikes any limb strikes in two ways: or in a chief member, like the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar members. When it strikes then in any of these members, and the sign of death, which I will tell you afterwards, appears: if it is necessary that you refrain from the extraction of this arrow, for death comes afterward in many conditions; and when these bad signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not deeply embedded, then pull it out and treat the wound.
And the signs of the brain when the arrow strikes and pierces the bone, and the membrane that is above the brain bursts, is when there is scotomia and dimness and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasms and confusion of understanding, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps there is a discharge of blood from the nostrils or ears; and perhaps loses speech and voice; and from the wound comes white moisture like pus, and it also comes like burning flesh;
and if these signs appear, then desist from treatment, and remove the arrow if it is not embedded.
The signs of an arrow lodged in the heart are that it is near the left breast, and feels as if it were lodged in something hard, and not empty; and perhaps the arrow moves like pus, and black blood flows, and coldness and cold sweat come, and syncope. Then know without doubt that death is coming.
And the sign of an arrow that wounds the lung is that frothy blood spurts from the wound, and the throat swells, and the patient changes color, and gasps loudly and seeks cold air.
And if the arrow strikes the chest wall, it is next to the small ribs; and causes great pain and loud gasps; and all the limbs move from the shoulders.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, perhaps some undigested food spurts from the wound.
And if the arrow strikes the belly, and some straw spurts from the intestines, there is no hope for the cure, nor for the arrow's removal.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder, and urine spurts and flows out, and the patient feels intense pain: know that the wound is fatal.
The other limbs, such as the face and neck, and throat, shoulder, shoulder blade, spine of the back, arm, thigh, and legs, and similar members, are subject to various conditions. When the arrow is in the nerve or artery, and it is not poisonous, as I will tell you what happened to me, so that you may do likewise.
It happened to a man that an arrow struck him in the tear duct at the root of his nose: I extracted it, and pulled it out from the other side under the fat of the ear, and he was healed without harm.
And I pulled out an arrow that had lodged in the fat of the eye under the eyelid, and the arrow was bent, and I could only reach the tip towards the shaft, and the arrow was large, from a Turkish bow, with every iron head light without ears;
The man was healed, and no bad accident occurred to him.
And I pulled an arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arab, with ears:
I soothed the (inflammation of the) barbells, and I worked subtly until I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I pulled an arrow from a man, that had lodged in his belly, and I thought that he would die;
and after he had passed thirty days, he did not change his condition at all; I cut around the arrow, and I encircled it, and pulled it out, and there was no bad accident.
And I saw a man whose arrow lodged in his back, and the wound was closed over;
and the arrow remained inside him, and did not change his natural dispositions, nor did he find any harm in any of his natural works.
And I saw another man, in whose face an arrow lodged, and the wound was closed over; and remained thus without suffering great pain;
and many others like that.
And he extracted an arrow from a man of the king's princes, which had lodged in the middle of his nose, and was slightly leaning to the right side; and the arrow was completely embedded.
I was called to treat it after it had been lodged for three days. I found the wound very narrow.
I probed it with a very thin probe, and felt nothing; and he felt a prickling and pain under his right ear.
I thought it was from the tip of the arrow. I applied an attractive and digestive plaster to the area, so that it wouldn't swell; and the arrowhead appeared to me.
and the arrowhead appeared to me. I applied the plaster again, and the wound healed up again. The patient remained like this for a long time, until he felt the arrowhead emerge from his nose one day;
and he told me so. I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound repeatedly, until it was open, and probed it, and felt the head of the arrow loosening in the area;
then I added more of that sharp medicine to the opening of the wound, until the arrowhead appeared clearly visible;
and it took about four months, and then the wound widened enough that I inserted pliers, and moved it back and forth, but it wouldn't come out;
then I continued to refine and devise instruments, until I took pliers well-crafted, according to what their form will be at the end of this chapter, so that I extracted it, and healed the wound.
And the doctors judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: I restored it then, and the wound was healed, and the patient was completely healthy.
Or I have told you the quality of the extraction of some arrows, so that you apply your treatment based on what I have not said, for the book cannot encompass everything;
but the wise masters look closely at even the smallest things, and based on what is present and missing, devise new work and new instruments, for the emergence of strange things that occur in this art.
I say that arrows do not exit the limbs where they are lodged except in two ways: or through the place where they entered, or through another part;
and the one that exits through the place where it entered, is an arrow lodged in fleshy areas, and sometimes it exits immediately.
And if it does not exit immediately, leave it until the flesh around it is rotten and the exit is eased;
and if it is lodged in the bone, and it cannot exit, leave it so for a few days, and move it each day;
and then it will exit, and if it does not exit, pierce around it with a very thin instrument, until the surrounding area is widened, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is lodged in a part of the body where it cannot be seen, then search for it throughout the entire wound; and if you feel it, then remove it with a suitable instrument;
and if you cannot because of the tightness of the wound, and the depth of the arrow, and there are no bones, nerves or veins there, then widen the wound until it is large;
and remove the arrow if you can, and if the arrow has points with which it is held, then cut away the flesh which is caught on either side as much as you can, and then break or bend the points of the arrow so that you can remove it;
and be careful that you do not break the arrow, as this would make removing it more difficult.
And if you cannot do it in one go, leave it until the surrounding area is rotten, then remove it, for removal will be easier. And if the flow of blood makes it difficult, then apply what we have said about treatment in its chapter;
and beware of cutting the nerve and vein, and devise how you can safely remove the arrow, quickly or slowly, firmly or gently;
and position the patient according to the form he was in when the arrow struck him, for this is the greatest help there is; and if you cannot, then position him according to what the signs show you.
The arrow that comes from another part, or where something is apparent, or the skin is swollen in a place that is seen or felt distinctly:
then cut around it until the pliers can grip it, and then remove it: if it jumps out now.
And if it is held in the bone, then turn your hand roundly, until it enters the bone, and widens the bone, then remove it.
And if it cannot come out, then leave it for a while, and then resume the extraction until it jumps out;
and if the shaft of the arrow is in there, then push it with the whole shaft;
and if the shaft has fallen, and you want to administer a push, then administer a pointed instrument, so that the point of the arrow enters the pointed instrument;
and then push forcefully, and if the arrow is pointed, then push an instrument with a pointed end into it, to ease the extraction.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you must cut all the flesh around where the poison is, if you can, then treat the wound as appropriate.
And if the arrow hits the feet or the belly or the bladder or the ribs, and it is close, and you can cut above, then cut above it;
and be careful not to cut the vein and the nerve, and then remove it, and then dress the wound, if necessary; and treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the forceps used to remove arrows is similar to the beak of a bird, and here is the shape:
And there are many varieties of them: large, medium, and small, according to the size of the arrow.
The shape of the arrowhead is also like the feather of a bird, for thrusting at the point of the arrow, as is this shape:
Of the veins from which one bleeds are thirty-one, of which there are sixteen in the head, that is to say: Two beating ones that are behind the ears, which are called the two "herbaches"; and the two arteries that are in the two visible temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called "aspirs"; and the vein that is in the middle of the forehead; and the vein that is at the top of the nose; and the two veins that are in the neck; and the two veins that are in the lips above the mouth, and these are the veins that are called "augeherich"; and two veins that are under the tongue.
The veins commonly bled are five in each arm:
one is the cephalic, and it is on the left side, and the common people call it "vein of the head"; and the middle one is called "faste," and it is composed of the cephalic and basilic, and the common people call it "vein of the heart"; and the basilic is on the right side, and the common people call it "vein of the belly," and it is above the fossa, and it is the one from which one bleeds, which is clearly visible above the wrist.
And the salvatelle is the vein which is between the ring finger and the little finger, and it has two branches;
and in the leg and foot there are three veins: one is under the bend of the left side wrist, and the second is behind the ankle of the right side; and the vein called "nesse," which is at the ankle of the other side;
and in the other leg are three veins below those.
Bleeding from the veins that are behind the ears helps with old colds and migraines;
and the quality of the bleeding, as I told you, is that you raise the patient's head and rub the place where the veins are with a rough cloth; then the patient tightens their neck with a bandage, so that the two veins appear behind the ears in two places depending on the head: then take them with your finger, and where you feel the pulse under your finger, prick gently;
then take the lancet, and insert it under the vein down to the bone, then raise your hand above the entire vein, and cut both the skin and the vein with two passes of the blade, and make the blood flow out as much as you want;
then restrain and bind it, until it is healed;
and I have already said about the incision and the cautery in the first book.
The bleeding of the two arteries that are in the two temples is good for old, severe migraine, and habitual ophthalmia, and for sharp tearing in the eyes;
and the qualities of the bleeding are as I said: and it is that the patient tightens their neck, until the two veins appear clearly; and feels the pulse under your finger, and then bleeds from the inside;
then raise the heart above the vein up to your index finger, and place the lancet underneath, and raise the vein upwards, and cut it, as you have done to the other two veins, and let the blood flow according to your necessity;
then release the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, then put cotton on; and then bind it tightly, and leave it until it is healed;
and we have already spoken of their cutting and their extraction, in the beginning of the book.
Bleeding from the vein in the forehead is as good as bleeding from the cephalic vein for diseases of the face, and for migraines, and for redness;
and the quality is such that the patient tightens his neck by twisting, until the vein appears; then take the instrument that is called "digging tool", of which here is the shape:
And place the point on the vein, and press upon it with your hand, or with something else, and let blood issue according to the quantity you desire; then loosen the patient's neck, and tie the vein until it is healed and sometimes the work of a wide flame.
However, it is not fitting that the flame be too sharp; and the flame sideways, for the bone is near, and by chance the flame breaks when it is thin.
The cauterization of the two veins that are in the two tear ducts aids the eyes, and the temples, and the redness, and the inflammation in the eye, and the ailments of the face;
and the qualities of their cauterization are such that the patient tightens their neck by twisting with a certain bandage, as before;
then cauterize, and let the cauterization be across, a little long, a little wide, for there is no flesh there. And if the flame is thin, by chance it breaks;
then make the blood flow as much as you need, and then bind over cotton, and bind it well.
Cauterization of the vein of the nose is good for colds, and for violent madness, and for facial illnesses, such as migraines and redness that comes to the face, and especially when it is old;
and the method of the cauterization is that the patient strains their neck, then holds their nose with your left hand, and take a thin, long flame, and insert it in the space between the two nostrils, because the vein is not clearly visible there, and the blood will begin to flow;
and do not go too deep, and make the blood flow according to your needs, then bandage it for a night, for it is quickly restored;
Cauterization of the two temples helps with constriction of the throat, and with the beginning of ulcers, and many illnesses, and with impetigo, and with sores, and with herpes, and with blisters;
And the method of the cauterization is that the patient strains their neck from both sides, as we have said;
And let the master stand above the patient's head, and the patient sit on a chair, then cauterize the vein a little widely along its length, then draw the blood moderately, or as much as is needed;
Then do the same to the other vein, then loosen the bandage, and constrict both veins moderately, so the patient does not choke; And leave it until morning, that the wound may be healed.
Of the cauterization of the lips The cauterization of the veins in the lips above helps with cold in the mouth, and the corruption of gums, and fissures in the lips, and of the nose and throat.
And the quality of the cauterization is to make the patient sit in front of you, and hold his neck as I have said; then turn the lip, and look for two veins, one on the right lip and the other on the left, and they are recognized by being black, and by the small black veins around them:
Then cut one and the other, and if you do not recognize them, and you are in doubt, then cut the largest on each side, and likewise do with the two veins above and below, for it is the same method.
Of the cauterization under the tongue The cauterization of the veins under the tongue helps after the cauterization of the cephalic vein, and it is for the tightening of the throat, and for diseases of the eye, and for diseases of the mouth;
and the quality of the cauterization is that the patient sits between your hands in front of the sun, and lifts the tongue, and looks underneath on each side for a black vein:
Then cauterize one and the other, and do not go too deep, for the arteries are below.
The veins of the ribs, which are commonly cauterized, are cauterized according to two methods:
either by piercing with a broad, flaming iron, or with a thin, olive-shaped knife, as sharp as a carving knife, and is called "anesil"; and are broad or thin according to the width and narrowness of the veins. The shape of the flaming iron is very well-known, and is broad as you see:
And it is needed to open the veins filled with thick, visible blood, and containing thick and troubled blood; and that is the shape of the olive-shaped iron:
and it is more pointed and thin, and is for bleeding thin veins, where there is thin, yellowish blood.
The bleeding of the basilic vein, which is one of these veins, helps illnesses that are under the throat, and in the neck, and in the chest, and in the belly;
and it is necessary for the surgeon that he bleed wisely, and that he avoids the artery underneath. And if he cuts the artery, and a flow of blood comes, it must be stopped, as I have said; And the flame should not be piercing, but cutting, like a lancet.
And if the basilic vein is not clearly visible, you must bind it and change to another one; or you want any branch of it, or you bleed in its place the vein in the middle of the arm: it is clearly visible; and cut with the burning lancet, as we have said.
And if you wish to know the place of the bleeding, you should first bind the arm, that you touch the place until you know the pulse; then mark the place precisely, and then bind the arm, and cut the vein with the burning lancet; and watch that you do not strike the artery when you see the place pierced, for it is of the artery: Wipe it then.
And if you see it spring up like a child's urine, and the blood is red and subtle, know that it is blood from the artery: Hurry then, and put your finger over it for a long time, then remove your finger if the blood stops, for it often happens; Bind the arm, and leave it thus, and let the patient not move it;
and let him be careful, and not move it until he is healthy.
And if the blood does not stop, and it overwhelms you, and the medicine is not present, then cut the artery if it is exposed, for the head will retract; and stop the blood.
And take a fig-tree bark, and slit it, and take one half and bind well until the other day;
if the blood stops, that is good; if not, treat it, as we have said, with powders that stop blood;
and the stopping is not difficult in many conditions due to the small size of the wound, and the strength of the arm's bandage.
The bleeding from the vein in the middle helps by drawing blood from the head above and from the body below, because it is composed of the basilic and cephalic veins, as we have said;
and it is necessary for the surgeon to be careful of the nerve underneath, and if he goes too deep and finds the nerve, it will swell and the patient's condition will be serious, and perhaps it will not heal;
and this nerve appears many times, and if it does not appear in some men due to its subtlety, then you must bleed it with the lancet; and dry the nerve to your power.
And if there is a vein between the two nerves, cut it lengthwise.
Bleeding from the cephalic vein helps, as it draws blood from the head and aids the eyes;
and it is necessary to bleed by piercing the olive vein or the myrtle vein, for it is the safest of all the veins, for it has neither nerve nor artery beneath it. However, one must seek the easiest spot, and do not hurt anything if one fails the first time, and try again; and perhaps the spot swells in some people when one fails the first time, but it does no harm.
The quality of the bleeding is according to your thought.
The first thing you should know about bleeding is that it is only administered to preserve health and to avoid future illnesses;
and let the bleeding be done in one of the three veins that are on the arm: that is to say, cephalic, basilic, and median; and one should bleed in the beginning of spring on an empty stomach, and in autumn and winter after eating, when the signs of fullness appear;
and one should bleed on the first or third day, after two or three hours of the day.
The bleeding administered to illnesses has no determined hour, but whenever needed, by day or by night, at all hours and at all times;
and it is not appropriate to bleed children until fourteen years old, nor women carrying a child except from the fourth month until the seventh. And old people who have passed sixty years should not be bled.
And when someone wishes to be bled, in whatever way, it is necessary that they cleanse their intestines with a gentle clyster, if they have retained a lot of waste, so that the veins do not draw from the intestines the putrid superfluities harmful to the principal limbs;
nor should those who are overly full of food, nor those who are drunk, as long as they are still affected by it, nor those who are hydrops, be bled;
and one should refrain from bleeding after a colic attack, and vomiting, and bowel discharge, and increased urination in women, and childbirth, from wakefulness and fasting, and whatever diminishes all strength, either through a thing of the spirit or of the body;
then subtilize the humors, if the blood is thick, through foods and drinks and medicines, if you have the power to do so;
then enter a bath, if nothing prevents it, to subtilize the blood, and bleed from the vein of the arm around the third part, as we have said;
and guard yourself that day from work, and from hardship, and from lust, and from similar things;
and be relaxed and joyful, and let the blood-letter be higher than the one being bled, and the blood-letter rub the arm two or three times, then tighten the bandage moderately, for when it is too tight or too loose, the blood cannot flow;
and then rub the area with your hands, until the veins swell and are felt;
then the blood-letter moistens the flame with a little old oil, then places the finger of his left hand on the vein just beneath the area where he wants to bleed, so the vein does not burst and fail when it is pierced.
For there are veins that flee like ropes when bled, and there are some that are full of wind, so that when the flame is placed upon them, it recoils, and the vein cannot be opened, and such are these; and if he opens the vein, the wound is too narrow, therefore the blood-letter must be careful in these matters.
And if the vein opens the first time, that is good; if not, he should begin again a little below that spot or a little above, if the spot is not swollen.
And if the spot is swollen, and the patient is frightened, let him leave it for one or two days, and do not tie the arm. perhaps a hot abscess will come.
do not enter a bath, then recommence the bleeding if it pleases him.
and if the opening is small, or the blood flows subtly and you doubt that it will not issue as much blood as you wish, then strike the flame directly into that opening itself.
and work a little hastily, before the spot is swollen; for this happens many times, when the wound is small.
If you see the place swollen, do not recommence the bleeding, and place a little linseed oil there, for it lightens the body of the blood, and the linseed is milder in this place than the oil.
and thus administer the linseed oil in each bleeding that you bleed the veins, to stem the flow of blood;
and this same thing makes it stick and swell, when it is placed on the spot; the blood is subtle and spreads when it is too thick.
And if there comes a large abscess, which happens many times, especially when it has not been bled enough, but only when the opening of the vein is small, hurry, and put a sponge moistened in warm water and salt on the spot, and hold it for an hour;
and you must do this after the blood flows from the vein, and if any blackness or greenness remains at the spot after a few days, it does not harm it at all; and if you wish, put some aloes or myrrh mixed with juice of calamint, mustard, or similar things.
And many times an abscess and appearance occur at the bleeding of the basilica:
Then place your hand on it, and if you find the area soft to the compression of your hand, that appearance is bad. Then know that you should not put anything of what we have said on it, because perhaps an artery is cut open.
But make a dry poultice to harden the area, then treat it with another remedy until it is healed.
And draw from each of the blood according to the quantity of its virtue, and from the color of the blood.
For if the blood is dark, let it issue until it is red; and if you see it thick, let it until it is thinned; and if it is too hot, let it cool.
And it is necessary for someone who is strong and full, and needs bloodletting, that they be given a larger wound, and that the flame be wide;
and for someone who is weak, do the opposite, and they should be bled little and often, and they should be bled by cutting across, not by piercing;
and this manner of bleeding is safe from blood flow and nerve cutting, and is better than bleeding from the long or the wide.
And to someone whose body weakens due to bloodletting, it is necessary to give bread soaked in pomegranate juice; If he is heated, then draw blood three or four times. And if he is of a cold disposition, then eat bread soaked in syrup made of honey or syrup of aromatic honey with spices, like pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and chickpeas, and a well-smelling syrup.
And if he faints during bloodletting, after the outflow of much blood, then it is necessary that he drink broth of meat, and subtle fragrant syrup, and use the other things that we have said in the division or chapter on syncope, for the evacuation of the vein.
And if he wishes to vent his arm and bleed again, then it is necessary, when he is weakened by a great bloodletting, that he bleed little by little, according to the amount of his continuing strength.
And whoever wishes to vent his arm after the first bloodletting, and he has a strong body, then he bleeds seven hours after the first bloodletting, or after the ninth hour.
And whoever wishes to bleed from another part, he should bleed on the second or third day.
For there is much blood within the body that is already heated, and causes fever; so a great quantity must be drawn, and the opening widened until it drips into a basin; then, when you observe all the conditions of bloodletting, and place your hand upon his pulse while he bleeds, so that death does not come instead of a basin; and this happens many times when the bloodletter is negligent;
and it is not appropriate when you want to release the arm, and make blood issue a second time, and the opening is closed, that you press strongly upon it; nor if he is bent, that he extend his arm hastily, for that would be bad;
but let him bleed a second time; or you prick it with the point of the flame, so that the blood which is congealed in the opening of the vein issues forth, and put a little moistened cloth over it, and press slightly.
And if the vein is swollen, let it be, and do not constrict it, until the abscess is calmed.
And if it is necessary to draw blood a second time, let it bleed in the same place, or in another vein, or in the other arm.
The vein in the middle of the arm is opened instead of the vein of the head because it is composed.
And the manner of bleeding is that the patient puts his hand in warm water, until the vessels are red;
then be tied moderately, so that the vein appears well, then bleed through the middle, not from the wide or long part;
and let the opening be wide, and let it bleed near the joint of the hand, and if blood cannot flow, then put the hand back in warm water, and let the blood flow into the water until you have enough;
and if it is summer, do not put the hand back into warm water, because one puts it more into water in winter than in summer;
and bleeding from this vein is safer than all other veins, because there are no arteries or nerves in it.
Bleeding from the vein on the right hand is good for all liver ailments, and this is the method:
Hold the hand, and place it in warm water, until the vein is swollen, so one can see it; and if the blood flows sideways, and you cut it completely, nothing will be harmed;
and do not go too deep, for the nerves are beneath, bare of flesh, and then return the hand to warm water, if the blood is frozen in the wound, and cannot escape.
And when you have drawn as much blood as you need, place oil and wool on the vein to quickly close it, and do this for each vein.
The bloodletting in the left hand is useful for the mouse disease, and do likewise as I told you for the right.
Bloodletting from the sophen is useful for all illnesses below the body, such as illnesses of the stomach, and retention of flowers, and kidney disease, and thighs and legs, and similar illnesses.
And the quality of this bloodletting is that the patient puts their foot in warm water, and rubs over the vein until it swells, and ties above the joint of the foot; and the vein is at the ankle, and above the foot go many veins;
Then bleed it in the larger vein, or at the ankle, which is more effective.
And if you bleed above the foot, beware of the nerves underneath, and bleed through it as if cutting;
And let the flame be gentle.
And if the blood cannot come out, place the foot in water, and let the vein empty well.
And if the lancing fails the first time, begin again a little higher the second time, because the place is salty;
and do not fear the nerve, as we have said, and do likewise with the vein of the other foot.
The place of the sciatic vein is at the heel of the foot, and its lancing relieves pain in the hip, when it is for hot blood.
And the method of its lancing is that the patient enters a bath, and presses on top of the ankle with four fingers by twisting, for otherwise the vein is not apparent;
and if it appears, lance it in all the ways you can, and across it; and it is better that you cut it, for the place is safe, and it is very receptive to the hands of men.
and it is better that you cut it, for the place is safe, and it is very receptive to the hands of men. And if you do not find it, lance any visible vein on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and beware of the nerves;
and make as much blood flow as you wish, and then loosen the ligature, and place cotton on it and compress it; It is now healed.
Cupping is done with horns, or bronze, or glass;
and cupping is done in two ways: either by striking and drawing blood, or without striking.
And this cupping without striking is in two ways: either with fire, or without fire;
and cupping done by striking and drawing blood is done in fourteen places on the body, of which one is the top of the head; and another is in the middle of the neck; and two others on the two sides of the neck; and the cupping below the chin; and the cupping on the two shoulders; and the cupping above the hips; and the cupping between the two arms; and the cupping on the two legs; and the cupping on the two ankles;
and cupping does not draw much blood, except from small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of this, one does not weaken, as one does with bloodletting from a vein; and it is not appropriate to administer it, neither with nor without fire, in any disease that comes from repletion, until the whole body is emptied.
And if, due to the necessity of illnesses or custom, cupping is to be administered, one should do so every hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and in between and at every time.
for there are some who, when they need cupping, have a heavy head;
and there are those who find fullness and redness in their face, and in their head, and neck, and darkness in their eyes;
and those who find a drop of blood in their mouth, and have a swollen tongue, and spit blood; and there are those who dream, and see by night blood and wounds and death and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and especially when it is in the middle of the month, we order them to be cupped after three hours of the day.
The bloodletting from the temple aids the heaviness of the head ... that comes to the eyes, and it is not necessary that it be after the evacuation of the whole body;
and this cupping is in place of bloodletting from the cephalic vein, and it is not necessary for those of cold complexion to use it, or those who have a cold, for this does them much harm;
and therefore it is not necessary for the elderly to use it, nor those who have cold ailments in the head.
And those who often bleed themselves become forgetful, and therefore it is necessary to place the cupping a little lower for fear of forgetfulness.
Cupping in the neck is in place of bloodletting from the head and from the basilic vein, and therefore it is useful for the constriction of the breast, and for the splitting of the bronchial passage, and for all, and for fullness.
And it should be applied gently, for if it holds too firmly, it will cause forgetfulness in the stomach and the heart.
Cupping on the two ribs of the neck is useful for headaches, and ophthalmia and migraine, and for constriction, and for toothache, and is in place of bloodletting from the basilic vein.
And you must instruct the patient to press his hand when applying it, so that he does not cut the artery, and there is no bleeding.
Cupping under the chin is useful for mouth diseases, and for gum corruption, and similar maladies that are in the mouth; And it is in place of bloodletting from the two lips.
Cupping of the shoulders is useful for maladies caused by heat and fullness.
Cupping of the elbows is as effective as bloodletting from the three veins of the arm, for it draws blood from these large veins;
and instruct the lord that he should not strike too hard or deep, for the place is bare of flesh, and is close to nerves and arteries.
A cupping on the rump is good for hemorrhoids of the fundament and for ailments underneath.  The cupping should be large, and made of bronze, as it needs to draw well. And perhaps, if it were thin, it would break. And cause great wounds.
Cupping on the legs is effective, as they draw blood from the whole body, and are good for chronic pains in the kidneys, bladder and urethra, and remove the obstructions.
And are placed on the shins and ankles.  However, they weaken the body after prolonged use, and cause swelling in many conditions.
The method of applying the cupping is to first make it empty, then to suck gently, apply it quickly, move it evenly, and do not stop until you see the area red and swollen, and the redness of the blood appears.
Then, remove them and put the cupping away, and be careful of the body's condition, for there are some who have delicate flesh and easily bruise. So it is necessary to strike only once, and to make wide, somewhat deep wounds. And suck gently.
And if the blood is thick, it is necessary to strike twice. The first time to thin the thick blood's passage.
And if the blood is very thick, it is necessary to strike a third time;
And when we want to draw out blood little by little, only one strike is sufficient. And if we want a lot of blood, we begin again often.
And if the blood is thick, strike deep, and the limit is that the heart might be pierced suddenly, and it is necessary for those with thick, hard skin, and narrow pores, that you anoint the places of the cupping glasses with arousing and dissolving oil: if it is in this state, with violet oil, or sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil;
and if it is in winter, with oil of cress, or lily, or chamomile, or another similar one.
And if the superfluities are thick and cold, take amarinth oil, or balsam oil, or anise oil, and the like.
And if the one being treated has tender skin and large pores, one should not put any oil on it, but it should be washed after the cupping with rose water, or cold water, or morel water, or pumpkin water, or porcelain water, or something similar.
And those who have much moisture, should rise with ease, or with myrtle water, and sumac, and similar things.
And those with thick superfluities rise with old wine, or water of sorrel, or a decoction of anise or chamomile, or other similar things;
and one should not be bled with a cupping glass before the bath or in the bath, but after the bath an hour or two;
and do not sleep after the cupping, and it is necessary that they wash themselves when they are to be cupped and when they are cupped.
And beware if the one who is bled is choleric, and if the blood is too sharp and inflamed; if it is necessary that he take cold things, such as pomegranates and endives and lettuces in season, and similar things; and eat poultry, and hare meat, and moist foods.
and eat poultry, and hare meat, and moist foods. And he who has a cold complexion, let him take syrup of honey, and a medium-aged fragrant wine, which is between old and new, and eat little, and eat poultry and small birds and pigeons;
and on the day that he is to be bled, he should drink more than eat;
and it is necessary to give some men sometimes treacle or nutmeg before the bleeding, or afterwards, to strengthen the main limbs; and the blood should be thinned, but those who are hot should not drink it.
The leeches that are applied without causing a wound are those applied to the liver, and to the spleen, and to gout, and to the belly and the groin and the kidneys and the hip, for these limbs do not tolerate wounds upon them, and one does not apply them except to draw blood from limb to limb, as we apply them to the breasts when the nipple bleeds;
to remove the viscosity that is in the limb, as we apply leeches to the belly and the groin to thin the limb;
and it relieves the pain, when there is obstruction or stone, so it removes the obstruction by its attractive power, or dislodges the stone from its place;
and so it acts when placed on the liver and spleen when there is retained wind, and these leeches are administered empty simply to draw; and sometimes they are administered with fire, and sometimes filled with warm water, as in diseases of the pleura, and in such a manner that one fills the leech with hot water alone, or with water in which suitable herbs have been boiled.
The form of the leech administered with fire is thus:
And have two fingers wide and half a palm deep, and have on the side near the middle one small hole, as if for putting a needle, and be of bronze, smooth in front so that it does not injure the patient when placed on the limb;
and have in the middle a cross-bar of bronze or iron, to put a lit candle on, and there are both large and small ones according to the diseases and the age of those who take them;
for the leeches of children are different from those of the old, and from the lean ones than from the fat ones.
And one should thus place this leech on the limb:
take the candle of wax or a lining, and put it in the middle of the leech through the bar that is in the middle of the leech, so that the light is at the bottom of the leech so that it does not burn the patient;
and then place it on the limb, and your fingers should be on the opening that we have mentioned, so that when one wants it, the vapor goes away, and one removes the leech;
and one takes the lining as before, and repeats it often, if you need to.
In the leech, then, which is administered in a pleurisy, in acute cases, there is no bar or opening, and it is not administered otherwise than when it is full of water, and is placed on the limb simply;
and that is the form:
Leeches are only administered to limbs where one cannot place cupping due to their small size, like lips and gums, and similar places; and in places lacking flesh, like the nails or nipples, and others similar;
And the quality of use is that when you find leeches that are in clear, fresh water without puncture, then take them;
and put them in fresh water, until they are satiated and have nothing in their bellies; and then bleed from a vein and with cupping, then rub the limb until it is red, and place the leeches on;
And when they are full, and fall off, if it is a place where one can apply cupping, then apply it, for this is very worthwhile.
If not, then lift the place gently, and then with water, very well, and then squeeze it;
And if the place bleeds too much after the leeches, soak a linen cloth in cold water and place it on, until the blood is stopped;
And if the bleeding is excessive, then place ground vitriol, or galenicals, and similar things, until it is stopped;
or you put half of peeled beans on the place, and let them until they burn the place, it will now stop;
and if you need more, then take more leeches.
And if the leeches do not want to take hold, rub the place with fresh blood, or you stick a needle into it until blood comes out, and then place them on it, and as soon as they feel the blood, they will latch on;
And when you want them to drop off, sprinkle a little powdered aloes and salt, or ashes, on them, and they will fall off now.
Here begins the book of fractures. This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and is about the restoration of fractures and dislocations.
Know, my dear son, that foolish men are scornful of this chapter, as they have never seen any of the ancient books, nor read a letter in them;
and for this reason, the science is estranged in our land, for I have never found any good one;
and I know nothing, except through the knowledge of ancient books, in which I have studied so much that I have acquired the knowledge, both by experiment and by the custom of my life;
and I have described in this chapter what is contained within, and have summarized it at the end, and have clearly shown the forms of the instruments that are used, as I have done in these two chapters before.
It is therefore necessary that we state in the prologue of this book the essence of the words and the chapters where the wise man focuses his understanding, and remains upon the truth, so that those who are tested may know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a break or dislocation or twisting or fracture occurs to anyone, you must quickly bleed the patient on either side, if nothing prevents you, such as weakness of the body, or children, or old people; or if the time is not very hot, or too cold;
and eat cold foods, that is to say cold drinks, and the flesh of birds and of roe deer, and drink no wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and do not overfill with foods that fill the veins with blood, lest you fear a hot abscess, or the spreading of matter in the limb;
if the patient returns to his initial governance that he has used.
And when the broken bone begins to recover, it is necessary to nourish the patient with foods that make for a thick nourishment, where there is viscosity, such as wheat cooked in water, and rice, and testicles, and feet, and cow's paunch, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things. For with such nourishment, the fracture heals more quickly.
And know that broken bones of the old and decrepit cannot recover or knit together well according to their nature because of the dryness of the limbs, nor those that are too tender, such as the bones of small children;
but there is no cure, unless the broken bone is rejoined with thick tendons which bind and join the limb together, until it strengthens as it was before; and do not ignore the entire work, and therefore it is necessary to nourish him with strong foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are diverse in many ways.
For the fracture of the head is different from the fracture of the arm or leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures. For there is a fracture that goes to a tear, and another in sharpening, like the tip of a writing pen.
For there is a fracture that goes to a tear, and another in sharpening, like the tip of a writing pen. And there is a fracture with a wound, and a fracture with only a small crack.
And for each type there is its own device and its own proper instrument in the restoration, according to what remembrance comes into its place;
And the fracture of the bone is recognized because the place is twisted, and it is clearly apparent by deficiency, and sounds when the hand presses it;
And when there is no twisting or sound upon touching, and the patient does not feel great pain, there is no fracture;
But there can be twisting, or a crack, or a small fracture. If so, you should not move it by hand, but apply the medicines that come afterward, and then hold it gently.
And know that the fracture that goes into a twist, and the two parts are separated, they must be put back into alignment, lest a boil come upon it;
and if a boil comes upon it, leave it for a few days until the boil subsides;
then put it back in alignment as you can gently and wisely, and know that the restoration of this one is easier than the restoration of that where there are pieces;
then hold it, as is appropriate afterward.
And if in the bone there are broken pieces, if it is split in two parts, whether it's a hand or a foot, or in your hand if it's a small limb, or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand;
and place the limb according to its natural shape, so that when the broken parts of the limb are separated, you bring back all the pieces to their places as best you can, and be careful that your work does not cause the patient harm or pain;
and well join the two ends of the bones according to the best forms.
And feel it well with your hand if it seems to you that it is not well:
if you straighten it beautifully, and do not bind it too tightly, nor press it as those who cause through their work a hot abscess and contraction in the limb do, as we have often seen.
And when the limb is in place, carefully instruct the patient not to move it, neither while awake nor while sleeping, nor turning, nor in any other way; and watch well that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels no pain, it is not in place, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain;
and watch well that the limb is so secure that it feels no pain. For when it feels no pain, it is not in place, and it must be put in such a position that it feels no pain; and be careful that it is placed straight, that no twisting comes when it is restored;
and the quality of the broken limb is according to what I have told you.
Know that broken limbs are diverse in smallness and in size and in shape.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and similar things: so it is necessary to wrap linen cloths soft and subtle; and those that are large, such as thighs and legs:
so it is necessary to wrap with a wide and hard bandage, for wide bandages encompass the entire large limb, and constrain it equally from all sides, so that there is no blemish;
then tie around light bandages, three or four turns according to the limb, and squeeze your hand a bit on the entire bandage, then go above the fracture and squeeze less, that the fracture then moves the fracture away a bit;
and soften the bandage little by little, until you take a large portion of the healthy area, then take another bandage and turn around again over the broken area;
then return to the area below the fracture, and constrain it moderately, neither too tightly nor too loosely, as we have said in the first bandage above;
then place strips of linen or cloths between the bandages, so that it is all equal, then bandage everything over the bandage, and then place your splints properly, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or an abscess, then place something that soothes the abscess, hot, and that removes the swelling, and leave it thus for a few days;
then bind over your splints, and let them be half the width of a well-researched cane, or of wood from which wedges are made, or of palm ribs, and let them be according to this figure:
but it is necessary that the splint placed over the fracture be a little thicker and wider than the others;
and be also as long as is appropriate to the limb's size or bigness; then bind over the splints just as you did to the first dressing, then tie over it a suitable thread, just as in the first dressing over the fracture; tighter on top, gradually less so;
and the thread should be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, and be of soft linen;
for if the threads are thick, like I have seen the works of fools who make their dressings with twisted linen cords, and that is a great error, for the dressing cannot be even if it is too subtle, and it is not necessary that there be less than a finger's width of space between each splint.
And if the patient is wounded by the edges of the splints after the tightening in healthy areas, then place linen or wool padding under them, so that he is not harmed.
When the wound is with a fracture, and the bone is broken, I will discuss the treatment later.
And know that it is not necessary to bind all broken limbs with splints on the first day. For when the limb is large, it is not necessary to put splints on it before five days or seven, or more according to your certainty of a coming hot abscess.
And see here the method of the ancient plasters for restoring fractures, dislocations, and twists:
and it is that you take flour that is held in the mill walls, and mix it with abundant egg, and apply this mixture, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it.  This is the common method of the plaster for restoring a fracture in various situations, and especially for women and young children, for it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another method of plaster restoring fractures, dislocations, and twists: take equal parts of abareis, ladani, enule, asafetida, gum arabic, and mugat. myrrh and aloes, equal parts of 5 measures. alechil 9 measures. and make it into powder, and mix it with the white of an egg. if the man's complexion is hot, then use this plaster, for it is of good composition, and quickly restores broken bones, and is useful for many people.
Another type of plaster that is good for sprains: take mugwort and marsh-mallow, each 10 measures. myrrh and aloes, each 9 measures; frankincense 6 measures; Armenian bole 10 measures, and grind well, and mix with water or egg white, and administer.
Another manner of plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and relieves the pain that follows, and the wear and tear of the bone, and the fracture: Take new wool, and soak it in warm oil and cooked oil, and place it over the area.
These plasters do not restore, but they are good for calming a hot abscess and properly relieving the pains.
Another manner of plaster that restores broken bones: Take dried fig leaves and leaves of earth-parsley, and grind them together, and make a plaster.
Another manner of plaster for the restoration of a broken bone and to reduce the remaining abscess. Take root of mallow, chamomile, violet flowers, and chickpea flour, of each one part;
and grind, and mix with wine, and if the limb is inflamed, mix it with moist coriander water or water, and use it.
Another manner of plaster, stronger than the first, when a hard abscess comes to the restoration of the limb. Take roots of mallow, and flaxseed, balaustine, melilot, and yarrow, and violet flowers and chamomile, of all an equal part; and grind, and mix with salt water, or fresh water, or with wine, according to the heat of the limb and its rest.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should only place on a fractured limb, to restore strength, a cerote made of wax and oil, and nothing else, and says it should be neither too soft nor too hard.
And Galen seems to say that one should put on a fractured limb, to restore it, somewhat dry and warm things, such as myrrh and aloes and frankincense and similar things, as we have said.
Another type of poultice that is good for injury and pain: Take mugwort and chopped human hair, or bird feathers, and mallow and flaxseed, and grind them, and make a poultice of them and apply it.
And then remove it a little later, and be careful that the patient feels no pain, and that the bone has not moved from its place; If not, do not remove it for several days. And if pain, itching, lack of rest, or swelling comes to the place, hurry and remove it, and take the poultice away immediately;
and take a light cloth and a damp sea sponge, and dip it in water, and apply it to the area, until the itching stops, and the pain is relieved; then let the limb rest for an hour, then put dry wool, moistened in water or rose oil, and bandage it overnight, until you are sure of a hot abscess;
and rest the inflammation of the limb, and let the pain be removed, then recommence the gentle bandage, and a little poultice, and do not bind it as tightly as before; and treat it gently until it is healed.
And if you see that the hot abscess, redness, pain, and swelling are completely gone, and you need a poultice and bandage, then start again, as you did before in the same way.
And if nothing of what we have said happens to the limb, do not unbind it until after three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes leave it for twenty days, according to what is seen, until the fracture heals, and the flesh approaches the joint;
then restrain it more than before, and increase its nourishment, as I said previously;
and if you see the place drying more than is necessary, know that nourishment cannot come to it; therefore apply warm water frequently, every third day, and loosen the bandage slightly;
By this work then, nourishment comes to the limb, and quickly corrects what the foolish physicians do, who restore the limb crookedly:
This is bad, and such work is dangerous, and I see no other way but to leave it and work correctly.
Many types of fractures exist, and diverse shapes, and the causes are different;
For there are fractures caused by the impact of a sword, and the collarbone breaks all the bone down to the surface beneath the bone, just as a hedge or a log does; and for that reason, this type of fracture is called "haichure".
Where the sword cuts the bone through from above, and this type of fracture is called "absolute";
and the wound from these two fractures is large or small.
And if there is a penetrating blow, or a fissure, or from a blow from a stone, or from falling on stone, or other similar things.
And if there is a piercing fracture, which approaches the membrane beneath the bone, or is on the bone, and this wound is either large or small.
And if there is a wound that is embedded in the bone as thin as a hair, and the fissure is small, and for that reason this fracture is called "capillary";
and if the wound is made either by hitting with a stone, or by falling, or by a similar thing, and pushes a piece of bone inwards, and the place is cracked like the blacksmiths do when they strike the cauldrons; if between the stones inside.
And this happens more to those who have moist bones, such as a child's head;
and it happens in all these types of fractures that small pieces are separated, like splinters; and I will speak about it in its place.
And we recognize all types of fractures by the pulling on them, and the examination with probes, and by the corrupted flesh that is on top.
The similar fracture is known by this: when the bone has been uncovered, and one rubs the surface, the broken black bone appears.
In the treatment of the fracture, be mindful of the patient's complications, and if you see any bad complication, such as vomiting of bile, loss of understanding, stretching, pallor, acute fever, and the eyes bursting out and turning red, and other similar symptoms in many cases, it cannot heal without a doubt.
And if you do not see a frightening complication, and you hope for recovery, then begin the treatment.
And when the injured person comes to you first, and it is in winter, it is necessary to remove the bone before the fourteenth day, if you can.
And if it is in summer, hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the flesh under the bone is corrupted, and the complications that we have mentioned arise.
And if the fracture of the bone extends to the tissue covering the brain, you must split the fractured part like this:
and you should take the head of the wounded patient, and uncover the bone in every way that you can, and over the wound's shape as gently as possible.  If blood or a festering abscess comes when uncovering the bone, help with whatever is needed, and you should fill the space with cloths moistened in rose oil; and let the wound rest until the festering abscess is calmed, and be sure of any bleeding; then begin to remove the bone, and it is done according to two methods of work:
one method is that you cut in a narrow incision in front, and this is the form:
And then you make another cut larger than the first.
And the second method is that you have various cuts, some narrow and others wide, and they are pointed, and they are of hard steel;
and in working gently, so that you do not injure the head.
And if the bone is strong and hard, you must pierce around it, before administering cuts with drills, not deep enough that they pierce beyond the bone of the head, and it should have a margin or circle above the point, which does not allow the point to pass beyond the bone;
and you must have several, so that each comes to its place in the thickness of the bone, so that you have drills for all heads;
and this is the form of the three types of drills:
The quality for piercing around the broken bone is that you place a drill on the bone, and turn with your fingers until you know that the bone is pierced;
then reposition the drill elsewhere a little later, and do so all around, then cut with the incisors the space of the bone that is between the holes, and do this more subtly than you can, and lightly, as we have said, until you pull the bone with your hand, or with any of the instruments that you have such as pliers, pincers;
and be careful not to touch the brain nor the surface.
And when you have pierced and drawn the bone, it is necessary that you remove the residue that remains of the bone with any other instrument similar to a chisel, but it must be finer and more subtle than the other chisel;
and if any small bones or scales remain, remove them gently with one of the instruments. then treat the wound with ointments and dressings as we have described.
And the other method of work is that which Galen described, which is safer; and hold it very firmly, and that is his word. First you must expose a portion of the bone, where the fracture is evident; so that when you have exposed that part, you will place the head of this wedge-shaped lancet beneath the fragment, whose shape is like this:
And do not cut from one side only, but let the blade be sharp on both sides, so that the cutting edge is towards the bone;
then strike with a small mallet on top, so that you cut the bone slightly all around, and be careful of the cloth beneath;
if it is adhering to the bone, then remove it gently, for it can be removed without harm, and without fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the cloth, and the bone is cut only on top, and there are small pieces, then you must smooth out that roughness, and remove the flakes with a fine rasp, of which you must have various sizes, to apply the most appropriate one, according to the work and the shape of the fracture.
First use larger rasps, and then finer ones, and do not stop until it is smooth.
In each of the other haircuts and subtle fractures, you must provide treatment according to its direction;
and this is something not easily learned by someone who has put their study into this art.
And if the surface is exposed, then you must take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and soak it in rose oil, and place it over the wound; then take another cloth doubled in two or three, and soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth; and do this as gently as possible, so you do not weigh down the surface, then apply another bandage on top, and do not bind it too tightly, only enough to hold the wound;
and leave it like this for one or two days, until the inflamed abscess has calmed down, then remove it, and apply medicines such as lily roots, and vetch flour, and frankincense powder, and aristolochia, and similar things;
and make powder from these things, and put it on the wound, and apply further medicines without causing pain;
and watch that the wound is always clean, that you do not leave ointment on it, nor allow pus to collect, for when pus collects on the membrane of the brain, it will rot and fester, and great harm comes to the patient;
for when one puts a biting substance on the surface, it will burn through above. Therefore, be warned, if any bad accident comes to the patient, as we have said, it is doubtful without a doubt.
And if blackness does not appear other than from the medicine that has been applied, that such a virtue may exist, then you should take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil and mix them into one bandage, and place it on the surface; then treat it with the necessary treatments until it is healed.
Know that sometimes the two parts of the nose above are broken, or one by itself, for these are two bones;
and the one below is cartilaginous, and does not break, but only bends or twists, and then heals.
And if one of the two parts is broken, you should place your little finger into the nostril, and align the fracture of the nose with your index finger, and push it from the outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape; and do this gently, and watch that the patient does not feel pain through your work.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger cannot reach the place, you should place it aligned with the head of a small, somewhat thick, rod.
And if the fracture is of two parts, do the same again, and hurry to restore it on the first day, if possible.
if not, after the seventh or tenth day, when the hot abscess has calmed down, then apply strips of linen cloth to the top of the nose, if the fracture is in one part.
Or you apply one to the other side, if the fracture is there. and let the strips be so large that they fill the holes in the nose.
And some restorers say that the strips should be soaked in butter, and changed every day. It does not seem to me that this is good, but they should be soaked in a mixture of egg white and mill powder; then leave the strip until the bone is firm, and the cartilage hardened.
And sometimes goose feathers are put in the nose in place of strips, and a soft cloth is wrapped around them, and the fracture is held, and the patient breathes through it; or do whatever you want.
And if a hot abscess comes to the nose while you are working on it, put cerote or dampened cotton in rose oil, or a little bit of diachylon.
And if a hot abscess does not come, apply a plaster externally, made of flour of sesamum, and incense powder, mixed with a bit of egg white, then put light stoppings on, and do not bind the nose;
and if the nose fracture is small, and it is broken into small pieces, remove it with instruments suitable for this, then suture the fracture, and treat with things that bind flesh, and solder, like plasters and ointments suitable for this;
and if there is no wound inside the nose, treat it with tents, and put lead strips on it until it is healed.
When the jaw is fractured from below, and there is no external wound, and the fracture is only superficial, and it is not broken into two, except for some internal bumps, it is easily recognized.
It is necessary, if the fracture is in the right part, that you put your index finger into the patient's mouth; and if the fracture is in the left jaw, put your index finger of your right hand, and gently guide the fracture inward, and hold it steady with the other hand, and adjust it evenly.
And if the jaw fracture is separated in two, it is necessary that you apply extension to both parts, until they are equal.
And if movement of the teeth occurs, or a fracture, bind them with a gold, silver, or silk thread, then place a plaster on the fractured jaw, and apply a double bandage. and place a large, well-made splint, or a piece of leather, even, long and wide according to the jaw, and tie it to the skin as tightly as you can, and instruct the patient to rest and eat light foods.
And if you see that the shape changes, untie it on the third day, and then put back in place what has changed. and apply a plaster on top, of the mill powder with abundance of egg or chickpea flour, after you have removed the plaster.
and place light wool on top of the plaster, and if the plaster dries, and the patient's condition does not change, leave it until healed. Many times he is healed in three weeks.
And if hot abscesses come, administer what we have said many times.
And if there is a fracture and wound together, observe if any piece of the bone has been removed; so subtle as to remove it with suitable instruments for this.
And if the wound is narrow, enlarge it with flame according to your need.
And when you have removed all these pieces, and none remain, suture the wound if it is large, and apply suitable plasters to it to promote the growth of flesh until it is healed.
The forceps break several times before, towards the shoulder, and the break is in three ways:
where it is broken and separated into two, and there are pieces, and it is the easiest to restore;
where there is a break with a wound.
And the work is when the break is without a wound, that you have two assistants, so that one holds the shoulder that feels the broken forceps; and the other extends the neck towards the part;
then place the break with your fingers, so that the shape is as it should be, and there is neither appearance nor ending.
And if you need to extend it further, place a round sphere of cloth, or wool, under the patient's shoulder, and make it as large as you need. and extend and lift the forceps, and hold the sphere in your hand, so that you place the break evenly, as it should be.
And if you cannot pull the head of the forceps out, because it goes deep, the patient must lie often on their back, and put a medium pillow under the shoulder, and the assistant pushes the shoulder down, until the bone of the forceps is lifted.
And then straighten the break with your fingers, and if you find it broken, you must split it open.
and gently pull the pieces apart, and if the bone cannot join through any effort, cut it with one of the incisors you have. but that you put this instrument under the forceps, to protect its surface.
and it looks like a spoon, and is not sharp, and is as wide as necessary, according to the size of the bone and the power of the work.
and has two prongs, as you see, and one is wide, and the other narrow, like the fracture of the wound you have made when you have pulled the bones apart.
and when you are sure of a hot abscess, cauterize the wound, and if the fracture is small, or you doubt a hot abscess, then fill the wound with bandages and tents, according to its quantity.
And if hot abscesses come, soak the bandages in rose oil and vinegar and wine, and apply them.
The tightening of the bone, when it is without wounds and without cuts, is that you put on the bone a plaster of mill dust and egg white, and put light wool on top, and put a splint under the arm, if you need it. Then take a very wide bandage, one palm wide, then put a double bandage over the wool, and the plaster. Then take a thin splint three fingers wide and long, and wrap it around that bandage, so that the end of the bandage hangs down. And place the splint over the fracture, and turn the bandage over the collar, and under the healthy arm, and under the affected arm. And bandage each part, and when you see that the binding holds the fracture well, and you clearly see that the splint does not move from the broken bone, then watch it every day, and when the binding loosens, then tighten it.
And make the sick person lie on their back, and put a small pillow under their arm when they sleep, to raise the shoulder. This will ease the fracture from the force by lifting the shoulder, or you bind the arm to the collar, and do not unbind it unless bad accidents occur, until 20 days.
Then resume the poultice if you see that it is needed, and apply and leave it thus, until it is restored.
And it is restored in at most 28 days, and in fewer days in some people.
Of the fracture of the shoulder
Sometimes the shoulder fractures in a wide area or in the middle, and one cannot know it is fractured except by touching it.
If you align it according to the pattern of the fracture, and reposition it according to its natural shape, in every way you can.
Then place on the area flour from the mill with plenty of egg, and light bandages, and place over it a double cloth. Then place over it a wide and thin splint, a little wider than the shoulder, and if under the splint there is hair anywhere on the shoulder, fill that hair with linen bandages so that the splint lies evenly.
And then bind it with a large, firm bandage, so that the splint does not move from its place, and check the bandage daily.
And whenever it softens, bind it again, and put the splint back in place if it is out of position, and let the patient lie on their side.
And the shoulder is restored in 20 or 25 days.
And when this number is complete, unbind it, and be sure, for it is not bone that easily gets dislodged.
And if a piece of bone protrudes, and is under the skin, cut it open and remove it, and do as we have said in dealing with a severe fracture to relieve a hot abscess.
of the fracture of the breast.
The breast is sometimes broken in the middle, but this happens rarely. But it often breaks on the outside.
And when it is broken in the middle, it sinks downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and lack of breath, and swelling, and perhaps vomits blood, and the broken bone shows through the skin, and one can feel it well.
And the restoration is that the patient often lies on their back, and puts a cushion between the shoulders, then presses the shoulders, and brings together the ribs on both sides with your hands, and skillfully adjusts in every way you can, until the shape of the bone is as it should be;
then place plasters and bandages over the delicate layer of salt, or other lightweight material, and wrap it in a cloth, and bind it over the broken bone so that it does not move; and turn the bandage around the back, and bind it securely, and check the bandage every hour, and if it loosens, then tighten it;
and if it needs to be untied, because of corrosion or itching that comes to the area, or pain or an abscess, then hurry, and untie it, and remove the plaster, and address whatever has come from the treatments;
then reapply the plaster, and tighten it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the ribs
Know that the fracture of the ribs usually occurs only in thick areas behind the back, and at the inside of the chest, and they only bend because they are flexible; and one can feel it well by examination of the sides.
And the restoration is that you put the fracture straight, as is proper. And then apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, if you need one.
And if the fracture of the ribs is inclined inward, the patient feels very great pain and stabbing, just like from a pinprick, because the bone pierces the tissue; and breathes with difficulty, and coughs and vomits a great deal of blood, and it is a serious ailment, and the ancients devoted much ingenuity to it.
And some say that it is necessary to administer foods that inflate the belly, to push the fracture outward.
We do not do this, lest a hot abscess arise, if it has not already. And if it has arisen, then treat it.
And some of you say that cupping is applied to the area, to draw out strongly, and this seems reasonable. However, there is doubt that the cupping will draw out the superfluities to the area because of the disposition of weakness.
And some of you say that one should cover the area with wool soaked in warm oil, and one places tents between the ribs to evenly wrap the affected area, then treat it with the treatment for pleurisy, with food and medicine.
And if the patient feels great pain that he cannot bear from the bone piercing the skin, and there is doubt in the patient, then it is necessary to cut open the area of the broken rib, and it is necessary to place instruments underneath to protect the surface.
and then one must cut the bone, and pull gently, and then sew the two edges of the wound, if it is large, and treat it with plasters, until it is healed.
And if hot abscesses arise, then place damp cloths in rose-colored oil, and place them on the affected area.
and treat the affected area as is appropriate for an abscess, and keep it lying often on its side, until it is healed.
and also to the spine of the back.
And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if they will recover or not, watch if you see their hands soft and swollen and lifeless, and they cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, they do not feel it.
Know that it is mortal in several conditions, and if they move and feel well when squeezed and pricked, know that the joint of the bone is saved, and that the patient will be cured, if a cure is applied.
And if similar things happen to the spine of the back, and you want to know if they will recover or not, watch if their feet are softened, and if the accidents are there as in the hands, and if there are windiness and expulsions without will on the back;
and when they are placed on their belly, there will be expulsions without will. And when they are placed on their back and they want to sit up, they cannot. Know that it is mortal: then do not labor in its cure.
And if this accident does not come to him, then the thing is less serious.
And the treatment is that if there is a hot abscess, you should apply rose oil or egg oil until it is calmed;
then put on one of the comforting and drying plasters, and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and do not sleep on the part where he feels pain until he is healed.
And if any bone is separated, it is necessary to cut above the heart; and remove the bone, then bring together the two edges of the wound, if it is large, with stitching, then treat it with a healing ointment until it is healed;
and if the bone head is broken, which is called the "head of the thigh", put your left hand's thumb on it, and position it equal to the other hand as much as possible, then put the plaster and splint on it if you need them;
then bind it, and if there is a separated bone, cut it open, remove it, and heal the wound until it is healthy.
of the fracture of the hip bone
Sometimes the hip bone is broken, and if it happens, there isn't much reduction at the head; and it breaks lengthwise, and shifts inwards, and there is pain at the site, and a prickling, and the broken part swells.
And the restoration is that you stretch your hand above, so that you are above the fracture; and know what the fracture is and its shape;
and if the fracture is only at the head, then place that fracture evenly, so that it is in a natural shape.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or shifts inwards, then have the patient lie on their stomach, until the restoration of the fracture is suitable for you. And when you have placed it evenly, then place the plaster on, then place a splint of wood or leather, and bind the fracture, so that it does not move;
and fill the space beneath the ribs, so that the splint is even. And instruct the patient to sleep on their healthy side, or on their back.
And if a hot abscess comes, do not touch it until the hot abscess has subsided, and put on what we have previously said; and then return to the restoration, and bind it as is necessary, if there is no bad accident;
of the fracture of the shoulder
The shoulder is that which is between the ribs and the head of the shoulder, and if it is broken, it should be restored according to one of the two methods:
One of which is that you take a piece of plain medium-sized wood, according to this shape:
And tie two ends to two pieces, and hang them upwards, and have the patient sit on a seat;
then place the broken arm on the wood, so that it reaches the armpit, and place a curved piece of wood in the middle, and hang it on some heavy thing, or the attendant extends it downwards;
then the attendant aligns the fracture with his hands together, so that the fracture returns as it should.
And another method is that the patient is supported on a support, and the hand is tied to the neck, then instruct two attendants, that one holds that which is above the fracture with their hands, and the other holds below with a single cord, and each stretches to their side.
And if you want the extraction to be stronger, then tighten one cord below the fracture, and one above the fracture, and each of the attendants stretches to their side.
And if the fracture is close to the head of the shoulder, you should put one cord under the armpit, and another towards the elbow, below the fracture;
and also if the fracture is towards the elbow, a light cord should be placed gently, without exertion, so that the fracture is aligned over the place, and over the elbow;
then align the fracture as it should be, and hold it tight, if no festering pus comes.
And if festering pus comes, do not tighten it for seven days, and put soaked wool in oil and rose oil, until the festering pus subsides;
then tighten it, and the manner of tightening it is that you place the plaster over the fracture, then assemble the arm over the shoulder, and place your hand on the shoulder or on the breast;
and place the bandage, and tighten it over the shoulder, and over the arm, so that the arm is in its proper position, if nothing prevents it, or if the bone is not moved.
And if you doubt that the bone will not move, use splints, and place a splint wider and stronger than the others over the fracture, and have one finger's breadth between each splint, and let each splint be so large that it extends three fingers' breadth beyond the fracture on each side;
then tighten over the splints, as I said at the beginning of the chapter on the fracture, more strongly and less as it extends.
And if you see the placement of the splints, and the tightening, as we have said, in the hour that you restore the fractured limb, and you fear a hot abscess, let it be bound until the seventh day, as we have said;
then check the bandage every three days, that no itching or swelling occurs in the area, or that the nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight. If it heals, as we have said.
And if no such accident occurs, do not loosen it until after three days or more, and let the patient sleep on their back, with their hands on their stomach;
and place a cushion of wool underneath the shoulder, and check every hour of the day or night that the shape of the fractured limb does not move or the bandages are not softened;
if it heals through the power of medicine, and give it the food we have previously mentioned, in such a way that the food is subtle at first; and as it begins to recover, let it be thicker.
And it is customary that the shoulder and leg should be recovered in forty days in all; and then it should be unbound and given baths and ointments to straighten the area.
And if the constriction is severe and swollen, it remains unbound for 10 days or 2 months.
of the broken arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two "forearm bones", one being small, and it is the one that extends to the thumb;
and the other is large, and it is the one that is underneath, towards the little finger;
perhaps only the large forearm bone is broken, or the small one, and perhaps both together.
When the small forearm bone is broken, the restoration is slight, and the healing;
and when the large one is broken, the healing is bad, and more difficult than when both are broken together.
If it is the small forearm bone that is broken alone, then it should be slightly extended gently, and put straight.
And if it is the large forearm bone, then it must be squeezed more tightly;
and extend it over a cushion, and hold the thumb of the hand higher than the others, and the little finger lower than the other fingers, and let the patient lie across himself, and the cushion in front of him higher, so the patient doesn't suffer any labor;
then let the ministers extend their arms to the part below his hand, or to a splint, and another minister to the other above.
And then let the healers put it straight, according to its best form.
And if it is broken into pieces, then put each in its place, and if there is any detached piece that pricks the heart, and you cannot restore it to its place, then cut open and remove it, as we have said before.
And if with the breakage there is a wound, I have spoken of it in a separate chapter. so take the cure.
And if, at the beginning of the restoration, hot abscesses arise, then apply a bandage of plaster made of rose oil and white wax, neither too hard nor too soft. and tie the bandage subtly over it, until the hot abscess is calmed.
And then remove the plaster, and apply the poultice of mill powder with plenty of egg, then place the splints, and let the splint of the fracture be stronger and a little wider than the others.
and know that there should be six splints on the arm in various positions: whether the fracture is in one of the bones, or in two.
and tighten more over the fracture than elsewhere, and progressively less as one moves away, as I said at the beginning of the chapter. and let the bandages over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough;
and let the bandages over the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or rough; and let the thread with which it is bound be of linen, neither too thick nor too thin, as we have said.
And examine the limb and the bandage after a few days. And if any bad accident comes to the limb, such as itching that comes to the limb, you must wash the limb with hot water, until that itching is calmed;
and leave the limb not too tightly rested.
And then recommence the binding, and if the bandage is softened and the bone separated, or something similar, then adjust it.
And if you take care that nourishment cannot reach the limb because it is too tight, you must loosen it a little, and leave it that way for a few days, until nourishment runs to it, and then tighten it.
And if none of these things that we have said comes to the sick person, do not untie it for up to twenty days.
or, otherwise, then he bends his hands to his neck, and let his neck be straight, and guard against movement and fidgeting, and sleep on his back;
and know that this fracture is restored in thirty or thirty-five days, and perhaps in twenty days, according to the combinations and the constitutions of the virtues.
of the fracture of the hand
Know that on the back of the hand and at the ends of the fingers, there are few fractures, and there are often only bends.
And when the palm of the hand is fractured or bent, the patient must sit crossed-legged, and sit straight in front of him equally;
then place his hand on a flat surface, and let the attendant extend the broken bones, and place them straight, the attendant, until they are well joined;
and apply the plaster and bandages, if no abscess forms, then place a splint according to the size of the area; and be wrapped in a linen bandage.
And if the fracture is inside around the belly of the palm, make a sphere of bandages, and instruct the patient to hold it to his fractured palm; and then bandage it with a long bandage, and let the splint be soft leather as large as the palm of the hand, and bandage it, as is necessary.
And if the fracture is on the outside, you must place a splint on top, and another one underneath in the palm, so that the hand is open and straight, then bandage it all around the hand, and tie the bandage between the fingers.
And if the fracture is in any of the fingers, if it is the thumb, put it straight, as is appropriate; and bandage it with the palm, and if you wish, put a small straight splint to raise the fracture, and do not move it;
and if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the index or one of the others, put it straight, and tie it with the healthy finger next to it; or you tie them all together in a straight line, whatever is suitable, or you put a splint on them, as with the thumb;
and take care in the restoration and arrangement of a hot abscess, and treat what comes of it, as I have said.
The bone of the thigh is often broken, and this is clearly seen when it turns forward and backward;
and the restoration is done by tying one bandage above the break, and another below. And the patient lies on their face, then each attendant stretches their bandage equally to their side;
and this is when the break is in the middle of the bone.
And if the break is close to the root of the thigh, one of the bandages should be towards the groin, and the other below the break.
And also if it is close to the knee, then the bandage should be next to the knee, and the extension should be downward;
then the medic should place the bone even with their two hands, so that it is according to its natural shape, and then put the plaster, and bandage it, if no abscess arises there.
And if there is a hot abscess, let it calm down, then return to your work and your treatment; The bandage is done in this manner.
You should wrap over the break one hard bandage doubled in two or three, and the excess remains, then turn the leg until the heel comes to the root of the hip, and put a long thread between the thigh and the leg, next to the knee underneath, and the end of the thread comes above;
then turn the bandage over the leg and over the thigh, then put over the fracture splints, and put a splint over the bone of the leg;
then fill the empty space between the leg and the thigh with soft cloths to make the constriction equal, then begin to tie tightly three or four turns over the fracture; and the higher you go over the fracture, the less you tighten it;
then tie the two ends of the thread you put between the leg and the thigh, and tie three splints that are above, then go back underneath to the end of the thread, until you come next to the foot;
and tighten it so that it does not move from its place, then leave it like this, so that there comes neither an abscess nor swelling nor other similar thing. And if it happens, then loosen it, and treat what comes, as we have said many times;
and if there are pieces of the bone that prick, it is necessary to remove them, if possible; and if one cannot, it is necessary to split the place and draw it out; and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
And sometimes the thigh is broken in such a way that splints are placed in it, as in the shoulder and in the arm;
However, in such a restoration, the patient does not limp.
And know that the thigh is restored in 10 days, or a little less or a little more, according to the diversities of the constitutions.
Know that in the joint of the knee, there is little breaking, but it often bends.
And if it breaks, it is only a crack or a hole, and happens to all wounds, and without wounds, and this one feels well.
And the restoration is that one should place the broken parts in their place, so that they are as much assembled as possible.
Then apply the plaster, and place a round splint if needed, and bind it as appropriate, then observe all the procedures that we have described for other fractures, such as a hot abscess and similar things. So apply to each injury what is necessary until it is healed.
Of the fracture of the leg.
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is called properly "tibia" and the other "fibula".
And there are all the same fractures as happen to the arm, and therefore the restoration is the same as that of the arm, and the procedures are the same. And if the two bones are broken together, the leg is twisted in all directions.
And if the smaller bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the larger bone is broken, great pain is felt, and it is clearly visible. And it turns downward.
Then administer extension, and put it straight, and tie the splints equally;
However, if the fracture is severe, and there are many pieces, the extension should be less and lighter; and bandage according to your ability.
And when you have completed your work, take two bundles of wooden splints that support the leg on either side, and are as long as the leg from the knee down;
then wrap two places with one bandage over and under, and tie it in the middle as well, and with this binding, the leg will not decline to the right or left, and thus it is well;
and some apply a splint the length of the leg, made of wood, and place the leg on it to prevent movement, and this is properly done in a fracture or where there is a wound;
and move the leg each day, to see if there is a hot abscess or other accident; if treat it until it is healed.
of the fracture of the bones of the foot
At the ankle there is no fracture, but to the bones of the foot comes sometimes fracture and to the toes sometimes, and there happens only a break in various positions.
And if it happens to the bones of the foot a fracture, and you see these bones rising above each other, then put the patient's foot on the ground, as if he were about to walk, and then put your foot on his, where the bones are raised, and then press it until they return to their place;
then put the plaster and bandages on, and put under the sole of the foot a small board two inches thick, then bind it to the foot firmly, after wrapping cloths around it, and other things you need.
And when three or four days have passed, loosen the bandage, for you will find the bones equal, whether fractured or dislocated.
And if there are any of the toes fractured, restore them, as we have said for the fingers of the hand; then put on the fractured toe a splint according to the length of the toe, and let it be a little wider, then place under the foot the board I mentioned, and bind it firmly;
and if there are two or three, or more, fractured, put on each toe a splint according to its size, wrapped in one linen bandage, and bind the board under the foot; and let it be placed on top of the head of the board to support the sole of the foot, so that it holds it well.
And you must not forget the other things I have said about other fractures, which we have already mentioned; and treat each accident as is appropriate.
of the fracture of the bone of the finger
When the bone of a woman's nature is fractured, let her sit with her legs spread, then incline her to the part of her back, and let her be held from behind;
then let the attendant fill the patient's natural part with cotton, and put in as much as it will hold;
then lift the woman up, and raise her back little by little, and then the cotton will come out, until it reaches the entrance of the natural passage, and the bone returns with the cotton;
and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton, and when she has urinated, replace it, and do so for seven days or thereabouts: thus the fracture will be restored, and if you wish, take a sheep's bladder and tie a string to the opening, and place the entire bladder into the natural passage; then blow into the string forcefully, until the bladder is inflated within; the natural passage will return to its proper form;
then fill it with cotton, and leave it like that for several days, until it is healed.
And when the bone of a man's or woman's finger is broken, restore it in the same manner as we have said for the hip bone;
and these nearby fractures are not hidden to those who apply themselves to the study and practice of it and attend to my book.
For the fracture signifies in many ways the proper path of restoration: Understand it then.
In the finger, when it is broken, take a goose's throat and place it on the finger; then wrap it in cloths, and leave it three days or so wrapped, and it will be healed quickly.
of fracture with wound
It is necessary for one who has a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the bone of the thigh or the shoulder or similar, that he be bled now, so that the bleedings we have mentioned testify to this.
And if the wound bleeds, stop the bleeding with vitriol, if you have nothing else, then begin again to restore the fracture at that same hour, or that day, if a hot abscess does not appear.
And if a hot abscess appears, leave the restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess is calmed, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day, for you would cause a bad accident.
And if the broken bone is apparent on the uncovered flesh, it is necessary that you put it in place gently with your hands, with a small extension.
And if the extensions are not suitable for putting it straight with your hands, then reset it with this iron instrument, which has seven or eight fingers in length, and the width is according to the size of the wound; and for this, the surgeon needs three or four, according to what is needed in each fracture treatment;
and let it be round and somewhat thick, so that it does not bend under compression on the limb during your work, and be pointed at the front, and thick from the middle forward, like this:
And it is called a "palanche," therefore it is necessary that the bent end be placed on the head of the visible bone; and push it once, until it returns, and be even one against the other. And if the fracture is subtle, and the instrument cannot properly grip the bone, it is necessary that you cut the head of the bone, so that the instrument has power over it.
And if you cannot return the bone, as we have said, then cut it with a suitable instrument for this, either a chisel or a saw, to your ability;
then remove what remains in the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is returned, and the patient feels great pain afterward, know that it is not in its natural place.
Do so until it is in its place, then soak a bandage in dark astringent wine, and properly if it is in a state of; and do not put any plaster or other oiled thing on the wound, lest it cause rot and corruption;
then apply splints once you have restored the bone, and leave the wound uncovered, and cut away the covering all around, according to the size of the wound, and be very careful that the wound is not constricted by the fracture;
and many times foolish surgeons have done this, and have caused either death or some corruption in the patient; and let the constriction be softer and gentler than other fractures.
And if the wound is severe or large, and you fear that bad outcomes might occur, as we have said, and you find pain at the site, then you should not apply splints; but wrap around, in place of splints, tough cloths, and bind them.
And when you see pus forming on the wound after one or two days, then remove what you have put on it completely, and apply a healing ointment for wounds, such as tetrafarmacon ointment and similar ones.
And you must unbind the limb twice a day, morning and evening, until it is healed and sound.
And the limb must be positioned in such a way that the pus runs down easily.
And if many days pass, and it still does not heal but returns to pus, know that there are small pieces of bone, so you must probe the wound with a tent, and remove all those separated pieces that cause the pain.
And if a fistula appears in the area, or another kind of corruption, then you must treat it according to what he says in his chapter previously.
And when the bone is broken and exposed on the limb, like the bone of the thigh or of the shoulder, and other similar large bones, do not remove it, for often death comes from it, but let it rot.
Perhaps it will fall away by itself after twenty or thirty days, then treat the wound if you can.
and if you cannot, leave it.
We often get many scabs after the injury, especially when it is near the joint, and a terrible sight is the appearance of the limb; and perhaps the limb cannot perform its natural functions.
Therefore, be cautious if it is fresh. if the administrator gives astringent medicines, such as aloes, incense, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, acacia, and similar others, so that you take any of these things, or all together, and mix them with astringent wine or with abundance of egg or with oil; and place them on the wound in bandages, and bind it tightly, and do not unbind it for many days;
and place them on the wound in bandages, and bind it tightly, and do not unbind it for many days; and then undo it, and start another, until the swelling is gone;
or you bind over a piece of well-made lead; for the property of lead is that it removes all swellings from the limbs;
and if the swelling has already become hard like stone, and it is necessary to remove it, then cut above it, and remove the excess visible part; or you scrape it with a tool, until it is removed, and treat it until it is healed.
of the limb that is weak after the healing
When the broken bone is restored, and afterward the limb remains weak and frail, this happens for many reasons: one of which is that it was bound too tightly, and not bound as it should have been; or because there were too many bandages, and nourishment could not reach the limb; or due to a multitude of dressings; or due to too much movement, not at the right time; or because it has little blood in its body, and is weak.
And the treatment is that you should make the patient eat, and make the body tender, so that the blood is multiplied in him; and give him a bath, and give him joy and ease;
then put poultice on the limb, so that the poultice draws a great nourishment, and often sprinkle it with warm water, so that the nourishment flows to the limb; and returns to its natural shape.
for a limb twisted after illness When the limb is twisted after restoration, and the broken bone is apparent, and the limb's shape is ugly, nevertheless, it does not entirely lose its natural function:
So do not believe the fools who say that one must break the limb anew, and many foolish people have done this in our land;
and this practice is blamed, and great harm, and perhaps death, comes from it;
However, if the knots and twists are fresh, they should be bathed with hot water, or softening herbs be boiled, such as mallow leaves, roots, and melilot, and similar things;
and make a softening poultice, such as well-made diachylon, and take the mucilage of mallow, and combine it with goose fat or sesame oil, and make a poultice on top;
or you take ripe figs, and grind them with fennel seed, and similar medicines that soften the swelling.
And sometimes the knot is removed by rubbing continuously and for a long time with damp hands. And movement should be administered to the limb every hour.
And if the distortion is old and hardened, like stone, and it needs to be removed with iron, then it must be cut to the bone, with a thin, light incision. and put dressings and care into the treatment.
Dislocation occurs when a joint moves out of its place, so it cannot move, and the limb is misshapen, and the patient feels great pain and injury.
When dislocation occurs to someone, it must be immediately put back in place without delay.
For if one delays, the area swells, and perhaps one puts it back in place with difficulty.
Therefore, it is not appropriate to move it when it is swollen. Many times this causes spasm and other pains;
However, when this happens, make the patient bleed, then leave it until the abscesses are calmed.
Then anoint the limb with warm water and oil, then gently reset it, and treat each limb as it comes back into its place.
And I have ordered the chapters on dislocations from the head down to the feet.
Often, the jaws are dislocated on both sides, and the dislocation of both is according to two types: where they are slightly removed from their places, and slightly softened; or they are entirely dislocated, and hang towards the chest, and saliva drips from the mouth that he cannot contain, nor can he close his mouth, and wraps his tongue in speech.
When the dislocation is slight, it returns through several methods.
And if it is complete and accomplished, you must reset it quickly, and delay not.
and in such a manner that the attendant holds the patient's head, and places the padded part of one hand into the root of the dislocation of the jaw in the mouth, if the dislocation is of two parts; and the other finger of the hand should be free, to bring it into alignment;
and instruct the patient to relax their jaw and move it in all directions. And the attendant brings it into alignment, until it returns to its place.
And if the repositioning is difficult, especially if it is the two jaws together, then soothe them with warm water and oil, until they are gently repositioned;
and do not delay in repositioning, as we have said.
And when they are equally repositioned, and the patient's mouth closes well without discomfort, then place damp cloths, in a cerote made from rose oil and wax, and lightly bind it with soft bandages;
and let the patient sleep on their back, and their head be supported between two pillows, so that they do not move it either to the right or to the left, nor should they make an effort to move, but take light food until the pain is removed, and the jaws are healed;
and then let them eat what they want lightly, and do not let them work to open the mouth to eat and drink, until the jaw is well healed and sound.
And if the two jaws cannot be put back in place in one hour, and are not returned to their place, then fever and habitual swelling result, and perhaps looseness of the bowels, and perhaps pure bile vomiting.
And when you see this, then know that it is a loss; and many times the one to whom this happens dies in nine days.
The fork cannot dislocate from the inside of the rib cage and the breast, and is sometimes dislocated outwards, and one can easily feel it.
And the restoration is that the patient often lies on their back, and extends their arms; and then press the place firmly with your palm, and it will return;
then put on the plaster and the bandage, and bind it tightly;
and the shoulder near the ribs cannot dislocate; if it does, and if it dislocates any time, reset it to its place, as we have said;
then put on the plaster and the bandage, and bind it tightly, and instruct the patient to rest until he is healed;
and likewise is the shoulder reset, when it is separated from its place.
of the dislocation of the shoulder
Know that the shoulder is not dislocated except in three ways:
of which one is that it dislocates towards the armpit below; and the second is towards the breast; and perhaps it dislocates upwards, and this happens rarely;
and it does not dislocate behind because of the shoulder, and does not dislocate inwards because of the nerves;
and many times it dislocates downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, for in them it quickly jumps;
in those who have enough flesh, it jumps with difficulty, and returns with difficulty.
And perhaps in some men, there is a blow or fracture, and the shoulder swells with a hot abscess, and they think that it is dislocated because of this.
You must therefore test it, until you are certain; and then begin the treatment.
And dislocation is recognized when it is lower toward the armpit, and a difference is made between the sick and healthy shoulder, and you will find a clear difference between them; and you will find a hollow at the head of the shoulder, and below the armpit when touching the head of the shoulder, as if it were a bone; and the patient cannot bring his hand to his nose, nor move in any way;
and also, if it is dislocated upwards, it is not hidden, for you find it clearly when you touch it;
and this type of dislocation is only to be reset, when it is new, or if the child is sick.
And the method is that the minister lifts the patient's hand upwards, then places his palms under the armpit, and lifts the joint upwards forcefully to its place; And the minister lifts the hand, and extends it upwards, then places it underneath; So it will quickly return.
And if it does not return as we have said within a few days, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in hot water; and the minister will apply a softening and soothing lotion, such as a decoction of mallow and fenugreek and melilot in water, and it should be administered;
Then the patient should be placed on their back, and a piece of even wool, neither too soft nor too hard, should be placed under the armpit; then the patient's heel should be placed on the wool, and the shoulder head should be lifted with strength, and the patient's arm should be pulled;
and another attendant should hold the patient's head so that it does not move down; that shoulder will return immediately, and if you wish to see how to reset it in this way:
and it is that you must have a person present who is taller than the patient; and stand straight next to the patient's side, and put his shoulder under the patient's armpit, and lift the armpit upwards, so that the patient hangs in the air; and another attendant pulls the patient's arm down towards the stomach. And if the patient is too light, then hang some heavy object with him, and the dislocation will return immediately.
And it is reset also in another manner:
and one places a long burning stick in the ground, whose head should be as wide as a pestle, and should be neither too thick nor too thin; then it is placed under the patient, but so that he has soft cloths above, and the patient is lying along the length of the stick;
then his hand is stretched downwards on the other side forcefully, and the joint will return to its place quickly;
and if it does not wish to return for all these things that we have said, then do this treatment: take a stick of two arms of great and four fingers wide, which has a head rounded for the ends to enter deep under the armpit, according to this shape:
then place soft cloths over the head of the stick, so that the stick does not injure the patient, then place it under the patient's armpit;
and extend his arm along the stick, and tie the shoulder to the stick, and the arm to the top of the hand, then place the arm on a rung of a wide ladder, and let the hand be stretched downwards, and let the body hang from the other side: the joint returns in now.
And when it is back in place, in whatever way, you must put a layer of wool under the armpit, then put the prepared plaster of powdered mill, with incense and egg white, over the entire shoulder and around it, then tighten the bandage under the armpit, and turn the bandage over the plaster, and brace the hand to his neck, and let the hand remain thus.
And it is necessary that he eat little, until the limb is strengthened, for it will heal more quickly;
and then eat more after five or seven days, and move it; and if it is firm and it is not softened, then it is healed.
And if the joint is out of place due to moisture that has come to it, or for another reason, you must administer cauteries to three punctures, as is shown in the chapter on cauteries.
And if you do all this, and it dislocates after seven days, and the joint does not stay in place, and cannot raise the arm upwards, then know that the nerve at the head of the shoulder is cut or stretched or softened; and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
Dislocations near the breast or behind are caused by pushing and stretching of the arms, and another treatment is administered.
and treat until it is healed.
And if after healing, there is stiffness in the limb and slowness in movement, then the patient should use baths many times until the stiffness is relieved and returns to its original nature.
of the dislocation of the ribs
Know that the joint of the ribs is dislocated in spurts, and returns in spurts.
and it has dislocated on all sides, especially in front and behind, and the dislocation is not mended, for it is clearly seen and felt. and dislocates according to each shape. And when you join the diseased rib with the healthy one, you can see it clearly. For the joint is twisted, and cannot bend the arm, nor touch its shoulder at all.
And you must reset it before a boil comes there, for if a boil were to form there, it would be hard to reset it.
and perhaps it cannot be reset entirely, especially when it is at the back; if it is worse than other dislocations, and causes greater pain, and perhaps death comes from it.
And the restoration, when it is such that it can be reset, is that you extend his hand with your two hands; and his arms spread out, and the hands of the one looking at it, according to the blade, around, above and below, and push the joint to his shoulders together, or to the root of his palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is at the front, it returns when he doubles his hand to his hand, and pushes from the root of the palm towards the blade that is dislocated.
And if it does not want to return to its place, then administer strong extension;
and it is that two ministers extend the arm, and hold it with two ministers, so that it does not move during the extension;
then turn the arm in each direction, after you have wrapped a double cloth long and wide;
and when the physician has joined the joint to his hand, then anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint firmly, until it returns;
and when it is in place, then put a dry plaster with a bit of egg on it, and bind it firmly, and hang the arm at the patient's neck, and leave it for some days, then unbind it.
And if the joint is firm in its place, then unbind the bandage, and leave it;
and if you see that the joint is not properly aligned, then reapply the plaster and the bandage, and leave it thus for some days, until it is firmly placed; then unbind it.
And if he feels pain after the joint has been reset, and it moves, then bathe and rub it gently, and press until it is soothed; or you put a layer of fatty mutton on the joint, then leave it one day and one night, then remove it, and put it into a bath; and when it sweats, gently rub the joint, then replace the mutton layer, and then put it into the bath; and so do it two or three times, until it is healed;
and if you wish, put warm, moist cow's hay with butter on it, and bind it on;
it will return to its proper position.
the dislocation of the hand
The joint of the hand dislocates, and the return is lighter than other joints. However, it must be returned to its place quickly, at the time it is dislocated, before the place becomes swollen, or a hot abscess forms there.
And the returning is done by placing the diseased hand on a table, and the minister extends the hand, and the minister places it straight, so that he places his palm over the appearance of the joint, and pushes it until it returns.
However, you must look to see if it is properly in place; Then the patient should place the back of their hand on a table during the extension and return. And if the dislocation is in the back of the hand, the patient places the back of their hand on the table, and the minister places their hand over that appearance of the joint.
If it returns now, it is good. If not, apply soothing poultices to the inflamed abscesses, and leave it like that without re-starting.
And if he cannot bear it, and you cannot put it back in place after several days, the joint remains twisted.
and it does no harm to the patient other than that the hand is weakened and cannot grasp anything at all. Then know that the nerve or artery is severed.
There is no other remedy except to cauterize near the wound, and perhaps that is not enough.
And when the hand is in place, put on the plaster we have described, then bandage it and leave it for five days, then unbandage it and leave it thus.
And if it cannot move well, and there is some stiffness, soak it with hot water and rub it until it is healthy.
Of the dislocation of the fingers of the hand
Sometimes the finger of the hand is dislocated on either side, sometimes on the back of the palm or on the front;
Then extend the finger, and push the dislocation with your fingers until it returns, then support the head of the finger and tilt it towards the part where it is separated;
and leave it two days, and then put it back in place that day;
and at night bind it, as we have said, and unbind it by day, and make it move, and rebind it at night;
and do this often, until it is healed, and likewise do so if it is dislocated on the front of the hand, and do as you have done previously, until it is healthy;
and likewise do so, when it is dislocated on the other side.
where dislocation of the shin from the back
When the shin from the back or from the neck is dislocated, or if there are multiple dislocations, there is no cure, for death hastens the patient.
And the signs are that the excretions leap forth involuntarily, and cannot be held, and often some limb, or both thighs, or both arms, or one, are softened.
And many times the shin moves in four directions;
that which moves to the back is called "gilbositez":
The cure is that you observe if the gilbositez came from childhood: if not, there is no cure or healing at all.
And that which comes from falling or impact or similar things, the ancient ways of cures, with great words,  have not always great benefit;
but I have shortened it according to my intention, and have formed instruments in various ways.
I say that in the gilbositez that comes to the breast/chest, there is no device nor health.
and also that which comes straight on both sides, and one cannot cure except properly that which comes to the back, as I say;
and it is that the patient be laid out on his face in a level place, and have a restraint underneath him, so that he does not injure himself;
then stick one brand into the ground at the head, and another at the feet, and tie a band under the patient's armpits, and another at the hips, and the knees, and the ankles;
and two attendants should hold the bands, one at the head and the other at the feet, between the two brands;
and let them be firmly held, the brands as we have said, and the master should place his palms firmly on the spine until it returns to its place.
And if it does not return with this treatment, then take a board three arms long, and place it under the wall, and let the patient lie on his side, and place the head of the board under the wall, then place the middle of the board on the spine; and let the master place his feet on the other end of the board, and press firmly, until it returns to its place;
and if you wish, do it with a turning device that turns in the hand. And you should place two brands at the head of the sick person, one arm's length apart, and two more towards the feet, and have a palm's width of space between each brand, above and below.
and let there be one hole in each brand, where the turning device runs, and let the brands be firmly in the ground, so that they do not move.
and between each of the two brands, let there be one turning brand, upon which the ligaments turn, and let there be two small brands of one palm's length in the two turns, for turning the device.
and then tie the ligament that is among the assels to the device near the head, and the other ligament towards the feet to the other device, and each of the assistants turns their device to the entire ligament, and the master aligns the spine as we have said.
And when it is aligned, place a desiccated poultice with plenty of egg, then the bandages, then a splint of a tablet three fingers long, which covers the area of the bump and the healthy part of the spine, then bind it with a bandage, as we have said, and the patient should use a light diet until he is healed.
And if any condition arises at the end of the healing process, it is necessary to administer softening and soothing medicines, with the splint that we have mentioned before. And sometimes a piece of lead is administered, and sometimes an appearance arises in the lower part of the back, and it is thought to be a dislocation. And it is the bone that appears, therefore one should not have any presumption. Perhaps it would bring death.
Know that at the joints of the hip and at the joints of the shoulder, only dislocations arise, and nothing else like at other joints.
And the joint of the hip is dislocated according to four parts: inward and outward, and front and back;
and more inward elsewhere, and slightly dislocated in front and back.
And the knowledge of its inward dislocation is that when the diseased leg is joined with the healthy one, it is longer, and the patient's knee is more apparent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their diseased knee to the fire; and the place beside is swollen with a hot abscess, because the head of the thigh comes there.
And the sign of that which comes to the outward is that these accidents are contrary to those before.
And the signs of that which happens in front are that they extend their leg well according to its completion; however, they do not bend the knee without pain, and if one wants to make it move, it cannot move forward, and they retain their urine, and their groin swells, and when they walk, they step on their heel.
And the signs of that which happens behind are that they cannot extend or bend their knee, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the thigh is in the place below the ribs.
The treatment of this type of dislocation is that you must observe if the dislocation is old, and it remains according to its position, then there is no cure; and no presumption should be made of it.
And in that whose dislocation is recent, and it is one of the four kinds of dislocation, hasten to turn the joint, and extend it inside and outside, and move it to the right and left; Perhaps it will return, and no other cure is needed.
And if it does not return in this way, you must prepare a strong assistant, and extend the leg firmly with two hands, or with a bandage tied above the knee; and another assistant should extend their hand above in such a way that they put their hands under their armpits, then tighten with a gentle bandage over the thigh; and another tightens the head of the bandage;
and they pull upward and downward all at once, so that the patient is lifted from the ground at once, and hangs suspended.
This method of extension is common to four similar cases, and if the dislocation is returned, as we have said, that is good.
If not, then treatment must be applied to its likeness.
When the dislocation is on the inside, you should turn the patient on their healthy side, then place the bandage on the root of the thigh, and the place beneath the armpit, then extend the bandage upward toward the armpit, and towards the shoulder;
then take other attendants, and grasp the thick part of the diseased thigh, and extend it strongly outwards: it will return to its place now;
and this type of dislocation is less severe than the others.
And if you cannot secure it in this manner that we have described, you must bind the patient's two feet together with a strong soft bandage over the two heels, and over the two knees, and the diseased leg should be extended two spans more than the other;
then be suspended from the top of a post, and be two arms' length above the ground;
then command one attendant to grasp the head of the thigh, and let another attendant hang with the patient, grasping the thigh firmly, for the joint will return quickly now.
And when the dislocation is on the outside, the patient lies down, as we have said for those with hip problems, and a bandage is applied tightly to the diseased leg and also to the foot;
then place two embers, one at the head and one at the feet, then place an ember between the patient's thighs in the middle; and have wet cloths placed around it so it does not burn the patient, then each attendant should pull towards themselves, and the one who observes should place the dislocation equally in his hand.
If it returns, it is good.
If not, place it on a table, and press it as we said in hip dislocation, and the patient should lie on his sound side.
And when the dislocation is in front, it is necessary to extend the ill leg forcefully, and according to what I have said; and the observer should take pains to be above the ill groin, then press with the other hand, and extend it downwards towards the knee.
And if the dislocation is behind, it is not necessary to extend the ill person downwards, nor to lift him up from the ground, but it is necessary that he be as if the hip were dislocated behind, as we said of the lying down on two hips; and he should lie on his face, and the ligament is extended as we said before, and one must press on the joint against the table; and it will be successful when the patient extends his legs, and they are equal; then join the thighs, and apply the plaster, and bind it with a bandage, so that the hip does not move; and rest for three or four days, then unbind it, and place the plaster over it;
and if you see that they are equal, then bind it, as before, and leave it for three days;
then unbind it, and allow it to move gently, until the limb is strengthened.
of the dislocation of the knee
The knee is dislocated in three ways: that is to say, inward and outward, and backward;
and does not dislocate forward.
And the sign is that you instruct the patient to bend his leg at the hip, and if it does not fit into his hip, know that it is dislocated;
and the restoration of all is that you make the patient sit upright, and extend his leg if he can, and put your back against his face, and place his foot on your feet;
then take his knee in your palms, and retract between your fingers, then bend the two sides of the knee firmly; and another attendant extends his foot, so that the knee returns to its place, and the sign is that he fits his leg well into his hip lightly;
and place the plaster on it, and make the leg fit into the hip, and bind them together firmly for three or four days, then unbind it;
and the patient does not exert himself to walk, until the limb is strengthened.
And if the limb is not quite right, the attendant should apply strong stretching, as we have said in the treatment of the hip, until it is healed.
of the dislocation of the heel.
The heel is sometimes displaced, and sometimes fully dislocated, both inward and outward.
And the signs are that the ankle is swollen, and extends forward to the part where it is dislocated.
The reduction is gentle, and one should gently extend it with their hands when it is only displaced.
And when it is completely dislocated, you must have the patient sit upright, and two assistants hold firmly on the leg, above the ankle.
Then pull the foot towards your right hand, and then to the left hand twice, then extend it upwards, and place the foot firmly upwards.
And do this twice, as we have said, pushing and pulling the foot.
If it returns, it is good.
If not, then restart the procedure, for it will return.
And if it cannot return thus, lay the patient on his back on the ground, and firmly place a staff between his thighs, and bind cloths around it so that it does not harm the patient.
Then let the assistants hold the thigh, and other assistants extend the foot to their hands or to a tie, which they bind to the top of the foot. Then let each assistant stretch equally, and the staff should be constantly between the patient's thighs to hold the patient while stretching.
Then let the surgeon hold the dislocation in his hands, and another assistant hold the healthy leg below, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it is in place, put the plaster and bandages on, and bind it tightly, and tie the foot to the leg, and watch the nerves that are above the ankle behind, so that the binding is not too tight.
Then leave it for two or three days, and if the bandage softens, bind it tighter.
Then unbind it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for four days. And if he walks before that time, it is not certain that it will not dislocate again.
And if boils or sores come there, you must soothe them, as we have said elsewhere, until they are healed.
of the fingers When the fingers are dislocated, they should be gently straightened without effort, and this is an easy task.
And if the dislocation is in any part of the back of the foot, you must have the patient sit on a flat surface, or, say, a table, completely upright, and place your foot on the exposed part of those joints, then press firmly on your foot until it returns to place.
And when it is aligned and nothing is visible, place a table with two supports under the sole of the foot, then hold it firmly, and leave it for three days, then release it. and let it rest until it is healed.
of wounds and dislocations together
When a wound comes with a dislocation, and one wants to restore it, often the patient dies:
So be not presumptuous in the cure, if you are not skilled in the art and have not used it long, and if you are not compassionate and merciful and slow, and not hasty.
And use at the beginning things to soothe the hot abscess, and leave the patient in God's hands if you see no hope of health; And when you see hope, then reset the limb to its place, before the hot abscess comes there;
And when the limb is in place, administer things to soothe the hot abscess, and treat the wound as is proper, with drying ointments;
And if with the dislocation there is a fracture, and small bones separated, then set them, and do what we have said in simple maladies;
And beware of entering a path of fear, according to what I have said, for this will earn you merit according to your Creator, and for the safety of your arms and body.
