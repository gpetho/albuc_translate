When tears from the eyes descend from the veins on the top of the head outward, and medical treatments do not help, and you see the patient's face redden, and he feels a throbbing in the forehead as if from chills; and his eyes are thin and moist so that the hairs of the eyelids fall out, and the eyelids are heated and scraped by the burning of the tears, then there is need for this treatment.	When lachrymation is chronic and arises from the external vessels on the cranium, nor does treatment by any kind of medical remedy have any effect, and you see the patient's features flushed, and he feels a creeping in his forehead like that of an ant, and his eyes are wasted and moist, and the roots of the lashes itch, and the eyelids are burned by the bitterness of the tears, the Ancients were compelled to treat it by this operation which they called 'treatment by the sword'.	0.79051983
And the ancients called it "contused treatment," and it involves having the patient with this disease pull back any hair on their forehead, then make three incisions on the forehead evenly along the length of the forehead; one of the incisions should be like two fingers in the middle of the forehead, running down to the nose, and the other two at the sides above the eyelids, and be careful of the incision of the arteries that are at the two sides above the eyelids; and keep your hand away from the junction of the two jawbones, and each wound should be three fingers wide across joined together;	You bid the patient shave the hair of his forehead; then you make three parallel incisions across his forehead a little apart; and let the length of each incision be two fingers' breadths; the first incision continuing the line of the nose in the middle of the forehead; and the second at a little distance from the temporal muscle; and the third incision on the other side of the forehead.	0.79322904
from the incision that is towards the temple to the second incision; and scrape all the flesh that is between the two cuts along with the tissue that is on the bone, then do the same from the middle incision to the other second, and then remove this spatula.	Beware of cutting the two arteries which are at the sides, and keep your hand away from the mandibular joint; and let there be a distance between each incision as of three fingers joined.	0.57463884
then place in the first cut the instrument that is called "knife-like," and it is very sharp on one side, and on the other side it is smooth, not sharp, and this is the form: And place the cutting side towards the flesh up to the tissue, and the smooth side towards the bone, and place it until it reaches the middle cut. And cut all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes until the incision is continuous to what appears from the tissue, and then do the same from the middle cut to the other outside; and then extract the blood evenly, and press the area for the clotted blood; then place in each cut a tent of old cotton, and place cloths soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and ensure that no hot abscess forms; and on the third day, untie the bandage, and administer a large amount of warm water, then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil, and other treatments used for wounds, until it is healed.	Have ready by you some pieces of sponge or a number of linen towels to wipe away the blood. Then introduce the double-edged scalpel shaped thus through the incision near the temple to the middle incision, and with it pare off all the skin between the two incisions with the periosteum; then do the same from the middle incision to the third one; then draw out this scalpel and introduce into the first incision another instrument which is known as 'the knife-shaped': sharp on one side, smooth and blunt on the other, thus. The sharp edge of it should be turned upward to the subcutaneous tissue and the smooth edge toward the bone; then push it on to reach the middle incision and with it cut all the vessels passing from the head down toward the eyes, without letting the incision come through the outer skin. Then do the same from the middle incision to the third.	0.8271425
