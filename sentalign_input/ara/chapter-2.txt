Chapter Two.
On Incisions, and Lancing, and Phlebotomy, and Wounds, and Similar Procedures.
Khalaf said: We have mentioned in the first chapter every disease suitable for cauterization by fire and burning medication, along with their causes, reasons, instruments, and shapes of the cauteries, and we arranged them in chapters from the head to the foot.
And I will follow in this chapter the same path so that the student may easily find what he seeks.
Before I begin this, it is necessary that you know, my sons, that this chapter contains more dangers than the first chapter on cauterization.
And for that reason, the warning in it should be stronger, because the procedures in this chapter often result in excessive bleeding—the very blood upon which life depends—whether by opening a vein, or incising a swelling, or lancing an abscess, or treating a wound, or extracting an arrow, or incising for a stone, and similar procedures, all of which are accompanied by danger and fear, and in most cases, death.
And I warn you against engaging in what is doubtful for you, for you may encounter in this profession all kinds of people with various ailments, and some of them may be weary of their illness and death may be insignificant to them.
Because of the intensity of their suffering and the length of their affliction, and their illness shows certain signs of death, while others will offer you their wealth and enrich you with it, hoping for recovery while their illness is fatal, so you should not at all assist those who come to you in this condition.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness, and do not proceed with any of this except with certain knowledge that you have of what the good outcome will be, and in all the treatment of your patients, use foreknowledge and forewarning of what the outcome of the treatment will be.
For in that, you will have help in acquiring praise, glory, renown, and gratitude. May God inspire you, my sons, with His guidance, and may He not deprive you of rightness and success, for that is in His hand; there is no god but He.
I have arranged the chapters of this section, as in the previous section on cautery, from the head to the foot, so that it may be easier for you to find what you want from it, God willing.
