Chapter Two: On Fracture When It Occurs in the Head.
The types of fractures are many, and their shapes are diverse, and the causes are distinct. Some fractures are caused by a blow from a sword, and the impact breaks the bone all the way to the membrane beneath it, like cutting into wood. This type is called 'ascial.' Or the sword cuts part of the bone and the flesh but does not go all the way through. This type of fracture is called 'levatio absoluta.'
And the wound from these two fractures can be large or small. There are also fractures caused by crushing or grinding, from a blow with a rock or a fall onto a stone, and similar causes.
And this fracture can either penetrate deeply, approaching the membrane beneath the bone, or it can be on the surface of the bone, and the wound from these two types of fractures can be large or small.
And there is a type of fracture that is hidden within the bone, as thin as a hair, and thus this type is called a 'capillary fracture.'
And there is a fracture caused by a fall or a blow with a stone and similar impacts, which causes a piece of bone to press inward, creating a concavity as happens when a bronze pot is struck and its surface is pushed inward.
This happens mostly in soft bones, like the heads of children.
All these types of fractures create fragments, like pieces separated into stars.
I will return to explain all this in its proper place.
We identify all these types of fractures by examining them and probing them with tools and observing any decayed flesh over them.
A capillary fracture is identified by cleaning and rubbing the bone with a probe, making the fracture appear black.
But in the treatment of fractures, first consider the symptoms of the patient. If you see symptoms indicating severe distress, such as vomiting bile, convulsions, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, acute fever, bulging eyes, and redness of the eyes, and similar severe symptoms, there is no doubt the patient will not recover.
If you see no severe symptoms, you can hope for recovery and start the treatment.
The reason is that if the injured person comes to you in the early stages of the injury, and it is winter, you should examine the bone by the fourteenth day according to all conditions.
If it is summer, you should hurry to remove the bone before the seventh day, before what is beneath the bone is corrupted by the membrane, and before the symptoms we mentioned occur.
If the fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain and has small fragments and abrasions, you should cut the crushed and abraded part, as I will explain to you.
You should shave the head of the injured patient, expose the bone according to the customary manner and according to the shape of the wound, and do this gently on the patient.
If, after exposing the bone, you encounter blood flow or a hot abscess, you should treat it by filling the area with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil, and let the wound rest until the abscess subsides, and ensure the blood flow is controlled; then start working around the bone and removing it.
This should be done according to one of two methods of operation.
One method is to cut the bone with a narrow chisel, and this is its shape: then use another chisel that is a little wider than the first; and this is its shape:
Then use a chisel that is wider than the second one.
You should have a number of different chisels, some wider than others; some shorter than others, with the tips of their ends sharp, made of Indian iron or steel.
Use them gently, striking the chisel in such a way that it does not shake the head or injure it.
If the bone is strong and hard, you should first drill around it before using the chisels with the augers, which are called non-penetrating augers.
They are called non-penetrating augers because they do not go through the entire thickness of the skull, as the auger has a rounded tip or margin that prevents it from sinking too deep and passing through the bone.
It is advisable to have a large number of these augers, each suited to the thickness of the respective bones, so that you have on hand the right one for each part of the skull, the tip of which should be sharp, and the length and shortness should match the thickness of that part of the skull.
This is the form of three types of augers: The quality of drilling around the fractured bone is to place the auger on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know the bone is penetrated; then move the auger to another place, and leave between each hole the amount equal to the thickness of the ray or around that.
Then cut with chisels what is between each hole in the bone, making it as thin as possible to facilitate removal, as we said, until you can extract the bone, either with your hand or with some other tool such as forceps or fine pliers prepared for this purpose.
Take care that the chisel does not touch any part of the membrane.
Then when you have drilled around the bone and it is separated from the membrane if it was attached to it, and you have extracted it, you should scrape and smooth the rough edges of the bone with another tool similar to a chisel, but it should be thicker and finer than the other chisels.
If any small bone fragments remain, remove them carefully with the tools at hand; then treat the wound with ointments and bandages as we have described.
The other method of operation is lighter, free from fear, as described by Gualia and praised greatly; his teaching is: you must first uncover the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and obvious until you have exposed that part and placed beneath it the end of this gentle and precise chisel, which has this shape:
The lenticular part is smooth and does not cut anything, while the sharp part extends on both sides longitudinally, like this; the lenticular part is placed against the membrane, with the sharp face cutting into the bone.
Then, strike the chisel gently with a small mallet until you cut through the bone easily as it is turned, ensuring the membrane is not harmed by any accident you fear, even if the healer was the most foolish and ignorant of men, or even if he was asleep.
If any part is attached to the bone in some places, separate it with the lenticular chisel tip, releasing it easily, without harm or fear.
If the fracture does not penetrate the membrane, and what is cut or removed is the bone's surface, leaving rough edges and fine fragments, then you should scrape those rough edges and remove the fragments with fine razors, for which you have prepared various sizes, so you can use the most appropriate one for each place, based on the requirements of your operation on the broken bone and its shape.
You should start with the widest razor and then use the finer one, continuing until you reach the finest and thinnest razor of all.
But in all other small fractures and subtle fractures, you should treat according to what is needed to correct them.
This is a method known to all who have studied this art.
I will stand by what we have written and shown for major fractures.
If the membrane is intact when you remove the bone, take a linen cloth according to the size of the wound, soak it in rose oil, and place it over the wound opening; then take another cloth, folded or tripled, soak it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth, doing this as gently as possible so as not to burden the membrane; then apply a wide bandage, but do not tighten it, only enough to hold the wound.
Leave it with this care for a day or two until you are sure there is no pus; then untie it and apply medicines that have drying properties, such as linseed roots and barley flour, and powder of incense and aristolochia, and similar things.
Make a powder from these medicines to sprinkle on the wound, as they are dry; generally, apply any medicine that cleanses and does not irritate.
Ensure according to your ability that the wound remains clean during treatment; do not let it become dirty with ointment or anything else; do not let any virulence accumulate in it; for when it is on the brain membrane, it corrupts it, causing rot, and leads to severe complications for the patient.
This occurs in the head membrane when the bone is cleaned from it, especially when its care is neglected, and it blackens on the surface; then consider if the patient experiences the symptoms we have mentioned, knowing it is harmful beyond doubt.
If the blackening is not due to the medicine applied on top, and it is the medicine that causes it, then you should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, soak a cloth with them, and place it on the membrane; then treat it with the appropriate healing methods until it is healed.
