of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism occurs in two ways in men: one is that between the two testicles appears something like the form of a woman's nature, where there is hair, and sometimes urine flows there.
And the other way is in women, and they have on the pubis something like a penis and two testicles.
And the treatment for the man and the woman is that you cut away all the extra flesh, and treat them like other wounds; in the second type, of men whose urine spurts from the skin of the testicles, there is no cure.
