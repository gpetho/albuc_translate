On setting a fracture of the forearm.	On the restoration of a fracture of the arm.	0.7548257
The forearm consists of two bones and is sometimes called 'the two firesticks'.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two forearm bones.	0.80524004
One of these bones is small and is in line with the thumb, the other is large; this is the one placed lower, under the smaller one.	One of which is small: it is the one that follows the thumb. And the other is large, and is located beneath the small one from the lower part.	0.8450591
The larger alone may be broken, or the smaller alone, or both broken together.	Thus, perhaps the larger bone alone breaks, or the smaller one; or perhaps they break together.	0.83674645
When the small upper bone (radius) is broken it is easy to set and its mending is rapid.	When the smaller bone is broken at the upper part, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.	0.7663489
When the lower bone (ulna) breaks it is bad and its mending is difficult.	And when the lower bone is broken, its fracture is bad, and its healing difficult.	0.7831981
Worst of all is when both bones break together.	And it is worse when both bones are broken together.	0.84546596
If the broken bone is the radius, the doctor when setting it must use light traction, gently, until he has it straight.	If, therefore, the broken bone is the smaller upper one, it is fitting for the doctor in its restoration to apply a gentle extension until it is aligned.	0.6751261
If it is the ulna that breaks, he must employ stronger traction on it.	But if the larger bone is the one that is broken, then it is necessary to apply a much stronger binding.	0.6835362
During setting and extension the hand must be disposed on a cushion, spread out with the thumb uppermost, higher than all the fingers, and the little finger downmost, while the patient sits cross-legged upon the floor. The cushion should be on a level with him so that he does not suffer discomfort.	And it is necessary to position the hand appropriately for its restoration, and extend it on a cushion. And the thumb of the hand should be elevated above all the fingers, and the joint lower than all the other fingers, or the rest; and the patient should sit upright, and the cushion should be placed in front of him, or at his level, so that the patient does not experience discomfort.	0.8153108
Then let an attendant extend the arm from below, either by hand or by means of a band, while another attendant extends it from above similarly.	Then the assistant extends the arm from below, either with his hand or with a band. And another assistant extends it from above in the same way.	0.91449267
Then the doctor may straighten the bone so as to restore it to the best possible shape.	Then the doctor aligns the bone until he restores it to the best shape possible.	0.9219688
If there be any splinters in the fracture he must do his utmost to restore each splinter to its place.	If there are splinters in the bone fracture, then try to return each fragment to its place with your skill.	0.77557963
If a detached splinter appears there and is piercing the skin and you have no hope of restoring it, cut down upon it and remove it in the manner we have mentioned earlier.	But if a separated splinter appears in it and pricks the skin, and you have no hope of restoring it, then cut above it and remove it according to the method we have previously mentioned.	0.90505093
If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, we have devoted a separate section to this, so take the treatment of it from there.	If, however, the fracture is accompanied by a wound, I have already dedicated a specific chapter to it; therefore, take the treatment for it from there.	0.85862327
If, when you begin to set the bone, an effusion occurs, smear a cloth with the wax made from oil of roses and white wax, of medium thickness, and bind the dressing on gently. When the effusion subsides, remove the wax and apply the plaster prepared from mill-dust and egg-white, then apply splints; the splint that goes on the actual fracture should be a little wider and stronger than the rest.	If, at the beginning of your restoration, a warm swelling occurs, then line a cloth with a salve made from rose oil and white wax, at a medium consistency between thick and thin, and bind the cloth gently over it until the swelling subsides; then remove the salve and place a plaster prepared from mill dust mixed with egg white. Then place the splints, and the splint that is placed over the fracture should be somewhat wider and stronger.	0.91425896
You should know that the number of splints for an arm is, as a rule, six, whether the fracture be of one bone or of both together.	And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most cases, whether the fracture is in one forearm bone or both.	0.85030866
Then bandage more tightly and strongly over the site of the fracture, and, as you wrap the bandage above and below the fracture, bind little by little more loosely according to the instruction given at the beginning of the book.	Then place your binding tighter and stronger over the site of the fracture, and somewhat more toward the upper or lower part of the fracture; or make the binding slightly looser, as previously mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.	0.8075639
The dressings wound round the fracture should be gentle and soft, not very hard, while the cord for binding is best made of linen of medium thickness as we have prescribed.	And let the cloths that are wrapped over the fracture be soft, moist cloths; they should not be hard or rough. And the thread with which it is bound should be of proper linen, medium between thin and thick, as we have described.	0.7395108
Some days later, examine the limb and the bandaging and if anything has happened that should be put right, such as pruritus in the limb, the limb should be bathed in warm water until the pruritus has subsided. Let the limb be unbandaged for one night so that he may rest, then put the bandage on again.	And examine the limb and the binding after several days. If anything occurs that requires correction, such as itching of the limb, then it is necessary to wash the limb with warm water until the itching subsides, and let the limb be unbound until it calms down, then reapply the binding.	0.8810433
If the bandaging has become loose and the bone has shifted or anything of that sort, correct it all diligently.	If the binding has already loosened, and the bone has already shifted, or similar issues arise, then correct it all with your skill, and examine it again.	0.73837566
Look also to see if nourishment is being prevented from reaching the part on account of over-bandaging, in which case you will have to loosen it a little and leave it for a few days until nourishment flows to it; then bind it up.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive binding, then you should loosen it slightly and leave it for several days until nourishment reaches it again, then rebind it.	0.74801856
But if none of those things that we have mentioned happens to the patient, it should not be loosened until after about twenty days.	If none of these issues we have mentioned occur to the patient, then it should not be loosened until after twenty days or around that time.	0.8829144
Then the patient's hand is to be suspended from his neck, the arm being level, and he should guard carefully against agitated movements, and should sleep on his back.	Then the patientâ€™s hand should be suspended from his neck. And let his neck be kept straight, and protected from agitating movements by its own strength. And have him sleep on his back.	0.89147896
You should know that this fracture of the arm mends in thirty or thirty-two days, and sometimes in twenty-eight, depending on the individual's constitution and the condition of his strength.	And know that this fracture heals in thirty or thirty-two days, and perhaps in twenty-eight days. All of this depends on the conditions of constitutions and the arrangements of strength.	0.81534266
