On the blockage of ears
Some children are born without any openings in their ears;
and this same thing happens to men by the blockage of a wound, or by flesh born inside the ear, and this blockage sometimes occurs deep in the ear, so that it cannot be seen;
and sometimes it happens that the opening is almost closed, and one sees it well.
The one that occurs deep inside, so that one cannot see it, is difficult to heal in several situations, and in the one that can be seen, you must place the patient's ear in the sunlight; 
and look inside:
if you see the blockage apparent, then open it with this spatula of which the form is here:
And it should be sharp and cutting at the front and back, entirely flat, so that it does not injure the ear;
if the blockage is from flesh born in or on the body of the ear, grasp it with fine forceps, and cut it lightly, until all that flesh is removed.
And if the blockage is deep within the ear, take a thin, light razor and warm it a little in the fire, then place it in the body of the ear.
If you feel the blockage which causes the patient difficulty hearing, pierce it lightly, and be careful not to damage the nerves of the ear; 
then place in the ear a tent according to the width of the opening, and soak it in Egyptian ointment.
Do this for several days until the wound is healed, or take a tent and soak it in rose water, and powder it with crushed vitriol;
and if you see the ear swell, you must remove the tent and replace it with another tent soaked in cerate which is made of rose oil and wax, until the swelling is gone;
then treat it until it is healed.
And if bleeding occurs, soak a sponge and cloths in cold water and place them on the ear, and use other treatments that stop the bleeding which are in the treatise on distillations.
