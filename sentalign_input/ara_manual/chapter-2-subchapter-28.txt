Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On excising excess flesh in the gums.
Often excess flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients call epulis. It should be grasped with a hook or held with forceps and cut at its base. Allow the pus or blood to flow, then apply powdered vitriol to the area.
Or [apply] one of the astringent, desiccating powders. If that flesh returns after treatment, as it often does, cut it again and cauterize it, for it will not return after cauterization.
