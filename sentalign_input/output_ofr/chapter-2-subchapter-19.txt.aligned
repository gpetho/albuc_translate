Doctors call a fistula "arissati": when you treat it with cautery and with a sharp burning medicine as I have said before, and it is not healed, then the trick is to cut open the abscess, where it has settled, and draw out all the moisture that is there, until the bone is exposed.	Doctors give the name 'fistula' to what laymen call 'a quill'. When you have treated it with the cautery or with caustic according to the instructions given previously, and it is not healed, there is no clear method of treatment except to cut down on the tumour at its ripening and let out all the humidity or pus therein, till you reach the bone.	0.7154948
And when the bone is exposed, and you see the corruption and blackness, then scrape it with the instrument whose form is shown here; and it is called "rough head," and let it be made of Indian steel with a round head, and be pointed like a file as it is in the present form:	When bone is reached and you see necrosis or blackness, scrape it with an instrument like this. It is called 'rough-head' and is made of Indian iron. Its head is round like a button but is engraved with markings finely engraved, like those of a file or a rasp.	0.7396809
And place it on the site of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little so that you know that the corruption is scraped; and do this a few times, then restore the area with drying medicines.	Place it on the site of the diseased bone and spin it between your fingers, pressing down a little with your hand, till you are sure all the diseased bone has been scraped away. Do this several times. Then let the place be dressed with stanching and styptic remedies.	0.8111803
Then place it on the bone near the tear duct, and move your hand slightly away from the eye, then turn the drill until it pierces the bone and the patient feels it because the air comes out if he holds his hand over his nose; and then restore the place with dry medicines, as I have taught you, and when the flesh grows and the place hardens, the matter goes to the nose; so it is an easier thing for the patient.	Then put it to the bone itself near the canthus; but keep your hand a little away from the eye; then with your hand rotate the drill till the bone is perforated; and the patient will have the sensation of this, since, if he holds his hands over his nose he will find the breath coming out through the hole. And then dress the place with styptic and stanching remedies as I have taught you. And when the flesh begins to grow and the place gets hard, the matter which before was coming outward will be turned into the nose; and this will be easier for the patient.	0.91486335
