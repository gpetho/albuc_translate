Of the fracture of the neck
Sometimes fractures occur to the bones of the neck, and it rarely happens that they bend; and also to the spine.
And when this happens to someone, and you want to know if they will be healed or not, watch if you see their hands softened and swollen and lifeless, and they cannot move or extend them, and when you prick them with a needle, they do not feel it. Know that this is mortal in many cases, and if they can move and feel well when squeezed and pricked, know that the joint of the bone is safe, and the patient can be cured if treated.
And if similar things happen to the spine, and you want to know if they will be healed or not, watch if the feet are softened, and if the same symptoms appear as in the hands, and if on the back there is wind and involuntary egestion; and when turned on their stomach, there is involuntary egestion. And when turned on their back and they try to sit up, they cannot. Know that this is mortal: do not work on their treatment.
And if these symptoms do not occur, the situation is lighter.
And the treatment is that you observe if there is a hot abscess, then place rose oil or egg yolk oil on the spine until it is soothed; then apply one of the comforting and drying poultices, and bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and not to sleep on the side where they feel the pain, until they are healed.
And if any bones are disjointed, then you need to cut above the heart; and remove the bone, then join the two lips of the wound if it is large, with a suture, then treat it with flesh-generating ointment, until it is healed; and if the head of the bone is broken, which is called the "head of the tail," then place your thumb of the left hand on it, and set it evenly with the other hand as much as you can, then apply the poultice and the splint if needed; then tighten it, and if there is a dislocated bone, cut above it, and remove it, and treat the wound until it is healed.
