On the treatment of a fractured sternum.	On the repair of a fracture of the breast.	0.7081175
The sternum may be fractured in its middle, and this rarely happens. As for its edges, they are most often fractured and fragmented. Among its symptoms, if its middle is fractured, it inclines downwards, and severe pain, difficulty breathing, and coughing occur.	The breast is sometimes fractured in the middle but this happens rarely; more often it is the extremities of it that are broken and comminuted. The symptoms that occur when it is broken in the middle are that he bows downwards and suffers violent pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and sometimes he vomits blood; and there is an obvious and palpable concavity in the bone.	0.83325475
And perhaps he coughs up blood, and the depression in the fractured bone becomes apparent and is not hidden from feeling. Its treatment is that the patient lies on his back, with a pillow placed between his shoulders, then his shoulders are pressed, and the ribs are brought together by hands from both sides, gently straightening it in every possible way.	Now the way to mend it is for the patient to lie on his back, and you place a pillow between his shoulders; then his shoulders are squeezed, and with your hands you press together his ribs from both sides and skilfully try to equalize them in any way you conveniently can, until the bone is reduced to its proper form.	0.71871614
And continue until the shape of the bone returns as it should be, then apply the bandage and the dressing, and place over it a splint from a thin board of willow or heather or similar in lightness, after wrapping it in a cloth. Then gently tie it over the fractured bone so that it does not move, and pass the bandage around to the back several times and tighten it firmly, then check the bandage at all times, and whenever it loosens, tighten it.	Then apply over it a plaster and a pad and place over that a splint of thin willow board or brier or similar light wood, first wrapping it in cloth; then gently bind this upon the fractured bone so that it does not slip; and carry your bandage round about the back several times, tying it firmly; then inspect it constantly, and whenever it loosens tighten it.	0.8555141
And if it becomes necessary to untie it due to itching, pain, or swelling that occurs in the area, then quickly untie it and remove the dressing and treat what has occurred with its appropriate treatment, then replace the dressing if you see fit. and stick to tightening it until it heals.	If you are compelled to loosen it on account of itching at the place, or pain or swelling, loosen it quickly and remove the plaster and correct whatever has occurred with the appropriate treatment. Then renew the plaster if you think fit, and keep it bandaged until it heals.	0.89527696
