The author of this book says: When I had completed for you, O my sons, this book, which is a part of medical science in its completeness, and had reached the utmost in its clarity and explanation, I saw fit to complete it for you with this treatise, which is a part of the practical work.
Because practical work is completely lacking in our country and in our time, so much so that its knowledge is almost extinct and its effect has ceased. And only a few outlines of it remain in the books of the ancients, which have been copied by hands and marred by mistakes and confusion, until its meanings have become obscure and its usefulness has been lost.
Therefore I saw fit to revive it and compose this treatise on it in a way that is explanatory, clear, and concise, and to include pictures of cauterizing irons and other surgical instruments, since this is a means of increasing clarity and of facilitating what is needed.
The reason why there is no skilled practitioner in our time is that the craft of medicine is lengthy, and its practitioner must beforehand practice in the science of anatomy, as described by Galen. until he understands the functions, forms, temperaments, connections, and separations of the organs, and knows the bones, nerves, muscles, their number and origins, the pulsating and non-pulsating vessels, and the locations of their origins.
Therefore Hippocrates said that physicians are many in name but few in deed, especially in the craft of surgery, and we have mentioned something of this in the introduction to this book.
For whoever is not learned in what we have mentioned concerning anatomy will inevitably fall into error, and kill people thereby, as I have often witnessed among those who have imagined themselves to be skilled in this science and have claimed it without knowledge or practice.
And that is because I saw an ignorant physician who incised a porcine tumor in a woman's neck, and severed some of the neck's arteries, so the woman bled until she fell dead before him.
And I saw another physician who proceeded to remove a stone from a man who had been stabbed in the bladder; the stone was large, so he was reckless and removed it with a piece of the bladder's substance. So the man died after about three days, and I had been summoned to remove it; and I saw from the size of the stone and the state of the patient that I could have done it.
And I saw another physician who earned his living from some of the brothel keepers of our town through medicine.
Then a black boy came to him who had a fracture in his leg near the heel, along with a wound.  The physician, in his ignorance, quickly bound the fracture over the wound with bandages and splints very tightly, and left no room for the wound to breathe.
Then he left him to his desires, and left him for days and ordered him not to untie the bandage until his leg and foot swelled and he was near death.
Then I was summoned to him, and I quickly untied the bandage, so he found relief and was freed from his pains; except that the corruption had become firmly established in the limb, and I could not prevent it.
Then the corruption continued to spread in the limb until he died.
And I saw another physician cauterize a cancerous tumor, and it ulcerated after days until the affliction of its owner became great.  That is because if a cancer is purely of black humor, then it should not be treated with iron at all.
Except it be in a limb that can be entirely excised.
Therefore, my sons, you should know that manual operations are divided into two parts: an operation accompanied by safety, and an operation accompanied by harm in most cases.
And I have warned, in every place it comes in this book, against the operation which contains danger and fear; therefore you should avoid and reject it.
Lest the ignorant find a way to speak and criticize, take for yourselves caution and circumspection, and for your patients gentleness and deliberation.
And use the best method leading to safety and a good outcome, and avoid dangerous and difficult-to-cure diseases.
And purify yourselves from that which you fear might cast doubt on your religion and your worldly life, for that is more lasting for your reputation and higher in this world and the next for your status.
For Galen said in some of his precepts: Do not treat a bad disease, lest you become bad physicians.
This chapter is divided into three sections.
The first section.
On cauterization with fire and cauterization with strong medicine, arranged sequentially from head to foot, with illustrations of the instruments and cautery irons and everything needed for the procedure.
And the second section.
On incision, puncturing, bloodletting, cupping, wounds, and the extraction of arrows and the like, all arranged sequentially with illustrations of the instruments.
And the third section.
On setting and reduction, and the treatment of dislocations and the like, arranged sequentially from head to foot, with illustrations of the instruments.
The first section.
On cauterization.
And before we mention its use, it is necessary to mention its benefits and harms, and in what temperament it is used.
And I say that the discussion of the benefits and harms of cauterization is a lengthy discussion, a precise science, and a hidden secret, and a number of wise men have spoken about it.
And they differed in it, and I have shortened their speech for fear of lengthening.
And I say that cauterization generally benefits every bad temperament that is with a substance and without a substance, except for two temperaments: the hot temperament without substance and the dry temperament without substance.
As for the dry temperament with a substance, they differed in it. Some said that cauterization is beneficial in it, and others said the opposite, that cauterization is not suitable in a disease that is from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
And it is impossible to be cured of a hot, dry disease with a hot, dry medicine. And the one who says the opposite says that cauterization with fire may benefit from a hot, dry disease that occurs in the bodies of people. Because when you add the human body and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you make the human body cold.
And I say what he says, because experience has revealed that to me many times, except that one should not imagine that matter except one who has practiced and trained in the field of cauterization to a great extent. And he has observed the difference in people's temperaments and the state of diseases in themselves, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
As for the other temperaments, there is no fear for you from them, especially the cold and moist diseases.  All the physicians have agreed on them, and they have not differed in the benefit of cauterization in them.
And know, O my sons, that among the secrets of treatment is cauterization with fire, and its advantage over cauterization with a burning drug, because fire is a simple element whose effect does not extend beyond the member that is cauterized, and it does not harm another connected member except slightly.
And cauterization with a burning drug may extend its effect to other members, and it may cause a disease in the member that is difficult to treat, and it may even kill.  Fire, because of its nobility and the excellence of its essence, does not do that except if one exceeds.
And this has become clear to us through experience, long service, attention to the craft, and understanding of the realities of the matter.
Therefore, I have dispensed with lengthy discourse.  Were it not that it is unbecoming of this book of mine, I would have presented to you concerning fire a hidden secret and the manner of its action in bodies and its expulsion of diseases, with philosophical, demonstrative speech too subtle for your understanding.
And know, O my sons, that they have differed concerning the time suitable for cauterization, and they have considered the best time to be springtime.
And I say that cauterization is suitable at any time, because the harm resulting from the time is absorbed by the benefit brought about by cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for strong, urgent, necessary pains that do not tolerate delay, because of the fear that what follows from them might be a calamity greater than the slight harm caused by the time.
And let it not occur to you, O my sons, what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that cauterization which cures a disease will never return, and they make it a guarantee.
And the matter is not as they suppose, because cauterization is only like medicine which alters the temperament and dries the humors which are the cause of the pains.
Except that cauterization is preferred to medicine in the speed of its success, the strength of its action, and the intensity of its power.
And it is possible that the disease may return after a time, according to the temperament of the patient, the strength of his disease, and the gathering of humors in his body, and his neglect of himself in acquiring them from foods and similar causes.
Except that the disease in which cauterization is used is a mild disease and in a member with few humors and moistures. Like cauterizing a tooth for pain and the like, for it is possible that that pain may not return, and this is in the least.
And as for the saying of the common people also that cauterization is the last of medicine, it is a correct saying, not to what they go to, for they believe that no treatment is beneficial by medicine or otherwise after cauterization has occurred, and the matter is otherwise.
And the meaning of cauterization being the last of medicine is only that when we use types of treatment in a disease and those medicines do not work, then we use cauterization as the last thing, and it works; from here it is said that cauterization is the last of medicine. Not in the sense that the common people and many ignorant physicians went to.
And the ancients mentioned that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron, and they said that because of the moderation of gold and the nobility of its essence, and they said that the place of cauterization does not suppurate; and this is not absolutely the case.
Because I have tried it and found that it only does that in some bodies and not others, and cauterization with it is better and more excellent than iron, as they said, except that if you heat the cautery in the fire, made of gold, you cannot determine when it is heated to the degree you want, due to the redness of the gold.
And because cold quickly affects it, and if you increase the heat, it melts in the fire and is spoiled; thus the craftsman is troubled by this. Therefore, cauterization with iron is, for us, quicker and closer to the correct practice, God willing.
And I have arranged this chapter on cauterization into sections that I have organized from head to foot, to make it easier for the student to find what he wants, God willing.
The first chapter.
On cauterizing the head, one cauterization.
This cauterization benefits from the predominance of moisture and cold on the brain, which are the cause of headache, frequent colds from the head to the eyes and ears, excessive sleep, toothache, and throat pain. And in short, for every disease that results from cold, such as paralysis, epilepsy, aphasia, and similar diseases.
The manner of this cauterization is that you first order the patient to vomit with a purgative medicine that cleanses the head for three or four nights, according to the strength, age, and habit of the patient.
Then you order him to shave his head with a razor, then you seat him before you cross-legged, having placed his hands on his chest.
Then place the base of your hand on the root of his nose between his eyes; where your middle finger reaches, mark that spot with ink.
Then heat the olive-shaped cautery, whose image is this.
Expose the bone the size of a clove or the size of a carob seed. Then lift your hand, or if it cools, repeat with the same or a different instrument. Until you see what I have described of the bone. Then take some salt, dissolve it in water, soak a cotton swab in it, apply it to the area, and leave it for three days.
Then apply a cotton swab soaked in butter and leave it there until the scab from the cautery is gone. Then treat it with the four-ingredient ointment until it heals, God willing.
And they have said that the longer a wound remains open, the more pus it discharges, and this is better and more beneficial.
Some have mentioned cauterizing the skin to the bone, holding the cautery until some of the bone thickness is burned, then removing the burned bone, and then treating it.
Others said that one should exaggerate with the cautery until it strongly affects the bone, until it falls from the bone like a carat or a small flake.  They claimed that this vents the head's vapors from that place, and leaves the wound open for a long time.
Then treat it until it heals. I do not see these two types of cautery at all except in some people and by way of risk, and in my opinion leaving it is better and safer.  For if it is done, the head weakens when its natural connection is broken, as we have witnessed in other organs.
Especially if the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cautery is safer and better in my opinion, and it is what I use.  Act accordingly, and you will be safe, God willing.
Chapter Two.
Also on cauterizing the head.
If a chronic pain occurs in the head and it persists in the patient, and poultices, gargles, snuffs, ointments, and dressings have been used, especially if a single cauterization as we described has been performed and none of this has helped, then look. If the patient's head is naturally strong and not weak, and he feels intense cold, cauterize him again a little above the previous cauterization. Then cauterize each temple of his head until the thickness of the skin is gone and the amount of bone we described is exposed. And cauterize him in the back of his head in the place known as the hatchet, and lighten your hand in this and do not expose the bone, for the patient will find this very painful, unlike the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head. I will mention this cauterization in its place.
The cautery used for the temples and the back of the head should be gentler than the cautery used for the middle of the head. This is its form.
Chapter Three.
On cauterizing non-chronic migraine.
If pain occurs in a fissure of the head along with a headache and the pain extends to the eye, then purge the patient with medicines that purify the head and use all the treatments that I mentioned in the divisions of diseases.  If that does not work, then cauterization is done in two ways. Either cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine or with iron.
As for cauterization with a burning medicine, take a single clove of garlic, peel it, and cut off its ends from both sides. Then incise the place of pain in the temple with a wide scalpel until there is a space under the skin that fits the clove.
Then insert it under the skin until it disappears, then bind it tightly with a bandage, and leave it for about fifteen hours. Then unbind it, remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, then dress it.
Apply a cotton swab soaked in butter to it until the area suppurates, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If you wish, you can do this with some of the burning medicines that I gave in the eighteenth chapter on burning medicines.
As for cauterization with iron, it is in this manner: heat the cautery, which is of this form:
It is called the nail cautery because its head is like the head of a nail, with some perforation and a small protrusion in the middle.
Then place it on the painful area and hold your hand while you rotate the iron little by little, and the amount you burn of the thickness of the skin should be about half of it. Then lift your hand so as not to burn the artery underneath and cause bleeding, then soak cotton in salt water and apply it to the area and leave it for three days. Then dress the cotton with butter, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize this migraine with the knife-like end of the cautery, and be careful not to cut the artery in this chronic migraine, especially.
Chapter Four.
Cauterizing chronic migraine.
If you treat the migraine with what we have mentioned of the aforementioned treatment and what we mentioned in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment does not work, and you see a cause that cannot be treated with what we mentioned of the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire. Then it is necessary to heat the knife-like cautery until it glows white after you have marked the painful area with a line half a fingerbreadth long or thereabouts, and you should move your hand once while pulling it so as to cut the artery and reach towards the bone.
Except that you should be cautious of touching the jaw, which moves when chewing, lest you burn the muscle or the nerve that moves it, and thus cause spasms.
And be cautious and careful about the bleeding from the artery that you cut, for there is danger in cutting it. Especially for one who is ignorant of what he does and is not a skilled and experienced person; leaving the operation is preferable.
And the treatment of bleeding that occurs from an artery will be mentioned in its proper place in the book, God willing, if you see a condition that this cautery cannot manage.
And you saw the patient's body able to withstand it, cauterize in the middle of the head as we described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, use the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on artery ligation with the double-bladed cautery, for it is a better and more effective cautery than this.
Chapter Five.
In cauterizing earaches.
If pain occurs in the ear due to cold and it is treated with laxatives and other treatments that we mentioned in the classification, and the pain does not go away, then heat the cautery which is called the point, whose image is this.
Then, after heating it, apply it with points around the entire ear, as it circles, or around both if the pain is in both. And keep the cauterization a little distance from the root of the ear, after marking the place with ink.  The cauterization should be about ten points in each ear, or thereabouts. Then treat the areas until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Six.
On cauterizing paralysis.
The paralysis treated by cauterization is that type which arises from phlegm, as I mentioned in the classification of diseases.
And one should avoid cauterizing the type which arises from dryness and spasm of the nerve.
When you have treated this type of paralysis with ointments, snuffs, and gargles, and your treatment has not been effective, then the patient should be cauterized with three cauterizations. One at the root of the ear, the second a little below his temple, and the third at the junction of the lips.
And make your cauterization on the opposite side from the diseased side, for the relaxation occurs on the side which appears healthy.
And the image of the cauterization is that you cauterize with a cauterization opposite the upper part of the ear, a little below the horn of the head, and another in the temple, and its length should be the length of the thumb.
Lower your hand with the cautery until you burn about half the thickness of the skin. This is the image of the cautery; it is a type of scalpel, the image of which has preceded, but it is a little gentler, as you see. And the knife should have a little more thickness, then treat the area with what has been mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
In cauterizing the chronic stroke.
If the stroke becomes chronic and you treat it with what we have mentioned and your treatment is not effective and the patient does not have a fever, cauterize four times. One cauterization on each temple, one cauterization in the middle of the head as we mentioned, and one cauterization at the back of the head as previously described.
The prescription for the cautery is as previously mentioned.  It may also be cauterized at the mouth of the stomach, which will be more effective, then treat it as previously mentioned.
Chapter Eight.
On cauterization for forgetfulness.
If it is caused by phlegm, the patient should first be given strong purgatives and brain-cleansing pills.
Then his whole head should be shaved and a mustard plaster, as described in the chapter on plasters, should be applied to the back of his head repeatedly, for this is a kind of cauterization.
Do this in the same order I mentioned there; if he is cured by this, well and good; otherwise, cauterize three times at the back of his head, in a row from the top of the head to the nape of the neck.
Make the distance between each cauterization the width of a finger.  Then treat the cauterization as described above. If you wish to increase [the treatment] and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle area.
If you wish to increase [the treatment], cauterize the temples, then treat him until he recovers. The cautery should be olive-shaped, as described previously.
Chapter Nine.
Cauterization for paralysis and general body relaxation.
It is necessary that you begin by purifying the head with purgatives and as we have mentioned. Then shave the patient's head, then cauterize: one cauterization in the middle of the head, one on each temple, and one at the back of the head.
And three on the vertebrae of the neck. If, in a case of general body relaxation, you need more than that, and the patient can tolerate it and the disease is strong and intractable, then cauterize with four cauterizations on the vertebrae of his back. And carry the cauterization to the point of burning most of the skin, then lift your hand, then treat him as previously mentioned until he recovers, God willing. And let the cautery be olive-shaped.
Chapter Ten.
Cauterization for Epilepsy.
Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is caused by phlegm should be cauterized.  It is necessary to first purify his brain with strong purgatives and with the other treatments we mentioned in the classification, if the patient is an adult and able to tolerate medication.
But if he is a child who cannot tolerate medication, then let him use gargles and masticatories that purify the brain for many days beforehand, along with improving his diet.
Then his head should be shaved, and then one cauterization should be performed in the middle of the head, as previously described, and another cauterization at the back of the head. And one cauterization on each temple; if the patient is strong and able to tolerate it, then perform the cauterizations described for the patient with paralysis and relaxation of the body, on the vertebrae of the neck and vertebrae of the back. The cautery should be olive-shaped, as previously described.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery gentle in this manner.
Chapter Eleven.
On cauterizing melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is corrupt humors and thick phlegm, then perform the cauterizations we mentioned for the paralytic.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess inclined towards black bile and the patient's body is moist, then purge what cleanses his brain as was previously explained in the classification.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tight cake of linen like a circle, then place it in the middle of his head, and the patient sits cross-legged holding it from each side, then take one pound of old sheep fat.
Then heat it over a fire to a moderate temperature, as much as the finger can tolerate when inserted, then pour it into the middle of his head in the circle and leave it until it cools. Do this for the patient once a week along with all other good treatment until he is healed, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize it with many small punctures without holding your hand to the cautery iron, but rather by fumigation, for this type of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply a cotton swab soaked in butter or chicken fat.
Chapter Twelve.
On cauterizing the flow of water in the eye.
If the onset of the flow of water in the eye becomes apparent to you through the signs mentioned in the classification, then act quickly and purge the patient of what pollutes his head, protect him from all moisture, and sweat him in the bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave his head and cauterize him in the middle of the head, then cauterize him twice on the temples if the onset of the flow of water is in both eyes, or on one side if it is in one eye.
Then cut with the cautery all the veins and arteries which are under the skin, and let the cauterizations be lengthwise across the temples, and guard against the bleeding of blood.
If you see something of it, cut it on the spot with any treatment possible to you, and we will come to the wisdom in cauterizing and cutting arteries and guarding against bleeding.
And he may be cauterized in the nape of the neck under the two bones with two intense cauterizations.
Chapter Thirteen.
In cauterizing chronic tears.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and persistent, and they are from the veins and arteries on the surface of the head, from outside the head, and you are certain that this is from cold, thick, phlegmatic superfluities, then cauterize it with the cautery which I described in its place at the beginning of the descending water. A cauterization in the middle of the head and two cauterizations on the temples and two cauterizations in the nape of the neck under the two bones. And if you need to increase [the cauterizations], then cauterize one cauterization on each side of the corner of the eye at the edge of the eyebrow with a small cautery iron.
Chapter Fourteen.
In cauterizing the foul smell of the nose.
If you treat it with what we mentioned in the section and the treatment does not work, then act quickly and purge the patient with colocynth for three nights, then shave his head and cauterize the middle with the olive-shaped cautery iron. Then cauterize with the nail-shaped cautery iron, two cauterizations above the eyebrows, a little under the hair, and be careful of the artery, do not cut it. And this is the image of the nail-shaped [cautery iron].
Chapter Fifteen.
In cauterizing the relaxation of the eyelid.
If the eyelid relaxes due to illness or moisture, then cauterize the eyelid with one cauterization using this crescent-shaped cautery iron.
And if you wish, then cauterize a little above the eyebrows, two cauterizations on each side, and keep a distance from the temples, and let the length of each cauterization be along the length of the eyebrow.
And do not exaggerate your hand with the cautery, but only to the extent that one-third of the skin is burned, and the shape of the cautery iron is like this.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If its margins turn inward so that the eye is inverted, then cauterization is of two types. Either cauterization with fire or cauterization with a cauterizing drug. As for cauterization with fire, you should order the patient beforehand to leave his eyelashes alone, if he is one who plucks them, until they grow long and even.
If you cauterize it while they are growing, then bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they grow. Then when they have grown and become even, place the patient’s head in your lap, and then mark the eyelid with ink in the shape of an ivy leaf.
The beginning of the mark should be near the margins. Then place under the eyelid cotton soaked in egg white or in the saliva of a lizard. Then heat a cautery iron; this is its shape.
Then cauterize according to the mark you made, little by little, in many times, until the surface of the skin, which is in the shape of the ivy leaf, is entirely burned, especially its surface. A sign of the correctness of your work is that you see the eyelid curled and the hair raised from the flesh of the eye.
Then lift your hand and leave it for three days.  Then apply cotton soaked in butter to it until the eschar separates. Then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If some of the hair returns after a time and the eyelid relaxes,
repeat the cauterization on that place as you did before. If the hair is in the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and does not prick the eye. As for cauterization with a caustic medicine, you should instruct the patient to let the margins grow until they are long and even.
Then make from paper the shape of an ivy leaf. Then take of the known soap and of unslaked lime, of each one a drachm or so, and grind them together very finely. Do this quickly lest it dry. Then spread some of it on the paper you made in the shape of an ivy leaf and place it on one or both eyelids. Place cotton soaked in egg white under the eye, and the patient's head in your lap.
Place your index finger on top of the medicine and hold it down gently, moving it whenever the patient feels the sting of the medicine, for he will feel a burning sensation. As long as he feels the burning, leave the medicine and move it with your finger. When the burning subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And look; if you see that the eyelid has risen as it rises when cauterized with fire or by cutting, then leave it. Otherwise, apply more of the medicine to the place where the medicine did not take effect and did not blacken, until you complete your work and the eyelid is cauterized. Then apply cotton with butter to it until the burning subsides.
Then treat it with palm-tree ointment or the like until it heals. When working, you should be extremely careful that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye. If the eyelid relaxes after a few days and there is a fear of something in the eye, [proceed as follows].
Then reapply the medicine to that relaxed part of the eyelid in the same way as you did initially, then treat it until it heals.  This is the image of an ivy leaf.
Know that people's eyes differ in size, so adjust your cauterization accordingly. The correct method is not hidden from anyone experienced in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cauterizing the polyp that appears in the corner of the eye.
If you treat the polyp with what we mentioned in the classification of diseases and your treatment is ineffective, then it should be cauterized in this manner.
Order the patient to place his head in your lap, and have an attendant hold his head firmly so that he does not move or shake his head.
Then place a cotton ball moistened with egg white or the saliva of a frog on his eyes, then heat the cautery iron, which is of this form.
It should be hollow, in the shape of a tube, like a bird's quill, at one end, which is the cauterizing end.  If you wish, it can be perforated at the other end, or if you wish, it can be solid like an awl, although the hollow one is better for your work, God willing.
Then, squeeze the polyp if it is open and remove its contents and dry it, or if it is not open, open it and remove its pus. Then immediately apply the very hot cautery iron, holding it with your hand until it reaches the bone.
And move your hand slightly away from the eye towards the nose during cauterization, lest your hand waver or the patient become anxious and the cautery iron fall into the conjunctiva and damage it. If you reach the bone with the first cauterization, well and good; otherwise, repeat the cauterization a second time if necessary.
Leave it for three days, then apply a cotton ball with butter to it and treat it with drying ointment until it heals. If forty days pass and it does not heal, then apply a sharp, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and remove it as will be mentioned in its chapter, God willing.
Another method of cauterizing a polyp, mentioned by some of the ancients, is to approach the location of the polyp, incise it, and then place a thin cone in the incision itself.  This is its image.
Then pour into it an amount equal to the weight of a dirham of molten lead, and hold the cone firmly and securely; and the patient must not move at all, lest the molten lead flow into his eye. It is advisable to place cotton soaked in egg white or water on the patient's eye.
For the lead will burn the site of the polyp and heal it wonderfully. If the polyp heals with the cauterization and treatment that we have mentioned, well and good; otherwise, it is necessary to use nasal perforation and return the polyp to the nasal passage, as will be described in its more appropriate place.
Chapter Eighteen.
On cauterizing a cleft lip.
A cleft often occurs in the lip, called a harelip, especially in the lips of children; for it often occurs. If you treat this cleft with what we have mentioned in the classification and the treatment is not effective, then heat a small, knife-like cautery of this shape.
Its cavity should be as thin as a knife. Then apply it, hot and quickly, to the cleft itself, until the cauterization reaches the depth of the cleft. Then treat it with the qiروطى until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
On cauterizing fistulas occurring in the mouth.
If a swelling appears at the root of the gums, or in the palate, or at the roots of the molars, then it suppurates and bursts, and from the flow of pus a fistula results, and you treat it but the treatment is not effective, then you should heat a cautery to the extent that it fits into the fistula.
Then insert it, hot, into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand until the heated iron reaches its depth and end. Do this once or twice, then treat it afterwards with the treatment we have mentioned, until it heals, God willing.
If the discharge ceases and it heals, well and good; otherwise, it is necessary to examine the place and remove the decayed bone, according to what will come in its chapter, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On the loosening of the molars and gums.
If the gums are loosened by moisture and the molars are mobile, and you have treated them with medication without success, then place the patient's head in your lap, and then heat the cautery iron, whose form will be shown later, after you have placed the tube on the tooth.
And insert the hot cautery iron quickly, and hold your hand for a little while until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth, then raise your hand, then return the cautery iron repeatedly, as much as you want, then the patient fills his mouth with salt water.
And he holds it for an hour and then spits it out; for the mobile tooth will become firm, and the loosened gum will tighten, and the corrupt moisture will dry.
Chapter twenty-one.
In cauterizing toothache.
If the toothache is from cold, or if there are worms in it, and treatment with medication has not been effective, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with butter, or cauterization with fire.
As for cauterization with butter, you take cow's butter and boil it in an iron spoon or in a shell, then you take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe, then you dip it in the boiled butter and quickly place it on the aching tooth and hold it until it cools.
Then repeat it several times until the strength of the heat reaches the root of the tooth.  And if you wish, you may dip wool or cotton in cold butter and place it on the aching tooth, and place a heated iron on top of it until the heat reaches the bottom of the tooth.
As for cauterization with fire, you take a brass tube or an iron tube, and it should have some thickness in its body so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth. Then heat the cautery iron, the image of which is shown, and place it on the tooth itself, and hold your hand until the cautery iron cools. Do this several times.
Then the pain will go away, either that same day or the next day. After the cauterization, the patient should fill his mouth with good butter and hold it for an hour, then spit it out.  This is the image of the cautery iron.
Cauterize with whichever end you wish, and according to what is possible. This is the image of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On cauterizing fistulas.
If the fistulas are due to phlegm and cold humors and do not yield to ripening by medications, and you desire a quick ripening, then heat the hollow cautery iron, the image of which is this, which is perforated at both ends.
So that the smoke exits at cauterization from the other end. Place it, protected, on the same swelling once and twice if you need to do so until you reach the depth of the swelling. If the swelling is small, then make the cautery iron to the size of the swelling.
Then leave it for three days and apply cotton soaked in butter to it until what was burned by the fire is gone. Then treat it with ointment and tents until it heals, God willing.
Chapter twenty-three.
On cauterization for hoarseness and shortness of breath.
If humors prevail over the windpipe, especially if that is with coldness of temperament, then it is necessary that the patient first be purged with laxative medicines. Then cauterize a cautery in the hollow of the throat at the root of the gullet in the lower place.
Beware of reaching the gullet with the cautery, and do not burn more than half of the skin. Then cauterize another cautery at the joint of the neck at the end of its last vertebra, and let the cautery be nail-shaped in the manner previously described.
Then treat him with what has been mentioned until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter twenty-four.
On cauterizing lung disease and cough.
If the cough and lung disease are due to cold humors, and the patient has no fever or consumption, and the disease is chronic, then cauterize two cauteries above the clavicles in the low, soft, empty places, and another cautery in the middle of the chest between the breasts.
And let the cautery be nail-shaped, in the manner previously described. And if you wish, let your cauterization be by puncturing with the cautery called the “point,” the image of which has been previously shown in puncturing earache; and let the points number from thirty points or thereabouts.
Then treat him with what has been previously mentioned until he recovers.  You may also make a cautery with three branches in this manner, and it hastens cauterization because you cauterize three cauteries at once with it. This is the image of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On cauterizing the armpit.
If the head of the humerus is dislocated because of slippery humors, or if it does not remain in place when it is reduced from its dislocation so that it becomes habitually dislocated and then dislocates at the slightest movement it is subjected to, as we have witnessed, then it is necessary to reduce the joint first. Then the patient lies on his back or on his sound side, and then the skin inside the armpit is raised upwards with the fingers of your left hand if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then heat the cautery with two points, which is of this form.
Then cauterize with it the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and the shape of the cauterization is four cauterizations. It may be cauterized with a cautery with three points, so its shape is then six cauterizations, and the points should be on the level of a rosebud.
And this is the image of the cautery with three points.
And this number may be increased by one, so that the cauterizations are eight. Then apply to the cauterizations crushed balls with salt, and then the patient should be kept quiet and not move the limb for a while until it is strong. And if the dislocation is upwards, which is rarely the case,
cauterize above the shoulder with one good, nail-like cauterization, or many cauterizations as punctures; for the joint will strengthen and the moisture will leave and the patient will heal.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
In cauterizing the stomach.
If cold and excessive moisture occur in the stomach, to the extent that it disrupts its temperament and  catarrhs to it increase, and it is treated with various treatments but to no avail, then the patient should lie on his back, extending his legs and arms, then cauterize with three cauterizations. One cauterization below the clavicle, the size of a finger, with a nail-like cautery, and two cauterizations lower down on either side of the first cauterization, so that the shape of the cauterizations is triangular, and farther apart so that they do not join if they suppurate, and the depth of the cauterization should be two-thirds the thickness of the skin, and this should be the shape of the cauterizations.
In this manner and to this extent, no more.
And if you wish, cauterize it with one large cauterization in the middle of the stomach, in this manner.
And the cautery with which you cauterize this single cauterization should be circular, in this manner.
And you may cauterize the stomach by puncturing it for someone who is afraid of this cauterization; and that is that you mark points on the stomach to the extent that you desire with ink, then cauterize them with a punctate cautery, then treat it with the treatment which was described until it heals.
Chapter twenty-seven.
In the cold cauterization of the liver.
If there appears from the liver a pain due to coldness and dampness, or due to a subtle wind, until it has departed from its natural temperament an excessive departure, and the patient is treated with what we mentioned in the division, and that does not work. Then it is necessary that the patient lie on his back, and three cauterizations are marked with ink in this shape and this precise amount on the liver, below the ribs where the elbow of a person ends.
And after each cauterization will be a cauterization of the thickness of a finger, and the cauterization will be along the body straight, and do not press down gently with the cautery iron.
And let the amount you burn of the thickness of the skin be half of it, no more. And let the patient be standing on his feet; and if he is not standing, let him be lying down with his legs extended and his arms raised. And this is the image of the cautery iron.
And you may be able to cauterize these cauterizations with the knife-cautery if you have gentleness and skill in the craft, and be cautious lest you exceed in the cauterization and burn all the skin and burn the abdomen and reach the intestines, for the skin there is thin; so know this.
Chapter twenty-eight.
In cauterizing a swelling of the liver.
If an abscess appears in the liver and you wish to know if that swelling is in the flesh of the liver or in its peritoneum, then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient will find heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the peritoneum of the liver, there will be severe sharpness with the pain, and you see that physicians have been unable to treat it, then the patient should lie on his back, and then mark the swollen area with ink.
Then heat the cautery in the fire; it is the cautery that resembles a needle, and this is its image. And cauterize it with one cauterization until you burn all the skin and the cauterization reaches the peritoneum until all the matter comes out, then treat it with the treatment of abscesses until it heals.
And this type of cauterization should not be used except by one whose experience in the art of medicine is long and who has treated these diseases many times through experience; then he may undertake such work, but leaving it is better in my opinion.
Chapter twenty-nine.
On cauterizing the fistula.
The ancients mentioned cauterization with rhizomes of rhubarb for a cold fistula in this manner: that you take one long, dry rhizome of rhubarb, the longest you can find, and it should be as thick as a finger, then dip it in oil and heat it in the fire. Then make one cauterization between the connection of the clavicle and the neck, and two small cauterizations a little below the jugular veins, slightly inclined toward the side under the chin, and two large cauterizations above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
And two cauterizations also between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly inclined backward, and another cauterization in the middle of the chest and another above the stomach, and three cauterizations on the back: one between the shoulder blades and two on the sides of the spine, lower than the cauterization which is between the shoulder blades.
And you should not deepen your hand with the cautery, but it should be on the surface of the skin superficially. Some of the ancients mentioned that some people used an iron cautery like a spatula; they would heat it and insert it between the ribs until it reached the tumor itself.
And the pus is evacuated as we mentioned in liver tumors.  In this method of cauterization there is danger; either the patient dies immediately or a fistula forms at the site which will not heal.
Chapter Thirty.
On cauterizing the spleen.
If you treat the spleen disease with what we mentioned in the division and your treatment is not effective, then cauterization is done in three ways, all correct. One is to cauterize it three or four times in a row along the length of the spleen.
In the shape of the liver cauterizations whose form we have described, and between each cauterization and the next is the width of a finger or a little more.  The type of cautery is the same as we mentioned in cauterizing the liver.  Do not deepen your hand with the cautery, and the patient's position is lying on his back.
The other way is in the flank, and you raise the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left flank ends, and you raise the skin opposite the spleen where the patient's left flank ends, and your raising of the skin should be across the body so that the cauterizations are along the body.
Then you insert the two cautery irons, very carefully protected, until you pierce the skin on the other side, then you remove the cautery iron, and the cauterizations will be four. And if you wish, you can cauterize with the other cautery iron with three points.
Then you treat the place of cauterization after you leave it to discharge pus for many days; this is more effective than all the treatments mentioned previously.
Chapter Thirty-One.
On cauterizing dropsy.
Cauterization is only beneficial in ascites specifically, if you treat the patient with dropsy using the types of treatment we mentioned in the classification, and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize four cauterizations around the navel and one cauterization on the stomach.
Another cauterization on the liver, a cauterization on the spleen, and two cauterizations on his back between the vertebrae, one opposite his chest and another opposite his stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be approximately the thickness of the skin. Then you leave the cauterization open to discharge pus for a long time.
And do not deprive the patient of treatment after cauterization with what is necessary to combine the two meanings for him, so that healing will hasten to him. The shape of the cauterizing iron with which the back is cauterized is nail-shaped, as its image has preceded. That with which the abdomen is cauterized is olive-shaped.
Chapter thirty-two.
On cauterizing the feet and legs.
If they swell in dropsy and fill with yellow water, then it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in the hollow between the little finger and the ring finger.
And place your hand with the cauterizing iron and do not bend it, then raise your hand and do not return it at all, for the yellow water will exude, and the cauterizing iron is of this shape.
Then cauterize on the legs two cauterizations on each leg, and the cauterization is to be with the sharp end of the cauterizing iron, and the cauterization is to be along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another below it towards the middle of the leg, and on each thigh two cauterizations.
And leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time, so that the water may exude from it, then treat it with all that we have mentioned.
Chapter thirty-three.
On cauterizing diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is from cold and dampness, so that it weakens the retaining and digestive powers in the stomach and intestines, and this has been treated with various treatments and it has not healed, and you see the patient able to withstand cauterization and strong, then cauterize him with a large cauterization on his stomach. As was previously mentioned in cauterizing the stomach with the circular cautery iron, and four cauterizations around the navel gently with the mild nail-shaped cautery iron, and one or two cauterizations on the cotton above the coccyx.
If you see that the dampness is abundant and the patient is able to withstand it, then cauterize him on the pubis and cauterize him on each loin, and perhaps you can add two small cauterizations on the stomach near the large one; for this is a successful treatment whose benefit is not missed, God willing.
Chapter thirty-four.
On cauterizing the hemorrhoids of the anus.
If there are chronic hemorrhoids, many or one, in the anus, and they are of thick, cold humors or putrid moisture, and they have been treated with what we mentioned in the classification but the treatment has not been effective, then cauterize the patient with three cauterizations on the lower part of the sacrum, a little below the coccyx, in a triangular shape.
And a cauterization below the navel by the length of two fingers; and if you estimate that his stomach has become cold and his food does not digest, and you see his face swollen, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cauterization as mentioned before, and a cauterization on his liver. And another on his spleen with a nail-shaped cautery, and leave the cautery open for a while, then treat him until he recovers, God willing.
Chapter thirty-five.
On cauterizing warts.
After cutting it, if the wart is cut, heat the cautery which resembles a needle, then insert it hot into the same cut wart and persevere until the cautery reaches the mouth of the vein from which the blood flows; do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as we have described, then treat them with suitable ointments until they heal. And if you cauterize it with a large cautery on cotton, it will be more effective.
Chapter thirty-six.
On cauterizing the fistula which is in the anus and its surroundings.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and the procedure we described in its place and is afraid of it, then perhaps he will heal with cauterization. If a fistula occurs and pus and corrupt humors flow from it for a long time, then the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then know its depth with the probe, then heat the cautery that resembles a needle, then insert it hot into the fistula itself, along the course of the fistula and the extent to which the probe entered, and repeat the cauterization until all those corrupt bodies are burned, once or twice or three times, according to your need.
And be careful not to burn a nerve if there is one, or a large vein, and if the fistula leads to the substance of the bladder or to the substance of the intestine.
Therefore, be careful of all these places. You only do this if the fistula is in a fleshy place and you estimate that it is not penetrating. Then treat the place until it heals. If the place closes and the materials cease from it and it remains like that for a time, then know that it has completely healed.
And if the materials do not cease from it, then know that it is penetrating, or that there is a decayed bone in its depth, or something similar, which will be mentioned in its place.
Chapter thirty-seven.
On cauterizing the kidneys.
If pain occurs in the kidneys from cold or a strong wind, and the patient's sexual function is diminished because of that, then it is necessary to cauterize it on the loins, over the kidneys themselves. Cauterize each kidney with the nail-shaped cautery that was previously mentioned.  And perhaps cauterize a third time in the same place, so that there are three cauterizations in a row, which will be more effective.
Chapter thirty-eight.
On cauterizing the bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder from cold and dampness, so that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize it with one cauterization below the navel, on the bladder where the pubic hair begins, and one cauterization to the right of the navel and another to the left.
The distance after cauterization on each side should be the length of a thumb joint. And cauterize one cauterization in the lower back, or two if necessary. The cautery should be nail-shaped, as previously mentioned.
Chapter thirty-nine.
On cauterizing the uterus.
If a substance from cold and dampness occurs in the uterus, and because of that it is prevented from conception and its temperament is corrupted and its functions are impaired, or pain occurs in it upon the arrival of menses, then three cauterizations should be made around the navel as we mentioned in cauterizing the bladder. One cauterization on the cotton in the lower back, or two, and the cautery should be nail-shaped.
Chapter forty.
On cauterizing a dislocated hip.
Erroneous moist substances may settle in the hip joint, becoming the cause of its dislocation. Its sign is that the leg is longer than the other when they are measured against each other, and you find emptiness in the place of the dislocation.  Then it is necessary to cauterize the patient on the hip joint itself with a semi-circular cautery.
After you have drawn with ink around the joint as it rotates, so that the joint itself falls in the middle of the circle, and the cautery whose image is presented in cauterizing the stomach. If you do not have this cautery, then cauterize with three cauterizations using the large olive-shaped cautery.
Make the cauterization deep enough to reach the entire thickness of the skin, then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter forty-one.
On cauterizing sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint, and the cause is cold and dampness, and you have treated the patient with what we mentioned in the section, and the treatment has not been effective, and this has lasted for some time, then it is necessary to evacuate the thick humors from the patient with hellebore or prickly pear seed, or something similar.
Then shave it and apply the cautery in two ways: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire. Cauterization with fire can be done in many ways; one of them is to cauterize the hip joint itself with three triangular cauterizations in this manner.
Make them of a suitable depth, and the distance between each cauterization should be the width of a finger. The cautery iron should be olive-shaped.  A cauterization may also be made in the middle, on the head of the hip itself, making four cauterizations. Or, if you wish, cauterize it in a circle, as previously mentioned in the cauterization for hip dislocation, with a single cauterization.
So that the circle encompasses the entire hip and burns through the entire thickness of the skin. This is the method of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If it extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize two places on the thigh where the patient indicates pain, and one cauterization above the heel, four fingers towards the lateral side, slightly. The cautery iron should be knife-shaped, and the depth of the cauterization should be only the thickness of the skin.
If he indicates that the pain extends towards the toes, cauterize where he indicates with a pointed cautery iron, three or four times, or more if necessary. If he indicates pain below the knee towards the leg, cauterize there with one knife-shaped cauterization.
And be careful in all your cauterizations not to burn a nerve or a large artery, lest you cause the patient a serious or lasting harm.
And I have witnessed one and another who was cauterized above the heel, and the cauterization was excessive, so the leg became gangrenous until the gangrene reached the foot and perforated it entirely, and the entire leg was corrupted. Then diarrhea and death followed. If the pain is in both sides, cauterize both in the same manner.
Some learned physicians have mentioned concerning the cauterization of the hip a cauterization of this type:  A cup-like instrument is made of iron, its diameter being half a span, and its mouth the thickness of a date pit, or slightly less; and within this cup is another cup, and a third cup.
The distance between each cup is the width of a thumb joint; the cups are open on both sides; their height is about a joint or two joints; and a handle of firmly attached iron is made for them.  This is its form.
Then it is heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, then it is placed on the hip, the patient leaning on the sound side. Three round cauterizations are performed at once. Then he is left for three days, and the wound is dressed with butter, leaving the wound open for some days.
Many then treat it with ointment until it heals. The author of this book says: We rarely used this type of cauterization because of its ugliness and the horror of its appearance, and because of the scarcity of those who can endure it; however, it is among the best cauterizations for those who endure it and have the affected area treated with it.
As for cauterization with burning drugs, it is done by making two cup-like things, similar to the rings through which the hinges of a door pass, from copper or iron.
Their rims are about two finger joints high, and the distance between them is the width of a finger; they are open at the bottom and open at the top, and they are held together in this manner.
Then you lower it onto the hip joint, with the patient lying on his sound side, and you firmly hold your hand. Then you pour between the circles some caustic water, which has been warmed a little over the fire. You hold it for about an hour, and the patient endures its stinging and burning, for he feels a burning like fire.
Until the stinging subsides, then you lift the instrument with your hand and wipe the caustic water from the entire hip with fresh water. Then you leave it for three days and apply butter to it until the blackness of the burn disappears. You then leave it for some days, so that pus may drain from it; for that is more effective.
Then you treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, you make a mold for it which holds the water, in the same way as you did for the hip.  This is the description of the caustic water, which I have already described in the chapter on the preparation of drugs.
Take one part of potash and one part of unslaked lime, crush them, and put them in a new pot which has a small hole pierced in its bottom, large enough for a probe to enter.  Place another glazed pot beneath the bottom of the pot.
Pour fresh water over the potash and lime to cover them by a finger's breadth, after having pressed them well together with your hand. Leave the pot until the caustic water drips into the glazed pot below. Then collect all that water, and pour it onto more fresh lime and potash.
Then it will be extremely potent, useful in many medical procedures and in cauterizing various members, because it acts just like fire itself.  There are other drugs which cauterize the hip as well, such as thapsia, honey of henbane, and lime with soap, mixed together.
Galen recounted a story from the ancients about a treatment for hip pain and sciatica, and greatly emphasized its importance, claiming that no other treatment was needed and that it cured in a single application.
So much so that one might enter the bath carried and leave cured.  This is done by taking fresh green verdigris—if fresh is unavailable, then use recently dried verdigris—finely pulverizing it with some fat, and applying it to the hip where the pain is, or to the leg, or to the thigh.
It is bandaged and left for three hours, or however long the patient feels the burning sensation subsiding. Then he is brought into the bath. When his body is damp, he is placed in the tub.  Then the pain will go away, and he will be healed, God willing. If it is not cured, repeat the application after ten days.
Then, God willing, he will be cured. Know that one should not cauterize with these drugs unless the body has been purged. Dioscorides mentioned that goat hair, when used to cauterize sciatica, is beneficial.
The cauterization is done in this way: wool is soaked in old oil and placed on the deep place between the thumb of the hand and the forearm, closer to the forearm. Then take a dry goat hair.
Heat it in the fire until it becomes a coal, then place it on the wool and leave it until it goes out. Then take another one and continue doing this until sensation reaches from the middle of the arm to the hip and the pain subsides, God willing. This type of cauterization is called goat-hair cauterization.
Chapter forty-two.
On cauterizing back pain.
Back pain may occur from many causes, either from a fall, a blow, excessive vomiting, and the like.  It is caused by the effusion of a cold, moist substance, and cauterization is only applied in this type alone.
That which is caused by the effusion of a cold substance: after the patient has vomited with hellebore and the like, he should be cauterized on his back where the pain is, three rows across the width of the table itself, after marking the location with ink.  In each row, five cauterizations or more, depending on the patient's tolerance and strength.
The cauterization should be done with a pointed cautery; or if you wish, cauterize three or four times with a medium-sized nail-shaped cautery, in this manner.
Chapter eighty-three.
On cauterizing the beginning of a hump.
This ailment frequently affects young children.  The sign of its beginning in a child is shortness of breath upon standing and movement, and you will find at the end of the vertebrae of his back a bead that has protruded and stands out from the other beads.
If you see this and wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery iron in this manner. Let the cauterization take hold on each side of the vertebra equally.  And if you wish, cauterize it around the vertebra with a pointed cautery iron in two or three rows, and let the points be close to one another. Then treat the area until it heals as we have mentioned.
And be careful not to use cauterization in a hump that is from a spasm of the nerve.
Chapter forty-four.
On cauterizing gout and joint pains.
If joint pains are from cold humors that settle in any member of the body, and if the pains occur in the legs, then it is customary for physicians to call this gout specifically.
If cold-caused gout is treated with the kinds of treatments we mentioned in the classification and the pains do not go away, then cauterization will remove them.  This is done by cauterizing around the joints of the legs with many cauterizations after purgation, and the cautery should be olive-shaped and medium-sized, in this manner.
And if you need to cauterize the surface of the leg, do so with a pointed cautery. If the pains ascend to the knees or to the other joints—and this often happens—cauterize each knee with three or four cauterizations on each side with this same olive-shaped cautery.
If you need more cauterization than this, cauterize, but do not deepen your hand with the cautery; rather, it should be about the thickness of the skin only. If the pains ascend to the hips or to the back, use what we mentioned of cauterization in its chapter.
If the pains are only in the hands, cauterize around the forearms as if circling two rows. If the pains remain in the fingers, cauterize each joint with a point and the metacarpus. If the pains ascend after days to the elbows or to the shoulders,
cauterize them on each side. The patient should not be without good management and the taking of medicines, for if he improves his diet and purges the phlegm, he will be cured with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter forty-five.
On cauterizing fistulas.
If a hernia appears in the groin and some intestine and fat descend to the testicle, and this is recent and beginning, then you should order the patient to abstain from eating that day and to use laxatives that will move the stool from his bowel.
Then he should lie on his back before you, and you should tell him to hold his breath until the fat or intestine protrudes, then you should return it with your finger. Then you should mark with ink below the hernia on the pubic bone a mark resembling a semicircle, its extremities toward the upper part of the body.
Then heat a cautery of this shape.
Until it becomes white and throws off sparks. Then return the intestine or fat to the abdomen. Then a servant should place his hand on the place so that the intestine does not protrude.  And you have spread the patient's legs apart and placed a cushion under him, and another servant ties his legs.
And another on his chest holds his hands. Then lower the cautery onto the same mark, and your hand with the cautery should be firm and straight, and hold it until it reaches the bone, or repeat it again if it did not reach the bone the first time.
And take care to prevent the intestine from protruding while you cauterize, lest you burn it, which will cause the patient either death or a great calamity. And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work will not be successful. And the cautery should be gentle for children according to their size and for adults according to their size.
Then treat the cauterized area after three days with butter until the scabs from the fire are gone. Then treat it with other ointments until it heals. And let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is healed.
And you should make his food during his treatment such as softens his bowels, lest the intestine protrude during defecation. Then, if he wants to get up after forty days, use a tight bandage and keep it on for another forty days. And let him reduce exertion, fullness from food and drink, and loud shouting.
For if this procedure is used in this way, he will recover completely, God willing. And I will mention the treatment of hernias by incision in its chapter, God willing. And as for a hernia that occurs in the rest of the abdomen and is in its beginning stages, if you wish to prevent it from increasing, cauterize a circular area around it to the extent of the hernia. Let what you burn of the skin be about two-thirds of it. Then treat it as we have mentioned, for it will not increase, God willing. And some of the ancients have mentioned cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery in this manner.
After you mark the hernia with ink, making the horizontal line at the top of the hernia and the other line downwards, and you place a single nail-like cautery in the middle, the first cautery is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter forty-six.
On cauterizing fistulas.
If pain occurs in some member due to a fall or blow, and that pain persists for a long time, and treatment with medicine does not work, then it should be cauterized with a pointed cautery.  The cauterization of each member should be according to its size, smallness, weakness, and strength.
And if the pain and fistula persist, then if it heals from the first cauterization, fine. Otherwise, repeat the cauterization, because it is the nature of these pains to spread from the member to what is near it. Therefore, it is necessary to pursue them with cauterization until the patient is cured.
Chapter forty-seven.
On cauterizing leprosy.
As for lepers, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially the type of leprosy that is caused by putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize, look: if the leprosy is incipient and you have treated it with what we mentioned in the section, and it has not subsided nor stopped, and you fear that corruption will overcome the whole temperament of the patient, then cauterize the head five times. One in the middle of the head as is customary, the second below it towards the forehead at the hairline, two on the temples, and one at the back on the nape of the neck.  And be thorough with the cauterization, a little, until it slightly affects the bone.
And scales will be shed from it, so that the thick vapors may easily escape.  Cauterize also the spleen in the same way as before.  But if the leprosy has persisted in the patient and has appeared evidently, then it is necessary to cauterize with these cauterizations which we mentioned on the head. And a cauterization on the tip of the nose, two cauterizations on the cheeks, two cauterizations on the cervical vertebrae, six on the dorsal vertebrae, one large one on the coccyx at the base of the spine, and another above it in the same region, and two on the hips, one on each hip. And two on the knees, one on each knee, and two on the shoulders, and two on the elbows, and two on the breasts, and cauterize each joint of the fingers and toes, and each heel, and the forearms.
And take care of the nerve which is at the back of the heels, lest you burn them.  And a cauterization may be made on the pubic bone, and another on the pit of the stomach, and another on the liver. And know that the more cauterizations you make, the more beneficial and effective it will be.
And know that the patient does not feel the pain of cauterization as the healthy person does, because his body is numb. And the cauteries should be large and small according to the organs and joints, as described in the properties of the instruments.
Then treat the cauterization with crushed acorns mixed with honey and other treatment until it heals, God willing.
Chapter forty-eight.
Concerning the cauterization of numbness: When a limb becomes numb and is treated with medication, ointments, and bandages, but does not heal, cauterize the numb limb with cauteries according to the size of the bone of the limb, whether large or small. Let your cauterization be deep and penetrate the thickness of the skin slightly.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.  Some numbness that affects the hand and foot may be cauterized at the vertebrae of the spine at the exit of the nerve that moves that limb, and the numbness will disappear.
And let no one undertake this except one who is knowledgeable about the anatomy of the limbs and the exits of the nerves that move the body.
Chapter forty-nine.
Concerning the cauterization of leprosy.
If leprosy is longstanding and no medical treatment is effective, cauterize it slightly, to the depth of the skin's thickness, until the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour, rose ointment,  lamb's tongue, and pigeon's blood or the blood of a sparrowhawk; one part of each. Mix everything together, apply it to a cloth, and bind it to the area until it heals.
Chapter fifty.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
If the cancer is incipient and you wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as it grows.  Some learned men have mentioned cauterizing it intensely in its center, but I do not see that, because I expect that it will ulcerate, and I have witnessed that many times.
Therefore, it is correct to cauterize around it in a circle, as we said, or with many cauterizations.
Chapter fifty-one.
Concerning the cauterization of the fistula.
If a fistula occurs and is slow to mature, either because of the strength of its causative agent, or because of the age of the patient if he is old and anemic, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the fistula, cauterize around it with many small cauterizations, punctually.
Then leave it, for it will hasten maturation.  If you wish to slow it with cauterization, use a cautery iron of this form.
And insert it into the middle of the fistula until it penetrates the skin. Let the cauterization be from what is below, so that the flow of pus is easier. Then treat it as is appropriate until it heals.
Chapter fifty-two.
On cauterizing the ulcer.
An ulcer is a corruption that spreads in the member and consumes it, as fire consumes dry wood. If you see an ulcer in a place that can tolerate cauterization with fire, then use many small and large, nail-like cauteries according to what is suitable for that place where the ulcer is.
Then cauterize it from every side until all the corruption is eradicated and nothing at all remains. Then leave it for three days and apply to the cauterized areas ground sulfur with oil until all the eschar and all the corruption is removed.
Then treat it with ointments that promote flesh growth. If after three days you see that the flesh grows healthy and without corruption, then do nothing. Otherwise, repeat the cauterization on whatever remains of the corrupted areas. And you may also treat the ulcer with a caustic medication.
For it acts in place of fire, more quickly beneficial. And I have already mentioned its treatment with caustic medication in the classification, so take it from there when you need it.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
On cauterizing inverted and non-inverted nails.
This condition frequently occurs on the soles of the feet; it is a rough thing that pains the man.  Cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with fire or cauterization with caustic water.
As for cauterization with fire, you heat a hollow cautery iron resembling an eagle's feather, made of iron to the extent that it encircles the nail on all sides, and it should have a thin edge. Then you apply it hot to the nail, and you turn your hand with the cautery iron around the nail until the cautery iron reaches the depth of the nail.
And you leave it for three days, it will suppurate, then you dress it with pounded wild lettuce mixed with salt, and you leave the dressing on it overnight, then it will be removed from its roots. Then you treat the wound with a flesh-growing ointment until it heals, if the nails are not inverted.
And it often occurs on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet.  Then you should take a tube of copper, iron, or eagle's feather, and place it over the nail or wart, then pour a little caustic water into the tube.
And hold your hand while turning it, with a little movement of your hand, so that the edge of the tube affects the root of the nail, and the caustic water finds a way to penetrate to the root of the nail.  Let the patient endure the sting of the caustic water for a little while.
Then leave it, for the nail will be removed with its roots.  Do this one by one until you have removed all of them from the body, then treat the places after they are removed with ointments that grow flesh.
Chapter fifty-four.
On cauterizing the falling [hair/disease].
If someone suffers from falling hair due to a cold in the nerves, or from a quartan fever or something else, then you should cauterize him four or five times on the vertebrae of the back, with one cauterization between each vertebra, and one cauterization on his chest. And on his stomach a cauterization with the olive cautery, for the falling [hair/disease] will be calmed and the cold illness will quickly mature.
Chapter fifty-five.
On cauterizing boils that occur on the body.
Ugly boils may erupt on the body, resulting from cold, thick, and corrupt materials. At their first appearance, each boil should be gently cauterized on its head with a sharpened stick whose tip has been ignited in the fire, or with a long piece of ziraund, or with a lentil-shaped cautery.
And the abscesses may be cauterized at their first eruption in this manner, so that the effective cause will not increase and will dissipate, and the patient will recover from it; however, this should be done after the patient has been bled.
Chapter fifty-six.
On cauterizing bleeding that occurs when an artery is cut.
Frequently, bleeding occurs from an artery that has been severed during a wound inflicted from the outside, or during the incision of a tumor, or the cauterization of a member, and the like, and its severance is difficult.
If this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the mouth of the artery and press it firmly so that the blood is contained beneath your finger and nothing comes out of it.  Then place several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire and heat them until they become very hot.
Then take one, either small or large, according to the wound and the location where the artery has ruptured, and apply the cautery to the same vessel after quickly removing your finger, and hold the cautery until the bleeding stops.
If, upon removing your finger from the mouth of the artery, the bleeding resumes and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another cautery from those in the prepared fire, and continue doing this one after another until the bleeding stops.
And be careful not to burn a nerve that is there, lest another affliction befall the patient. And know that if an artery bleeds, it cannot be severed, especially if it is a large artery, except in one of four ways: either by cauterization, as we have said, or by amputation if it has not already been severed. For if it is severed, its ends contract and the bleeding stops; or it may be tightly bound with threads; or medications that stop bleeding may be applied to it, and tightly bound with bandages.
And as for anyone who attempts to sever it with a ligature, or by tightening with cloths, or applying burning substances, and the like, it will not be severed at all except rarely. If this happens to someone and a physician or medicine is not available, he should immediately place his index finger on the mouth of the wound itself, as we have described.
And he should tighten it very hard until the blood is constricted and flows away from above the wound and onto the artery, and the finger should not be removed from it, constantly using very cold water until the blood coagulates and thickens and stops.  In the meantime, consider what is needed in the way of cauterization or medication.
Chapter Two.
Concerning incisions, punctures, bloodletting, wounds, and the like.
Khalaf said: In the first chapter, we mentioned every disease for which cauterization with fire and caustic medication is suitable, its causes, reasons, instruments, and the shapes of cauteries, making it chapters from head to foot.
And I follow in this chapter the same method, so that the student may easily obtain what he desires.
Before I begin with that, you should know, my sons, that this chapter contains more dangers than the first chapter on cauterization.
And for that reason, warning should be more emphatic, because in the work of this chapter, there often occurs the loss of blood, upon which life depends, when opening a vein or making an incision on a tumor, or puncturing an abscess, or treating a wound, or removing an arrow, or incising a stone, and similar things, all of which are accompanied by danger and fear, and in most of them, death occurs.
And I advise you against engaging in what is doubtful for you, for various kinds of people may come to you in this craft with various kinds of illnesses; some of them may be weary of their disease and death may seem light to them.
Because of the severity of their illness and the length of their affliction, and from the illness, there is that which indicates death; and some of them give you their money and enrich you with it in hope of health, and their disease is deadly, so you should not at all cooperate with anyone who comes to you of this description.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness, and do not proceed with any of that except after certain knowledge is established with you of what leads to a favorable outcome; and in all the treatment of your patients, use the precedence of knowledge and warning of what leads to safety.
For in that, you have help in acquiring praise, glory, mention, and thanks. May God inspire you, my sons, with His guidance, and may He not deprive you of correctness and success; indeed that is in His hand, there is no god but He.
And I have arranged the chapters of this section in the same manner as what preceded in the chapter on cautery, from head to foot, so that what you want from it may be easy for you, God willing.
Chapter One.
In the treatment of the water which collects in the heads of children.
This ailment often occurs to infants at birth if the midwife presses the infant's head without gentleness, and it may also occur from a hidden cause that is not known.
And I have not seen this ailment in anyone except infants, and all those I have seen of them have quickly approached death; therefore I have seen [it is best] to leave treatment. And I have seen an infant whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger every day. Until the infant could not sit up because of the size of his head, and the moisture increased until he died.
And this moisture either collects between the skin and the bone, or it collects under the bone on the dura mater.  The procedure in this is, if the moisture is between the skin and bone and the swelling is small, then it is necessary to make one incision across the middle of the head, and the length of the incision should be about two fingerbreadths, until the moisture flows out.  This is an image of the scalpel.
If the moisture is greater and the swelling larger, then make two intersecting incisions in this manner:
And if the moisture is under the bone—and its sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side, and the water subsides if you press it with your hand inwards, and this is not hidden from you—then it is necessary to make three incisions in the middle of the head in this manner.
After the incision, all the moisture comes out, then you bind the incisions with cloths and bandages. Then you bathe it from above with syrup and oil until the fifth day. Then you untie the bandage and treat the wound with lint and ointments. Do not neglect to bind the head moderately, and feed the patient with all dry food, low in moisture.
Until the member strengthens and heals. Another description of the incision is that you look where the bone of the swelling and the collection of water appear, because it may be more in the back of the head, or in the front, or on the right, or on the left.
Then you aim the incision where the swelling and the fullness of water appear to you, and you incise it as you are able, and be careful not to cut an artery, lest bleeding occur and the patient die from that bleeding along with the evacuation of the moisture.
Chapter Two.
Severing the two arteries behind the ears, known as the mastoids.
When someone is afflicted with severe colds in the eyes or chest, and this has persisted and medication has not been effective, then the most effective treatment is to sever these two arteries.
Then, if you wish to sever them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth to reveal the artery, then tie the patient's neck with a part of his garment, then look where the pulse beats and their locations, the two low-lying places behind the ears, and they rarely hide except in some people.
Then mark them with ink, then sever them with a lancet, cutting to the bone.  This should be done across the head, or if you wish, insert the lancet under the artery and cut upwards. The length of the cut should be about two fingers breadth.
If the artery is severed, blood will spurt forth in a pulsating manner, leaping forward in a continuous flow. If the artery is not palpable, you should measure three fingers' breadth from the ear, then mark it with ink and incise to the bone.  What should be...
Let six ounces of blood be released on average, though sometimes more or less may be released, depending on the patient's strength and the fullness of his arteries. Then examine the wound; if any peritoneum remains on the bone, cut it away.
So that a hot swelling does not develop. Then bind the wound with a linen thread and treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
Incision of the two arteries in the temples.
If a person suffers from chronic hemicrania or acute attacks due to sharp humors and heat in the muscles of the temples, or severe chronic headache and the like, and he has been treated with various medical treatments without success, then in such diseases we have tried the incision or cauterization of the arteries of the temples as we described.
The procedure for their incision is that the patient's hair in the temples should be shaved, and the artery visible in the temple should be sought, for it will be apparent to you from its pulsation, and it rarely hides except in a few people.
Or, in severe cold, if it is hidden from you, let the patient tighten his neck with a part of his garment, then you rub the area with a cloth or compress the area with hot water until the artery appears clearly and evidently. Then take the scalpel, whose image is this. Then you incise the skin gently with it until you reach the artery, then you insert a hook into it and pull it upwards until you bring it out of the skin and free it from the membranes beneath it on all sides; if the artery is thin, twist it with the tip of the hook. Then cut off a part of it to the extent that its ends separate and contract and do not cause bleeding; for if it is not severed and cut off, the blood will not flow at all.  Then bleed from six ounces to three.
If the artery is large, then it is necessary to tie it in two places with a strong doubled thread, and let the thread be either of silk or of lute strings, lest decay reach it quickly before the wound heals and bleeding occurs.
Then cut what is between the ligatures; do this at that time or after another time. And if you wish to cauterize it with a knife-like cautery to the bone until its ends are severed, it will act as the same thing or better, as we said.
Unless the patient has a fever or a hot temperament, for cauterization helps to eliminate humors and is therefore more beneficial. After removing the arteries, the place should be packed with old cotton and tightly bandaged. After healing, it should be treated with dry medicines that produce flesh and with dressings, until it heals, God willing.
If bleeding from the artery occurs during your work, quickly cut it, either by cauterization or by filling the place with vitriol and pressing your hand until the blood stops. If you do not have any of that, place your finger until the blood clots.
And wash the place with very cold water until the sharpness subsides and bind it as necessary.  What is easier than ligating the artery is to cauterize the vein with this double-bladed cautery after marking the two places with ink.
And apply it very hot until it reaches the bone and the vein is severed in two places so that the ends are separated, for it will not heal at all with this cauterization. And this is the image of the cautery.
The blades should be sharp, resembling small scissors, but much less sharp than a knife, because if they are as sharp as a knife, they cool more quickly and the flesh will not be severed quickly. If they are somewhat thick, the heat of the fire will remain in them.
And the flesh is cut quickly. This method is better than any other method, and easier.  The distance between the blades should be the width of a finger.
Chapter Four.
In the treatment of the constant flow of hot tears to the eyes.
If the tears are constant and their flow is from the veins on the outside of the skull and nothing from medical treatment with drugs has benefited, and you see the patient's face is reddened. And he feels a crawling on his forehead like the crawling of ants, and his eyes are sunken and moist, their lashes are eroded and their eyelids are clung together from the intensity of the tears.  The ancients in treating it resorted to this procedure, and they call it treatment with the scalpel; it is that you order the patient to have the hair shaved from his forehead.
Then you make three parallel incisions on the forehead along the length of the forehead. The length of each incision is about two fingers, one incision parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second a little distance from the movement of the muscle in the temple, and the third from the other side.
And be careful not to cut the two arteries on the sides, and keep your hand away from the joining of the jaws.  The distance between each incision should be about three fingers’ breadth. And have with you prepared pieces of sponge or many dry cloths to wipe away the blood.
Then you insert the double-pointed, sharp scalpel, whose image is this. From the incision next to the temple to the middle incision, and with it you flay all the skin between the incisions, together with the periosteum on the bone. Then you also do this from the middle incision to the third incision, then you remove this scalpel. And you also insert into the first incision another instrument called a scalpel, sharp on one side and smooth, not sharp, on the other side. And this is its image:
And you place its sharp side upwards towards the flesh adhering to the skin, and its smooth side towards the bone, and you push it until it reaches the middle incision, and you cut with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes, without the cut reaching the surface of the skin.
Then you do that in the middle incision to the other incision, and after a moderate amount of blood flows, you squeeze the places of the clotted blood, then you place in each incision a wick of cotton, and you place over it a compress moistened with syrup and oil, or vinegar and oil.
Lest a hot swelling occur, and on the third day you untie the bandage and use much irrigation with lukewarm water, then you treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and whatever else you treat wounds with, until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Five.
In the treatment of tears and discharges to the eyes from the interior of the head.
When someone experiences many, sharp, severe, persistent discharges, and you see his eyes weak and small, and his sight weakened, and his eyelids ulcerated, and the eyelashes falling from them. And there is a sharp, painful ache in the depth of the head and continuous sneezing, then know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from many deep veins.  The best treatment in this is this treatment: that you order the patient to have his forehead shaved, then you make one incision in the middle of the forehead.
And there is a sharp, painful ache in the depth of the head and continuous sneezing, then know from these symptoms that those materials and discharges come from many deep veins.  The best treatment in this is this treatment: that you order the patient to have his forehead shaved, then you make one incision in the middle of the forehead. Or a little higher across, and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple, and let the incision be to the bone, and keep your hand away from the muscles of the temples which move when chewing, until the bone is uncovered and all the blood is dried with a sponge.
Then separate the lips of the incision with old cotton or a linen thread, then bind from above with compresses, and soak the compresses with syrup and oil, lest a hot swelling occur. And when you unbind them and see that the hot swelling has subsided, then you should scrape the bone until the growth of flesh begins in it.
Then treat it with the drying treatment which causes the growth of flesh, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony, and preparing an ointment from them, and using it in the growth of flesh in such wounds.
Chapter Six.
In the treatment of what falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic stone or a semi-stone like iron and glass; or a vegetable seed like chickpeas and kernels and the like; or a flowing thing like water and vinegar and the like.
Or an animal.  When a stone or a type of stone falls into the ear which does not grow in the ear, expose the ear to the sun.  Then if you see the stone, instill some violet oil or cerate into it, then try to remove it by moving the head or sneezing with a sternutatory. And block the nostrils when sneezing comes, after you place a ring of rags or wool around the ear and extend the ear upwards. Often it comes out with this treatment. If it does not come out otherwise, then try to remove it with a gentle probe, whose image is this.
If it comes out with the probe, otherwise try to remove it with a gentle, slightly curved, blind probe. If it does not come out with that, then make a tube of copper and insert the end of the tube into the hole of the ear gently.
Seal around the tube with pitch softened with oil, lest there be a path for the air other than the tube. Then draw it with your breath strongly, and often it comes out by this. If it does not come out by what we described, then take a little of the gum of Nabataea or of the prepared gum which is used by birds, and place it on the end of the probe.
After wrapping it tightly with cotton, then insert it into the hole of the ear gently after drying the ear from moisture. If it does not come out by all that we described, then proceed to incision before a hot swelling or spasm occurs.
The description of the incision is that you first bleed the patient in the temple and take out blood according to his strength. Then you sit the patient before you and turn his ear upwards, and make a small incision at the root of the ear near its lobe, in its lower part.
And the incision should be crescent-shaped until you reach the stone, then remove it with whatever instruments you can. Then stitch up the incision quickly and treat it until it heals.
And if the thing that has fallen into the ear is one of the seeds that grow and swell, then try to remove it as we mentioned. If it does not respond to removal, then take a thin, delicate scalpel of this shape.
And try with it to cut that type of seed that has fallen into the ear.  You do this only if you are certain that the seed has become moistened by the vapor of the ear until it becomes many small pieces, then remove them with a blind probe or a soft sponge or by suction.
As we mentioned, then it is easy to remove it.  As for water entering the ear, the patient should first use sneezing with a nasal douche, having filled his ear with some old cotton while lying on the ear containing the water. If it comes out with that,
otherwise, take many small, smooth stones the length of the fingers, warm them slightly in the fire, and let the patient insert one into the opening of his ear. He should then hop on one foot on that side and strike the stone in the ear with another stone.
He continues to do this, stone by stone, until all the water comes out. The water may also be removed by taking a piece of papyrus or a feather, inserting one end into the ear, and applying the other end to a fire until most of it burns, then repeating with another feather.
Do this repeatedly until all the water comes out or draw it out with a tube as previously described for the stone. As for removing an animal that has entered, see if it is small in size like a flea or similar; treat it as described in the classification, but…
if its body is large and perceptible to the touch, try to remove it with lint and hooks. This is easier than anything else that lodges in the ear.  As for removing worms that develop in the ear, if you have treated it as mentioned in the classification in the chapter on instillations and your treatment has not worked…
you should examine the ear in the sun. If you see any worms, remove them with lint or fine hooks. If you see nothing, take a tube of this shape.
narrow at the bottom and wide at the top, and insert the thin end into the ear as far as the patient can tolerate. Then suck strongly. Do this repeatedly until all the worms come out. If they do not respond to this, seal around the tube with wax as I described for the stone.
If they do not come out by the methods mentioned, use the instillations I have described, which have been tried by the ancients in killing worms, and which you will find in the chapter on instillations. Pouring oils and medicines into the ear should be done with this instrument, and this is its shape:
As you see, make it from silver or copper, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, and wide at the top. If you wish, the nozzle inside the tube can be made of tightly fitting copper; or if you wish, take a reed and wrap cotton tightly around its end.
Then pour the oil or juice or whatever medicine you want into the tube while it is in the ear; then insert the reed with the cotton from above and squeeze it moderately with your hand until the oil is forced into the inner ear and the patient feels it.
The patient should feel it entering.  What you pour into the ear should be warmed slightly over a fire. Be careful that what you drop in is neither too cold nor too hot, for the ear cannot tolerate that.
Chapter Seven.
On the treatment of the obstruction affecting the ear.
Some children are born with their ear canals not perforated.
Also, some people may experience an obstruction in the ear canal from a wound or from  growing flesh. This obstruction may be deep within the ear canal and not visible to the eye.
It may also appear slightly outside the opening and be visible. That which appears deep within the ear and is not visible is, in most cases, difficult to see. That which is visible should have the patient's ear placed in the sun. And look into it; if you see the obstruction, open it with a delicate scalpel, which is of this shape:
Its tip should be slightly broad and limited, and the rest of the scalpel smooth on both sides so as not to injure the ear. If the obstruction is due to flesh that has grown in the ear canal, grasp it with a delicate hook and cut it gently but firmly until all the flesh is removed.
If the obstruction is deep within the ear, take a smooth, slender probe, warm it slightly in the fire, and insert it into the ear canal. If you feel the obstruction and the patient feels a heaviness in hearing, remove it gently.
Be careful not to injure the eardrum. Then insert into the ear a tent corresponding to the size of the opening, having smeared it with Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are sure that the wound has healed. Or take a tent, moisten it with water, and sprinkle powdered vitriol upon it.
And use it. If you see that the ear has swollen with a hot swelling, then it is necessary that you remove the tent and replace it with another tent smeared with a poultice made with rose oil, until the hot swelling subsides. Then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, dip a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear.  Use the other treatments for stopping bleeding mentioned in the chapter on cauterizations.
Chapter Eight.
On the treatment of warts that appear on the eyelids.
These warts which appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry.  It is necessary to grasp them with forceps or a hook and cut them from their roots with a scalpel, then apply powdered vitriol to the area.
If it bleeds, cauterize it with a gentle lentil-shaped cautery. Cauterization is best after cutting.  They often return if any of their roots remain; if cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and they do not return.
Chapter Nine.
On the treatment of the cold affecting the eyelids.
Something resembling a cold in its intensity and hardness often appears in the eyelids.
Therefore it is called a cold, being a gathering of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelids. The treatment is to look: if the cold swelling is prominent on the surface of the eyelid and moves to every side, then the matter is easy; make a transverse incision upon it.
Then peel it off gently from every side until it is removed, then hang it with a hook and cut it off. If you are unable to cut it off except after penetrating the eyelid with the cut, that will not harm the patient. If the incision is large, bring it together with sutures and treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, there is no harm from it, for ointment will heal and join it. If the cold swelling is inclined towards the inside of the eyelid, towards the inner surface, then turn back the eyelid and hang the swelling with a hook without needing to make an incision, and cut it away from every side.
If it penetrates the eyelid with the cut, that will not harm. Then wash the eye after cutting the swelling with salt water, and treat the area with something that will heal until the patient recovers.
Chapter Ten.
In the treatment of the stye which appears in the eyelid.
A stye is a fleshy growth which forms in the layers of the upper eyelid.  This most often affects children, weighing down their eyes and causing them to suffer from colds at night; they are unable to look at the sunlight. Because the tears rush to them.
Therefore you see them always leaning on their faces, and on them they sleep, and their eyelids under the eyebrows are moist, swollen, and the stye is clearly visible. When you press the place with your fingers you feel the stye between them.  The method of treatment is that the patient should place his head in your lap.
Then you take a linen cloth and prepare from it a wick, and you make from that wick a circle of a size to encompass the stye from every side, then you place it on it and press with your fingers from every side to collect the stye in the middle of the circle.
Then you make an incision in the middle of that moisture with a lancet, a transverse incision, and the incision should not be larger than the incision which is made in bloodletting; as for the depth, you should cut all the skin until you reach the stye.
Then, in most cases, the stye protrudes from the incision in the form of a white piece of fat, so you pull it out with a cloth that you have wrapped between your fingers, while you turn your hand right and left until it heals. And beware of increasing the incision, lest the lancet reach the eye and harm it.
If the stye does not appear to you at the first incision, then you should increase the incision a little gently until the stye appears, then pull it out as we said, then dip a cloth in vinegar and water and place it on the place and bind it with a bandage. And some people crush salt.
And they put it inside the incision to dissolve what remains of that moisture, then you treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs in the place, then treat it with soothing compresses until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On types of eyelid inflammation.
If there grow on the eyelid extra eyelashes, not in the natural course, under the natural eyelashes and eyelids, then they harm the eye and cause various diseases such as constant tearing, relaxation of the eyelids, whiteness and thickening, until this becomes a cause of blindness in the eye.
Eyelid inflammation is of four types: either by cauterization with fire, or by a sharp medicine as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, or the inflammation may be by cutting and suturing, or by a reed, as I will describe.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand; if it turns, otherwise, insert a needle with thread from below the eyelid and pass the needle with thread from above, close to the hair itself, and pull the thread upward with the eyelid.
Turn it with a probe, then incise in the inner eyelid, without the extra hair, with a sharp scalpel from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus; then remove the thread and place under the eyelid a small pad of cotton or cloth, then mark the eyelid with ink.
Like the shape of a laurel leaf, except that the shape should be according to how much you want to raise the eyelid, because people differ in this; some need to have a suitable amount cut from the eyelid according to how much the eyelid has relaxed.
And some need less cutting, all that according to the relaxation of the eyelid. Then incise with the scalpel along the two lines which you marked, beginning from the larger canthus to the smaller canthus, and let each incision be near the natural hair, about the thickness of a probe.
Then insert the hook into one corner of the skin, then flay it all, then bring together the edges with sutures using a fine woolen needle and thread, wipe away the blood, and stick what remains of the threads to the eyebrows with some adhesive material.
If you wish to do that, otherwise it doesn't matter. Then leave the sutures and threads for about three or four days, then treat it. And if you wish, leave the wound without sutures and treat it with something that dries and contracts, for the eyelid will rise when the wound is closed and joined; and suturing is better.
This method of blepharoplasty was mentioned by the ancients, although it is troublesome for the patient; it is a good procedure and there is no danger in it. Another method of blepharoplasty is to mark on the eyelid a shape like that of a laurel leaf, as we described. Then raise the eyelid with three hooks, either separate or grouped in this manner:
Then cut off the excess eyelid with small scissors, evenly, in this manner:
If you cannot hold the hooks and they do not remain steady for you, take a needle with thread and insert it into the middle of the shape, and insert another thread near the larger corner and a third thread near the smaller corner; and gather the threads between your fingers evenly, then raise them with an even lift.
Raise all of the marked skin as we described, then bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and treat it until it heals. If a hot inflammation occurs when you cut or incise, soothe that inflammation with Qirūṭī and similar soothing ointments.
The lower eyelid may also turn in its margins; in this case, you should use what we mentioned: cutting, suturing, cauterization with fire, and with a caustic medicine. Cauterization with fire or with a caustic medicine is more effective and gentler on the patient than cutting and suturing, and you should perform cutting and suturing in both.
Cauterization with a reed is done in this way: you turn back the eyelid and make an incision on the inside as described, then you make two thin reeds or pieces of wood, their length equal to the length of the eyelid and their width less than the width of a scalpel.
And you cut into their ends on both sides where the threads will be attached, then gently bring them together on what remains of the eyelid, and firmly tie the two reeds on both sides, and leave it for several days; then the constricted skin dies, turns black and decays.
Until it falls off by itself; if it is slow, cut it off with scissors, then treat it until it heals.  When it unites, the eyelid is raised and the margins no longer turn in. This is an image of the two reeds; make them in this shape and this exact size in length and width.
Chapter Twelve.
On raising ingrown eyelashes from the eye with a needle.
If there is one or two hairs, the procedure is to take a fine needle and thread it with a smooth, fine silk thread, then bring the two ends together and tie them in a very gentle knot, and let the length of the thread be about a span.
Then attach another fine thread to the needle, shorter than the first, and tie its ends if you wish. Then the patient places his head in your lap, and let it be near the sun so that the work may be clear, for it is delicate work. Then insert the needle with the thread into the root of the ingrown hair.
And quickly pass it through the eyelid until you bring it out above the natural hair, then pull the thread upwards on the needle and insert into the needle that hair, whether it is one, two, or three, no more.
Then pull it with your hand until the hair comes out with the needle in the eyelid along with the natural hair. If you pull the needle and the hair does not come out with it, pull the needle downwards by the thread which you had attached to it, until the needle comes out from the upper opening.
Then return the hair into it and pull them both; do this until it rises to the upper opening and you see it with your own eye. Then remove the needle and thread and take them out, and bind the eye and leave it bound for two or three days until the hair settles in its place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, either add to it a long hair from the natural hair so that it rises with it, or leave it until it grows longer after a time, then raise it.
Chapter Thirteen.
In the treatment of the stye which occurs in the upper eyelid of the eye.
The condition to which this stye is exposed is called arnabiyya, and this stye is either natural or accidental.  The accidental one is from the healing of a wound or cut or cauterization and the like.
And the method of treatment is to incise that adhesion and separate its lips and place between them a wick of linen and bind it until it heals, and it is not appropriate to use in its treatment things which dry and constrict.
For if you do that, the stye will return more severely than it was, but use in it things which relax, like fenugreek and lint with water in which mallow and flaxseed have been boiled, and diachylon ointment melted with something of the fats and smeared on the wick and treated with it.
And the key to its treatment is to try by every means that it does not adhere in the way it was originally, and this treatment which we have mentioned is only some improvement of the stye, not that the appearance of the place returns to what it was at all.
Chapter Fourteen.
In the treatment of the stye which forms in the lower eyelid.
This stye which forms in the lower eyelid is that which is truly called a stye, and it is natural and it is accidental. The accidental one is from a wound or incision or cautery and the like.
And the method of working in it is that you take a needle with a doubled thread and you pierce it into the flesh and pass it from the left canthus to the right canthus until the thread is at the two ends of the flesh, then you stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and cut it with a wide scalpel.
If the shape of the eyelid returns to what is appropriate, otherwise you take a probe and place it on the place of the incision and turn the eyelid with it and make two incisions in the inner side of the eyelid, and the ends of the two incisions are from the corners of the cut which you cut until they meet and a corner is formed from them. Until when they meet, its shape becomes similar to this shape:
And it is the Greek letter lambda, then you remove that flesh to the extent that its sharp side is lower than what is next to the eyelid, then you gather the separated parts with two stitches, sewing it with a wool thread, then you treat it with what we mentioned of the relaxing and softening medicines until it heals.
And if the fistula appeared from an incision or suture or cauterization, it is necessary to make a simple incision without the hair of the labia as well, as mentioned before, then separate the lips with a probe as we mentioned.
In short, in the treatment of the fistula, whether it is from above or below, you perform the procedure according to what is available to you of the appearance of the fistula, for it may vary greatly in form, and the skilled craftsman devises a solution in whatever way is possible for him.
Until the shape returns to its natural state or approximates it, and the disease itself indicates what is suitable for it in terms of procedure and instrument in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
This adhesion may occur to many people, such that the upper eyelid adheres to the white of the eye, preventing it from easy movement and hindering its natural functions; therefore, you should insert the point of a probe under the eyelid.
And raise it upwards or stretch it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a delicate scalpel, not sharp like cutting scalpels, but rather a little blunt, lest the patient be disturbed during the procedure and the scalpel slip, injuring the eye with its sharpness.  And your cutting should be as if you are peeling off that adhesion.
And wait until the eyelid returns to its natural state and the adhesion is completely healed. Then pour into the eye some salt water to wash it, or instill into it some solution of vitriol dissolved in water, then separate the eyelid from the eye with a linen thread.
And place over the eye wool moistened with egg white, and after the third day use the astringent medications until it heals.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cutting the pterygium and the fleshy excrescence of the conjunctiva.
The pterygium is of two kinds: either nervous, which resembles a thin, firm membrane; or non-nervous, which resembles a thick white moisture; if touched by an instrument or attempted to be removed with a hook, it is torn.
And a hook is not fixed in it. Both kinds begin from the greater canthus until they gradually spread until they cover the pupil and obstruct the light and the movement of the eye. The method of operating is that the patient should place his head in your lap.
Then he opens his eyes and you lift the eyelid with your hand, then you grasp the pterygium with a slightly curved hook and stretch it upwards; then you take a needle and thread it with a horsehair or cow hair and strong thread, and you bend the point of the needle slightly and pierce it into the middle of the pterygium.
Then you pass the needle through and tie the pterygium with the thread and stretch it upwards, and you dissect with the hair the side of the pterygium next to the pupil, as if you were spreading it with the hair to its end; then you cut the remainder at the root of the canthus with a fine scalpel or small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the canthus.
So that continuous lacrimation may not result from its excision. The pterygium may be stretched with the hook alone or with the thread as we said, then the smooth end is dissected with a scalpel, whose image is this:
And be careful that the scalpel does not touch the cornea, lest a wound occur in it and the pupil be injured. Then after the excision, you put some powdered salt or vitriol into the eye and leave it until the next day, then you treat it as is appropriate until it heals.
If the pterygium is not fibrous and you cannot insert a needle into it nor secure a hook in it, this type of pterygium is often treated with medications and it heals as described in the classification. If you wish to excise it, open the patient's eye.
Take a fine, smooth scalpel with a weak edge, in this image: And dissect the pterygium from above gently with it. If you see that it is loosening and disintegrating and the dissection has affected it, then instill in the eye immediately some vitriol or red vitriol or powdered salt, and bandage the eye until the next day.
Then repeat the procedure until all of it is gone, unless a hot inflammation interferes in the eye; then leave it and treat the hot inflammation until it heals, then resume the procedure of dissection until it heals. As for the fleshy excrescence of the caruncle…
If the excrescence harms the eye excessively, then hook that excrescence with a hook and cut some of it, but do not be excessive in cutting, lest it cause epiphora. Then instill red or vitriol in the caruncle until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
On excising polypi and what grows of excessive flesh in the eye.
In the eyes of some people, a red fleshy growth may sprout, accumulating until it covers the pupil, or comes near to it, or overflows onto the eyelids, and perhaps the eyelids turn outward; it resembles a pomegranate flower.
The procedure is that the patient places his head in your lap, then opens his eyes, and you grasp all that red flesh with hooks appropriate for that.
Or you grasp it with forceps or a small knife, then you cut the flesh, piece by piece, until you have removed it all by cutting, and you protect the eye so that it is not harmed during the procedure, and your cutting of it is either with the scalpel we described in cutting the membrane or with small scissors. Like those with which one plucks hairs, as its image comes in the chapter following this chapter.
When your cutting is completed and all the growth is gone, fill the eye with finely ground salt, or instill into it some red vitriol or similar caustic medicine, and apply to the outside of the eye a cotton compress with egg white to prevent hot inflammation.
If some of the growth remains and the bleeding overwhelms you and you fear hot inflammation, leave the eye and treat it with what calms the inflammation, then return to it with the procedure until it heals.  Do the same with excessive flesh that appears in the eye of this type.
However, you should avoid treating any eye weak by nature or by circumstance with instruments, and do not put your hand to any of these procedures until you see that the member can tolerate the procedure.
Chapter Eighteen.
On removing growths from the eye.
Growths are red vessels that grow on the eye, preventing its function and weakening the eye over time.  You should first look; if the eye in which the growths are found is strong and has no other disease besides the growths,
then the removal is performed by having the patient place his head in your lap, then you will hang those vessels with one or two hooks, according to your skill; and let the hooks be delicately curved in this manner:
Or let there be two double hooks in one body, in this manner:
Then, with delicate scissors, gently remove those vessels, wiping away the blood from time to time until you see that those vessels have gone from the eye and the bleeding has stopped. Be careful not to injure the eye with the tips of the scissors, and let your work be done midday, facing the sun.
And be very careful in your work, lest you cut anything other than those vessels.  Upon completion, instil green or red eye drops to cauterize any remaining growths. If you cannot remove them all at that time, then bandage the eye with something that soothes the eye's pain.
And leave it for some days until the pain subsides and the inflammation is safe, then repeat the procedure in the same manner until it is healed. This is the image of the scissors.
And leave it [and let the patient's head be in the lap of the student, and another wipes away the tears and examines the front and back of the eye, and you]. The principle of the procedure is to open the eye with fixed or triangular dilators held by a student.
Sharp, and let the patient's head be in the lap of the student, and another wipes away the tears and examines the front and back of the eye, and you have the option of beginning to remove [vessels] from the top or bottom of the eye, and it is preferable to remove two vessels in the upper corner, one at the end of the eyelid and the other at its beginning.
And grasp them between the middle and index fingers, then hook from below opposite them, then grasp them between the little and ring fingers, and lift your hand gently until you see all the vessels raised, then cut them with the smaller scissors if you wish, or with a delicate scalpel if you wish.
And you insert the thread onto a needle and you raise all the vessels until they rise above the pledget, and do not cut the [vessels] while they are still wet, for the tears and blood will obscure your vision.
Then cut with scissors what extends beyond the eyelid from above and below, so that nothing remains attached except to the cornea. If you can raise it from the cornea by means of the thread, that is best, and it may be possible in some people.
And when you have cut it, let its place be cauterized for several days to alleviate the pain and prevent hot swelling, then resume work on it.
Chapter Nineteen.
On returning the nose to its place.
Physicians call a polypus a nāsūr. If you treat it with cautery or with a sharp, burning medicine, as described above, and it does not heal, then there is no remedy but to incise the swelling when it is ripe and to evacuate all the moisture or pus within.
until the bone is exposed.  If the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then remove it with an instrument of this shape:
The rasp-head, made of Indian iron, is so called. Its head is round like a button, finely engraved with the pattern of a file or rasp.  You place it on the corrupted part of the bone, then turn it between your fingers, while slightly pressing your hand, until you know that the corruption has been removed.
Do this repeatedly, then dress the wound with drying, astringent medicaments. If the wound closes and flesh grows over it, and the discharge ceases, and forty days pass without recurrence, suppuration, or other incident,
know that it is healed. Otherwise, there is no remedy but to return the polypus to the nasal cavity in this manner:  You again expose the bone with an iron instrument or with a sharp medicament. When the bone is exposed, take a probe of this shape:
The tip of the instrument is triangular, and its shaft is conical, tapering to the point, as you see. Then place it on the bone itself, near the ethmoid bone and slightly away from the eye. Then rotate your hand with the probe until it penetrates the bone and the patient feels it.
He will feel air escaping from it if he holds his hand to his nose.  Then dress the wound with the drying, astringent medicaments as I have taught you. If flesh grows and the area becomes firm, then the material which was discharging externally will return to the nose, which will be easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
In returning the protrusion of the eye.
If the eye protrudes in its entirety, and no damage or impairment occurs in the vision, then you should ease the patient, and then you should bleed him in the cephalic vein. Then apply a cupping glass to the nape of the neck without any specific requirement, and apply gentle suction.
Then apply a poultice made of acacia, aloe, frankincense, and gum tragacanth to the eye. Then bind the eye from above to the poultice with many pledgets. The method of making pledgets is to take many soft pieces of linen, and fold each piece into four layers, making many of them.
Then place them one over the other, as much as the eye requires, and then bind it tightly with a firm cloth. Repeat the cupping with suction without any specific requirement, then remove the cupping glass and leave the eye bandaged for a day and a night.
If the bandage loosens during that time, then it should be tightened gently. Then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we said. If you see that the eye has returned, otherwise, repeat the poultice, pledgets, binding, and cupping until it returns.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On cutting the uvula.
If a hernia appears in the uvular layer, then it swells and protrudes outside the eyelids like a grape, and the appearance of the person is disfigured by it, and you wish to cut it, then the procedure is as I describe.
It is that you insert a needle into the root of the uvula from below upwards, then insert another needle with a doubled thread from the side of the uvula, and pass it through, and leave the first needle as it is.
Then you cut the place where the doubled thread bends and tie some of the uvula around the needle with it and pull it tightly, then you remove the needle and place moistened wool on the eye with egg white and leave it until the threads fall out with the uvula, then you treat the eye with what strengthens it.
Until the wound heals.  And you may pull the uvula from each side with a circle of cloth until the eye swells more tightly, then you cut it with a thin scalpel that reaches the depth of the eye, so that the white moisture flows out, and the eye descends and withers in place, then you pull it until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-two.
In the treatment of the uvula.
This ailment which is called *kumana* is a moisture that gathers in the eye, resembling descending water, but it is not. The procedure is that you seat the patient upright on a chair, then take his head in your hands from both sides.
And move it until you see the moisture go to the bottom with your eye, then it becomes fixed and does not move, and the light departs and the patient sees things as he used to see them. And if it does not descend to the bottom, we know that it is water. If the descent of the moisture is not achieved by what we have mentioned,
otherwise, seat the patient before you, then take a thin scalpel and make a small incision with it above the cornea at the point where the conjunctiva joins the cornea in the limbus until the material comes out.
When it has come out, instill into the eye warm water in which you have mixed honey, or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
We have already mentioned the types of water in the classification and which of them is suitable for the cupping, with a detailed and explained statement; take that from there correctly. Then you should seat the patient before you, sitting squarely facing the light near the sun.
And you bind his healthy eye and bind it tightly, then you lift the eyelid of his eye with your left hand if the eye in which is the water is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then you place the tip of the cupping instrument near the cornea, with the thickness of a probe, in the same white of the eye on the side of the smaller canthus, then you push the cupping instrument forcefully while you turn it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel with the cupping instrument that it has reached something empty.
And it should be that the extent to which the cupping instrument goes into depth is the extent of the distance that is from the pupil to the end of the black, which is the cornea, for you see the copper in the very gaze of the observer, by the clarity of the corneal membrane, then you move the cupping instrument upwards to the place in which is the water.
Then you press it downwards time after time; if the water descends immediately, then the patient sees what his sight has been opened to immediately, and the cupping instrument is in his eye, then it rests a little. If the water rises, then lower it again without removing the cupping instrument.
Then if it settles and does not rise, remove the cupping instrument gently while you twist it with your hand little by little, then dissolve in the water a little of pure Andarani salt and wash the eye with it from the inside, then apply to the outside of the whole eye a compress or wet wool.
With rose oil and egg white, and you bandage it with the healthy eye. As for us and the people of our time, we place on it crushed cumin with egg white. If the cupping instrument does not go into the eye because of its hardness—for some people have a very hard eye— Then you should take the scalpel which is called the *barīd*, whose image is this:
Then pierce with it only the adherent part and do not prolong the perforation; it is only that you make a gentle opening for the cupping instrument, then insert the cupping instrument as we have mentioned. When your work is complete, prepare for the patient a firm bed in which he sleeps on his back in a dark room.
And he abstains from all movements and from coughing, and you make his food whatever softens his constitution, and he does not move his head to the right or left at all. The bandage remains in place until the third day, then you untie it in that dark room and test his sight.
And you show him things, then you return the bandage until the seventh day.  And it is not proper to do this at the time of treatment or after cupping from your hour, but rather you should avoid that before the water rises quickly with intense sight.
If a hot swelling appears, then it is necessary to untie the eye before the seventh day and treat that with what calms the swelling until, when it subsides, then you release his sight and place a veil over his face, training his sight from under it for days while he is in that dark room, then...
He leaves the house gradually and manages his affairs. And know that in cupping, the learner cannot dispense with observation many times; then he proceeds to work. And it has reached me from some Iraqis that he mentioned that they make in Iraq a perforated cupping instrument with which they draw out water.
And I have not seen anyone in our country make that nor read it in any book of the ancients.  And it is possible that this is recent.  And this is an image of types of cupping instruments for one ignorant of them to stand upon.
It is made of copper especially, and its end is of this very thinness, triangular-tipped and sharp.
Chapter twenty-four.
In the treatment of the growth of flesh in the nose.
Various fleshy growths may grow in the nose, some resembling a centipede, some being cancerous flesh, hardened and dark in color, and some being soft flesh not dark in color.
As for those fleshy growths which are soft, not malignant nor cancerous, the patient should be seated before you facing the sun, his nostril opened; then you insert a snare into the flesh and draw it outwards, and cut off what you have grasped with a fine, sharp scalpel on one side.
Until you know that all of the flesh has gone; if any remains which you cannot cut, remove it gently with one of the fine instruments, so that nothing remains. If the bleeding is excessive, or hot inflammation occurs,
counteract it appropriately. If it is one of the malignant tumors, act quickly to cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh is gone; then place vinegar and water, or a medicated drink, in the nose. If the nose opens and the moisture passes down to the throat,
know that he is healed. If the moisture does not flow as it should, know that inside there is a fleshy growth on the top of the porous bones, which the instrument did not reach in cutting. Then you should take a linen thread of some thickness.
and tie many knots in it, leaving the space of a finger or less between each knot.  The patient should skillfully insert one end of the thread into his nose with a probe or any suitable instrument, after shaping it like a button, and draw it through until it reaches the pharynx.
and it will come out at his throat. Children often do this in school, and it is easy for anyone who wants to. Then bring together the two ends of the thread, the one which came out of the mouth and the other which remains in the nose.
Then use the knots in the thread to saw away the flesh, doing so until you know that the flesh has been severed by the knots of the thread. Then remove the thread, and after wiping away the blood, place a wick soaked in Egyptian ointment in the nose. Do this for three days or more.
until the ointment consumes all that remains of the flesh. Then, finally, place a lead tube in the nose for some days until it heals. If it needs drying treatment, use that.
This is an image of the speculum with which ointments and medications are instilled into the nose:
It is made of silver or copper, resembling a small, open, anointed candlestick, and its channel is likewise.
And if you wish, make the tube closed like a reed, and the surface of the speculum smooth.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, by which it is held when the ointment or any other liquids or flowing substances are heated within it.
Chapter Twenty-five.
Concerning warts growing on the tip of the nose.
Frequently a wart grows on the tip of the nose, and it increases and grows larger with the days until its appearance becomes unsightly.
Therefore it is necessary to cut it off at its first appearance and to excise it completely, then to apply to the place either cautery or a caustic medicine which takes the place of cautery. If it escapes cutting until it becomes large, then look: if it is hardened, solid, dark in color, and insensitive,
do not apply iron to it, for it is a cancerous tumor; and I have often seen that cutting this tumor resulted in great harm to the patient. But if the tumor is soft to the touch, not dark in color, and you see that it can be completely cut, then purge the patient and cut it off without hesitation or delay, and treat the place with what dries and constricts until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
On suturing the nose, lip, and ear. If their connection is separated by a wound or something similar, know that when a separation of connection occurs in one of these cartilages, the treatment is rarely effective except in some people.
So if something like that happens to someone, see if the wound is fresh with blood; bring the edges of the wound together with sutures and then treat it until it heals.  If the separation of the connection has separated its edges and each part is clean, then you should scrape each part to the thickness of its outer skin until it bleeds.
Then bring the edges together with sutures, tighten them, and sprinkle on them frankincense and mastic, powdered.  Then place on top of the sutures a plaster of palm-ointment or another of the vulnerary ointments and leave it bound for two or three days, then unbind it.
And change the dressing and leave it until the threads fall out by themselves, then treat it with ointment until it heals. The method of suturing is to bring together the separated connection either with needles, as we described in suturing the abdomen, or with thread, as I showed you there.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On removing the knots which appear in the lips.
Many people develop small, hard tumors inside their lips; some resemble small berries, others are smaller or larger. You should evert the lip and incise each nodule, and hang it with a hook.
And cut it from every side, then pack the site after cutting with powdered alum until the bleeding stops, then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the areas with an astringent until the wounds heal.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On cutting away excess flesh in the gums.
Often, excess flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients called epulis. You should hook it with a hook or grasp it with forceps and cut it at its base, and allow the serum or blood to flow, then apply powdered alum to the site.
Or one of the astringent drying powders. If that flesh returns after treatment—for it often returns—cut it again and cauterize it; it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On extracting teeth with an iron instrument.
Rough, unsightly crusts may gather on the surfaces of the teeth, inside and out, and between the gums; they may turn black, yellow, or green, so that the gums become diseased and the teeth unsightly because of it.
You should seat the patient before you with his head in your lap, and clean the tooth or teeth on which you see the crusts and sandy-like substance, until nothing remains; and do the same with blackness, greenness, yellowness and whatever else you find, until they are clean.
If this removes what is there from the first cleaning, well and good; otherwise, repeat the cleaning on another day, and then a second and a third time, until you achieve what you want. Know that a molar requires different types of scrapers, many shapes, according to what is suitable for your work.
Because the instrument with which you clean the molar from the inside is not the same as that with which you clean it from the outside, nor that with which you clean between the molars, which is of yet another form.  These are several forms of scrapers which you should have, all prepared.
Chapter Thirty.
On the Extraction of Teeth.
You should treat the molar for its pain by every means, and delay its extraction; for there is no replacement for it once it is extracted, because it is a noble substance, except when its extraction is unavoidable.
If the patient is determined on its extraction, then you should be certain that the molar is the source of the pain. For often the patient is deceived by the pain, and thinks that it is in the healthy tooth, and extracts it; then the pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is extracted. We have seen this done repeatedly by barbers.
If you are certain which tooth is the source of the pain, then you should incise around the tooth with a strong scalpel, so as to loosen the gum from every side; then move it gently with your fingers or with delicate forceps little by little, until you loosen it.
Then firmly grasp it with the large forceps, and hold the patient's head between your knees, having steadied it so that it does not move; then pull the tooth straight out, lest you break it.  If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments, and insert it under it from every side gently, and continue moving it as you did before.
And if the tooth is perforated or decayed, then you should fill that hole with a cloth and pack it firmly with the end of a thin probe, lest it crumble when you pull it with the forceps; and you should thoroughly incise around the gum on every side.
And take care not to break it, for if some of it remains, it will cause the patient a greater affliction than his original pain. And beware of doing what the ignorant barbers do in their haste and recklessness in extracting it without using what we have described.
For they often inflict great harm on people, the least of which is that the tooth breaks and all or part of its roots remain. Or that it is extracted with part of the jawbone, as we have often witnessed; then let him rinse his mouth after extraction with a drink or with vinegar and salt; and if bleeding occurs from the place—and this often happens—then crush some vitriol and pack the place with it.
Otherwise, cauterize it if the vitriol does not help you.  The image of the delicate forceps with which you first move the tooth: they should be long-pointed, short-handled, and thick, lest they bend when you grasp the tooth with them. And this is the image of the large forceps:
They should be, as you see, thick-handled, so that when you grasp them, they do not yield or bend; short-pointed, and let them be of Indian iron or of well-tempered steel, the points sharpened, and at the tips, teeth that interlock, so that they grip firmly and tightly.
And the points may be made in the shape of a file, and they will also be strong in their grip.
Chapter Thirty-one.
On the extraction of the roots of molars and the removal of fractured jaw bones.
If, when extracting a molar, a root remains broken, you should apply a pledget of cotton soaked in butter to the area for a day or two, until the area relaxes, then insert the forceps or hooks. whose points resemble the beak of the bird called the balarjah.  And this is an image of the hooks:
They should be made like a file from the inside, or like a scalpel. If you are unable to remove it with these hooks, you should excavate the root and expose all the flesh with a scalpel, then insert an instrument resembling a small lever,  which is depicted thus:
short at the end, somewhat thick, and not pointed, lest it break. If the root is removed by this means, well and good; otherwise, use these other instruments, which are depicted thus: the first is triangular at the end, somewhat thick:
Another fine triangular image:
And we may also use this instrument with two branches, which is also depicted thus:
And other instruments and tools previously mentioned in the extraction of teeth.  We may also use this instrument which resembles a large hook, which is depicted thus:
Triangular at the bent end, somewhat thick, lest it break; and it should not be pointed. And know that the instruments for teeth are numerous, and so too are all other instruments; they are almost innumerable, and the skillful and clever craftsman may invent for himself instruments according to what the work and the diseases themselves indicate.
For there are diseases for which the ancients did not mention instruments, due to the variety of their types.  If a bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth is broken, or becomes putrid, then search for it in its place with one of these instruments and hooks which were mentioned in the extraction of roots.
And we use a curette, its image is this:
It should be somewhat thick to control the bone so that it does not slip until the bone is removed, and we dress the place with suitable medicines. If the bone has slight decay, scrape away its decay and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
On the extraction of molars growing upon others.
If molars grow other than in their natural place, this is unsightly, especially if it happens in women and slaves.  It should be examined; if the molar has grown behind another molar,
and its extraction or repositioning is impossible, then extract it. And if it is attached to another molar, cut it with this instrument, whose image is this:
It resembles a small beak and should be made of sharp Indian iron.  Cut it in several days because of the hardness of the tooth, lest you shake other teeth. But if it is prominent and its removal is possible by filing, file it with an Indian file, whose image is this.
It should be entirely of Indian steel, very finely engraved, like the file used to make needles. File the tooth little by little over many days gently, lest you shake the tooth and it falls out. Then smooth it and remove it with some forceps.
And if a tooth is broken and hurts the tongue when speaking, it should also be filed until the roughness of the fracture is removed, it becomes smooth, and it does not hurt the tongue or impair speech.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
On binding loose teeth with silver or gold threads.
If the front teeth become loose and move due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot bite on anything to eat for fear that they will fall out, and you have treated them with astringent medicines but the treatment has not been effective.
The solution is to tie them with a gold or silver thread, gold being preferable because silver tarnishes and decays after a few days, while gold remains unchanged forever; and the thread should be of moderate thinness and thickness, according to what fits between the teeth.
The method of binding is to take the thread and insert its loop between the sound teeth, then weave the ends of the thread between the loose teeth, whether one or more, until you reach the sound tooth on the other side by weaving.
Then you weave back to the side where you began, and gently and skillfully tighten the thread so that it does not move at all; you should tighten the thread at the roots of the teeth lest it loosen.  Then cut the excess ends of the thread with scissors, gather them, twist them together, and hide them between the sound tooth and the loose tooth.
So that it does not injure the tongue. Then leave it tied as long as it remains; if it loosens or breaks, tighten it with another thread, and he will enjoy it thus for his whole life.  This is an image of the teeth and the method of binding in two sound teeth and two loose teeth, as you see:
And a single tooth or two may be returned to their place after falling out and bound as we have described, and remain.  This is done by a skilled dentist. He may also carve a piece of ox bone, shape it like a tooth, and place it in the space from which the tooth has fallen. And it is tightened as we have said, and remains, and he enjoys that.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cutting the ligament which appears under the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament which appears under the tongue may be either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from a wound which has healed.
And the procedure is that you open the mouth of the patient and place his head in your lap and raise his tongue, then cut that nervous ligament transversely until the tongue is released from its constraint. If there is some stiffness and complexity, and that is from a healed wound, then insert a hook into it and split it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knot is undone.
And beware that the incision is not deep into the flesh, lest you cut an artery there and bleeding results. Then let him rinse the mouth after the cutting with rose water or with vinegar and cold water, then place under the tongue a pledget of lint which the patient holds each night.
Lest it unite again. If bleeding occurs, apply powdered alum to the place. If the bleeding overcomes you, cauterize the place with a lentil-shaped cautery suitable for this. Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Chapter thirty-five.
On removing the frog which develops under the tongue.
A swelling resembling a small frog sometimes occurs under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function, and perhaps it grows until it fills the mouth. The procedure is to open the patient's mouth towards the sun and examine the swelling.
If you see it dark-colored or black, hard and insensitive to the patient, do not interfere with it, for it is a cancer; but if it is inclined to whiteness and moist, insert a hook into it and incise it with a fine scalpel, and free it from every side.
If the bleeding is excessive during your operation, apply powdered vitriol until the bleeding stops, then resume your work until you remove it completely. Then have him gargle with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with other appropriate remedies until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Six.
In the treatment of tonsil tumors.
And what grows in the throat from other tumors;  glands may appear inside the throat similar to those that appear outside, called tonsils. If you treat them with what was mentioned in the section and they do not heal,
then look: if the tumor is hard, dark in color, and insensitive, do not approach it with an instrument. And if it is red in color and its base is thick, do not approach it with an instrument either, for fear of hemorrhage; rather, leave it until it matures, then either cauterize it or it will burst of its own accord.
And if it is white in color, round, and its base is thin, this is what should be cut.  The procedure is that you should look before operating whether its hot inflammation has completely subsided or lessened somewhat.
Then seat the patient facing the sun, his head in your lap, and open his mouth. Take an assistant with you, who will press his tongue downwards with an instrument of this shape:
Make it of silver or copper, thin like a knife. When you press the tongue with it and the tumor becomes visible to you, take a hook and insert it into the tonsil, pulling it outwards as much as possible without pulling anything of the membranes with it.
Then cut it with an instrument of this shape, resembling scissors except that its two ends are curved, and the edge of each is very sharp. Make it from Indian iron or Damascus steel:
If this instrument is not available, then cut it with a scalpel of this shape:
Sharp on one side and not sharp on the other. After cutting one tonsil, cut the other in the same way. After cutting, gargle the patient with cold water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water in which pomegranate peels or myrtle leaves or similar astringents have been boiled until the bleeding stops. Then treat him until he recovers. Other tumors besides the tonsils may grow in the throat; cut them as I described for the tonsils.
I treated a woman who had a tumor that had grown inside her throat, resembling a polyp, somewhat insensitive, which almost blocked her throat. The woman was breathing through a narrow passage and was prevented from eating and drinking water.
She was on the verge of death if she remained for a day or two.  Two branches extended from the tumor, reaching her nostrils. I acted quickly, inserted a hook into one of them and pulled; a suitable piece came away.
Then I cut it where I reached it through the nostril. I did the same with what protruded from the other nostril. Then I opened her mouth, depressed her tongue, inserted the hook into the tumor itself, and cut some of it; only a little blood flowed.
The woman's throat opened, and she immediately began to drink water and eat.  We repeatedly cut away parts of the tumor over a long period; the tumor replaced what was cut until this treatment continued for a long time for both of us.
Then I devised a plan and cauterized the tumor inside the throat.  It stopped growing, then she left the area and I did not know what God did with her afterward.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
In cutting the uvular tumor.
That which is called a grape, if it descends to the uvula and swells, and is white and oblong, it is called a pillar; and if it is thick at the bottom and round, it is called a grape.  If it is treated with what we mentioned in the classification, and the treatment is ineffective, …
And I saw that the hot tumor had subsided from it and it was thin.  Then it should be cut, and what was gathered together and round, and did not have length, and was bloody or the color of pus, or black, or insensitive, then it should be avoided cutting.
For there is danger to the patient.  Therefore, if you see it in the manner that I mentioned, of its whiteness and length, then the patient should sit facing the sun, and you should compress his tongue with the instrument which I previously described, then pierce the grape with the hook.
And pull it downwards and cut it with one of the two instruments which I mentioned in cutting the tonsils.  It is necessary that you cut only that which exceeds the natural state, without excess; for if you cut more than that, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then, after cutting, use what we described in cutting the tonsils and treat it until it heals. If the patient is afraid of cutting it, then it is necessary to use a method of cauterizing it without fear or caution. The method of cauterization is with a sharp medicine, and that is that you place the head of the patient in your lap.
Then compress his tongue with the instrument which we mentioned, then take of the sharp water which I mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and mix it with unquenched lime, and make it neither thick nor thin, and fill the cavity of this instrument with it.  And this is its image:.
Its end, in which you place the medicine, has a cavity like the cavity of a spoon, and you place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula itself, and the patient lying on his side so that the saliva flows from his mouth from inside his throat, lest anything descend from it into his throat and harm him.
Then hold your hand with the medicine while you press it against the uvula for about half an hour, until you see that it has blackened and the sting of the medicine has subsided. And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of a probe and moisten the cotton in the medicine.
And insert the probe with the cotton into the tube from above until the cotton adheres to the uvula. Do this repeatedly until you achieve the desired cauterization of the uvula, then leave it; it will wither and fall after three or four days. If you need to reapply the medicine, reapply it.
After cauterization, wipe around the uvula with cotton soaked in butter and wipe away the medicine from around it. Then gargle with cold water and treat from the outside with poultices and from the inside with gargles until it heals. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and further from fear.
The uvula may also be treated with something gentler than cautery and cutting; it is treated with fumigation in this manner: take fumitory, hyssop, thyme, rue, wormwood, chamomile, and costus, and similar herbs. Gather them all or some of them in a pot and immerse them in vinegar.
Boil it, and the pot is plastered with wise clay, and there is a hole in the middle of the lid, upon which is fitted a hollow instrument made in this manner, made of silver or copper.
And insert the end with the pomegranate into the patient's mouth until the steam rises to the uvula through the tube until the uvula is well-fumigated. Then repeat it several times until it withers. And beware of performing this treatment at the first occurrence of the swelling.
For it often increases the swelling. Rather, it should be done when its hot swelling subsides. If you do not have this instrument, take a reed and attach an eggshell to its end lest the patient's mouth be burned.
For the eggshell prevents the heat of the steam from burning the mouth, and this is among the good treatments along with its safety.
Chapter thirty-eight.
On removing thorns and other things that lodge in the throat.
Often a bone or fishbone or something else lodges in the throat.  It is necessary to remove what is visible to the eye, after you have pressed down the tongue with the instrument toward the sun.
So that you may discern what is in the throat. And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you cause the patient to vomit before his food is digested in his stomach, for perhaps the lodged thing will come out with the vomit. Or let the patient swallow a piece of turnip or a head of lettuce.
Or let him swallow a mouthful of dry bread. Or take a piece of soft sea sponge, tie it to a string, then let him swallow it.  When it reaches the place of the thorn, pull the string quickly. Do this repeatedly.
Often the thorn or bone will stick to it and come out. If it does not come out by the methods mentioned, then use a lead instrument of this shape:
It should be slightly thicker than a probe, and at its tip a hook. The patient inserts it into his throat gently, raising his head upwards, and taking care not to touch his throat, lest he cause coughing and push the bone or thorn further down. Or the physician inserts it with his hand.
And it is better for the patient to insert it himself, for he knows the position of the lodged thing.  He pushes it downwards or pulls it upwards with the instrument, doing all this as much as he is able, until it comes out.
Chapter Thirty-Nine
On removing leeches lodged in the throat.
If you have treated the leech with what we mentioned in the section on medical treatment and it has not been effective, then look into the patient's throat in the sunlight, after you have pressed down his tongue with the instrument I described to you.
If you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook or with a fine, strong forceps.  If you cannot do this, take a hollow tube and insert it into the patient's throat near the leech, then insert a hot iron into the tube.
Do this several times. The patient should abstain from water all that day, then take a jug full of cold water, open his mouth into it, and rinse his mouth with it without swallowing a drop, moving the water around from time to time with his hand.
The leech will fall out when it feels the water. If it does not come out as described, fumigate the throat with urine and with galbanum using the instrument described for fumigating the tonsils; do this several times, for then it will fall out.
The method of fumigation is as follows: take a pot containing hot coals, the pot being covered with a lid in the middle of which is a hole; you then fit the end of the instrument into this hole, and throw in the fumigant. The patient places his mouth at the end of the tube and closes his mouth so that the fumigant does not escape, until he knows that the fumigant has reached his throat.
Then the leech will fall out. If it does not fall out, the fumigation should be repeated several times. The patient should endure thirst, eat salt and garlic, and drink no water; the leech must come out with this treatment.  This is an image of an instrument for drawing out a leech from the throat if it is visible.
It resembles forceps, as you see, except that it has this curve which enters the throat, and its ends resemble a bird's beak, having the roughness of a file; if it grips something, it does not let go.
Another instrument is used to compress the tongue. It is a wide iron ring, large enough to fit into the mouth over the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth upright on its side, so that the mouth remains open without the patient's will, and he is completely unable to remove it until it is taken away.
The description of the instrument with which the mouth is opened in this way.
Chapter Forty.
It will then speak of cauterizing and incising tumors.
Tumors are numerous and varied in kind, as will be described one by one in this book. They differ in their cauterization and incision in two respects: one, from the type of tumor itself and what it contains of humors.
The second type is due to the locations in the body where they occur, for a tumor occurring in the head is not the same as a tumor occurring in the rectum, and a tumor occurring in a fleshy location is not the same as a tumor occurring in a joint; each has its own treatment.
Some tumors should not be cauterized except after the pus in them has matured and is complete; others should be cauterized while still raw and not fully matured, such as tumors that are near the joints.
Because if a tumor occurs near a joint and its condition persists until it causes what is around it to fester, it may destroy the ligaments or nerves of that joint, thus causing crippling of that member, or the tumor may be near a vital organ.
Because if you delay its cauterization until it matures, you will harm that vital organ; or it may be near the rectum, so cauterize it while raw.  It is necessary to cauterize a tumor near the rectum while it is raw and not fully matured, lest it fester and penetrate into the rectum, thus becoming a fistula.
And it will become something that will not heal. You should know the time to cauterize tumors that have fully matured, which is when the pain of the tumor subsides, the fever disappears, the redness and throbbing decrease, the tumor head softens, and all other signs subside.
And you should apply the cautery to the lowest possible part of the tumor, if that is possible, so that the discharge may flow down more easily, or to the thinnest and most prominent part of the tumor.  The cautery should be lengthwise, if the tumors are in the hands or feet.
And the places of muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries; in short, in all flat places that do not bend.  But those that bend, the cautery should be applied according to that location. And if the tumor is in fleshy places, it is best to leave it alone.
Until its maturation is complete, as we have said, for if you cauterize it before that, the discharge of pus will be prolonged, and it will be very harmful and dirty; and perhaps its lips and base will harden. Some tumors may be cauterized across the body, if necessary, or according to the needs of the affected part.
You should use a single cautery for small tumors, and a wide cautery or many incisions for large tumors, according to the size of the tumor. Some tumors may need to have the skin scraped and cut if it has become like a rag.
And it has reached a point where it is dead, as happens in many abscesses and fistulas.  Some are incised with a three-cornered incision, and some are cut in the shape of an ivy leaf, like the inguinal tumor.
And some use a circular incision, a crescent-shaped incision, and similar incisions.  And if it does not have a head, like smooth, flat tumors, then it should only be cauterized simply. And if the tumor is large, and has collected for a long time, and you cauterize it, you should not rush to remove all the pus at that time.
Rather, remove some of it, then dress the tumor until another day, then remove some more of the pus; do this repeatedly gradually until you remove it all.
Especially if the patient is weak, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an old man, for the vital spirit often dissolves with the sudden exit of pus, so the patient may die without you noticing; therefore beware of this matter with great caution.
After cauterizing these tumors, you should wipe the wound and examine it. If the wound of the tumor is small, or the incision is single and simple, then use a lint of linen or old cotton.  And if the tumor is large and the incisions from cauterization are numerous,
then you should insert a wick into each incision until some of them reach each other. And if some of the skin of the tumor has been cut or scraped away, then you should pack it with old cotton or linen lint without moisture, and dress it until the third day.
Then remove it and treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar, after having soaked a linen cloth in them, and apply it to the bleeding site repeatedly.
If the bleeding persists, you should use the management, treatment, and styptics that we have described in many places in this book and in the section. If you are in winter and the location of the tumor is very nervous, then you should moisten the pledgets with warm syrup and oil.
And place them on the site. And if you are in summer and the locations are fleshy, then you should apply pledgets soaked in water and oil or in syrup and oil, all of it cold, until the third day, as we said. Then you should unwrap the tumor and wipe it.
And use similar treatments until it heals. This is what you need to know about the general treatment of tumors. As for the detailed method, I have mentioned how to treat each tumor, categorized and summarized.
Chapter forty-one.
On the incision of tumors that appear in the scalp.
Small tumors appear in the scalp; they are a type of boil contained within membranes, their conditions resembling a chicken’s crop.  Their types are numerous: some are fatty, and some contain a moisture resembling mud.
Some contain a moisture resembling pus and broth, and so on; and some are hardened and solid.  There is no danger in incising and removing them all, unless you encounter an artery during the incision.
The procedure for incising them is to first probe them with the instrument whose image comes after this, which is called the *muddass*, so that you know what they contain. If what they contain is moisture, then incise them lengthwise with a simple incision in this manner:
Begin the incision from line B to line C. When the moisture has been emptied, then peel away the sac that contained that moisture and cut it all away, leaving nothing of it whatsoever, for it often returns if anything of it remains.
Then dip cotton in  *marham sirri* if it is present; otherwise, in salt water, and fill the wound with it, and leave it until the next day, for it will eat away what remains of the sac. Then apply the cotton with *marham sirri* again and a third time if you need to.
Until you are certain that nothing of the sac remains. Then treat the wound with ointments until it heals.  If the swelling contains fatty matter, then incise it in this manner:
A firm incision, and place hooks in the lips of the wound and peel it from every side, and exert yourself in removing the peritoneum that contains it. If an artery obstructs you, then do what I described to you before, and similarly do in the swelling if it is hardened from the incision.
And the treatment is the same as I mentioned, and the incision on the hardened swelling is easier because it is low in blood and moisture.  And some of these swellings which are in the head in some people have no moisture with them at all; and that is because I incised a swelling in...
the head of an old woman, and I found the swelling like hard, rough, white stone; it could not be broken, and if someone were to throw it, it would cut him. And it was not like the other swellings occurring in the head, other than this, like the swellings which appear in the heads of children.
And at the bases of the ears, incise them all with a simple incision, and make their bottoms from their lower parts so that the flow of the matter to the lower part is easy, then treat them with what suits them from treatment.
Chapter forty-two.
Concerning the incision on the swellings which frequently appear in the neck. These swellings frequently appear in the neck and under the armpits and in the groins, and they may appear in the rest of the body.  And that which appears in the neck of them may be one, or it may be many, and some of them develop from others.
And every swelling of them is within a special membrane, as is the case in the boils and swellings of the head as we have described, and the types of these swellings are many; some of them are calcified, and some contain fluids, and some are malignant and do not respond to treatment.
So what I saw of them that was good in condition to the touch, and its appearance was near to the color of the skin, moved to every direction, and was not attached to a nerve of the neck, nor to a vein, nor to an artery, nor was it deep-seated. Then it should be incised with a simple incision from above to below the body in this manner, from line J to line B.
And peel it from every side and stretch the lips of the skin with a hook or with two hooks or with many hooks if it needs that, as we said in the swellings of the head, and remove it little by little, and be careful not to cut a vein or a nerve, and let the scalpel not be very sharp.
Lest your hand increase the cutting or the patient be troubled, so you cut what you do not need to cut.  If you cut a vein or an artery and it hinders your work, then place in the wound powdered verdigris or some of the things that stop blood.
And bind the wound and leave it until the acuteness of the swelling subsides and the wound relaxes and begins to suppurate, for the bleeding will then stop. Then return to your work until you finish, then examine with your index finger if there remain other small tumors, then cut them and clean them.
If there is a large vein at the root of the tumor, then it should not be cut from its root, but it should be tied with a doubled, tight thread and left until it falls off by itself without harm. Then stuff the wound with old cotton which has been soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it.
And if you cut the entire tumor, then it is necessary to bring together the edges of the wound and stitch it immediately after you know that no residue remains at all.  If you see that a residue of the bone of the tumor remains,
then it is necessary that you aim at cutting to its root and base and use sutures and what we have mentioned. And as for tumors containing fluids, apply a simple poultice where their maturation appears, and make the poultice from what is below, as we said.
Then, after the poultice, use a dressing with Egyptian ointment or the like to consume what remains of the corruption, until when you see that the wound has been cleansed, then treat it with ointments that promote the growth of flesh until it heals.
Chapter forty-three.
Concerning the incision of the throat for a tumor that occurs inside the throat.
The ancients mentioned this incision in the throat, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it. This is the account of their words; as for those with angina, they should avoid the incision of the throat, for they will not benefit from it.
Because all the veins and the lung will be weak; but those who have a hot tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no illness in the windpipe, then it is necessary to use the incision of the throat to escape the harm that results from suffocation.
Then, if we want to do this, we should incise the throat below three or four rings of the windpipe, a small transverse incision between two rings, to the extent that the incision is in the membrane, not in the cartilage; this place is suitable for the incision.
Because it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels are far from it. If the physician is timid, then he should stretch the skin of the throat with a hook, then incise the skin until he reaches the windpipe, avoiding the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should incise the membrane that we described.  He will know that the windpipe has been incised by the phlegm that comes out of it, along with what is excised, and by the interruption of the voice. The wound should be left open for a time, and when the time during which suffocation was feared has passed, the edges of the wound should be joined together with the skin.
Its incision is solely in the membrane, apart from the cartilage. Then use medications that generate flesh until it heals. The author of this book said, "The explanation of all that we have mentioned is that if they see the patient's throat blocked by one of these tumors which have been mentioned.
And if the patient is close to death and his breath is about to cease, they resort to incising the throat so that the patient breathes through the wound, breathes somewhat, and is saved from death. And they are ordered to leave the wound open until the course of the disease is complete, and its course is about three days or so.
Then they are ordered to suture the wound and treat it until it heals. What I witnessed myself is that a maidservant took a knife and ran it across her throat, cutting some of the windpipe. I was summoned to treat her, and I found her weakening as a slaughtered animal weakens.  I uncovered the wound.
I found the blood that came from the wound slight, so I was certain that she had not cut a vein or jugular vein.  Air was coming from the wound. So I acted quickly, incised the wound, and treated it until it healed.  Nothing happened to the maidservant except for hoarseness in her voice, and nothing more.
And after days she returned to her best condition. From this we say that there is no danger in incising the throat.
Chapter forty-four.
Concerning the incision on the tumor that appears in the throat from the outside and is called the throat’s elephantiasis.
This tumor, which is called the throat’s elephantiasis, is a large tumor the color of the body. It is frequent in women and is of two types.
Either it is natural or accidental. As for the natural, there is no remedy for it; as for the accidental, it is of two kinds: one resembling fatty swellings, and the other resembling the tumor that results from the complication of the artery, and there is danger in incising it. Therefore, one should not at all expose it to the iron, except that which is small, if you probe and examine it with a probe and find it to resemble a fatty swelling and not be attached to anything from the veins, then incise it as you incise fatty swellings. And remove it with whatever contains it from the sac if it is in a sac; otherwise, remove it all completely, then treat the place with whatever treatment is appropriate.
Chapter forty-five.
Concerning the incision of various swellings.
Swellings are numerous in types, and I have mentioned all their types in the classification. It is necessary to explain here the difference between a swelling and an abscess, since it is difficult.  I say that an abscess is accompanied by heat, fever, and terrible pains until the boiling of the pus subsides. And the pus matures; then the fever and intensity subside. A swelling is not accompanied by heat, fever, or pain, and it is contained in a serous sac, which is its special covering. It is the color of the body, and its beginning is like a lentil, and it becomes like a blister, larger or smaller.
And it is of two types: either fatty, or it contains moisture. The colors of the moisture are many, as I mentioned in the classification.  Therefore, when you come to treat a swelling, you should probe and examine it first with the instrument called the probe, whose form is shown in the chapter following this.
Assess the size of the swelling, then remove the probe and look at what comes out after it. If fluid of any color comes out, then incise it with a simple incision, as I mentioned in other swellings. If no fluid comes out after the probe, then know that it is fatty.
Then make a firm incision on it in this manner as I have taught you, and suspend it with hooks. Carefully peel the skin from every side, and preserve the sac, if you are able, so that you remove it intact with the swelling.
If the sac is ruptured during the procedure and you cannot remove it intact—and this often happens—then remove it piece by piece until nothing remains. For if any part, however small or large, remains, the swelling will usually recur.
If it overcomes you and a small amount remains, cauterize the wound at its completion with some sharp, corrosive cautery.  Then stitch the wound and apply something on top that cools hot swellings, and treat it with all other treatments until it heals. If the swelling is large, then suture its lips and treat it with things that promote healing.
If you encounter a bleeding or non-bleeding vein and bleeding occurs, immediately cauterize the area with powdered vitriol and leave it bound for two or three days until the wound is cleaned and the bleeding stops. Then return to cutting away what remains of the swelling.
Chapter Forty-six
On the forms of instruments.
Those which are used in incision and cauterization:  images of probes, and there are three types of these, some large, some medium, and some small.
Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
They are made of iron or steel, square-ended and tightly made, to facilitate entry into tumors. These are images of probes, and they are also called "bard".  There are three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large probe:
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
They are suitable for exploring tumors, wounds, fistulas, and cavities, to find out what is inside them, such as bones and other things. They are made round, polished, and smooth like styluses, from Chinese copper, or from electrum, or from copper, or from iron, or from silver; the best are those made from electrum.
Probes may also be made of lead; they are suitable for exploring fistulas which have a bend in their depths, as they flex easily with that bend.  These also come in three types: long, medium, and short.
According to the depth needed for each fistula, and its thickness should be according to the width and narrowness of the fistula. Image of a large lead probe.
Image of a medium-sized lead probe.
Image of a small lead probe.
Images of hooks.  They are of many types: simple, meaning those with one hook, which are of three types—large, medium, and small; blind hooks, which are of three types; hooks with two hooks, which are of three types; and curved hooks with two hooks. They are of three types.  And there are hooks with three hooks, which are of three types.  Each of these types is needed in its place. Image of a large simple hook. Image of a medium simple hook. Image of a small simple hook.

Image of a small scalpel.
Its edges, with which it incises, are sharp, and the other ends are not sharp; rather, they are made like that so that one may use them in dissecting the sore when there is fear of cutting a vein or nerve, and so that the patient may be somewhat eased and find some relief from the burning that he finds when the tumor is dissected.
And these are images of the probes. They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large probe.
It is made of copper, similar to the probe with which one applies kohl, and at one end is something like a broad spoon of two layers; in its head is a hidden lancet blade, similar to a bird's tongue, which moves in and out as desired, as you see.
Images of the lancets which are inserted between the fingers when cutting tumors, without the patient feeling them. They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of a large lancet.
Images of the cupping instruments with which blood is drawn.  They are of three types, for there are large ones, medium ones, and small ones. Image of the large cupping instrument.
They are made of copper or of china, slightly elongated as you see, and are thin.  It is necessary that you have these types of cupping instruments, large and small, to quickly draw blood when necessary and when medicine is not available.
But they are not used to draw blood from every part of the body, but rather they are used in fleshy areas such as the muscles of the leg and thigh, the muscles of the arm, the breast, the abdomen, the groin, and similar moist fleshy parts.
And other small instruments may be made from them, resembling pistachio shells, in this manner:
Blood is drawn with them if it flows from a place of phlebotomy or when a vein or artery is cut.  And they may be made round in this manner:
Chapter forty-seven.
Concerning the treatment of men's breasts.
The breasts of some people may swell at the age of puberty until they resemble women's breasts, remaining swollen and unsightly. Whoever dislikes this should make a crescent-shaped incision on the breast in this manner.
From line B to line C. Then remove all the fat, then fill the wound with cauterizing medicine, then join the edges of the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals. If the breast inclines downwards and becomes flaccid due to its size, as happens to women,
it is necessary to make two crescent-shaped incisions in its upper sides, each connecting to the other at their ends so that the larger line encircles the smaller one, in this manner: From line B to line C, then flay the skin between the incisions and remove the fat, and use what we have mentioned of sutures and dressings and whatever treatment is needed until it heals.
If you are unable to cut away what should be cut away because of the patient's anxiety or because of bleeding, then you should pack the wound with cotton soaked in caustic ointment and leave it until it consumes the remaining fat, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter forty-eight.
On the excision of tumors that appear under the armpit.
These tumors which appear under the armpit are of the kind of hard swellings contained in a sac, and some contain fluids.  As for those which contain fluids, an incision should be made in a crescent shape in this manner.
From line B to line C.  If all the fluid in the tumor is evacuated, pack it with old cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the kind of hard swellings, make an incision as we mentioned in the incision for swellings. If the wound persists and pus forms, use cautery as we previously mentioned.
Chapter forty-nine.
In the incision of the tumor which appears near the artery or vein, and is called aneurism.
If the artery is injured and the skin over it heals, a tumor often results from this; similarly, a swelling and tumor can also occur in a vein.
The signs by which one knows if the tumor and swelling are from an artery or from a vein: if the tumor is from an artery, it is oblong, deep-seated in the body, and if you press the tumor with your finger, you feel as if it has a murmur.
That which is from a vein, the tumor is round on the surface of the body, and incision of these tumors is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many places of the body where they are very large; therefore, one should avoid treating them with iron.
And those that are also in the extremities or in the head should be avoided.  As for those which are a swelling of the mouth of the artery, make a longitudinal incision in the skin, then open the incision with hooks, then dissect the artery and free it from the membranes.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle underneath and pass it to the other side, and tie the artery with a doubled thread in two places, as I have shown you in ligating the two arteries in the temples; then incise with a scalpel the place between the ligatures until all the blood in it comes out.
Then the tumor will resolve, and you use treatment that produces pus until the ligatures fall off, then treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the tumor is from a vein incision, you should grasp with your hand as much of the tumor with the skin as you can, then insert a needle below the place you grasped with your hand and pass it through with a doubled thread until you bring it out from the other side. Then tie the tumor tightly with it, as I described to you in tying the uvula from both sides with the ends of the thread. If you fear the threads will slip, insert another needle with another thread under the entire tumor at the intersection of the first needle.
And tighten your threads in four places, then incise the tumor in its middle until what is in it comes out.  Then cut away the excess skin and leave what was tied. Then place on it a compress which you have soaked in a potion and oil. Then use treatment with cauterization and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On the tumor which appears from the twisting of a nerve.
Just as a tumor appears in an artery and vein, so too does a tumor appear in a nerve if a blow occurs to it or it happens from excessive fatigue or the like.  This is most common in the wrists and heels.
And in every place where the joints move, it is a soft tumor, its color resembling the rest of the body. It is, in most instances, without pain. If pressed firmly, the patient feels a kind of numbness. The tumor is not clustered deep in the body.
Rather, it is under the skin and moves in every direction, neither forward nor backward. As for that which is in the joints, it should not be approached with iron, for it might cause gangrene. As for that which is in the head or forehead...
then incise the skin with a scalpel. If the tumor is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it from its root. If it is large, hook it with a snare and peel it off, then remove it, and close the wound with sutures and treat it until it heals.
Chapter fifty-one.
On the excision of warts which appear in the abdomen.
Many people develop warts on their abdomens and other parts of their bodies.  These are called fungal warts because of their resemblance to mushrooms. Their root is thin and their head is thick; their lips may be transformed, and some are small while others become very large.
I once saw a man who had two warts on his abdomen; they were very much like mushrooms, white and thin-rooted, their lips transformed and cracked, with moisture constantly flowing from them. I cut them off; one weighed about eighteen ounces, and the other about six.
In excising them, observe whether the patient is moist and the wart is white, moist, and thin-rooted. If so, cut it with a wide scalpel, having cauteries ready in the fire, for often much blood gushes forth when they are cut.
If the bleeding is excessive, cauterize it immediately. If you see that the patient is cowardly and afraid of cutting with iron, take a strong lead thread and tie it tightly around the wart of this type, leaving it for two days, then increasing the tightness of the lead, continuing to tighten it.
Continue tightening until it affects the wart, causing it to separate and fall off by itself without effort. If the wart is thick-rooted, there is some danger and uncertainty in cutting it, especially if it is in the abdomen; however, it may be possible to cut off half or some of it.
Then cauterize it to prevent recurrence, and treat it until the wound heals. Beware of cutting a wart that is dark-colored, insensitive, and foul-looking, for it is a cancerous tumor; we shall describe cancer later.
Chapter Fifty-Two.
In the treatment of umbilical hernias.
Umbilical hernias result from many causes: either from a rupture of the peritoneum of the abdomen, from which fat or intestine protrudes, as happens in other hernias; or from blood emitted from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned; or from wind that is contained therein.
If it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum and protrusion of fat, then the tumor will be similar in color to the body, soft, painless, and of varying appearance. If it is due to the protrusion of intestine, its appearance, as we have described, will be more varied. If you press it with your fingers, it disappears and then returns; and sometimes there is gurgling. It increases greatly with the entry into a bath and with great exertion. If it is due to moisture, then it will be soft.
It does not disappear when pressed with your hand, nor does it increase or decrease. If it is due to blood, then, along with these signs, the tumor appears dark. If it is due to newly grown flesh, then the tumor is firm, hard, and remains the same size.
If it is due to wind, it will be soft to the touch. The treatment is as follows: if the umbilical hernia is due to blood from an artery or vein, or to wind, then you should refrain from treating it, for there is danger and deception in that, as I have explained in the chapter where I mentioned the tumors that arise from arteries and veins.
If the umbilical hernia is due to intestine or fat, then you should instruct the patient to restrain himself and stand upright and extended, then you should mark with ink around the entire umbilicus. Then you should instruct him to lie on his back before you. Then you should incise with a wide scalpel around the umbilicus at the place you marked with ink. Then you should extend the middle of the tumor upwards with a large hook, and then tie the place of incision with a strong thread or silk sinew, tightly.
The knot of the ligature should be a slip-knot. Then open the middle of the drawn-up tumor above the ligature, and insert your index finger and search for the intestine. If you find that the ligature has grasped it, loosen the slip-knot and push the intestine back into the abdomen. If you find fat, extend it with a hook.
And cut away its excess. If an artery or vein obstructs you, ligate it carefully and return to your work. Take two needles and thread them with strong threads, and insert the needles into the incision you made around the tumor, crisscrossing them, having passed them through. Then tighten the tumor in four places over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the drawn-up flesh decays and falls off by itself, or cut it if it becomes thin and decayed, then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If the umbilical hernia is from flesh that has grown there,
or from moisture, then it is necessary that you constrict the tumor as we said, and remove the blood or moisture that you find in it, then treat it with what will close the place.
Chapter Fifty-Three.
In the treatment of cancer.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of cancer and how the way to treat it with medicines and the warning against treating it with iron lest it ulcerates, and we have mentioned the cancer that develops in the womb and the warning against treating it.
And the ancients mentioned that whenever the cancer is in a place that can be completely excised, like the cancer that is in the breast or in the thigh and similar easily removable organs, especially if it is small and beginning, but if it is old and large, then you should not approach it.
For I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me who has achieved that, and the procedure, if it is possible as we said, is that you first purge the patient of black bile several times, then you bleed him if there is clear fullness in the veins.
Then you position the patient in a position that allows for the procedure, then you apply to the cancer the hooks suitable for it, then you scrape it from every side along with the skin completely until nothing of its roots remains, and let the blood flow and do not stop it quickly.
Rather, press the areas and drain all the thick blood with your hand or with whatever instruments you can, and if you encounter during the procedure profuse bleeding from a severed artery or vein, cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
Chapter fifty-four.
On the treatment of the boil.
We have explained in the classification the types of dropsy, how the water accumulates, and the signs of each type and its treatment with medicines.  That which is treated with iron is only the ascitic type alone; the tympanitic type and the fleshy type are not at all approached with iron.
For that is fatal. If you have treated this type of ascitic boil with medicines and your treatment has not been effective, then look: if the patient is extremely weak or has another illness besides the boil, such as…
a cough or diarrhea, and the like, then beware of treating him with iron, for that is dangerous.  If you see that the patient is strong, has no illness other than the boil alone, and is neither a child nor an old man, then the procedure is to have the patient stand before you. and an attendant behind him squeezing his abdomen with his hands and pushing the water downwards towards the pubis; then take a lancet like this:
limited on both sides, long, with a defined tip like a lancet, except that it has a slight curve so that it does not go too far into the intestine during the procedure and injure it. Then observe if the boil has originated from the area of the intestines.
It is necessary that you make the incision three fingers' breadth below the navel, directly above the pubis. If the boil has originated from a liver disease, let your incision be three fingers' breadth to the left of the navel; if it has originated from a spleen disease, let the incision be on the right side, three fingers' breadth away.
Nor should the incision be on the side on which the patient wants to lie down, lest the pus flow to that weak place. Then pierce the skin completely with the instrument, then insert the instrument into that incision and raise your hand.
with the lancet between the skin and the peritoneum, as if you are flaying it, and the amount you flay should be about the size of a fingernail or so; then pierce the peritoneum until the lancet reaches the empty space, which is the place of the water, then take it out and insert into the opening the instrument which has this shape.
It is like a small tube made of a thin reed, made of silver, or copper, or smooth, polished lead; it has a small opening at its lower end, and three openings on its sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And one may sharpen its end in the shape of a pen nib, in this manner:
At its upper end is a ring; for when the instrument reaches the water, it will immediately flow down the instrument, and you will evacuate a moderate amount of water at a time; for if you evacuate more than is necessary at one time, the patient may die from the dissolution of his vital spirit.
Or he may suffer a faint that approaches death; but evacuate according to his strength and what the patient's condition indicates to you, from the strength of his pulse and the good color of his complexion; then remove the instrument and the water will be retained, for it will be retained immediately.
Because of the skin which covers the opening in the peritoneum, which I have instructed you to suture in that manner; then you may reinsert the instrument on another day, if you see the patient able to bear it.
And you will also evacuate a small amount of water; do this for several days, and you are responsible and must guard against error, until only a little water remains; but if you fear for the patient and leave a large amount of water, treat him by burial in hot sand.
And profuse sweating in the bath and sun, and patience with thirst, and treat him with drying medicines until he recovers; and cauterize the stomach, liver, and spleen after evacuating the water, as I have described above.
Chapter fifty-five.
In the treatment of children who are born with their urinary passages imperforate, or with a narrow or misplaced opening.
Some boys may be born with their anus imperforate; it is necessary to perforate it as soon as they are born.
With a very fine scalpel, in this manner:
Then place a thin lead nail in the opening, and bind it and keep it there for three or four days.  When he wants to urinate, remove it, and after urination, replace it. If you do not use lead, it is possible that the urine flowing to the place will not allow it to close.
As for him whose opening is narrow, he is treated with lead as we have said for many days until it widens.  And those whose opening is misplaced, that is, some are born with the opening at the end of the rectum, and are unable to urinate forward.
Until he lifts the urethra upwards by hand, and it is not born before that, since the semen cannot reach the uterus straight, and this is a very ugly condition.  The method of treatment is that the patient lies on his back.
Then stretch his rectum with your left hand with a strong pull, and incise the tip of the urethra with a sharp blade or scalpel, the size of a pen, or as if you were carving something so that its middle protrudes, similar to a penis, and the opening falls in the middle as it should.
And be careful during your work to avoid bleeding, for this often occurs; therefore, stem the bleeding and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter fifty-six.
Concerning the ulcer that appears in the foreskin and penis, and blackness, corruption, and adhesion of the foreskin to the penis.
This ulcer often appears in the urethra; it is a hard fleshy growth, and there is benign and malignant.  The benign should be tied off with a fine ligature.
And cut it until you remove it all, then apply a cotton swab soaked in Egyptian ointment, then treat it afterwards with date-palm ointment until it heals. But if the ulcer is malignant and dark in color, then cauterization should be used after cutting and removing it.
If the ulcer is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised man, and part of the ulcer is inside the foreskin and part outside, then you should remove the ulcer that is inside first, until it heals; then treat the outside.
Because if you treat them both at the same time, you do not prevent the foreskin from being perforated.  And it may also appear in the labia and in the foreskin, blackness and corruption; then you should remove everything that has blackened and threatens to corrupt or has corrupted.
Then apply honey with crushed and sifted pomegranate peel and  cress; then treat it with other treatments until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use cauterization with a crescent-shaped cautery of this shape:
For cauterization is beneficial for both conditions, I mean bleeding and the wound if it becomes corrupted. If the glans is eroded and completely destroyed at some time, then you should insert a lead tube into the urethra so the patient can urinate through it. As for the adhesion of the foreskin to the glans…
This adhesion occurs in those whose foreskin is intact and who have not been circumcised.  It may also occur due to a wound or swelling. Then you should separate it with a blunt scalpel until the bond is broken and the glans is freed from every side.
If it is difficult to distinguish them completely, then you should separate some of the glans and some of the foreskin.  Because the foreskin is thin, it may quickly perforate due to its thinness. Then separate the foreskin from the glans with a thin linen cloth soaked in cold water so that they do not adhere again.
Then treat with an astringent drink until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Seven.
On the cleansing of boys and the treatment of what befalls them of ailments.
Circumcision is nothing other than the separation of a connection like other wounds, except that since it is done by our will and its use is especially in boys, it is necessary that we describe the best procedure in it.
And the easiest path leading to safety.  I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not used in their laws, but rather it is something we have acquired.
by experience. And that is that I found the majority of the surgeons and barbers using cleansing with the knife and with the scissors, and they use the forceps and ligature with thread and cutting with the fingernail.  I have tried all these methods.
I did not find better than cleansing with scissors and ligature with thread, because cleansing with the knife often injures the skin, because the skin of the prepuce is two layers, so perhaps the upper skin is cut and the lower layer remains.
Then one is forced to make another cut and renewed pain, and cleansing with forceps does not prevent the cutting of the end of the urethra, because it might enter its hole. As for cleansing with the fingernail, the skin might slip and your work is spoiled, or the boy's skin might be naturally short...
so often they are born like that, not needing cleansing. I have seen that. As for cleansing with scissors and ligature with thread, experience has revealed its advantage to me, because the cut of the scissors is proportionate, because the blade from above is like the blade from below.
So when you squeeze your hand with the proportion of the two blades, you cut with one measure and in one time, so the thread becomes like a wall for the skin of the urethra from all sides, with no mistake at all. The way to work, first, is to reassure the boy.
Especially if he is one who understands a little that you are only tying the thread in his urethra and leaving him until another day, then rejoice and please him in every way you can and that he accepts with his mind, then have him stand before you erect.
And let him not be sitting, and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so the boy's eye does not fall on them at all, nor on anything of the instruments. Then you insert your hand into his urethra and inflate the skin and lift it up until the head of the urethra comes out.
Then cleanse it from whatever dirt gathers in it, then tie the marked place with a doubled thread, then tie a second ligature a little below it, then hold with your thumb and forefinger the lower ligature firmly, and cut between the two ligatures. Then quickly lift the skin upwards and bring out the head of the urethra, then let the blood flow a little, for it is better and causes less swelling of the urethra, then wipe it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some burnt dry gourd ash, for it is the best I have tried, or finely ground barley, for that too is excellent.
Then quickly lift the skin upwards and bring out the head of the urethra, then let the blood flow a little, for it is better and causes less swelling of the urethra, then wipe it with a damp cloth, then sprinkle on it some burnt dry gourd ash, for it is the best I have tried, or finely ground barley, for that too is excellent. Then apply over the wound from above a cloth of a boiled white egg in rosewater, beaten with fresh, fragrant rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, then treat it with the other treatments until it heals.
And this is the image of the scissors which are suitable for circumcision:
Let them be sharp, cutting, not crooked, with a nail-like point, and let the length of the blades be equal to the length of the handles. As for the mistake which occurs in circumcision, sometimes the whole or part of the inner skin is inverted during the cutting, so you should stretch it out at once with your fingernail before the place swells.
And cut it evenly; if you are unable to hold it with your fingernail, then pull it with a hook and cut it. If three days have passed and what is under the head of the urethra remains swollen and inflamed, then leave it until the acute inflammation subsides and then remove it gently.
And cut it as seems best to you, and be careful of the head of the urethra, for if something of the head of the urethra is cut, it does no harm; treat it with what heals the wound from among the caustics which we described in the chapter on caustics.
And if more of the skin than necessary is cut and it retracts upwards, this also does little harm; treat it with what we have mentioned until it heals.
Chapter fifty-eight.
On the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Urine retained in the bladder is due to its obstruction by a stone, or clotted blood, or pus, or a growth, or something similar.  If you treat this with the various treatments described in the classification,
and the urine does not flow, and you see that its retention is due to a stone that has lodged in the neck of the bladder, then the patient should be placed kneeling, then a man should mount his back, and stretch his belly towards his back, and the patient should hold himself as much as he can.
Then the neck of the bladder will be forced to push the stone backwards, and the urine will flow. If it does not flow with what we have mentioned, and the matter becomes severe for the patient, then it is necessary to use the instrument called a catheter for its removal, whose image is this:
It is made of silver, and it is thin, smooth, hollow like a bird's quill in thinness, about a span and a half long, having a gentle funnel at its head. The method of drawing off urine with it is that you take a doubled thread and tie to its end wool or cotton firmly.
And you insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the catheter and cut with scissors any excess of wool so that what enters the tube blocks it like a button. Then you lubricate the catheter with oil, or butter, or egg white, and the patient sits on a chair.
And you clean his bladder and urethra with moist ointments, or oil and lukewarm water. Then you insert the catheter into the urethra gently until it reaches the root of the urethra, then you bend the urethra upwards towards the navel, then you push the catheter inside it.
Until, when the urethra is completely bent, then you push the catheter inside until, when it reaches near the rectum, you incline the penis downwards with the catheter inside it, then you push it until it reaches the bladder and the patient feels it has reached something empty.
And it is made in this manner because the passage through which the urine passes is tortuous. Then you pull the thread with the wool gently; then the urine follows the wool, then you take it out and the urine flows, and you return the catheter.
You continue to do this until the bladder is emptied and the patient feels relief.
Chapter fifty-nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
And the instruments suitable for this are made of silver or hollow ivory, having a long tube as thin as pus, and you intend to instill liquids and medicines into it.  This is done with an instrument called a syringe, and this is its image:
It is made of silver or hollow ivory, having a long tube as thin as a hair, entirely hollow except for the tip, which is solid and has three holes, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
And the hollow part in which the piston is, should be just large enough to fit it, without excess, so that when you draw something up with it, it is drawn up, and when you push it, it is pushed out, just like the syringe that throws oil in sea battles.
If you wish to introduce liquids into the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the liquid and draw the piston upwards; then the liquid will be drawn into the body of the syringe. Then insert its tip into the urethra, as described in the section on catheters, and then push the liquid with the piston.
Then that liquid will reach the bladder immediately, until the patient feels it.  This is the image of a fine clyster also used to inject the bladder:
It is made of silver or lead, its upper end resembling a small funnel, and below it a groove in which the ligature is placed. Then take a camel's bladder and put in it the liquid you wish to inject into the bladder, and tie it tightly between the two grooves with a doubled thread.
Warm the liquid slightly over a fire, then insert the tip of the clyster into the urethra, then squeeze the bladder containing the liquid firmly with your hand until the patient feels that the liquid has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it, and pierce it all around. Then insert a strong thread into those holes as you go around, then gather the circle as you gather a cloth, after having placed in it what you wish of liquids, ointments, and waters.
Then tie it to the instrument and do with it as you did with the bladder, squeezing with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On the extraction of a stone.
We have mentioned in the classification the types of stones and their treatment with medication, and described the difference between stones generated in the kidneys and stones generated in the bladder, and the signs of all of that, and mentioned the stones in which one uses the hand and incision.
And that is the stone generated specifically in the bladder, and that which becomes fixed in the urethra, and I am describing that with a clear and concise explanation.
So I say that the stone generated in the bladder is mostly found in boys, and among its signs is that urine exits the bladder similar to water in its thinness.
And sand appears in it, and he scratches his penis and plays with it, and it often hangs down then spreads, and the anus protrudes with it in many of them, and it is easy to remove from boys until they reach fourteen years, and it is difficult in the elderly, and as for young men, it is moderate between that.
And the one whose stone is larger, his treatment is easier, and the small one is the opposite.  If we proceed to treatment, then it is necessary first that the patient be given an enema to expel all the feces in his intestines, for it may prevent the finding of the stone upon examination.
Then the patient is taken by his feet and shaken and jolted downwards so that the stone descends to the neck of the bladder, or he jumps from a high place several times, then you seat him between your hands erect, and his hands under his thighs, so that the whole bladder inclines downwards, then examine him.
And palpate him from the outside. If you feel the stone in the space, immediately begin to incise it. If it does not fall under your touch at all, then you should lubricate the index finger with oil from the left hand if the patient is a boy, or the middle finger.
If he is a fully grown boy, then insert it into his anus and search for the stone until, when it falls under your finger, you move it little by little to the neck of the bladder, then press on it with your finger and push it outwards towards the place you wish to incise.
And you order a servant to compress the bladder with his hand, and you order another servant to stretch with his right hand the labia upwards, and with his other hand he stretches the skin under the labia away from the place where the incision will be. Then take the lancet whose form is this:
And incise between the anus and the labia, not in the middle, but towards the left buttock. The incision should be on the stone itself, and your finger in the anus, and you press it outwards obliquely so that the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, to the extent that the stone can emerge from it.
Not larger, for perhaps the finger in the anus will press the stone during the incision and it will come out without difficulty. And know that there may be stones which have angles and edges, and thus their removal is difficult.
And some are smooth, resembling an acorn and rounded, and their removal is easy.  But those with angles and edges, increase the incision a little; and if it does not come out like this, then you should try to grasp it, either with a firm forceps whose end is like a file.
to hold the stone so that it does not escape from it; or else insert a delicate instrument with a hooked end underneath it. And if you cannot manage it, widen the incision a little. And if a quantity of blood overcomes you, stanch it with alum.
If there are more than one, push the largest one first towards the opening of the bladder, then incise upon it, then push the smaller ones afterwards; and thus you do if there are more than two.  If it is very large, then it is foolish to make a large incision upon it, because it exposes the patient to one of two things.
Either he will die, or he will suffer a constant dribbling of urine because the place will not heal at all. But try to push it out, or try to break it with forceps until you remove it in pieces.
When you have finished your work, cauterize the wound with myrrh, aloes, and cyperus, and bind it, and place upon it a cloth moistened with oil and wine, or with rose oil and cold water, to calm the hot inflammation; then let the patient lie on his back, and do not unbind the bandage until the third day.
When it is loosened, wash the place with plenty of water and oil, then treat it with palm-tree ointment and basil ointment until it heals. If there occurs in the wound excessive hot inflammation, ulceration, and the like, such as blood clotting in the bladder and preventing urination – this is known by the passage of blood with the urine –
then insert your finger into the wound and remove that blood; for if it remains, it leads to corruption and suppuration of the bladder.  Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and treat each type with its corresponding therapy until it heals.
In all the times of treatment, it is necessary to bind and bring together the thighs to secure the medicaments which are applied to the place. If the stone is small and has entered the passage of the penis and become fixed in it, and urination is prevented, then treat it with what I have described before it comes to incision.
Often I have dispensed with incision by this treatment, which I have tested; it is to take a probe of steel, which has this shape:
The end triangular, sharp, fixed in a stick; then take a thread and tie it around the penis below the stone, lest it return to the bladder; then gently introduce the steel probe into the urethra until the probe reaches the stone itself.
And turn the probe in the stone itself little by little, intending to pierce it until you pass through it to the other side; then the urine will flow immediately. Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from outside the penis, for it will crumble and come out with the urine, and the patient will recover.
But if this treatment is not feasible for you because of some impediment that prevents you, then tie a thread below the stone and another thread above the stone, then incise over the stone in the penis itself between the two ligatures, and then remove it.
Then untie the ligature and clean the clotted blood which has formed in the wound.  The reason for tying the thread below the stone is to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other ligature above is so that when the thread is untied after removal of the stone, the skin will return to its place and cover the wound.
Therefore, when you tie the upper thread, you should raise the skin upwards so that it will return when you are finished and cover the wound, as we said.
Chapter sixty-one.
On the removal of stones from women.
Stones rarely develop in women; but if a woman is afflicted with a stone, its treatment is difficult and impossible for many reasons. One is that the woman may be a virgin, and the second is that you will not find a woman who will allow herself to be examined by a physician.
If she is chaste or one of his relatives, and the third is that you will not find a woman skilled in this craft, especially in manual work, and the fourth is that the place of the incision for the stone in women is distant from the position of the stone, so it needs a deep incision.
And in that there is danger. If necessity demands it, then a skilled female physician should be sought, but they are rarely found. If you cannot find one, then seek a chaste and gentle male physician, or get a skilled midwife experienced in women's matters, or a woman who has some knowledge in this craft.
Then you should prepare her and instruct her to do everything you order her to do in examining for the stone first. That is, to see if the woman is a virgin; then she should insert her finger into her rectum and search for the stone. If she finds it and presses it under her finger...
then you should order her to incise it. If she is not a virgin but a widow, then order the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder and pressing it well.
If she finds it, then she should pass it from the mouth of the bladder downwards as far as she can until she reaches the origin of the thigh, then she should incise it opposite the middle of the vagina at the origin of the thigh, from whichever side she can and feels the stone in that area.
And her finger should not move from the stone, pressing under it. Let the incision be small at first, then insert the probe into that small incision. If she feels the stone, then increase the incision as much as she knows is necessary for the stone to come out. And know that the types of stones are many.
Some are small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, and branched.  Know their types so you can determine what you need. If the blood overcomes you, sprinkle powdered verdigris on the area and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then return to your work.
until the stone comes out. And make sure you prepare with yourself the instruments that I mentioned in removing stones from men to help you in your work. If the bleeding overwhelms you and you know from the pulse of the blood that it is from a severed artery, then place the forceps on the area.
And tighten it firmly with bandages and leave it; do not revisit it and leave the stone; do not remove it, for perhaps the patient will die. Then treat the wound. And if the severity of the bleeding subsides after a few days and the area becomes infected, return to your work until you remove the stone.
Chapter Sixty-Two.
On the incision on the watery membrane.
The watery membrane is merely an accumulation of moisture in the white peritoneum which is under the skin of the scrotum surrounding the testicle, and it is called the scrotum.  It may be in a special membrane prepared by nature in one part of the testicle.
So that one might think it is another testicle.  It is between the skin of the scrotum and the white peritoneum that we mentioned, but this occurs rarely. This membrane is generated from weakness affecting the testicles, so this material gathers there.  It may also occur from a blow to the testicles.
And this moisture is of many colors: sometimes it is yellowish, sometimes bloody red, sometimes dark and dirty, sometimes watery white, which is most common.  The signs by which it is known are...
Where the water gathers, if it is in the white peritoneum which we mentioned, then the swelling is somewhat elongated and round, like the shape of an egg, and the testicle does not appear because the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
And if the moisture is in a special membrane, then the swelling is round on one side of the testicle.
Because of this, a person imagines that it is another testicle. And if the moisture is between the skin of the scrotum and the white peritoneum, then it is palpable. But if you want to know the color of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe whose image we presented earlier; what comes out after the probe, you judge by what is inside.
If we proceed to treatment with cautery, it is necessary that you order the patient to be bled if he is able and you see that his body is full. Then he should lie on his back on something slightly raised, and you place many cloths under him. Then you sit on his left.
And you order a servant to sit on his right, extending his penis to one side of the scrotum and towards the groin. Then you take a broad scalpel and incise the scrotum lengthwise from the middle to near the pubis.
And make the incision straight, parallel to the line that divides the scrotum in half, until you reach the white peritoneum which contains [the testicle].  Then peel it back, and be careful not to incise it. Your peeling should be from the side that adheres to the testicle more, and you should complete the peeling as much as you can.
Then you widely open the peritoneum filled with water and remove all the water. Then separate the edges of the incision with hooks and stretch the peritoneum upwards, but do not touch the containing scrotum skin. Cut the peritoneum however you can cut it, either all at once or piece by piece.
Especially its thin side, for if you do not completely cut it, you cannot be sure that the water will not return. If the testicle emerges from its skin during your work, then when you have finished cutting the peritoneum, return it, and then join the edges of the scrotum skin with sutures.
Then treat it like other wounds until it heals. If the testicle is already damaged by another disease, then it is necessary to ligate the vessels in the spermatic cord for fear of bleeding, then cut the testicle from the spermatic cord and remove the testicle, then treat it as we have described.
If the collected water is in both sides, know that they are two hydroceles. Incise the other side as you did the first, and if it is convenient for you to do it all at once, then do so.  Then wipe away the blood.
And insert into the incisions wool that you have soaked in oil or rose ointment, and on the outside place other wool soaked in a drink and oil, and spread it over the testicles and the flanks of the abdomen, and place folded cloths on top—these are the pledgets. And tie them from above with a bandage which has six ends, in this manner:
Then two cloths are taken, sewn together, and stuffed with fluffy wool in this manner. The ends used to tie it are made of cotton or wet wool and gathered tightly in the waistband of the trousers; one end is taken to the buttocks and to the back.
The second is taken towards the pubis, and the two ends to the thighs below, and the remaining two ends to the groins. All the tightening is gathered in the waistband of the trousers. This hydrocele may also be treated by cautery instead of incision with an instrument.
This is done by taking a gentle, knife-like cautery and incising the skin of the scrotum with it while it is hot, as we have described, until the white peritoneum containing the water is exposed. Then take another cautery of this shape:
It resembles the Greek eye. Then cauterize that peritoneum with it while it is hot until all the moisture comes out. Then stretch the peritoneum with hooks and peel off the containing layer with the cautery, cutting it as much as you can until you excise all of it, being careful not to touch the testicle with the fire.
Know that this procedure is safer and prevents more bleeding, and is better than the incision method.  If during the incision or cautery you encounter a hot swelling, bleeding, or something else, then you should treat whatever arises with the appropriate treatment as described above.
If the patient is cowardly and cannot endure this procedure because of its unpleasantness, then use cauterization as I describe, if it is confirmed by the signs we have previously mentioned.
If the hydrocele is watery, then the patient should sit on a high stool, and then cauterize the lower part of the swelling with a wide scalpel. Make the cauterization along the length of the body, and make the opening wide so that all the water flows out. Then apply cotton to the area and bandage it.
Leave it to drain the remaining water, then treat it until the wound heals. If the water does not come out during cauterization because the tunica albuginea obstructs the opening of the wound and prevents the water from coming out,
then you should insert a goose feather or the instrument used to extract the water from hydroceles, the image of which was shown previously, or slightly enlarge the opening of the wound.
Know that the water may return and collect after about six months. If it collects, cauterize it in the same way, and the patient should abstain from intercourse during those days.
Chapter Sixty-Three.
On the incision on the fleshy membrane and its treatment.
Know that an incision on this membrane is very dangerous and often leads to death; therefore, we advise leaving it alone and avoiding it, although I will mention how to treat it and the various types of swelling.
I say that many swellings occur in the bodies which constitute the female genitalia; this occurs for many reasons, either from excessive heat descending to the genitalia, or from a blow. The swelling is the same colour as the body and contains no water.
The swelling may be soft, or it may be hardened, dark in colour and insensitive. It may result from the obstruction and swelling of the arteries, as previously mentioned, or from the swelling of the veins.  If it is from the swelling of the arteries, this is known by the dispersion of the swelling.
If you press it with your fingers, it should not disperse. As for that which results from the swelling of the veins, nothing of it disperses when pressed with the fingers. This type may be incised, along with the surrounding flesh.
You should incise the skin of the testicle, then draw the testicle upwards and bring it out from the white peritoneum. Free the spermatic cord from the vessels, ligate the vessels, and cut the spermatic cord after freeing it from all sides of the testis. If the testicle is adhered to those growing tissues.
Then you should remove and cut the testicle. If the adhesion is between parts of the peritoneum or between the vessels, you should free and cut all that adhesion with a circular cut.
If the growth of flesh is in the place of adhesion which is behind, you should cut it all away and remove the testicle as we said. When your work is complete, dress the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and syrup, then treat it with other treatments until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-four.
On the treatment of hydrocele with a hernia.
A hernia is a twisted tumor, somewhat twisted, similar to a bunch of grapes, with relaxation of the testicles, making movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient. The treatment of this condition is similar to what has been mentioned before.
However, it is necessary to mention the procedure as the ancients did. I say that you should have the patient sit on a high chair, then push the testicle upwards, then grasp the skin of the scrotum with your fingers along with the vessels which are near the penis.
And let an assistant hold it and stretch it tightly, then you incise with a broad, sharp scalpel, making an oblique incision along the vessels until the vessels are exposed, then dissect from each side as I described to you in the dissection of arteries in the temples, then insert a needle with doubled thread.
And tie it at the first point where the hernia appeared and tie it also at the end, then incise it in the middle with a vertical incision along its length and remove the collected turbid, corrupted fluids.
Then treat the wound with the treatment of other wounds that you want to heal for a while, so that the vessels that nourish one of the testicles fall off; there is no harm in that.  If the hernia affects all the vessels, then it is necessary to remove one testicle with the vessels, lest the testicle lack nourishment. before cutting the vessels, so that they wither and are of no use.
Chapter sixty-five.
In the treatment of intestinal hernia.
This hernia occurs from a fissure that appears in the peritoneum extending over the abdomen near the groins from the abdominal cavity, so the intestine descends from that hernia into one of the testicles.
And this hernia is either from a fissure in the peritoneum or from its extension.  These two types occur from many causes, either a blow, a jump, a shout, lifting something heavy, and the like.  Its sign, if it is from an extension of the peritoneum, is that it occurs little by little over a long time.
It does not occur suddenly, and the swelling is even to the depth because the peritoneum constricts the intestine.  Its sign, if it is from a fissure in the peritoneum, is that it initially causes great pain suddenly, and the swelling is uneven, appearing under the skin nearby.
That is by the exit of the intestine and its passage outside of the peritoneum.  And the omentum may exit with the intestine, and this hernia is called intestinal and omental. And it may be with wind, and the feces may flow into the intestine and be retained there, resulting in the death of the patient.
Because it causes severe pain and gurgling, especially if constricted.  Treatment of these types of illness with cautery is dangerous, so one should be wary of it. The method of treatment is to instruct the patient to return the intestine by hand into his abdomen if it is possible to return it.
Then he lies on his back in your hands and raises his legs. Then you stretch the skin next to the groin upward and incise all the skin of the scrotum lengthwise. Then you insert hooks into the edges of the incision to the extent needed to open the incision with them.
And the incision should be such that the testicle can exit from it. Then you dissect the membranes under the skin of the scrotum until the white, hard peritoneum is exposed on all sides. Then insert your index finger into the area behind the testicle.
Between the white peritoneum under the skin of the testicle and the second peritoneum, and with it you loosen the adhesions behind the testicle. Then, with the right hand, you draw it toward the inside of the scrotum's skin.  With this, you stretch the white peritoneum upward with the left hand and raise the testicle with the peritoneum toward the incision.
And you instruct the assistant to pull the testicle upward, and you completely loosen the adhesions from behind.  And you search with your finger lest there be something of the twisted intestine in the hard white peritoneum. If you find something, push it down into the abdomen.
Then you take a needle with thick thread, twisted from ten threads, and insert it at the end of the peritoneum under the scrotum's skin next to the incision. Then cut the ends of the thread's twist until there are four threads. Then you place some of them on top of each other firmly, and with them you tie the peritoneum—which we said is under the skin of the scrotum—tightly on two sides. Then you also twist the ends of the threads and tie them tightly so that nothing from the vessels that nourish it can reach it. Lest a hot swelling result from that, and also make a second ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it less than two fingers. After these two ligatures, leave of the peritoneum under the skin of the scrotum the amount of a finger bone.
Lest a hot swelling result from that, and also make a second ligature outside the first ligature, distant from it less than two fingers. After these two ligatures, leave of the peritoneum under the skin of the scrotum the amount of a finger bone. And you cut all the rest in a circle and remove the testicle with it. Then you make an incision at the bottom of the scrotum's skin from which blood and pus will flow, as we described before. Then use wool soaked in oil and place it in the wound, and use the ligature that we described.
And one may cauterize the white peritoneum which we mentioned after cutting it, cautiously to avoid bleeding, for that often occurs. And leave the ligature until it falls off by itself. If it is slow to fall off, then loosen it with warm water and apply something that will make it sweat until it falls off.
Then treat the wound with all the treatments for wounds until it heals.
Chapter sixty-six.
Concerning the windy hernia.  This windy hernia—I have seen no one dare treat it with iron. The ancients mentioned that it should be done as we described in the hernia with a pouch, that is, that the vessels should be gently ligated below after incising them.
Then incise in the middle and treat the tumor with what opens it until the vessels fall away, and treat the wound as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter sixty-seven.
Concerning the hernia which is in the groin.
A hernia may appear in the groin, as we said, so the place swells but nothing of the intestine descends into the scrotum; and if it does descend, it is slight and returns at all times.
But if time passes, the tear in the peritoneum increases until the intestine and epiploon descend into the scrotum; and this happens from the extension of the peritoneum which is in the groin, as we said. That is because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes and the place swells and protrudes, and its treatment is by cauterization, as I have previously described.
And it may be treated with the cautery in this manner: the patient lies on his back between your hands, then you incise the swollen, protruding hernia transversely to the extent of three fingers, then you separate the peritoneum which is under the skin.
Until the white peritoneum which follows it is exposed, then you take a probe and place it on the protruding part of the peritoneum and push it into the depth of the abdomen, then you sew the two protruding parts of the peritoneum to the end of the probe, and you adhere one to the other with the suture.
Then you remove the probe, and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle or anything else, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal hernia, then you treat it with the treatment of wounds.
Then, if the threads are cut, I clean them and dress the wound until it heals, for the peritoneum contracts and the protrusion of the hernia does not increase.
Cauterization is better in this location because it is closer to safety.
Chapter sixty-eight.
On the relaxation of the scrotum.
The skin of the scrotum often relaxes in some people without the flesh inside relaxing, and its appearance is unsightly.  Whoever wishes to treat it should place the patient on his back.
And he cuts away all the relaxed skin on the thick skin, then brings the edges together. And if you wish, first suture the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches, making sure the sutures are secure, then cut between the sutures.
Then treat it as you would treat other wounds until it heals and the stitches fall out.
Chapter Sixty-Nine.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our law.
Therefore, I should not have mentioned it in this book. However, I have mentioned it for two reasons: one, so that the physician may know about it if he is asked, and know how to treat someone who has undergone it; and the other, because we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit.
Such as lambs, goats, cats, and similar animals.  I say that castration is of two types: either by crushing or by incision and cutting.  That which is done by crushing is done in this way: we seat the animal in hot water until its testicles relax, soften, and hang down.
Then crush them with your hand until they dissolve and are no longer perceptible to the touch. As for castration by incision and cutting, you should hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its testicles with your left hand, then tie the cords and make a single incision on each testicle.
Until the testicles emerge, then cut them off after you have peeled them, and leave nothing of the membranes except the thin membrane that is on the vessels. This type of castration is better than that which is done by crushing.
Because crushing may leave something of the testicles, so the animal may still desire mating. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
In the treatment of the hermaphrodite.
The hermaphrodite in men is of two types: one is that which appears in the area behind the scrotum or in the skin of the scrotum between the testicles, a shape like a woman's vulva with hair, and urine may flow from that which is in the scrotum's skin.
As for women, there is one type, and it is above the vulva on the pubis like small male testicles protruding outward; one of them is like a man's penis, and the two are like testicles.  And the treatment of the three types.
The two types in men and the one type in women: it is necessary to cut away that excess flesh until its trace is gone, then treat it with the treatment of other wounds until it heals. As for the second type in men, from which urine flows, which is in the scrotum's skin, there is no action in it, nor is there benefit from seeing it.
Chapter seventy-one.
On the excision of the clitoris and the protruding flesh from the vulvas of women.
The clitoris may exceed the natural state to the point of being unsightly and unpleasant. In some women, it may even become large, like that of men, and lead to sexual intercourse.
It is necessary to grasp the excess of the clitoris with your hand or with forceps and cut it, but do not go too far in cutting, especially in the depth of the root, lest bleeding occur.
Then treat it with the treatment of wounds until it heals. As for the growing flesh, it is flesh that grows in the mouth of the womb until it fills it.
And sometimes it protrudes outwards like a tail. Therefore, some of the ancients call it the "tail disease."  It should be cut like the clitoris, and treated until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Two.
On the treatment of prolapse.
Prolapse is when a woman's vagina is not perforated, or the perforation is small. This may be congenital or acquired.  The acquired type results from a pre-existing condition, such as an excess growth of flesh.
or a thin or thick membrane. This may be located in the depth of the uterus, or on its sides, or above or below it. It prevents intercourse, conception, and childbirth, and may even prevent menstruation.  This is determined by examination by a midwife.
If the obstruction is apparent and near the surface, then if it is not apparent, she should examine it with her fingers or a probe. If the obstruction is from a thin membrane and is near the labia, then proceed to pierce it.  This is done by placing something like pledgets on the labia, then placing both thumbs together.
The woman lies on her back with her legs spread apart. Then, she forcefully stretches the labia until she pierces the thin membrane and opens the obstruction. Then she takes wool, soaks it in oil, and places it on the area. The woman has intercourse every day so that the area does not close up again.
If the membrane is thick and dense, then it should be incised with a wide scalpel resembling an aspen leaf. If the obstruction is from an excess growth of flesh, then suspend it with hooks and cut it.  You should have styptics at hand which do not cause stinging, such as oak galls, acacia gum, and frankincense, mixed with egg white.
Then use a wide lead tube so that the wound does not close quickly; keep it in place for several days. Use a wick of dry linen, then treat it with the usual treatment for healing until it is cured.  Another fleshy growth may appear in the uterus; it should be cut in the same manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor. A cancerous tumor which is in the uterus should never be treated with iron.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, warts, and red pustules which appear in the vulva of women.
As for hemorrhoids, it is a swelling of the mouths of the veins until much blood constantly flows from them. If hemorrhoids are present for some time they become warts.  Their types and signs have been mentioned in the classification; we will mention them here.
What of them accepts treatment and what does not accept treatment. I say that hemorrhoids and warts, if they are in the depth of the uterus and do not appear to the touch, have no treatment with iron; and that which is of them at the mouth of the uterus, which is felt, is what is treated.
Then it is necessary that the woman enter a cool house, then she should stretch the warts with a scraper or a rough cloth and cut them from their roots; then she should apply to them, when the blood flows, one of the styptics which stops the blood without cauterization.
Such as acacia,  [a type of]  Sumac, frankincense, and the like; then she should raise her legs to the wall for an hour, then lower them into cold water. If the bleeding continues, then seat her in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, gallnuts, and the like; then take barley flour, knead it with honey and vinegar.
And apply it as a compress to her back. If the blood stops, otherwise apply cupping glasses to the loins and breasts without restriction; then take wool, dip it in the juice of the plant *tharthith* or the juice of *Plantago* or the juice of the branches of *al-‘illiq* with a gallnut potion and apply it to the place.
If the swelling subsides, then treat the area with ointment until it heals. As for the red pustule, it resembles the heads of the *hashā* [a type of insect], rough in appearance; it should be cut off as much as appears, according to what I mentioned concerning warts, and treated until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Four.
Concerning the bursting of an abscess which occurs in the uterus.
Many types of tumors may occur in the uterus, such as cancer, hardened tumors, ulcers, fistulas, phagedena, sinuses, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and hot tumors. I have mentioned all of these diseases, their types, and their signs in the classification.
It is necessary to mention in this chapter the hot tumor which occurs in the uterus, if it is among the tumors which gather for a period, how its bursting with iron is to be done.  It should be examined; if the pain of the tumor is severe in its beginning, accompanied by throbbing, inflammation and fever,
and you see it red when touched, do not hasten to burst it, and treat it with what assists in ripening, until these symptoms subside. Then it is necessary that the woman sit on a chair with two seats and lean on its back.
and bring her legs together towards the lower abdomen, and let her thighs be spread apart, and let her arms be under her knees, and bind them with a suitable bandage.
Then the midwife sits on the right side and uses the instrument with which the mouth of the womb is opened, the image of which comes later. If you wish to use this instrument, you should estimate with a probe the depth of the woman's uterus, lest that which enters from the instrument be more than the depth of the uterus.
It will harm the patient. If the instrument is longer than the depth, it is necessary to place pledgets on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the depth of the uterus.  The screw which runs in the instrument should be on the upper side.
And you hold the instrument, and the assistant turns the screw until the cervix is opened. If the abscess appears and is touched by the hand and is soft and thin, then it should be incised at its head with a broad scalpel. When all the matter has been evacuated,
a soft pledget soaked in rose oil or green oil containing some astringent should be placed in the wound. The pledget should come out from the incision in the cervix. Clean wool soaked in water in which alum has been boiled should be placed externally on the uterus and pubis.
Then treat it after two days with the ointment which is suitable for this until it heals.
The uterus and wound may be washed by injecting with water and honey, then with water in which liquorice root or long zedoary has been boiled, then return to the ointment, if the abscess is hidden inside the uterus.
It is necessary to refrain from treating it with iron, but it should be treated as we mentioned in the classification.
Chapter seventy-five.
On instructing midwives how to treat living fetuses if they emerge in an unnatural way.
The midwife should first know the form of natural childbirth.  Its signs are: if you see the woman straining downwards and longing to breathe the air, and what she suffers from the labour becomes easier for her.
And the emergence of the fetus is quickened. Know that this birth is in the natural way, and its emergence is head-first, with the placenta either with it or hanging from its navel. If you see these signs, then you should press her abdomen so that the fetus emerges quickly.
For if it descends head-first, the placenta descends with it and cleanses itself of those impurities well.  Anything other than this birth is unnatural and blameworthy, for the fetus may emerge feet-first, or its hands and feet may emerge before its head.
Or one hand or one foot, or its head and hand may emerge, or it may emerge folded, and perhaps it turns onto its back, and so on from the blameworthy forms.  The midwife should be skillful and gentle with all these things and beware of mistakes and errors.
And I will explain each form and how to manage it, so that you may learn from it and understand it. If the fetus emerges head-first – the natural emergence – and this becomes difficult for the woman, and labor is hard for her, and you see her strength has weakened, then seat her on a chair and instruct women to hold her.
And pack her womb with cooked fenugreek and moist ointments, then the midwife inserts a small scalpel between her fingers and incises the placenta with it, or incises it with her fingernail, until the moisture within flows out, and she presses the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, then she should inject the woman with fenugreek saliva mixed with shirāj ointment, then after the injection, she should instruct her to cough and make her sneeze with a sternutatory, and hold her mouth and nose; then the fetus will emerge immediately. If the fetus's hands emerge first, then they should be gently returned little by little.
If they do not manage to enter, place the woman on a stool and raise her legs upwards, then shake the stool on the ground while the woman holds on so that she does not fall during the shaking. If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, cut them off and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them moderately; then he will emerge.  The emergence of the fetus with its feet: If the fetus emerges with its feet, then they should be pushed upwards, then the fetus should be turned little by little until it is straightened, then take one of its legs and extend it little by little.
If they emerge to the thighs, instruct her to cough and make her sneeze with a sternutatory, then he will emerge. If he does not emerge as we have described, then return the fetus little by little until it is in its natural position; then it will emerge smoothly. If it is prevented by all that we have described,
Take some henbane saliva, fenugreek saliva, shirāj ointment, and dissolved gum, and pound everything well in a mortar, then apply it to the woman's vulva and lower abdomen, then seat her in lukewarm water until it reaches the ankles.
If you see that her lower parts have softened, make a pessary for her from myrrh and let her hold it.  If the pessary is retained for an hour, seat her on a stool, then make her sneeze, close her mouth and nose, and gently press her lower abdomen; then the fetus will emerge immediately. The emergence of the fetus on its knees and hands:
If it emerges in this manner, gradually introduce your hands. Then the woman should lie on her back, her hips hanging downwards while lying on a bed, and clasp her hands; then press gently above her abdomen. Then remove the cushions from under her legs so that her lower body is raised. If the fetus does not emerge, take both her legs and move them vigorously. Then press gently above the ankles until the fetus ascends, then the midwife inserts her hand and adjusts the fetus little by little.
And order the woman to strain until the fetus emerges. The emergence of the fetus transversely, one of its hands hanging down: try to return its hand.  If you are unable to return it, have the woman stand and walk; if she is unable to walk, let her lie down.
on her bed and shake her legs vigorously. Then use the poultice that I described from the leeches. If labor begins, seat her on a stool, then work to reposition the arm and straighten the fetus to its natural position, make the woman sneeze and tell her to strain until it emerges.
The emergence of the fetus on its back, extending its hands, its face towards its mother's back: the midwife should grasp the hand of the fetus, then turn it little by little and straighten it gently.  Once straightened, apply what we described of the ointment and poultices to its head.
Then tell her to move little by little. If she does that, seat her on the stool and tell her to lean to her right side. Then tell her to strain and make her sneeze with a sternutation powder; then it will emerge.  The emergence of the fetus upright on its side.
If it descends to the mouth of the womb in this manner with the placenta, tear the placenta with your fingernail until it is free of moisture. If it is attached to the face and neck of the fetus, cut it from the navel lest it suffocate and die, then push the fetus inward until it is as it should be.
And tell the woman to strain repeatedly; then it will emerge easily. The emergence of twins or multiple fetuses: Know that twins are frequently born, and three or four may be born and live, although this is rare; as for five, it is something outside of nature, they do not live at all.
And they are surrounded, even if numerous, by one placenta, and they are separated by a membrane barrier between them, attached to the navel of each one.  And they may emerge like a single fetus, naturally and easily, and they may emerge in a blameworthy manner, as we have described.
If one of them is difficult at birth and becomes as we have said, in unnatural forms, then treat it as we have described. And let the midwife be gentle and do what she does gently and slowly, and adapt to every form with whatever expedient presents itself to her that leads to safety.
Mention of what is conceived in the womb of fetuses that are aborted: One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten may be conceived in the womb.  It has been confirmed to me that a woman aborted seven, and another fifteen, all conceived.
By the estimation of the Almighty and Knowing One, all of this should be in the knowledge of the midwife, for perhaps such a thing may befall her someday, and she may meet it with what is proper.
Chapter Seventy-Six.
In the extraction of the dead fetus.
If you treat the dead fetus with what I mentioned in the section on treatment, and it does not come out, and you are compelled to use your hand, then you should look: if the woman is healthy and strong, and has none of the symptoms from which harm is feared, then the woman should lie on her back on a bed.
And her head should be inclined downwards and her legs raised, and an attendant should support her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed, lest her body be pulled when the fetus is drawn out.
Then moisten her uterine orifice with moist ointments, along with henbane saliva and fenugreek and flaxseed. Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these ointments and salivas, then gently insert it into the uterus, then seek with it a place to insert the hooks into the fetus, and the appropriate places for that.
Look, if the fetus is positioned to descend headfirst, then insert the hooks into its eyes, or into the nape of its neck, or into its mouth, or into its palate, or under its chin or collarbone, or into the areas near the ribs, or under the clavicles.
But if its descent is feet first, then [insert the hooks] into the groin and the middle ribs.  It is necessary that you hold the hook with the right hand and place its bend between the fingers of the left hand, and gently insert the hand and insert a hook into some of those places which we mentioned.
Until you reach something firm, then insert another hook opposite it, or a third if needed, so that the traction is even and does not lean to one side. Then pull with a steady pull, and the pull should not be straight only, but moved to every direction.
So that its exit is facilitated, as is done with a molar when it is extracted.  It is necessary during this that the pull be relaxed; if it is obstructed from one side, then it is necessary that the midwife anoint some fingers with ointment and insert them from that side to move what is obstructed.  If some of the fetus emerges, then move the hooks to other places.
She should raise it a little; do this until the whole fetus emerges. If a hand emerges before anything else and cannot be returned because of its compression, then it is necessary to wrap a cloth around it, then pull it until, when it has completely emerged, you cut it.
Either at the wrist joint or at the elbow.  Thus it is necessary to act in the other hand and in the feet. If the head of the fetus is large and experiences pressure in exiting, or if there is collected water in its head, then it is necessary to insert a hooked scalpel between the fingers.
And split the head with it so that the water emerges, or puncture it with the instrument called the perforator, whose image comes with the images of the other instruments in the chapter that follows this.
Similarly, if the fetus is naturally large-headed, then it is necessary to split the skull or perforate it with the perforator, as we said, then remove the bones with forceps. If the head emerges and is compressed at the clavicle, then let it be split so that the moisture in the chest is released.
Then the chest will contract. If the chest does not contract and it is not possible to remove it, cut it as much as you can. If the lower abdomen is swollen or contains a tumor, it is necessary to incise it until the moisture flows from it.
If the fetus is in a feet-first position, then pulling it out is easy and straightening it to the mouth of the womb is simple.  If it is compressed at the abdomen or chest, then it is necessary to pull it with a cloth wrapped around your hand and split the abdomen or chest until what is inside flows out.
If all the limbs are extracted and the head retreats and is retained, let the midwife insert her left hand. If the mouth of the womb is open, let her insert her hand into the neck of the womb and search for the head with it and pull it with her fingers to the mouth of the womb. Then let her insert a hook or two hooks and pull it with them.
If the mouth of the womb has contracted due to a hot swelling affecting it, then it should not be forced. Instead, it is necessary to use the pouring of moist, fatty substances, and to use poultices, and to sit in waters that relax and moisten.
And if the fetus is on its side, if it is possible to straighten it, let what we mentioned for a living fetus be used. If this is not possible, let it be cut up and removed.  It is necessary not to leave anything of the afterbirth inside at all. When you have finished your treatment, use what we mentioned for the treatment of hot tumors that occur in the wombs.
If bleeding occurs, let her descend into astringent waters and use all other treatments. I have indeed seen a woman who had conceived and the fetus died in her womb, then she conceived again upon it.
Then the other fetus also died.  After a long time, a swelling appeared in her uterus and it swelled until it opened and began to discharge pus. I was called to treat her, and I treated her for a long time, but the wound did not close.  So I applied some strong, drawing ointments to it.
Then a bone came out of the place. Then after some days, another bone came out. I wondered at this, since the abdomen is a place where there are no bones. I judged that they were from the bones of the dead fetus, so I examined the wound and extracted from it many bones from the skull of the fetus.
I continued this until I had extracted many bones, and the woman was in the best of health. She lived like this for a time, with a little pus discharging from the place.  And I have only brought this rare case here.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the skillful physician attempts with his hand in treatment.
Chapter seventy-seven.
In it are images of the instruments needed for extracting the fetus.
Image of a screw to open the mouth of the womb.
This is a binding instrument which evens out books; it has two screws at the ends of the two pieces of wood, except that this screw should be finer than the binding instrument and should be made either of ebony or boxwood, and the width of each piece of wood should be the thickness of two fingers.
And their width is about a finger, and their length is a span and a half, and in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two guides of the same wood, which are fastened in them, their length being half a span or a little more, and their width about two fingers or a little more, and these two guides...
are those which enter the mouth of the womb to open it by turning the screws; an image of another instrument for the same purpose, finer and lighter:
It is made of ebony or boxwood in the shape of hooks, except that it has two guides at its end, as you see; the length of each guide is about a span, and their width is two fingers; and if you wish to open the womb with it...
then seat the woman on a bed with her legs spread apart between her thighs, then insert these two guides together into the mouth of the womb, while you hold the end of the instrument below between her thighs, then open your hand with the instrument as you do with hooks, according to how much you want to open the womb. until the midwife does what she wants.  An image of another screw mentioned by the ancients:
Image of the instrument which pushes out the fetus:
Image of the forceps with which the head of the fetus is extracted.
It resembles scissors, it has teeth at the end as you see, and it may be made rectangular like hooks, in this image as you see, it has teeth like the teeth of a saw, you cut and crush with it.
Image of a pusher also.
Image of a hook.
This hook should be somewhat thick so that it does not break when pulling the fetus with it. Image of a hook with two barbs.
Image of two wide scalpels for cutting the fetus.
All these instruments, the more numerous their types and the better prepared by the craftsman, the quicker his work and the higher his standing among people. Therefore, do not scorn any instrument that you have prepared, for there will certainly be a need for it.
Chapter seventy-eight.
On the removal of the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, you should instruct the woman to hold herself, then cause her to sneeze with a sternutatory, and press your hand on her mouth and nostrils. If it comes out this way, well and good; otherwise, take a measure.
And pierce a hole in the lid and place in it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as rue, henbane, dill, chamomile, wormwood, vervain, and centaury – all these medicaments or some of them – and immerse them in water, and place them over the fire, then place a silver tube over the hole in the pot’s lid, and the other end in the mouth of the womb.
And hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the womb, then cause her to sneeze as we said; then the placenta will come out quickly. If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in olive oil or mallow juice.
Then she should insert it into the vagina and search for the placenta; if she finds it, she should grasp it and pull it out little by little.  If it is attached deep in the womb, insert the hand as we described, until, when you find the placenta, you pull it out little by little, carefully.
Lest the womb fall out upon strong pulling; rather, it should be moved gently to the sides, right and left, then the amount of pulling should be increased; then it will yield and be freed from its adhesion. If the mouth of the womb is constricted, we have described treatment with sneezing and the treatment with the pot and herbs.
If it does not come out by all that we have described, avoid violence in pulling again; but it should be tied, that which has come out of it to the mouth of the womb to the woman's thigh, then inject it with the four-ingredient ointment, for it will cause it to rot after a few days.
And it will dissolve and come out; however, if it rots, a bad smell will ascend from it to the stomach and head, and this will harm the patient; therefore, suitable fumigation should be used.
Therefore, some of the ancients have tried fumigation with rue and dried figs.  Image of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated in cases of retained menses, placenta, and the like:
It is made of lead, resembling a funnel, or it is made of copper; the thin end is placed in the vagina, and the wide end over the fire, and the incense is placed on the embers; it is held until that incense is gone, and then another is added.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
In the treatment of the non-perforated fistula.
Many boys are born with their anus imperforate; a thin membrane has closed it.  The midwife should perforate this membrane with her finger; otherwise, she should incise it with a sharp scalpel, being careful not to touch the muscle.
Then she should place on it wool soaked in syrup and oil, and then treat it with ointments until it heals. If she fears that it will close up, she should place a lead tube in the opening for many days, and remove it whenever the child wishes to defecate.
The anus may also become obstructed by the healing of a wound or a tumor.  This adhesion should be incised, and then treated as described above, with medication and the tube.
Chapter Eighty.
On the treatment of fistulas which occur in the lower parts.
Fistulas which occur in the lower parts are a complication and thickening which occurs near the anus, externally or internally in the space from one of the sides. The fistula may be single or multiple.
If this complication becomes chronic, it opens and a watery white moisture or thin pus flows from it. Some of these fistulas may penetrate to the rectum and to the intestine, and others may not penetrate. Those which penetrate may be recognized by the passage of stool and flatus from them when the patient uses the privy.
And sometimes worms emerge from them.  There may be fistulas which, if they are in the space, penetrate to the bladder and to the urethra. And there may be some which penetrate to the hip joint and to the sacrum.  And a fistula which penetrates to the rectum is also known from one which does not penetrate.
That you insert your index finger into the rectum and insert a thin probe into the fistula, of copper or iron, if the fistula is not tortuous. If it is tortuous, then insert into it a thin lead probe or a horsehair.
Until you feel the probe or the hair with your finger. If you do not feel it at all, and nothing of stool, nor flatus, nor worms, as we said, emerges from the opening, then know that it is not penetrating, and proceed to treatment.
And if the fistula penetrates to the bladder or to the urinary passage, its indication is the emergence of urine from it, and the prevention of the place from healing with medications. And as for whether it penetrates to the hip joint or to the sacrum, its sign is the arrival of the probe there.
If it is not tortuous to the bone, and there is pain in that direction, and pus constantly emerges from it, and no treatment is effective, nor does it heal with ointment, and all these penetrating fistulas, then there is absolutely no cure for them.
And its treatment is a vain effort for those who attempt it among ignorant physicians. As for those that are not penetrating and not chronic, healing is hoped for with cautery, as I describe and as I have experienced. That is, that you place the patient between your hands on his back.
And raise his legs upwards, and his thighs inclined towards his abdomen. Then insert the copper or lead probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know where the probe ends. If the patient feels it towards the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel with your finger that the probe has penetrated by itself, exposed, without feeling between your finger and it any membrane or flesh, then know for certain that it is penetrating, so do not tire yourself with it, for there is no cure for it, as we said.
And it has been said that it heals in some people rarely. And of the treatments from which benefit is hoped for, is that you heat a thin cautery according to the width of the fistula, as previously mentioned, and insert it hot into the fistula until it reaches towards the anus, then repeat it two or three times.
Until you know that all that superfluous, matted flesh resembling a bird's quill has been burned. Then treat it with lint soaked in butter until you remove the burned flesh. Then treat it with healing ointments, if it heals.
Otherwise, it will never heal with any other treatment. But if you insert the probe and it does not penetrate to your finger which is in the anus, and there was between it and the probe a thick barrier of flesh or membrane, and you see the fistula near the surface of the skin, then incise the skin at the beginning of the fistula. And as you pass with the incision with the probe in the fistula, until you reach with the incision where the tip of the probe ends, the probe will become loose and fall out. Then cleanse that matted flesh resembling a bird's quill, and leave nothing of it.
Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If the bleeding overwhelms you and prevents you from cutting that flesh, the best and quickest remedy is cauterization with fire or a caustic medicine, because cauterization with fire combines two good things: burning that superfluous flesh.
And cutting the blood and drying the moisture. Then treat it with lint soaked in butter or sulfur powdered with oil until the area suppurates and that burned flesh comes out in the pus. Then treat the wound with healing ointments that generate firm flesh.
These are medicines which have an astringent and drying effect; for when it is closed, it is healed and there is no fear of recurrence. If the fistula has reached the depth of the anus and is far from the surface of the body, insert your finger into the anus and explore with it.
If you feel the probe and between you and it a partition of peritoneum or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then the action is only through hope and expectation; that is, to use one of three methods: either to cauterize it as we said.
Or to incise it until you reach its bottom, so that you can easily insert the lint and treat it closely.  Do not extend the incision lest you cut the muscle surrounding the anus and cause the patient involuntary evacuation of stool. Then treat it as we mentioned, for perhaps it will heal as we said.
Or to penetrate that partition and perforate it after incising it near the anus as we said, either with a probe or with another sharp-pointed instrument. Then clean out all the hardened flesh in the incision as far as you can thoroughly.
Then suture the whole wound, including the incision and the upper opening, until it is closed, leaving the fistula open inside the anus, which is easier for the patient. The fistula may be perforated in this manner.
And if you insert the probe into the fistula and it is on one side of the anus towards the surface of the body with the skin and the margin of the anus, then take a probe with a perforated end like a shoemaker's needle, in this manner:.
And insert a twisted thread of five or so threads into it, then insert the probe with the thread into the fistula until it reaches its bottom, if it is penetrating the margin of the anus from the inside nearby.
Then bring the thread out through that hole by inserting your finger into the anus and bringing out the end of the thread, and bring both ends together and tighten them, and leave it for a day or two. Whenever the thread cuts through the flesh, tighten it well until the flesh between the ends of the thread is severed and falls away. Then treat the wound until it heals and recovers.
If the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, penetrate it however you can, except that it should not be too deep, for you should not do that on account of the muscle, lest you cut it. Then treat it as we have described until it heals.
The image of the hooked scalpel with which fistulas are incised: its hook is very sharp, and the other side is not sharp, lest you cut what is not necessary, as you see.
Chapter eighty-one.
Concerning the opening of hemorrhoids from which blood flows, and their excision and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they are inside the rectum, resembling red bladders or like grapes, and there are small and large ones, and blood constantly flows from them.
And there may be one or many, and they may be outside the rectum and at its edges, except that those which are outside the rectum are, in most cases, less moist; a yellow fluid or a little blood constantly flows from them, and they are the color of the body.
And the treatment of those which are inside the rectum is that you order the patient to strain and bear down until the rectum protrudes and the excrescences appear to you. Then you quickly seize them with hooks or grasp them with your fingernail and then cut them at their bases, if the hooks do not hold them because of their moisture and laxity.
Then scrape it with a rough cloth or a piece of a rasp or pull it with your fingers, then cut it, then sprinkle on it after cutting some sharp powders to act in place of cautery, or cauterize it as described in the chapter on cautery.
Then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. If the rectum does not protrude, then inject the patient with an enema containing a little irritant to wash what is in the rectum and to quickly come out when the patient strains. As for the excrescences outside the rectum, their treatment is easy and simple.
And that is that you seize it with your fingernail or hook it with a hook and cut it, then treat it as we have mentioned until it heals. And whoever dislikes cutting with iron, it is necessary that you use a ligature in this manner: take a twisted thread and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the wart upwards and pass the needle through its base on the other side, and twist the ends of the thread below the needle while it is crosswise, and pull the wart tightly, then tie the thread and remove the needle.  Do this to all the excrescences and leave one unligated.
so that the excess blood flows from it, then place on the rectum a cloth soaked in rose oil or kypriot oil, and place it on the rectum and tell the patient to remain still, then leave him until it falls off. And when the excrescences fall off, treat them with ointments and other treatments until they heal.
As for the treatment of fissures, they often occur from the dryness of the feces and the retention of the temperament. If it becomes chronic and medicine does not work for it, then it is necessary to scrape it with the blade of a scalpel or with your fingernail until it becomes moist and the upper layer which prevents its healing is removed.
Then treat it until it heals as it should. If it does not heal, repeat the scraping more severely than the first time until it bleeds well and is peeled, then treat it, for it will heal.
Chapter eighty-two.
On the treatment of ingrown and non-ingrown nails, dry warts and the ant.
A nail is a round nodule, the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail. It occurs on the whole body, especially on the soles of the feet and the fingers, and causes pain when walking.
It is necessary to incise around the nail and grasp it with a hook or a forceps and pull it out from its root, then treat it. And if you wish, cauterize it as mentioned in its chapter. As for dry warts, each one is a small, rough, matted, round protuberance on the surface of the body.
They often appear on the hands of children.  Its treatment is to stretch the wart and cut it, or pierce it with a silk thread or a hair until it falls off. And if you wish, cauterize it as mentioned before, with fire or with a caustic medicine.
Ingrown and non-ingrown warts may be removed with the instrument which I have mentioned in the treatment of the ant. As for the ant, it is also a small, matted, thick protuberance on the surface of the body, going very deep, and if it is affected by cold, one feels in it something like the sting of ants.
It occurs on the whole body, but mostly on the hands. Its treatment is to take a tube from a goose quill or a strong eagle feather and place this tube on the ant until the circle of the tube surrounds it from all sides, then rotate your hand with the tube until you incise around the ant.
And make it go deep into the flesh, and the ant will be removed from its root. And if you wish, do this with a copper or iron tube in this manner:
The top of the tube, towards the tip, should be solid and wired so that it is easy for the fingers to grasp and twist it. And if you wish, cauterize the ant as previously mentioned in the cauterization of warts in the chapter on cauterization.
Chapter eighty-three.
On the forms of instruments used for injections in rectal diseases, diarrhea, and colic.
The syringe may be made of silver, or china, or cast or hammered copper.  These instruments may be made small or large, according to the users. Those used in the treatment of small children, whose rectums are narrow or sore, should be very gentle.  Image of a large syringe:
Its upper funnel, to which the bladder is attached, is wide in this manner. It has a partition where the bladder is tied, as you see. Its lower end, which enters the rectum, is solid, very smooth, and delicate. On one side there are two holes, and on the other side, one hole.
The size of the hole should be the thickness of a probe, or slightly thicker. The bladder, in which the medicine is placed, is made from an animal bladder or sheepskin, shaped like a small bag, its diameter being a span.
It is pierced with many holes in a circular pattern, the distance between each hole being the thickness of a finger. Then, a tight thread of twisted yarn, made of ten threads or so, is inserted into these holes and the bladder is gathered like a pouch. When the medicine is placed inside, it is tightly bound in the head of the syringe between the stones, then injected. This is an image of the circle of the bladder and the hole:
The method of injection is to fill the skin or bladder with the warmed medicine, to a degree tolerable to the patient. Be careful that it is not too hot or too cold. Then the patient lies on his back and raises his legs.
A cloth or blanket is placed beneath him. Then the tip of the syringe is lubricated with oil, egg white, fenugreek saliva, or something similar. Then it is gently inserted into the rectum.  Then an assistant takes the bladder in both hands and squeezes it forcefully until all the contents of the syringe are emptied into the bowel.
Then the syringe is removed and the patient raises his legs to the wall. If the medicine stimulates evacuation, let him hold it as long as he can. If he sleeps with it all night, it will be more beneficial. If it is injected for diarrhea and its expulsion is hastened, repeat the injection until he recovers.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful swellings in the rectum, the syringe should be very soft and smooth, like those used for children. This is an image of a soft syringe with its leather covering:
Chapter Eighty-Four.
In the treatment of wounds.
I mentioned in the classification the treatment of what resembles cauterization, and I will now describe its treatment by hand and by medication completely. I say that wounds vary according to the instrument that causes the wound and according to the location where the wound occurs.
The things that cause wounds are many, such as a blow from a stone, or a cut from a sword or knife, or a stab from a spear or stick or arrow, and so on from many things.
As for wounds according to their location on the body, there is the wound that occurs on the head, or neck, or chest, or abdomen, or liver, and so on from the organs.
And I am describing the treatment of some wounds to make them a measure and rule for all wounds, and I begin with simple head wounds, especially because the compound ones will be mentioned in the beginning of the third chapter of this book.
So I say that when a simple wound occurs in the head and there is no fracture of the bone, I look; and if it is from a blow from a stone or the like, and only the skin has been split, and the wound is large and I fear for the patient the occurrence of hot inflammation, then I hasten and incise the cephalic vein in the appropriate place. And do not delay that, and let blood be drawn from him according to his strength, if nothing prevents bloodletting, especially if the blood coming from the wound is little; and let the bloodletting be from the opposite side to the injured part.
And warn the patient against fullness, drinks, and coarse foods; and if something prevents him from bloodletting, let him reduce food and not approach meats or drinks, and apply to the wound, if hot inflammation occurs in it, cotton soaked in rose oil alone or with a styptic drink.
And if you are safe from hot inflammation, apply to the wound, if it is fresh and the air has not altered it, the powder which I will describe to you shortly; but if the air has altered it, apply some ointments to it.
Until pus forms, then treat it until it heals; and if the wound is large and is from a sword cut or the like, and its edges do not come together by themselves, then bring them together by suturing, as I describe in the suturing of abdominal wounds.
If the skin exposes the bone and hangs, and its attachment is only by a small piece, cut it off, then treat the wound with medicines which produce firm flesh in place of the skin, and order the patient to nourish himself with foods that have strength, such as heads and brains and the like.
If decay occurs in the skin and does not adhere to the bone, cut away all that is decayed and throw it away, then treat it; and if in these wounds there is an artery or vein bleeding and the bleeding does not stop with medication, search for the artery.
If you find it and it is not severed, sever it with the scalpel and tie it; and if necessity demands, if what we have mentioned is not effective, cauterize it until the bleeding stops. If these wounds are small and superficial, their treatment is easy and simple; it suffices to treat them by sprinkling this powder on them while they are still bleeding.
before the air changes it.  The preparation of the powder is: take one part frankincense, two parts  styrax, and three parts of quicklime or unslaked lime.  Grind everything, sift it, and fill the wound with it, and bind it tightly so that it adheres well.
It will coagulate with the blood, then bind it from above with bandages and leave it; do not unbind it as long as it does not swell, for the medicine will not come away from it until it heals.  The lime alone may do this if you do not have frankincense and styrax.
This action may also be performed with cobwebs in many large wounds if its application and binding are skillfully done, and the wounds are fresh and bleeding, provided the air has not changed them, but if the air has changed them somewhat, especially in summer.
then there is no point in applying this powder; treat it as mentioned before, by applying some ripening ointments or a poultice of barley flour made with water and honey until it discharges pus, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
But if a fracture of the bone occurs with the wound, and it is slight, draw it with a splint. I have described the treatment of head fractures in what follows, in the surgery of the neck. If the wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between it and a head wound if it is simple.
But if a nerve or artery of the neck has been severed, if it is a nerve, there is no remedy except to avoid treating it with things that cause strong constriction, such as verdigris and vitriol and the like, because they harm the nerve and cause it to spasm.
And nothing cold should be applied to the wound at all, because the essence of the nerve is cold and its connection is to the brain, which is the noblest of the organs.  What you treat it with should be from soft medicines, such as burnt alum washed many times with fresh water, moistened with oil, or rose oil and tutty.
If it is also washed with fresh water and other mineral stones in this manner, and moist ointments; but if the wound is large, use suture or approximate its edges with pledgets, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound is deep and a cavity forms at its bottom where pus collects, open it at its lowest point. If an artery is severed in the wound and you see its blood flowing, ligate it or cauterize it if necessity demands it.
If the wound has severed some or all of the cartilages of the larynx, and the trachea is unharmed, unite the edges of the skin by suture over the windpipe; do not touch the windpipe itself, but straighten it and restore it to its natural shape, then bind it tightly and leave it for some days.
Then treat it with ointments that have astringent and drying properties until it heals. If the wound has affected the bone, explore it; if there are bone splinters, extract them all, or as many as possible.  What you cannot remove, leave until the wound suppurates, heals, and their removal becomes easier.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle on it the powder we have described. If a bone in the wound becomes necrotic and fistulous, treat it as described in its chapter, on the surgery of the chest and between the shoulders.
If it is a wound from a spear or knife, and you see that it is deep, observe whether air escapes from it when the patient breathes; if so, know that it is a mortal wound. If it is not deep and is fresh with blood, do not at first apply powder to it, nor bind it tightly, lest the blood be retained in its depths.
This will cause it to spread to the heart and kill the patient. But apply an absorbing ointment and dress it twice a day. If you do not have ointment, place an old piece of cotton wool in the mouth of the wound to absorb the fluids that exude, and have the patient sleep on the wound.
so that what collects there may flow out.  If three days or more have passed since the injury, and the patient has experienced no convulsions,  faintness, or shortness of breath, and you see that his condition is otherwise good, know that the wound is safe; treat it with cautery and other therapies until it heals.
If its observation is difficult and the pus flows constantly, know that it has become fistulous, and treat it according to its chapter.  If the wound is on the chest or back, treat it with the stitching described above.
If it is large, cauterize it; if small, use powder. If it has affected the bone and broken off fragments, explore the wound and immediately remove these fragments if they are free; if not free, leave them until...
the wound becomes septic, for then their removal will be easier. As for other wounds occurring in other parts of the body, their treatment follows the rules we have mentioned.
Chapter eighty-five.
On abdominal wounds, the protrusion of the intestines, and their suturing.
The wound which affects the abdomen may be large, or small, or medium.  A large wound may allow the protrusion of one or several intestines, and their replacement and suturing will be more difficult and arduous.
A small wound may also be difficult in another way, necessitating more difficult replacement.  If the intestine is not immediately returned to its place, it swells and thickens, making its replacement difficult.  Therefore, the medium-sized wound is preferable, because the replacement of the intestine is not as difficult as in these two types.
Know that the suturing of the abdomen is of four types.  Two sutures are general, suitable for suturing the abdomen and for suturing other wounds of the body. The other two sutures are specific, used for all wounds, but they are most especially used for suturing the abdomen.
And I will describe them to you one by one with explanation and clarification. I say that if the wound is small and some of the intestine has protruded and its replacement is difficult, this is for one of two reasons: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we said, or because the intestine has been affected by swelling due to the coldness of the air.
If this is so, then it should be warmed by dipping a sponge or a damp cloth into lukewarm water alone, or water in which anise, rue, and spikenard have been boiled, and applying it to the intestine until the swelling subsides.
A medicament with astringent properties may also do this; it is better than water alone in resolving the swelling. If you see that the swelling has subsided, moisten the intestine with water in which alum or pomegranate has been boiled, for it facilitates its return with the least effort.
If its return is still difficult after this treatment, make a small incision in the wound with the instrument used to incise fistulas. The first treatment, if successful, is better than incision. Incision is only resorted to after necessity and the failure of other methods. This is an image of the instrument:
One side is curved and sharp, the other is blunt. The thin end is not as sharp as a lancet, but somewhat blunt. It is an instrument similar to a small spatula, as you see. If the wound has widened and the intestine has entered, it should be returned to its natural shape.
And its proper position, if you can achieve it, is best. But if the wound is large and in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on his back with his legs higher than his head; if it is in the upper abdomen, his head and chest should be higher than his lower body.
Similarly, if the wound is on one side of the abdomen, always make the side with the injury higher than the other.  This should also be used in large and moderate wounds.
As for small wounds, position him as best you can. Then have a skilled assistant ready to hold the entire wound with both hands, bringing its edges together, and then revealing it to the one performing the suturing, little by little.
This is the description of a general stitch: take one needle, or several needles, according to the size of the wound. Then leave a space the width of a little finger from the edge of the wound, and insert a needle without thread into the edges of the skin. along with the edges of the peritoneum under the skin from the inside, until you bring it out on that side.  You have now gathered the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum, making four layers. Then, tie a doubled thread around the needle several times on both sides until the edges of the wound are firmly joined.
Then leave a space the width of a finger again, and insert another needle, and tie it with thread as you did with the first needle. Continue doing this with as many needles as necessary until you have completed the entire circumference of the wound.  Let the needles be of medium thickness.
For very fine needles quickly cut the flesh, and thick needles are difficult to insert into the skin. Therefore, they should be of medium thickness, and the needle should not be inserted into the edge of the skin too close to the wound.
lest the flesh quickly tear and the wound open before it heals. Do not space the stitches too far apart either, lest the wound fail to unite. Then cut off the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the patient when he sleeps, and make him supports of linen strips on each side to hold the ends of the needles.
And leave them until you know that the wound has healed. This type of suture with needles is most suitable for small wounds, because one or two needles, or thereabouts, may suffice for suturing them.
As for the method of suturing the second type, the common one, it is to bring together the four edges, that is, the edges of the skin and the edges of the peritoneum, at once with a needle with a twisted thread, moderate in thinness and thickness. Then, when you have passed the needle through these four edges, return the needle to the same side from which you began.
So that the thread falls interwoven from above the wound, so that the stitching is according to the stitching of the purse with which goods are tied. And make between each stitch a distance the thickness of the little finger. This stitching is known to everyone.
With this suture, I stitched a wound which appeared on a man in his abdomen. He had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was more than an inch long. About two inches of the middle intestine had protruded, and the wound was in the middle of the abdomen.
I replaced it after his intestine had remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours. The wound healed in about fifteen days, and I treated him until he recovered. He lived many years thereafter, managing all his affairs. The doctors had judged that he would never recover.
And it is strange that I did not treat him with an ointment, because I was in a place where there were no medicines. I used to apply worn cotton to the wound twice a day and treat it by washing it with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the two types of special stitching, I mention it according to the words of Galen. It is that you begin the stitching from the skin and insert the needle from outside to inside.  When the needle has passed through the skin and the muscle going straight along the whole length of the belly.
I left the edge of the peritoneum on the side into which I inserted the needle, and I passed the needle through its other edge from inside to outside, into the other edge of the peritoneum. When I had passed it through, I passed it again through this same edge of the peritoneum from outside to inside.
And leave the edge of the peritoneum on this side, and pass the needle through its other edge from inside to outside, and as you pass it through, pass it also through the edge of the peritoneum on its side, until you pass it completely through.
Then begin also from this same side and sew it together with the edge of the peritoneum on the other side, and bring the needle out through the skin near it, then return it into that skin and sew the edge of the peritoneum on the other side together with this edge of the peritoneum.
And bring it out through the skin on its side.  Do this again and again, one time after another, until you have sewn up the whole wound in that way. The general description of this stitching is that you stitch it like the stitching of furs to furs.
That you sew the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin, and leave it once from the other side until you finish. As for the second type of special stitching which Galen also mentioned, these are his exact words.
And that is to sew it in the way some physicians sew it, by joining each part to its counterpart similar to it in nature, so that they join the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge and the edge of the muscle to its other edge, and that is as I will describe to you.
You should insert the needle into the edge of the muscle nearest to you from the outside, and pass it to the inside in it alone, and leave the edges of the peritoneum. Then return the needle and pass it from the outside to the inside in both edges of the peritoneum, then return it again.
And pass it from the inside to the outside in the edge of the other muscle which is on the opposite side. This type of stitching is better than the easy, common stitching, which is the stitching previously mentioned. These are Galen's exact words. And some have said that the stitching of the abdomen may be straightened with two needles. That is to insert one thread into them both, and begin by inserting the needle from your side and passing it to the other side, and insert the other needle from the opposite side, then pass it from your side, according to the stitching of the saddlers.
And know that if the wound is in the middle of the abdomen, then its stitching is more difficult than in other places of the abdomen. As for the treatment of the wound, its rule in its treatment is the rule of all other wounds. That is, if you find the wound fresh with its blood before the air changes it, and you return the intestines and stitch it and tighten it, then apply to it the medicated lint.
If the wound has been changed by the air, then apply to it some of the ointments that you prepare until it suppurates and the stitches fall out and the peritoneum and muscle unite, then treat it as you treat other wounds until it heals.
If you do not have medicines, then apply to it, from when it begins to suppurate, old cotton, and change it twice a day as I have taught you, until it heals. For you do not need further treatment in most cases if the wounds are simple.  If you fear that the wound will affect the principal organs with pain,
then it is necessary that you dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and armpit. If he feels pain or putrefaction in his intestines—and this often occurs—then inject him with a lukewarm black astringent drink.
Especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and become a penetrating wound into its cavity. And know that what was thick from the intestines is easier to heal, and what was thin from it is more difficult to heal.
And as for the intestine known as the jejunum, it does not accept healing from a wound that occurs in it at all. This is because of the abundance of its veins and their size, and the thinness of its substance and its proximity to the nature of the nerve.  And as for if what emerged from the wound was omentum and you apprehended it fresh, then return it in the same way you would return the intestine.
If a period of time has passed and it has turned green or black, then it is necessary that you tie it with a thread above the place that has blackened, lest bleeding occur, for there are veins and arteries in the omentum, then cut below that ligature.
And make the ends of the thread hanging from below the wound, outside of it, so that it is easy for you to remove and extract it when the omentum falls off and the wound suppurates.  [The text] mentioned the wound which occurs in the intestine. But if a rupture occurs in the intestine and it is small,
it is possible that it will close in some people, for I saw a man who had been wounded in his abdomen by a spear thrust, and the wound was to the right of the stomach. The wound became chronic and became a fistula from which feces and wind emerged. So I treated him although I did not have hope for his recovery. So I continued to treat him gently until he healed and the place united. When I saw the place had united, I feared for the patient that a bad accident might occur in his abdomen, but no bad accident occurred to him at all, and he remained in the best of his condition. He eats and drinks properly, engages in sexual intercourse, enters the bath, and exercises in his service. Some experienced people have mentioned that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be sutured in this manner.
And that is to take large-headed ants, then bring the edges of the wound together, then place one of them, with its mouth open, on the edges of the wound. When it has seized and tightened its mouth, cut off its head, for it will adhere and will not come undone. Then place another ant near the first.
And you continue to do that with several ants according to the size of the wound, then you dress it and stitch the wound, for those heads remain adhering in the intestine until the intestine heals and recovers, and no harm at all occurs to the patient.  It is also possible to suture the intestine with fine thread.
Which is withdrawn from the intestine of the animal adhering to it after it is inserted into a needle. That is to take the end of this thread from the intestine, then draw it out gently, then tie to its end a fine twisted linen thread, then insert that thread into the needle. And in it is the intestinal thread, with which the intestine is sutured, then it is returned to the abdomen. This type of suturing with ants and intestine is only a matter of hope and expectation.
But if the perforation is large and extensive, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, then there is no remedy and no healing at all.

In the treatment of catarrh and fistula.
Know that every wound or swelling, if it becomes chronic and protracted and becomes an ulcer and does not heal, and continuously discharges pus that does not stop, is generally called, in whatever member it may be, a fistula; and we call it catarrh, and fistula.
It is in reality a hardened, matted, white mass, without pain, having a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some have called it a feather; and it is sometimes moist, always discharging pus, and sometimes the moisture is interrupted; and this moisture may be abundant or little, thick or thin.
And I have already mentioned in the classification, when discussing wounds, that every ulcer which does not heal and in which flesh does not grow, is due to one of nine causes; one of them is either due to a deficiency of blood in the body, or to its poor quality, or because there is hard flesh inside it and on its edges, which prevents the growth of good flesh. Or because it is very dirty and foul; or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the matter which it discharges is of poor quality; or because the treatment is unsuitable; or because of a corruption which has occurred in the region, of the nature of an epidemic; or because of a special characteristic of the region.
Or because it is very dirty and foul; or because the ulcer itself is putrid and the matter which it discharges is of poor quality; or because the treatment is unsuitable; or because of a corruption which has occurred in the region, of the nature of an epidemic; or because of a special characteristic of the region. As occurred in the city of Saragossa, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of tumors is naturally slow; or because there is one or several bones in it. I have explained all these causes, their signs, and their treatment with drugs in the classification.
It is appropriate here that I should inform you of the treatment of fistula and abscess which is done by hand. Know that fistulas may occur in all the members of the body; some of them reach large veins and arteries, or a nerve.
Or to the peritoneum, or to the intestine, or to the bladder, or to a rib of the ribs, or to a vertebra of the vertebrae of the back, or to a joint of the compound joints, such as the hand and foot; and some of them lead to the vicinity of a principal organ, and so forth.
Then such fistulas as are of this kind are among the difficult diseases to cure, which do not admit of treatment, and to occupy oneself with them is trouble and ignorance. But if any of the fistulas does not reach these places which I have mentioned, and there is hope and expectation of its cure,
and you wish to arrive at a knowledge of it, take a probe of copper or iron; if the fistula runs straight, explore it with it; but if there is any tortuosity in the fistula, explore it with a slender leaden probe, because lead is soft in its substance.
It yields when entering, and bends towards the tortuosity.  If the fistula has many mouths, and you cannot ascertain them with the probe, inject one of its mouths; then the moisture which you inject will pass towards the other mouths and flow out.
Then thoroughly investigate in whatever way you can, to find out if there is bone or nerve, or if the bottom of the fistula is far or near, or if it is one fistula with many mouths; ascertain all this as far as you can, by inquiring of the patient and by noting the pain when you touch the place.
and similar signs and causes of the swelling. When you have ascertained all this with certainty, then proceed to treatment with confidence.  And that is, that you should consider whether, if...
the fistula is superficial and near, or in a sound place far from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or one of the places I have mentioned to you, then lay open the fistula as I have described, and remove what is in it of adhesion and corrupted and redundant flesh.
And whatever grows in its mouth of flesh or wart, and the like, and treat it until it heals. If the fistula is deep-seated and straight, you should incise it deeply as far as you can, and then cleanse it of all its corrupt flesh.
Then use a pledget soaked in strong medicines and insert it to the bottom of the fistula which you can reach with an instrument; do this repeatedly until the strong medicine eats away all that remains of corruption in the bottom of the fistula.
Then dress it with ointments which cause healthy flesh to grow until it heals. If it does not heal in this way, cauterize it as previously described.  If the cause of the fistula is bone, and you are certain of that, then probe it and incise it as I have told you, unless something prevents you.
a nerve, or a principal member, as we have said. If the bone is exposed and there is some corruption and blackness in it, scrape it until its corruption is gone, then treat it with what will unite it until it heals. If it does not heal and the pus continues as before,
know that you have not completely removed the corruption.  Expose everything again and thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with the greatest effort, then dress it. If it heals, well and good; otherwise, know that the corruption is in a deep recess, expose everything again.
and thoroughly scrape and cleanse it with the greatest effort. If the corrupted bone is small and you can pull it out, pull it out with delicate forceps suitable for that purpose.
If there are many bones, make every effort to extract them all and do not leave any behind. If something of the ligaments obstructs you, and there is no danger in cutting them, then cut those ligaments and flesh, if any are there, and remove the bones.
If you cannot extract the bones at once, apply something to the wound that will cause it to fester, and leave it for several days until the flesh and ligaments around those bones fester.  Keep the wound from closing, the incision that you made during your work.
Rather, if you fear that, place on it cotton soaked in powdered sulfur with oil, or cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments. For when those ligaments have festered and the bones have become loose, it will be easy to extract and pull them out.
If it is a single large bone, such as a bone of the leg or thigh, and so forth, and only its surface is corrupted, scrape it thoroughly until that blackness and corruption is gone, then dress the wound.  If a large part of it is corrupted and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to remove it.
And cut it all away to where the corruption ends. Then treat it until it heals. And I tell you of a case of gangrene that occurred in a man's leg, to serve as an example and aid to your treatment. This man was young.
About thirty years old, he experienced pain in his leg due to a cause originating within the body, until the matter reached the leg and swelled into a large swelling; there was no external cause. Then time passed, along with the mistakes of the physicians, until the swelling opened.
And much matter flowed from it, and he was treated badly, until the leg became gangrenous and many openings appeared in it, all discharging pus and the body's fluids. A group of physicians treated him for about two years, and none of them were skilled in the craft of surgery.
Until they came to me. I saw his leg and the matter flowing from those openings in great quantity, and the man's body was emaciated and his color yellow.  Then I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone. Then I examined all the openings.
And I found that they led to one another from all sides of the leg. So I began by incising one of those openings until I uncovered some of the bone, and I found it corrupted, eaten away, black, putrid, and perforated, until the perforation reached the marrow.  Then I excised what was revealed to me.
And I removed the corrupted bone; and I thought that there was no corruption in the bone other than what I had cut and excised, and that I had eradicated it. Then I proceeded to treat the wound with cauterizing medications for a long time, but it did not heal. Then I returned and uncovered the bone again, beyond the first uncovering.
And I found the corruption connected to the bone. So I excised what was also revealed to me of that corruption. Then I attempted to heal it, but it did not heal nor unite. Then I uncovered it again, and I continued to cut away the bone piece by piece and attempt to heal it, but it would not heal, until I had cut away about a span of bone.
And I removed it with its marrow. Then I treated it with medications, and it healed quickly and completely.  This repetition in its operation and incision was necessary because of the patient's weakness and his inability to endure, and my fear for his death, because he frequently experienced severe fainting from excessive vomiting.  He recovered a complete recovery.
And in the place of the bone, firm flesh grew, and his condition in his body was improved, and his strength returned, and he managed his affairs, and in walking, nothing whatsoever harmed him. If a projecting bone in a part of the body is broken,
it should be excised in this manner: you should take a ligature and tie it around the end of the projecting bone, and instruct someone to pull it upwards, and make another ligature of thicker wool than the first ligature.
Then tie it to the flesh beneath the bone and pull its end so that the flesh is drawn downwards, while you expose the flesh from the place you want to excise, lest the saw injure the flesh, and place a firm piece of wood or board beneath the bone from below.
For if you do that, the saw will not be prevented from cutting the corrupted bone.  The excision should be slightly above the location of the corruption, lest there be corruption in the cavity of the bone that does not appear on its surface to the senses, thus requiring you to excise it again.
If the bone is corrupted and not projecting, but its parts are connected and the corruption is in its middle or in some part of it, then expose the flesh from all its sides. Then place the wood underneath, and then excise it from the first side where the corruption is.
When you have finished excising it from one side, excise it from the other side, and let the excision be a little distance from the corruption, as we said. If the corruption is in a joint, cut the corrupted joint itself and excise the bone where it connects from the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, there is no recourse but to remove it. If the corruption is in the metacarpus of the hand or foot, treatment is very difficult, but you should peel off the corruption however it appears to you, and remove it and clean it in any way you can.
And by any method that works for you, as long as a vein or nerve does not obstruct you. And know that the instruments and saws for cutting these bones are numerous, according to the position, arrangement, thickness, thinness, size, smallness, hardness, and porosity of the bones. Therefore, for each type of work, you should prepare an instrument suitable for that work.
Know that the operations themselves can indicate to you the type of instrument you need, if you have long experience and knowledge of the arts of this profession, for this is a sign of mastery of the craft and of having seen many kinds of diseases. He may devise for himself instruments similar to those for each disease, and I will depict for you at the end of this chapter several instruments.
These are examples to follow and measurements by which you can measure other instruments, God willing. Image of a saw:

In the amputation of limbs and the sawing of bones.
Limbs may become putrid, either from an external cause or from an internal cause.  If you treat that corruption with medicinal treatment and the treatment is not effective, and you see the corruption spreading in the limb, nothing preventing it,
then it is necessary to amputate that limb to where the corruption has reached, so that the patient may be saved thereby from death or from a great affliction which is greater than the loss of the limb. A sign of this happening to someone is that the limb turns black, until you think that fire has burned it.
Or it may become putrid after turning black, until that putridity spreads to what is next to that limb and takes hold in the whole body; then hasten to amputate it.  Likewise, if the cause of the corruption is the sting of some venomous creature, like a sea scorpion, or a snake, or a tarantula, or the like.
If the corruption or the sting is in the tip of a finger, amputate the finger and do not delay, lest the corruption spread to the hand. Likewise, if it has taken hold in the hand, amputate it from the base of the forearm, and do not delay, lest the corruption spread until it takes hold in the bones of the arm.
Likewise, if it has taken hold in the arm, amputate the arm at the elbow in the joint itself. If the corruption progresses and you see it reaching toward the shoulder, do not amputate the shoulder at all, for in that is the death of the patient. Use other treatments as much as possible.
And likewise you do with the leg: if the corruption takes hold in the toe, amputate the toe at one of the joints; and if it takes hold in the metatarsus, amputate the whole foot; and if it ascends to the knee, amputate the leg at the knee joint.
And if the corruption has reached above the knee, there is no recourse but to abandon it and leave the patient to death.  The method of amputating or excising a limb is to tie a ligature below the place you wish to cut and tie another ligature above the place.
One assistant pulls the lower ligature downwards, and another assistant pulls the upper ligature upwards. You then expose the flesh between the ligatures with a broad scalpel until all the flesh is revealed, then it is cut or excised.  It is necessary that you place linen cloths on all sides.
Lest the saw touch the healthy area, which would cause the patient excessive pain and hot swelling. If bleeding occurs during your work, quickly cauterize the area or apply some styptic powders, then return to your treatment until you finish.
Then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. I will tell you of an example of a man who experienced this very condition in his leg; that is, blackness appeared in his leg along with burning resembling fire.
This corruption first appeared in his toe, until it consumed the whole leg.  The man, upon seeing the corruption spreading in his limb, along with the intense pain and burning, amputated it himself at the joint and recovered.
After a long time, that same corruption appeared in the index finger of his hand. He came to me, and I tried to stop its spread with the medications I applied to his hand after cleansing his body.  However, the corruption did not stop and continued to spread into the other finger.
Until the corruption consumed his hand, and he asked me to amputate it. I refused, hoping to stop the spread of the corruption, and I also feared for his life if I amputated his hand, as his strength was failing. When he despaired of me, he returned to his town.
Then I heard that he had amputated his entire hand and recovered. I have recounted this story to help in cases of this type of illness and to serve as a guide to be followed.
Chapter Eighty-Eight.
On the treatment of fistulas and how to inject them with medication.
If a swelling occurs in one of the fleshy limbs and the swelling persists for a long time, then bursts or is lanced, and all the matter within it comes out, leaving the place empty like a vessel.
And the skin over it is like a rag, thinned, and its corruption has not affected bone, nerve, or ligament.  Therefore it deserves to be called a fistula, and not a sinus, unless its duration is prolonged until the corruption affects any of these members.
Then it is called a sinus or fistula, and its treatment is to cut away all that skin completely, especially if it has thinned and become like a rag, and you are certain that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
But if you hope that the skin will adhere, and its corruption has not reached that extent, and there is a thickness of flesh in the skin, then treat it with injection.  This is to look at the fistula; if it is large and the pus that flows from it is foul-smelling, then inject it with the Egyptian medicine.
which is vinegar, oil, honey, and verdigris in equal parts, gathered in a vessel and cooked over the fire until the medicine thickens and reaches the consistency of honey. Then take what you need of it, thin it with water and honey, and inject it into the fistula, and bind its mouth, and leave the medicine in it for about two hours.
Then remove it by pressing. Do this for several days until the fistula is cleansed and the stench is gone.  And it may be injected with ash water if this medicine is not available to you. This is to take the ash of grapevine wood or oak wood and pour water over it.
Then strain it and inject it until you are certain that the fistula has been cleansed. If the patient cannot tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, then inject it with water and honey in which some powdered verdigris has been mixed.
Or inject it with honey and syrup mixed together, for honey cleanses and washes, and syrup closes the fistula, especially if the syrup has a binding and drying property.  When you have done this several times and are certain that the fistula’s corruption has gone, then inject it with something that will cause flesh to grow in it.
Such as taking some palm ointment and dissolving it in rose oil and astringent syrup, or injecting it with some other medicines and ointments whose properties we have established in the chapter on ointments. If the mouth of the fistula is narrow and does not allow the injection tube to enter,
widen it slightly with an iron instrument, or place in it a pledget soaked in Egyptian ointment or theriac ointment until it widens.  And similarly, if the mouth is also wide, bring its lips together with sutures and leave only enough space for the injection tube to enter, no more.
Similarly, if the opening from which the pus flows is high up, make an incision in the lowest part of it so that the pus will flow downwards; for if pus is retained in the depth of the fistula, it prevents flesh from growing there.
If you cannot incise the fistula downwards as you wish, then position the limb so that the pus flows easily from it, as seems best to you, so that no pus at all is retained in it.
As for the warming plasters which are applied externally to the fistula, and the method of applying them, take one of the warming ointments similar to what you want, and spread it on a linen cloth, and let the cloth be large enough to cover the entire fistula. Then cut with scissors, opposite the mouth of the fistula, a hole slightly larger than the mouth of the fistula. Then spread some soft ointment on another cloth, the size of the hole, and place it there, some distance from the mouth of the fistula, so that the pus may easily escape from it, and do not remove the larger cloth until afterwards.
several days; but the one on the mouth of the fistula, you remove at all times so that what has collected there of pus may come out, and so that you may know whether what flows from it of pus is much or little, mature or immature.
And with this also, examine the place of the fistula itself; does its owner feel pain in it or not, and is there swelling in it or not? If your treatment continues thus, and you see that the matter which comes out is slight at the mouth of the fistula,
know that the fistula has adhered or is close to adhering; then dissolve it on the morrow or on the third day. And when you have dissolved the wound, change the cloths for others and renew the ointment. If after a long time thin pus comes out from the fistula, do not despair of its healing.
Its healing is near, for some people are slow in the growth of flesh in their wounds, and others the opposite. If after many days immature pus comes out from the fistula, know that the fistula has not adhered. If the fistula is slow to adhere,
and its matter is prolonged, increase the drying medicines, and let them be medicines which are moist in their consistency and dry in their strength, like palm ointment if there has been added to it an excess of extract of henbane. And the most effective thing with which it may be treated is that palm ointment be taken.
and it is dissolved with rose oil, and old wine of moderate consistency is sprinkled on it, then you knead it with it and use it. He may do the same thing if palm ointment is not available to you: honey, if you cook it until it thickens, and use it, or take myrrh, aloes, and costus, and crush all together and sprinkle it on honey which is over the fire. Then spread it on a cloth and bind it on the fistula, or it may be spread with the honey which you have cooked until it thickens, and sprinkle the medicaments on it and place the cloths on it and bind it.
And there may be used in such a case long rhubarb, the root of the asphodel, pounded costus, and centaury, singly or compounded; crush them, sift them, and sprinkle them on the honey which I have described and use it. If the matter of the fistula is prolonged and it does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption in its depth.
And it has affected the bones, or the other hard nerves or ligaments, treat it with the treatment of the fistula, as has been described.
Chapter eighty-nine.
In the treatment of the felon and the bruised nail, and the cutting off of the superfluous finger, and the separation of the adhesion of fingers.
A felon is an excess of flesh which grows under the nail of the thumb of the hand or foot, and perhaps it grows in the other fingers.  If its matter is prolonged and its treatment is neglected, it swells with a hot swelling.
Or it becomes corrupt and foul until it eats the root of the nail, and perhaps it corrupts it entirely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone until it has a foul smell, and the tip of the finger becomes broad, and its color becomes livid. Then if you treat it with what we mentioned in the classification and your treatment does not work,
it is necessary to cut with iron all the excess which grows from the nail, then cauterize the wound afterwards; for cauterization in this is very beneficial. And as for if the bone is sound and the nail also is sound,
and the corner containing the nail has drawn the flesh inwards and caused it to be pinched and injured, then it is necessary to place a thin pledget under the corner of the nail which pinches the flesh and raise it upwards, and cut that flesh gently.
And you place on what remains of the flesh of the cauterizing corrosive medicines until it all goes away, then treat it with ointments until it heals. And as for if the corruption has affected the bone, then it is necessary to cut that bone and take it out, for it does not heal at all as long as there is corrupt bone in it.
Then if you see the erosion and corruption spreading in the finger, cut it off at one of the joints as mentioned before, then treat it until it heals.  If the nail receives a blow or injury and severe pain occurs in it, then it is necessary to bleed the patient first.
Then you incise the nail with a sharp scalpel, an oblique incision from above to below, and be careful not to reach with the incision to the flesh under the nail, for by that you cause the patient severe pain and it becomes a cause for the growth of excess flesh in the place, then treat the place with what soothes the pain.
As for the extra finger which grows in some people's hands, perhaps it is entirely fleshy, and perhaps it has bones in it, and perhaps it has a nail, and the growth of some of them is at the root of the joint of some of the fingers.
Or its growth may be in some of the finger joints; those which grow in some of the finger joints do not move, and those which grow at the finger joint may move. As for that which is fleshy only, its cutting is easy, and that is to cut it at its base with a broad scalpel.
As for that whose growth is at the root of the joint, its treatment is difficult, so avoid cutting it. As for that which grows in the finger at one of the joints, it is necessary to first cut its flesh in a circular cut to the bone, then saw the bone with one of those saws suitable for that.
Then treat it until it heals. As for the adhesion which occurs to the fingers, some to others, that often occurs, and that is from what a person is born with, and it is when a wound heals or a burn from fire and the like, then it is necessary to incise that adhesion.
until the fingers return to their natural state, then place between them a pledget or a piece of cloth soaked in rose oil, lest it adhere quickly, and separate them, or place between them a thin lead plate until the place heals as it should.
And likewise, if adhesion occurs to some of the fingers with the palm, then incise that adhesion according to what is suitable and improves the shape of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
On cutting off haemorrhoids.
Haemorrhoids are twisted, thick, swollen veins filled with dark fluid which occur in most parts of the body, and most frequently in the legs, especially in the legs of those who carry burdens and those who work as porters, so firstly it is necessary to use rubbing of the body with black hellebore repeatedly with strong rubbing.
Then bleed the patient in the basilica vein, and as for its treatment with an iron instrument, it is of two types: one is to incise and remove the black blood; and the other is to extract the vein and remove it entirely.  As for its incision, it is in this manner: first bathe the leg with warm water well.
Until the thick, cloudy blood is dissolved, then tie the patient's leg from above his thigh to below his knee with a bandage, then incise the vein in one place, or in two places, or in three, with a wide incision.
Then draw out the black blood with your hand from the lower leg upwards and from above downwards until you remove the amount of blood that you see as sufficient, or what the patient's strength can tolerate. Then bandage it and instruct him to avoid foods that produce black bile, and repeat purging and bleeding.
When the veins are full and this harms the patient. As for its extraction, it is in this manner: shave the patient's leg if there is much hair on it, then take him to the bathhouse and bathe his leg with hot water until it reddens and sweats, or he performs vigorous exercise.
If a bathhouse is not available, until the limb is heated, then incise the skin opposite the vein lengthwise, either at its end near the knee or at its lower part near the heel. Then open the skin with hooks and strip away the vein from every side until it is exposed to the touch.
And when it appears, you will see it dark red.  And when it is freed from the skin, you will see it also as if it were a tendon. Then insert a probe under it until, when it is raised and comes out from the skin, hang it with a smooth, blunt hook. Then make another incision near that incision, about the width of three fingers.
Then strip the skin from over the vein until it appears, then raise it with the probe as you did and hang it with another hook as you did at first. Then make another incision, or many incisions if you need to.
Then strip it and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel, then pull it and strip it until it comes out from the second incision, then pull it to the incision above it, and do this until you pull it from the third incision, the highest of all the incisions, until when it is all out, cut it.
If it does not respond to pulling and stripping, then insert a needle with strong doubled thread, and tie it and pull it, and insert the probe under it and twist it with your hand to every side until it comes out. And be careful that it does not break; for if it breaks, it will be very difficult for you to strip it.
And harm will befall the patient from it.  And when you have stripped it all, put wool soaked in a potion and rose oil or olive oil on the place of the incisions, and treat it until it heals. If the varix is tense with convolutions and torsion in directions…
and was not straight as we said, then it is necessary that you incise it at each part of its convolutions and places of torsion, then hang it with hooks until you strip it completely, and be careful when you incise it that you do not cut or wound the vein, for it will be difficult for you to strip it, so guard your effort.
Image of the stripping by which the varix is incised.
Image of the blind hook.
It should not be hooked like other hooks, nor should it be sharp-pointed lest it wound the vein, and it should be thick, smoothly curved, for if it is thin it will cut the vein with its thinness, but it should have a considerable thickness, as we said.
Chapter ninety-one.
On the removal of the internal hemorrhoid.
This vein develops in the legs in hot countries like the Hejaz and the lands of the Arabs, and in hot, barren lands with little fertility, and it may develop in other parts of the body besides the legs, and its development is due to an infection that occurs under the skin.
As happens with the generation of living creatures and worms inside bodies, and the gourd worm and the worm that develops between the skin and the flesh; and the sign of the beginning of the development of this vein is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg, then the place suppurates, then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that suppuration.
As if it were the root of a plant or an animal; so when its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing from one dirham to two dirhams, and tied, and the lead is left hanging from the leg.
So every time something comes out of it, wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it becomes very long, cut some of it and wrap the rest; and do not cut it from its root before it all comes out, because if you cut it, it will contract and enter the flesh, causing swelling, infection in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Therefore, it should be carefully and gradually pulled out until it is completely removed and nothing of it remains in the body.  From this vein, in some people, something may come out that is five or ten cubits in length.
And it has reached me that it came out of a man to the length of twenty cubits. If it breaks for you while you are treating it, then insert a probe into its hole and thoroughly probe it along the body until all that is in it of matter is emptied, and treat the place with medicines for several days.
Then treat it with the treatment for tumors. This vein may have many branches, especially if it appears in the joint of the leg or in the leg itself, and it creates many openings, and from each opening a branch comes out. Treat it as we mentioned in the classification and as previously stated.
Chapter ninety-two.
Concerning the incision for the worm that is generated under the ear and is called the cow's ailment.
This disease is called in some of our countries the cow's ailment, because it frequently affects cows. It is a single small worm that is generated between the skin and the flesh, and it moves in the whole body, ascending and descending.
It is perceived by touch as it moves from one member to another, until it breaks through wherever it breaks through the skin, and it comes out.  Its formation is from the corruption of some humors, as happens with worms and snakes and the gourd-like growth in the abdomen.
The harm to be expected from it is that if it moves in the body and rises to the head and reaches the eye, it may open it and come out, destroying the eye. This happens frequently. If you wish to treat it and remove it, this should be done when it is moving and apparent to the touch.
Then you should bind above and below it tightly with a bandage, then incise over it and remove it. If it has gone deep into the flesh and you do not find it, apply cautery with fire to the area until you burn it. The greatest harm to be expected from it is its corruption of the eye, as we said.
If you see it has reached the head near the eye, bind tightly below it on the forehead, then incise over it and remove it.  The patient should be treated with purgative medicines to cleanse the body of bad, corrupt humors and should avoid foods that produce putrefaction.
Chapter Ninety-Three.
On the incision for the disease known as the gnawing ulcer.
This disease, which in our country is called *nafir*, is a pain that appears in some parts of the body and then moves from one member to another. I have seen it as I describe to you.
I was called to a sick woman in the countryside. She uncovered her arm and showed me a slight swelling in a vein of the forearm. After a short while, I saw that swelling move along the ulna like a worm, ascending to her shoulder as quickly as possible, like mercury.
When it moved from one place to another, the pain left that place and settled in the shoulder. Then, after a while, it spread throughout her body until it reached the other arm.  She then told me that it circulated around her whole body, as I witnessed.
I was amazed by the speed of its movement from one member to another. I had never before seen this disease with my own eyes in this manner, although I had seen many people whose pain moved from one member to another.  I had never seen it as I saw it in this woman.
I judged that this was only because the woman was a country dweller, with a dry body and visible veins.  Therefore, this moving wind was apparent to the senses. It would not appear in this way in those of comfortable circumstances, with moist bodies and hidden veins.
If you wish to treat it and the patient feels pain, and if it appears to you visibly as we have mentioned, then bind above and below it tightly with a bandage and incise it so that the contained wind may escape, and cauterize the place.
If you do not see it with your eyes, then treat it by means of things that dispel and disperse the wind, such as the seed of rue and the seed of  *siqbinj* and similar medicines.
Chapter Ninety-Four.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows differ according to their types and according to the places in the body where they lodge. As for their differences according to their types, there are large ones and small ones, hollow glass ones and solid glass ones, and some have three points and some have four.
Some have barbs and some have splinters. As for those according to the organs in which they lodge, they are of two kinds: either the organs are hollow principal organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like; then if an arrow lodges in one of these organs, and the signs of death which I shall describe to you later appear, then you should avoid extracting that arrow from it, for death will overtake its owner in most instances. But if these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow has not disappeared into the depth of the organ, then extract it and treat the wound. And of the signs of the brain, if an arrow strikes it and penetrates the bone and wounds the membrane which is upon the brain, then there results from that a severe headache, drowsiness, and dizziness.
But if these bad signs do not appear, and the arrow has not disappeared into the depth of the organ, then extract it and treat the wound. And of the signs of the brain, if an arrow strikes it and penetrates the bone and wounds the membrane which is upon the brain, then there results from that a severe headache, drowsiness, and dizziness. and redness in the eyes and redness of the tongue, convulsions, mental confusion, vomiting, and sometimes blood comes from the nostrils or ears, and sometimes speech is lost and the voice is gone, and a white moisture resembling gruel comes from the place of the wound, and a watery substance like the water of flesh flows from it.
If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treating the patient and from extracting the arrow if it has not been extracted. As for the signs of an arrow if it strikes the heart, and it is near the left breast and you feel it as if it has been driven into something solid and not into something empty,
and perhaps the arrow has a movement resembling the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and coldness of the extremities and a cold sweat and fainting follow; then know that death is inevitably approaching. And a sign of the arrow if it wounds the lung is the escape of frothy blood from the wound.
And the vessels which are near the neck swell, and the color of the patient changes, and he breathes heavily and desires to inhale cold air. If the arrow strikes the diaphragm which is in the chest, then it will be near the small ribs, and the breathing will be great with severe pain.
And he sighs and all the members of the shoulders move. And if the arrow strikes the liver, severe pain follows, and blood resembling the liver in its redness comes from the wound. And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then perhaps something undigested from the food comes from the wound.
And its condition is evident. And if the arrow strikes the abdomen and becomes embedded in it, and something of the excrement or fat or intestine which has been perforated comes from the wound, then there is no hope for its treatment or for the extraction of the arrow. If the arrow strikes the bladder and urine comes out,
and something protrudes from it to the outside and the pain becomes severe for the patient, then know that he is doomed. As for the other members, like the face, eye, throat, shoulder, arm, vertebrae of the back, clavicle, thigh, leg, and similar members, they are mostly safe.
When the arrow does not encounter an artery or nerve and the arrow is not poisoned. And I inform you of some of what I have witnessed concerning these arrows so that you may deduce from it your treatment. That is, an arrow once struck a man in the inner canthus of his eye at the root of the nose.
Then I extracted it for him from the other side under the lobe of the ear, and he recovered and nothing untoward happened to his eye. And I extracted another arrow for a Jew which had struck him in the lobe of his eye under the lower eyelid, and the arrow had hidden itself, and I grasped only its small point which is attached to the wood.
And it was a large arrow from the composite arrows, square-headed, smooth, without barbs.  The Jew recovered and nothing bad happened to his eye. And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian, and the arrow was Arabic.
And it was one with barbs; so I made an incision upon him between the two muscles of the neck, and it had sunk into his throat. So I gently manipulated it until I extracted it.  The Christian was saved and recovered. And I extracted another arrow for a man which had struck him in his abdomen, and we estimated that he would die from it.
Then when thirty days or so had passed and nothing changed in his condition, I incised over the arrow and maneuvered it and extracted it, and he recovered and no ill effects occurred.  And I saw a man whom an arrow had struck in his back, and the wound had closed over it.
Then after seven years the arrow emerged at the root of her thigh. And I saw a woman whom an arrow had struck in her abdomen, and the wound had closed, and the arrow remained. Nothing changed in her condition, nor did she experience harm from it in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man whom an arrow had struck in the face, and the wound had closed, and he experienced little pain from it. And there are many similar cases. And I extracted an arrow for a man, one of the Sultan's guards, which had struck him in the middle of his nose, leaning slightly to the right side.
And the whole arrow was hidden. I was called to treat him three days after the arrow had struck. I found the arrow wound very narrow, so I explored it with a thin probe, but I did not feel it. He felt a stinging pain under his ear on the right side of the incision.
I hoped that the stinging pain was from the tip of the arrow, so I dressed the area with a dressing possessing drawing and ripening power, hoping that the area would swell and the arrow's location would become apparent, so that I could incise it. But nothing occurred in the area to indicate that the arrow had reached that location.
So I continued the dressing for many days, but nothing happened. Then the wound healed, and the patient remained despondent about its removal for a time, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and told me. So I applied a strong, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened, and I probed it, and I felt the thin tip of the arrow that adheres to the wood. Then I increased the opening of the wound with that strong medicine until the tip of the arrow appeared to us clearly.  And this took about four months.
Then, when the wound widened and I was able to insert forceps into it, I pulled and moved it, but it did not respond to removal. So I continued to gently manipulate it and devise methods with various instruments, until one day I grasped it with firm forceps, as shown in the image at the end of the chapter.
And the physicians judged that the cartilage of his nose would not heal, but I healed it, and the wound closed, and the patient recovered completely, without any further harm. And I tell you how to remove some arrows so that you may use this as a measure and guide for what I have not mentioned.
Because the parts of this craft and its details cannot be grasped by description nor encompassed by a book.  Rather, the skillful craftsman measures the much by the little, and the absent by the present, and devises a new work and a new instrument in the case of strange occurrences.
If we descend to this craft, then I say that arrows are removed from the members in which they are embedded in two ways: either by pulling from the place where they entered, or from the opposite direction; and those that are removed from where they entered.
Either the arrow is protruding in a fleshy place, and it is pulled out; and if it does not yield to removal from its place of impact, then you should leave it for some days until the flesh around it putrifies, so that its removal is facilitated; and likewise if it is embedded in bone.
And if it does not yield to removal, leave it also for days and return to pulling and moving it each day, for it will come out.  And if it does not yield to removal after days, then you should pierce around the arrow in the bone itself from every side with a fine borer until you widen the space for the arrow, then pull it out and remove it.
If the arrow embedded in the bone of the head has penetrated deeply into one of the ventricles of the brain, and some of those symptoms I mentioned to you appear in the patient, then refrain from pulling the arrow and leave it until its condition improves after some days.
then persevere in pulling out the arrow.  And if it is very deeply embedded and does not yield to pulling, use the borers around the arrow as I described to you, then treat the wound until it heals. And as for if the arrow has disappeared in a place of the body, and is hidden from sensation, then explore it with a probe. And if you feel it, then pull it with some instrument suitable for pulling it.  And if you are unable to reach it because of the narrowness of the wound and the depth of the arrow, and there is neither bone nor nerve nor vein there,
then incise it until the wound widens and you can reach the arrow so that you may extract it.  If it has barbs, grasp them and free the flesh embedded in them from every side by every means you can. And persevere, if you are unable to free the flesh, in breaking the barbs and twisting them until you are freed.
And when you attempt to extract the arrow in whatever place it may be, use the turning of your hand with hooks in all directions until you free it. And be extremely gentle, lest the arrow break and it becomes difficult for you to pull it out.  And if you are unable to reach it in your time,
leave it for days until the flesh around it putrefies, then return to it, for it will then be easier.  And if bleeding obstructs you, use what we mentioned of treatment in its chapter. And safeguard yourself from cutting a vein, or nerve, or tendon, and use skill.
By every means you can free the arrow, and let that be with gentleness and slowness and steadiness as I described to you. And it is necessary for you, when pulling the arrow, to place the patient in the position he was in when the arrow struck, for that is most suitable.
If you cannot do that, then use whatever positions you can. As for the arrow that exits from the opposite side, either something of it will have emerged outwardly, or you will find the tip of the arrow by feeling from the top of the skin nearby and see it protruding.
Then make an incision upon it, and let the incision be of a size sufficient to admit the hooks, then pull it, for it will be easy to remove. And if it sticks in a bone, turn your hand in a circle until the arrow affects the bone and widens for itself, then pull it.
Otherwise, leave it for days, then return to it until it comes out. And if the shaft of the arrow is in it, push it with it. And if the shaft has fallen off and you wish to use pushing, then insert the hollow instrument so that its cavity enters the tail of the arrow, then push it with it.
If the arrow is hollow, then push it with an instrument that enters that cavity, for the arrow will easily come out by that. If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut away all the flesh in which the poison has become, if you can do that, then treat it with what is suitable for that.
If the arrow that has fallen into the chest, or into the abdomen, or into the bladder, or into the flank was near what can be felt with a probe, and you could make an incision upon it, then make an incision and be careful not to cut a vein or a nerve, and take it out.
Then suture the wound if it needs suturing, then treat it until it heals.  The picture of the hooks with which arrows are extracted:
Their ends are like the beak of a bird; they are made like a file, so that when they grasp the arrow or something, they do not let go.  And various kinds are made of them, large, small, and medium-sized, all according to the size and smallness of the arrow, and the width and narrowness of the wound.
The image of the hollow pusher:
The image of the solid pusher:
This is solid at the end like an awl, to make it easier to enter the hollow arrow and push it.
Chapter ninety-five.
On the incision of veins.
The veins which it is customary to bleed in the body are thirty veins, of which sixteen are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as the "sensitive" veins; and the two arteries in the temples, which are apparent; and the two veins at the corners of the eyes, known as the "visual" veins.
And the vein which is erect in the middle of the forehead, and the vein which is at the tip of the nose, and the two jugular veins in the neck, and the two veins in the upper lip of the mouth, and the two veins in the lower lip—these veins are known as the "jaw veins"—and the two veins beneath the tongue.
As for the veins which are bled in the arm and hand, they are five veins: one of them is the cephalic, which is on the outer side, and the common people call it the "head vein"; and the median, which is the middle vein, and is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, and the common people call it the "body vein".
And the basilic, which is situated on the inner side, and is also called the axillary; and the common people call it the "belly vein"; and the vein of the forearm, which is situated on the ulna, and to which it adheres, and which appears clearly above the thumb; and the asil.
And this is the vein which is between the little finger and the ring finger; it has two branches. And in the leg and foot there are three veins: one of them is that which is below the hollow of the knee on the outer side; and the second is the saphenous, and its place is at the heel on the inner side; and the nerve vein, and its place is at the heel on the outer side.
And in the other leg there are three veins similar to them. As for the two veins which are behind the ears, the benefit of bleeding them is for chronic catarrhs, migraine, and ringworm, and chronic bad sores of the head; and the manner of bleeding them is as I describe.
And that is to shave the head of the patient and rub his head well in the place of the two veins with a rough cloth, then the patient's neck is constricted with a turban until the two veins and their place appear behind the ears in the two low places of the head; then you search for them with your finger, and where you feel their pulsation under your finger, there you mark with ink.
Then you take a lancet, which is known as the *nashal*, and you insert it under the vein in the skin until the lancet reaches the bone; then you lift your hand with the vein and skin upwards, and you cut the vein together with the skin, a cleanly cut; and the length of the cut will be the amount of two fingers placed together.
Or something similar, and you let out the amount of blood that you want, then you bind them with bandages and leave them until they heal.  And I have already mentioned in the beginning of the book their cutting and cauterization. As for the two arteries which are in the temples, the benefit of bleeding them is for chronic migraine, severe headache, persistent ophthalmia, and the flow of sharp humors which descend to the eyes.
And the manner of bleeding them is as I describe to you: the patient constricts his neck with a turban until the two veins appear clearly to the touch, and their pulsation becomes apparent under your finger; then you mark with ink. Then you lift the skin from above the vein upwards with your index finger.
And you insert the lancet, the *nashal*, from below and lift the vein upwards and cut it as you did with the other two veins, and you let out the amount of blood according to your need, then you loosen the constriction of the patient's neck and you place your finger on the vein for a while.
Then you place on it cotton and a bandage and bind it tightly from above and leave it until it heals. And I have already mentioned them, and their cutting and cauterization, in the beginning of the book. As for bleeding the vein of the forehead, its benefit, after bleeding the cephalic vein, is for chronic ailments of the face such as ringworm, ulcers, and persistent redness.
And the manner of bleeding it, as I describe to you: the patient constricts his neck with a turban until the vein appears; then you take the instrument which is called the axe, and this is its image:
You place the projecting spike which is in the head of the axe on the vein itself, and you strike from above with a comb or something similar, and you let the blood flow to the amount you want; then you loosen the constriction of the patient's neck and bind it until it heals.
And it may be opened with a wide lancet, except that it is not proper that the lancet be sharp-pointed like the other lancets, but rather it should be slightly broad-ended, and you incise it obliquely, because the bone is nearby, and perhaps the lancet will break in it if it is thin.
As for the two veins which are at the temples of the eyes, their benefit is for ailments of the eye such as ringworm, redness, and blemishes, and diseases of the face. As for the manner of bleeding them, it is that the patient constricts his neck with a turban, then you bleed them while you are standing over his head, and let the incision be somewhat obliquely lengthwise with a small lancet, slightly broad.
For the location has no flesh in it; for if the lancet is thin-pointed, perhaps it will break. Then you let out the amount of blood you need and you place cotton on them and bind them for one night, then you unbind them. As for bleeding the vein of the nose, it is beneficial for acute fevers.
And severe headache and from the diseases of the face like the red eruption which appears in the nose, especially if it is chronic.  The manner of bleeding it is that the patient constricts his neck, then you hold his nose with your left hand and take a thin, long lancet.
And you pierce it in the middle of the nasal bone itself, between the nasal septum, straight, because the vein does not appear to the touch there, for the blood emerges immediately.  And it is necessary that you deepen your hand with the lancet a little and let out the amount of blood you need, then bind it for a night, for it clots quickly.
As for the jugulars, the benefit of bleeding them is for shortness of breath, the beginning of leprosy, and melancholic diseases which appear on the surface of the skin, like black vitiligo, impetigo, bad ulcers, and sores.  The manner of bleeding them is that the patient constricts beneath them in his neck with a ligature, and the surgeon stands at the head of the patient.
And the patient is seated on a chair, then you bleed the vein lengthwise, a somewhat wide bleeding, then you let out a moderate amount of blood, or according to what you see of the need for it, then you do likewise with the other vein, then you untie the ligature.
And you constrict the two veins with a moderate constriction, lest the patient suffocate, and you leave him until the next day, for the wound heals. As for the veins of the temples, the benefit of bleeding them, after bleeding the cephalic vein, is that it benefits from canker sores in the mouth, corruption of the gums, bad ulcers, fissures of the lips, and bad ulcers.
which are in the nose and around it.  The manner of bleeding them is that you seat the patient before you and constrict his neck with a turban, then you turn back his lips and look at the two veins, one of which you see to the right of the lip and the other to the left of it, and you ascertain them by their blackness.
And that is also because around them are small, black veins, so you cut them with a severed cut. If it is difficult for you and you do not know what they are, aim to cut the largest and most apparent of them.  And likewise, do in the two veins which are in the lower lip.
As for the two veins which are under the tongue, the benefit of bleeding them, after bleeding the cephalic vein, is for the inflammations which are in the throat from a disease of the uvula and diseases of the mouth.  The manner of bleeding them is that you seat the patient between your hands, facing the sun, and you raise his tongue and look under the tongue, on one side a vein and on the other side a vein, and their color is toward blackness.
Then you bleed them, and be careful not to go too far in cutting them, for under them are arteries, so perhaps a flow of blood from those arteries might occur. As for the three veins which are bled in the elbow, they are those which customarily are bled in all people, and their bleeding is in two ways.
Either by piercing with a wide, lancet-shaped or olive-shaped scalpel to the depth, or either by incising with a knife-like scalpel, which is the *nashil* [and this is its picture], a picture of the wide, lancet-shaped scalpel:
It is wide as you see, so that it is suitable for opening hollow, full, prominent, apparent, thick veins which contain thick, turbid blood. And this is a picture of the olive-shaped scalpel:
And this scalpel is less wide and thinner at the point, suitable for bleeding thin veins which contain thin, bilious blood. And this is a picture of the *nashil* scalpel:
This is the *nashil*, which is suitable for incising, and there are wide and thin types of it, according to the width and narrowness of the veins also.  And one may infer from this to others, and it is well-known among the artisans.
As for the basilic vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of bleeding it is that it draws blood from the illnesses which are under the throat and neck, from what is next to the chest and abdomen.  It is necessary for the phlebotomist, when bleeding it, to be cautious and be on guard against it, for beneath it is an artery; if he makes a mistake and goes too deep with the scalpel, he will cut that artery.
Then bleeding will occur; therefore it is necessary that its bleeding should not be with the lancet, but its bleeding should be an incision with the *nashil*. If the basilic vein does not appear clearly, then it is necessary to avoid it and turn to another, or seek one of its branches.
Or bleed in its place the vein of the arm, for it is clear, and incise it with the *nashil* scalpel as we said. If you wish to bleed it itself, then before tightening the arm it is necessary to feel the place until you recognize the place of the pulse, then mark it with ink.
Then you tie the arm and incise the vein with a sharp incision with the *nashil* scalpel as we said, and take care that the blow falls away from the place of the artery. And when you see, upon tightening the ligature, swelling in the place which you marked with ink, then that swelling is the swelling of the artery, so avoid it.
If you see the blood, upon bleeding, spurt like the urine of a boy, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is from the artery; then immediately place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger; if the blood stops, it will often stop, and tighten the arm.
And leave it, and warn the patient against neglecting it, and let him be in bed and not move for days until it heals. If the blood does not stop and overcomes you, and you do not have medicine at hand, then amputate the artery if it appears to you, for its ends will contract and the blood will stop.
Or take a pistachio shell and split it, and take one half and bind it tightly to the place of the vein with a ligature and pledgets until the next day. If the blood stops, well and good; otherwise, treat it with what was previously mentioned of placing styptics, and stopping its blood is not difficult in most cases.
Because of the smallness of the wound and the tightness of the ligature in the arm, know that; as for the median vein, the benefit of bleeding it is that it draws blood from the upper head and the lower body, because it is composed of a branch of the basilic and a branch of the cephalic, as we said.
It is necessary for the one who bleeds it to be careful in bleeding it, for beneath it is a nerve; if he increases in the depth of the incision and injures the nerve, numbness occurs in it which is difficult to cure, and perhaps it will not heal at all. And this nerve is often perceptible to the touch.
If it is hidden in some people and is thin and cannot be distinguished, then you should make your incision of it a superficial one and avoid the nerve as much as possible. If the vein is between two nerves, then split the vein lengthwise. As for the cephalic vein, the benefit of bleeding it is that it draws blood from the head.
And it benefits from diseases of the eyes, and it is necessary in this vein especially, if you wish to bleed it, to make an incision with the olive-shaped scalpel or with the wide, basil-shaped scalpel, because it is the safest of all veins, because there is no artery or nerve beneath it.
Except that it is necessary for you, when bleeding, to avoid with the scalpel only the head of the muscle and seek the soft place; and it does not harm if it is not struck at the first stroke to be bled again several times, except that it may swell in some people if it is not bled at the first stroke.
But that swelling does not harm it at all. As for the method of bleeding, its complications, and what should precede in its treatment, the first of that is that you should know that bleeding is either used only to preserve health.
Or it is used in illnesses.  That which is used to preserve health and prolong it and to guard against the occurrence of illnesses is that bleeding should be in one of the three veins in the elbow, I mean the cephalic, the median, and the basilic, and that bleeding should be at the beginning of spring if the signs of plethora appear.
And the bleeding should be on Sunday or Tuesday after three hours of the day have passed. As for the bleeding which is used in illnesses, it does not have a limited time, but whenever necessity and need demand it, by night or by day.
And at every hour and at every time.  Children should not be bled until they reach fourteen years, nor should old men who have passed sixty years be bled.  If someone intends to bleed for any reason whatsoever.
He should cleanse his bowels before bleeding with a gentle enema if there is much retained excrement, lest putrid waste be drawn into the veins from the bowels during bleeding, harming the principal organs.  And do not bleed the anxious, nor the drunkard, nor the intoxicated until that passes from them.
And bleeding should also be avoided after fever, vomiting, diarrhea, excessive sexual intercourse, exertion, exercise, wakefulness, fasting, and everything which weakens the strength, whether physical or psychological. Then look to thinning the humors beforehand if the blood is thick.
With foods, drinks, and medicines, if he is able to do so. Then he should enter the bath, if nothing prevents him, or do some exercise, so that the blood is thinned, and make his bleeding in the middle of the day, as we said, and he should aim to free his chest that day from all bad psychological conditions.
Such as worries, anger, and fear, and from all physical conditions like excessive exertion and strain, sexual intercourse, and the like.  And let him prepare for his session the things which people are accustomed to using, such as various perfumes and fragrant herbs, entertainments, and the like, each person according to what he is able.
Then the phlebotomist sits on a cushion higher than the cushion on which the patient sits. Then he extends his arm, and the phlebotomist rubs it with his hand two or three times, then he tightens the ligature with the fillet and twists it two or three times. Let the tightening be moderate.
Because if the tightening is not moderate, either by excessive tightening, it prevents the flow of blood, or if it is towards relaxation, it also prevents the flow of blood. Then, after tightening, it is necessary that the patient rubs both his hands together.
Until the veins swell and become apparent to the touch. Then the phlebotomist wipes the lancet with a little old oil, especially, then places the index finger of his left hand on the vein itself, a little below the place he wants to bleed, lest the vein slip and he avoids the incision. Because some veins you find are like a tendon, they slip away during phlebotomy, and some are full of wind.  When you place the lancet on them, they sink below the lancet and deceive the phlebotomist, and the lancet does not open the vein, or if it does open it, it is only a narrow opening.
Therefore, the phlebotomist should be careful and deliberate in all these matters. Then he lowers the lancet. If the vein opens on that attempt, well and good; otherwise, he repeats it again a little below or above that place quickly, if the place is not swollen.
If the patient swells or is distressed, leave him for a day or two and do not tighten the ligature, for it may cause a hot swelling, and do not let him enter the bath. Then he may repeat the phlebotomy if he wishes. If the lancet is inserted and the opening is small and the flow of blood is thin,
and you fear that the desired amount of blood will not come out, then return the lancet to the same hole gently and in a straight line, and increase the opening a little, and do this quickly before the place swells, for in many people the place may swell with a small opening.
But if you see that it has swollen, do not repeat it at all, for it will not help you. Put something of oil dregs on it, for it facilitates the flow of blood and it is better in this case than oil itself and other ointments as well.
Therefore use oil dregs in all your phlebotomies when the flow of blood is difficult.  The theriac and the schechnaia may also do this if one of them is placed on the site; if the blood is thick, it will become thin and dissolve.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of phlebotomy—and this often happens, especially to someone who has only been phlebotomized once or if the opening of the vein was small—act quickly and place a sponge soaked in slightly warmed salt water on the swelling and bind it for an hour; then it will resolve.
And it is necessary to do this after the blood has completely exited the vein itself or from another vein. If something black or green remains in the place after several days, it does no harm. If you wish, apply something of aloe and myrrh dissolved.
Or something of the juice of the plantain and the like.  A swelling and a protrusion often occur when phlebotomizing the basilica vein. Place your hand on it; if you find it soft when you touch it, then it is a benign protrusion, and beware of placing anything we have mentioned on it.
For it may bleed arterial blood; but bandage it with something astringent to solidify the area, then treat it with the rest of the treatment until it heals. It is necessary to remove blood from each person according to his strength and the color that predominates in his blood.
For if the blood is black, let it flow until it becomes red; and likewise if you see it thick, let it flow until it becomes thin; and likewise if it is sharp, until its sharpness is gone.  It is necessary for someone who is full-bodied and strong and needs to have blood removed at once…
…to widen the vein incision and the lancet should be wide. And for someone who is weak, the opposite is true. It is necessary to remove it in several times, and the opening should be narrow. The best thing to use in phlebotomy is something sharp, well-sharpened, incised, not pierced.
This type of phlebotomy is safe from bleeding and from cutting a nerve; it is better and safer than phlebotomy across or lengthwise. If someone usually faints during phlebotomy, it is necessary to give him something to eat before phlebotomy, bread soaked in pomegranate juice or oxymel.
If he is feverish and blood is removed from him three or four times, if he has a cold temperament, let him take before phlebotomy bread soaked in hydromel or in honey-sweetened drink with herbs or in a fragrant rose-scented drink.
If fainting occurs during phlebotomy and its cause is the loss of a large amount of blood, then he should be given meat broth and a thin fragrant drink, and he should use aromatherapy with rosewater, and rub his chest with it, and he should use everything else we mentioned in the section on fainting.
which results from vomiting. As for someone who wants to relieve his arm and remove blood a second time, it is necessary for someone whose phlebotomy was for much evacuation and whose strength is weak, that the blood is removed little by little, according to his strength, on consecutive days.
As for someone who wants to relieve his arm and remove blood a second time and his body is strong, let him do that after seven or nine hours from his first phlebotomy. As for someone who wants to draw blood from his body to the opposite side to which it has inclined, it is necessary to relieve him on the second or third day.
As for someone whose body contains much blood, which has become hot and intense and caused fever, it is necessary to remove blood from him at once, and to remove a large amount, and to widen the opening until fainting occurs, after having observed all the conditions of phlebotomy. And that you place your hand on his pulse when the blood flows, lest death occur instead of fainting, for that often happens if the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligence occurs. And it is not necessary, if you want to open the arm and remove blood a second time.
And if the mouth of the vein is closed and the exit of blood is difficult, do not prick it forcefully or twist it strongly, for that is very bad. Rather, either leave it until you phlebotomize it a second time, or remove with the blade of the lancet what has solidified of blood in the mouth of the vein.
Or apply to it something of salt dissolved in water, or apply to it something of theriac or  schexnaia, and prick it gently until the blood comes out.  If the vein has swollen, leave it.
And do not touch it until the swelling subsides. If necessity demands removing blood a second time, then either phlebotomize above that place, or phlebotomize in the other arm or in another vein.
As for phlebotomizing the basilic vein, it is phlebotomized instead of the cephalic and basilic veins if they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of them.  Its method of phlebotomy is that the patient puts his hand in hot water until the forearm reddens and the vein appears clearly, then it is tied above it with a ligature slightly, a moderate tightening.
Then phlebotomize the vein at a slight angle, neither across nor lengthwise, and let the opening be wide, and let your phlebotomy be slightly above the joint of the hand. If the exit of blood is difficult, return the hand to the vessel with hot water and let the blood flow into the water.
Until it reaches your need. If you are in the summer, you may dispense with returning the hand to hot water.  The use of hot water to facilitate the flow of blood is most often in winter. Phlebotomy of this vein is safest of all veins. Because there is neither a major vein nor a nerve beneath it. As for phlebotomizing the vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments. Its method of phlebotomy is that you tie the wrist with a ligature or with your hand after putting it in hot water until the vein swells.
Because there is neither a major vein nor a nerve beneath it. As for phlebotomizing the vein of the right hand, it is beneficial for liver ailments. Its method of phlebotomy is that you tie the wrist with a ligature or with your hand after putting it in hot water until the vein swells. And it becomes very apparent to the touch, then phlebotomize it at a slight angle.  Even if you cut it completely, it will not harm him at all. Be careful not to thrust your hand deeply with the lancet, for beneath it are the nerves of the fingers, and the place is devoid of flesh. Then return the hand to the hot water.
And leave it so the blood flows in it. For if you do not return it to the hot water, the blood will congeal in the mouth of the vein and prevent its flow. When you have removed the amount of blood needed, place ointment and salt on the vein lest it close quickly.
And similarly you should do with every narrow branch. As for the benefit of phlebotomizing from the left hand, it is beneficial for ailments of the spleen.  You do the same in its phlebotomy as you did in the second, exactly. As for phlebotomizing the saphenous vein, its benefit is for the diseases in the lower body, such as uterine ailments.
And the retention of menses, and kidney diseases, and chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar diseases. Its method of phlebotomy is that he puts his leg in hot water and rubs it until the veins swell, then you tie above the ankle joint with a ligature; the vein is located at the heel, on the surface towards the big toe.
And many branches extend from it on the surface of the foot. Therefore, phlebotomize in its widest branch, or at the heel where it converges; this is best and safest. If you phlebotomize it on the surface of the foot, be careful of the nerves which are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
And make your incision as if you intend to amputate it, and let the scalpel be sharp. If the exit of blood is difficult, let him return his leg to the hot water, and leave the blood to flow in it until it is emptied. If the phlebotomist misses the vein in the first attempt,
let him repeat the phlebotomy a little higher. For the location is safe, and there is no fear of harm from it if you are careful of the nerve, as we said. And you do the same with the saphenous vein of the other leg, exactly. As for the sciatic vein, its location, as we said, is at the heel from the outer side.
And its benefit is for pain in the hip, if it is due to hot blood. And its method of phlebotomy is that you put the patient in the bath, and quickly tie his leg from the hip to above the heel with a four-finger-wide, long, thin bandage, for it does not appear otherwise.
Then, when it appears, phlebotomize it in any way that suits you: either by incision, which is best, or by amputating it, or by splitting it. For its location is safe, and it is very hidden in most people. If you do not find it,
and it does not appear at all to the touch, then phlebotomize some of its branches, which appear on the dorsum of the foot towards the little finger and ring finger, and be careful of the nerves, and let out the amount of blood you desire.
Then untie the bandage and place cotton on the site of the phlebotomy and bandage the area tightly, for it will quickly heal.
Chapter ninety-six.
On cupping and its method of use.
Cupping instruments may be made of horn, wood, copper, or glass, and cupping is of two types: one is cupping with incision and evacuation of blood, and the other is cupping without incision.
This cupping without incision is of two types.
And cupping of the cheeks, which are the sides of the neck on both sides, and cupping of the chin, which is below the lower jaw of the mouth, and cupping of the shoulders, and cupping of the coccyx on the rump, and cupping of the forearms, which are the middle of the arms, and cupping of the legs, and cupping of the heels.
Cupping draws blood from the small veins spread throughout the flesh, and for that reason it does not weaken as much as bloodletting, and cupping, whether with fire or without, should not be used in any illness that is due to fullness until the entire body is purged.
If cupping is needed due to illness or habit, we use it at any time, at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, in the middle, or at any time.
That is because some people, when their blood increases to the point where it needs to be removed by cupping, feel heaviness and headache in their heads, and some feel fullness and redness in their face, head, and neck, and some feel itching in their face and sides, darkness and pain in their eyes, and some itch at the site of their cupping.
And some laugh a lot, and some find the taste of blood in their mouths, their gums swell, and they spit blood, and some sleep a lot, and some see blood, redness, pus, and wounds in their sleep and things like that, so when we see any of that...
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then order cupping after two or three hours of the day have passed. As for the benefit of cupping the temples, it benefits from heaviness in the head and water pouring into the eyes.
But it should be after evacuating the whole body, and this cupping can be a substitute for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein. It is warned against using it for those who are cold-headed or have a cold, for it harms them greatly.
Therefore, the elderly and those with cold diseases in their heads should not use it, and those who persist in it will develop forgetfulness.
Therefore, the cupper should be instructed to lower his hand with the cupping glass a little lower, for fear of generating forgetfulness. As for cupping the nape of the neck, it is a substitute for phlebotomy of the basilic and cephalic veins.
Therefore, it benefits from asthma, shortness of breath, rupture of the respiratory apparatus, cough, and fullness.  The cupping of the nape of the neck should be raised a little, for if it is lowered, it generates weakness in the heart and stomach.
As for cupping the mastoid processes, it benefits from pains occurring in the head, ophthalmia, migraine, angina, and pain in the roots of the teeth. It is a substitute for phlebotomy of the basilic vein.  The cupper should be instructed not to deepen his hand with the lancet, lest he cut an artery and cause bleeding.
As for cupping under the chin, it benefits from thrush in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar diseases in the mouth. It may substitute for phlebotomy of the labial veins. As for cupping the shoulders, it benefits from palpitations that arise from fullness and heat.
As for cupping the forearms, it benefits from what benefits phlebotomy of the three veins, the basilic, cephalic, and median cubital, because it draws blood from all those small veins in the flesh and attracts those small veins from other thicker veins until the attraction reaches the three large veins.
The cupper should be instructed not to deepen the incision, because the area is devoid of flesh and beneath it are nerves and arteries. As for the single cupping applied to the coccyx, it benefits from haemorrhoids and lower sores.
The cupper should be instructed that the cupping glass be large and made of copper, because the area requires strong suction and a glass cupping glass might break and require many incisions. As for cupping the legs, it noticeably reduces fullness.
Because it draws blood from the whole body, it benefits from chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder, promotes menstruation, benefits from boils and abscesses, and acts in place of phlebotomy of the saphenous veins, except that it greatly weakens the body and causes fainting in most people.  The benefit of cupping the ankles is similar to the benefit of cupping the legs.
The method of applying cupping is that the cupping glass is first placed empty and moderate suction is applied. Do not prolong the placement of the cupping glasses, but rather place them quickly and remove them quickly so that the humors may flow to the area evenly. Continue to repeat this until you see the area has reddened and opened.
When the redness of blood appears, then make an incision and gently resume suction. Then observe the condition of the bodies. If a person has loose flesh with porous skin, then one incision should suffice, lest the area ulcerate.
Instruct the cupper to widen the incision slightly and deepen it, and to adjust the suction gently and delicately. If the blood is thick, then two incisions should be made; the first to open a path for the thin and watery blood, and the second to thoroughly extract the thick blood.
If the blood is very thick, repeat the incision a third time to achieve the goal. In general, if we want to remove a small amount of blood, one incision suffices; if we want to remove a large amount of blood, we make more incisions, especially if we judge the blood to be thick.
Then a deep incision should be made; the moderate limit for the incision is the depth of the skin only. What ointments, waters, and things should be avoided when applying cupping. As for someone whose skin is thick, hard, dry, and whose pores are tight,
the areas for cupping should be anointed with opening, softening, and resolving ointments. If it is summer, then use rose ointment, violet ointment, sweet almond oil, or pumpkin seed oil.
And if it is winter, then use narcissus ointment, iris ointment, chamomile ointment, lily ointment, or similar. If the waste matter is thick and cold, then use marjoram oil, balm oil, frankincense oil, or rue oil, or similar.
If the patient has wide pores and soft flesh, then the ointment should be avoided. These people should wash their cupping sites after cupping with rose water, cold water, gooseberry water, pumpkin water, or chickweed water, or similar. As for someone whose blood is very moist,
he should wash his cupping sites with vinegar, or with water of the acacia and sumac, or similar. As for someone whose waste matter is thick, he should wash his cupping sites with old wine, or with marjoram water, or a decoction of rue or chamomile, or similar. Cupping should be avoided in the bathhouse and immediately after bathing.
Rather, it should be done an hour or two after leaving the bathhouse. No one should sleep after cupping. What the cupper and phlebotomist should arrange before and after cupping.
First, you must observe whether the patient or phlebotomist is choleric, and whether his blood is predominantly sharp and inflamed.  If so, he should take cooling agents such as pomegranates, dandelion with vinegar, lettuce, oxymel, and sherbet, or similar. He should eat the intestines and flesh of sheep, stews, and sour foods, or similar.
And if his temperament is cold, he should be given honeyed drinks, or a drink of quince, or seed oxymel.  He should consume moderately aromatic wine, something between old and new. He should be instructed to eat sparingly, and his food should consist of intestines, chicken giblets, sparrows, and pigeon squabs, stewed. The drink on the day of cupping and phlebotomy should be more than the food.
It may also be necessary to give some people, at certain times, some of the Mithridatium, or musk medicine, or theriac before or after cupping and phlebotomy, to strengthen the principal organs and thin the blood.  It should not be given to those suffering from fever.
As for cuppings that are without a condition, these are the cuppings that are placed on the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, the region of the kidneys, and the hip joint, because these organs do not tolerate incision, but rather what is sought from them is either drawing blood from one organ to another.
Such as placing the cupping glass on the breasts in cases of epistaxis, or using it to draw out cold wind that has settled in an organ, as when we place the cupping glass on the abdomen and navel; it loosens the organ, warms it, and removes pain by resolving that wind.
It may also be placed on the kidneys if there is an obstruction or stone there; by the strength of its drawing, it may perhaps open the obstruction or remove the stone from its place.  It acts similarly when placed on the liver and spleen in cases of wind causing disorder there. These cuppings may be used empty, only by suction.
It may be used with fire, or it may be used filled with lukewarm water in cases of inflammation; that is to say, fill the cupping glass, and let it be large, with hot water alone or with water in which some herbs suitable for this have been boiled.
Then, filled, it is placed on the place, held, removed, and repeated several times as needed.  This is the image of the cupping glass which is used with fire:
Its mouth should be the width of two open fingers, as we have depicted, and its depth half a span.  There should be a small hole in its side, about halfway up, large enough for a needle to enter; it is made of Chinese copper or yellow copper, with a thick rim.
Smooth, even, and polished, lest it injure the member when placed upon it.  In its center there is a transverse groove of copper or iron where the lighted candle is placed. This cupping glass may be made larger than we have described, or smaller, according to the illness.
And the instrument's use: for the cupping glasses of boys and thin people are not the same as those of men and corpulent bodies. As for the method of applying this cupping glass with fire to the member, it is to place a lighted wick of tightly-spun linen or a small candle of pitch on the middle of the solidified rod which is in the middle of the cupping glass.
So that the fire will ascend upwards towards the bottom of the cupping glass, lest it burn the patient's body. Then it is placed on the member, and the finger on the hole we mentioned, until, when we have held the cupping glass as long as needed, the finger is removed.
And the vapor will exit through that hole, and the cupping glass will adhere in place. Then you place the wick in the manner described, and repeat if needed. As for the cupping glass used in the treatment of the shosha with water, it has neither a solidified rod nor a hole.
It is used only by being filled with water and placed on the member. And this is its image:
And this cupping glass, the larger it is to hold more water, the better it is.
Chapter ninety-seven.
On the suspension of the leech.
Leeches are used mostly in cases where cupping glasses cannot be applied, either because of the small size of the member, such as the lip and gum and the like, or because the member is devoid of flesh, such as the finger and nose and the like.
And the method of using them is that you should choose leeches that are in fresh, pure water, free from impurities, then leave them for a day and a night in fresh water until they become hungry and nothing remains in their bellies. Then the body is first purged by bloodletting or cupping, then the affected member is wiped.
until it reddens, then it is placed upon it; and when it is full, it falls off. And if it is possible to suck the place with a cupping glass, it is more effective; otherwise, wash the place with vinegar, then with plenty of water, and rub and squeeze it.  If the bleeding continues after the leech falls off and it is a trickle, then wet a linen cloth in cold water.
And place it on top until the trickle stops. If the bleeding is profuse, sprinkle upon it powdered alum or gallnut or similar astringents until the bleeding stops, or apply halves of peeled lupins to the place.
And leave it until the lupin adheres to the place, for then the blood will stop.  And it is necessary that if it is necessary to reapply leeches, then do not apply those same leeches if others are available. And if the leeches refuse to adhere, then let the place be wiped with fresh blood.
Or insert a needle into the place until some blood comes out, then apply them; for when they sense some blood, they will adhere to the place. And if you want to make them fall off, sprinkle upon them some aloes or salt or ash, for then they will fall off immediately.
Chapter Three.
On setting (bones).
This chapter also contains what is needed in the craft of medicine, which is the setting of fractures and dislocations occurring in bones.
Know, O my sons, that this chapter is claimed by the ignorant among physicians and the common people, and by those who have never studied the books of the ancients or read a single word from them.
For this reason, this art of knowledge has become nonexistent in our country, and I have never encountered anyone skilled in it at all. And I have only gained what I have gained from my long reading of the books of the ancients and my eagerness to understand them, until I extracted knowledge of that from them, then I devoted myself to experience and practice for a long time.
And I have depicted for you in this chapter everything that my knowledge encompasses. And my experience has followed it, after I have presented it to you, and freed it from the complexities of prolixity, and shortened it to the utmost, and clarified it to the utmost, and depicted for you in it many images of the instruments which are used in it.
For it is from an increase in explanation, as I did in the preceding chapters, and there is no strength except in God, the Most High, the Most Great.
Chapter One.
In it are summaries and compendia concerning the matter of fractured bones, and it is necessary to present them. And before we begin to mention the fractured and dislocated members one by one, it is necessary that we mention at the beginning of this chapter a summary of the discourse and sections. It compels you first to understand them and to stand upon their truth, you and whoever else is eager to learn this noble craft.
So I say that when a fracture or dislocation or sprain or fall occurs to someone, it is necessary to hasten first to bloodletting or purging, or both. Unless something prevents it, such as weakness of strength, or the one to whom this has occurred is a child or a very old man, or the time is extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then restrict his diet to cold vegetables and poultry and game, and forbid him drink and thick meats and overeating and every food that fills the veins with blood until the swelling is safe and the flow of material to the place is not expected.
Then let the patient return to his first regimen to which he is accustomed.  When the broken bone begins to knit, the patient should be nourished with foods that nourish strongly, thickly, and firmly, containing viscosity such as porridges, rice, heads, and necks, and cow tripe. And eggs and soft fish and thick drinks and the like, for by this regimen the setting of the fracture will be quicker and better. And know that broken bones, if they are in strong men and old men, cannot ever unite and join in their first nature.
Because of the dryness of their bones and their hardness. And what was of the bones in the extreme of softness, like the bones of small children, may unite and join. But nature grows on the broken bone from all its sides something resembling glue, thick in it, that adheres to it and strengthens it until one part joins another.
And it binds one part to another until it comes to the utmost strength and firmness as it was at first, so that nothing hinders it in its actions.
For this reason it is necessary to give the patient foods which contain firmness, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said. And know that fractures differ in their types according to the difference of the members, for a fracture of the bone of the leg differs from a fracture of the bone of the head, and a fracture of the bone of the chest differs from a fracture of the bone of the back.
And so all the other members, each differs from another. And we shall come to the mention of each type of fracture explained in its chapter, detailed from the others.  And the type of fracture of the bone may also differ in itself.
For its fracture may be a shattering without splinters occurring in it, and its fracture may be along the length of the bone and its fracture may have splinters and protruding parts, detached or not detached, and the fracture may be with a wound and a perforation in the skin, and the fracture may be a slight crack.
And for each type there is a special method in its setting, as will be mentioned in detail in its place. And among the things by which a fracture of the bone is recognized are its crookedness, its swelling, its appearance to the touch, and its roughness when you probe it with your hand.
Then when there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor roughness, nor do you feel a disturbance in the bone when you touch it, nor does the patient feel much pain, then there is no fracture, but it may be a sprain, or a slight fracture, or a slight crack, then it is not necessary to move it by pulling and probing at all.
But apply to it from the medicines, the mention of which will come after a while, what suits the place, then bind it gently. And know that if the bone is shattered and broken into two without splinters occurring in it, then each part has only separated from its fellow.
Then it is necessary for you to hasten at once to straighten and align it before a hot swelling occurs to it.  If a hot swelling occurs to it, then leave it for days until the hot swelling subsides, then align it in any way you can with gentleness and skill.
And know that its setting and alignment is easier than a bone in which splinters have occurred. Then it is bound as will be mentioned. If there are splinters in the bone, then it is necessary to pull the broken limb from both sides, whether hand or foot.
Either with your hands if the limb is small, or with two ropes, or with a rope and hand. And let the placing of the limb be on a level surface in its natural shape, until when the broken part of the bone is extended, then return those protrusions to their places in any way you can with skill and gentleness.
And strive with all your might not to cause the patient pain or suffering by your actions, and strive with all your might to unite one bone with its fellow in the best manner. At that time, it is necessary to touch and feel them with your hand. If you see something out of place, correct and align it to the best of your ability.
And beware of strong pulling and forceful probing, as many ignorant people do, and they often cause by their actions a hot swelling or inflammation in the limb, as I have witnessed many times from their actions.
Then, after the alignment, perfection, and binding, keep that limb still and calm, and warn the patient not to move it while awake or asleep, and when turning over and restless, and when defecating, and in all his movements to the best of his ability, and let him strive to keep the limb in a position that ensures against pain.
Because if he feels pain or discomfort in the position of the limb, he should move it to a different position where he does not feel pain, and he should strive to keep that position level and straight.
Lest a deformity occur in the limb if it heals, and as for the method of binding the broken limb, it is as I describe to you; know that broken limbs differ in their size, shape, and form.  Those that are small, such as the arm, finger, forearm, and so on...
then the bandages should be soft and gentle; and those that are large, like the thigh, back, and chest, then the bandages should be wide and firm, for a wide bandage is necessary for a large limb, and it binds it from every side with equal tightness, without any defect.
Then, after you have finished the alignment, you begin to apply the appropriate plaster. on a soft splint at the site of the fracture; then begin to wrap the bandage around the fracture itself three or four times, according to what the limb requires, and pull the bandage slightly with your hand, then take it to the upper part of the fracture.
with less tightness than you applied to the fractured area; then gradually spread the bandage away from the fracture site, loosening the tension little by little until you have obtained a suitable amount of the correct position, then take another bandage and wrap it also around the fractured area.
bandages; then take the bandage to the lower part of the fracture, and let your action in tightening and loosening the bandage be as we mentioned in the first upper bandage; then place between the bandages some of the soft splint or cloths to even out the crookedness of the fracture.
If there is crookedness, otherwise do not put anything in it; then wrap another bandage around it, then apply the firm splints to these bandages immediately, if there is no swelling or hot inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or hot inflammation, then apply something that will calm that inflammation and reduce the swelling, and leave it for a few days, then apply the splints at that time; and let the splints be of broad, carved, skillfully prepared halves of reeds, or let the splints be of sieve wood.
which are made of pine or palm leaflets or reeds or boxwood and the like of what is available, and let the width of each splint be in this manner and in this exact shape.
Except that the splint which is placed on the fracture itself should be slightly thicker and wider than the other splints, and as for the length of the splint, it is made according to what befits the broken limb, in its size and smallness,  Image of the splint:
Then tighten the splints with another bandage, in the same way as your first tightening, then tie from above with firm threads, according to what we mentioned of the tightening, which is that your tightening should be greater at the place of the fracture. And the farther it is from the fracture, the less the tightening.
And the threads should be medium in thickness and fineness, and let them be of wet linen especially, because if the threads are thick, as I have seen done by the ignorant, who make their threads from twisted linen strips, this is a great mistake.
Because the tightening with them becomes excessive, and thin threads are also unsuitable because you will not achieve with them the tightening you want, and there should not be less than a finger's breadth between splint and splint.
If the patient is harmed by the ends of the splints after tightening in the healthy areas, place under them soft tow or fluffy wool so that nothing harms him from that. As for if the fracture is with a wound and a rupture occurs in the skin, we will mention that separately.
And know that not every broken limb should be tightened with splints from the first day, and that is that if the limb is large, splints should not be placed on it except after five or seven days or more, according to your assurance that hot swelling will not occur.
And this is a description of the bandages with which the ancients used to bind fractures, dislocations, and sprains; a description of a general, brief bandage that binds fractures and is suitable for most temperaments, especially children and women, because it is not dominated by heat or cold.
And it is that you take from the dust of the mill, which is the best part of the flour that adheres to the walls of the mill during the movement of the mill, and knead it as it is without sifting it with egg white, and make its kneading neither thick nor thin, then apply it.
The description of another bandage that sets fractures, dislocations, and sprains:  Take of mastic, leadwort, acacia,  resin, gum tragacanth, and sugar, ten drachms of each; and of myrrh and aloes, five drachms of each; and of  athi, twenty drachms; and of Armenian or Roman clay, twenty drachms. Pound everything and mix it with the water of athl or with egg white if the patient's temperament is hot, then use this bandage, for it is well-composed, quickly mends broken bones, and is suitable for most people because of its moderation.
The description of another bandage which is also useful for fractures and sprains: Take gum tragacanth, mastic, and white lead, ten drachms of each; myrrh and aloes, five drachms of each; acacia, six drachms; Armenian clay, twenty drachms.  Pound all of these very finely, sift it, and knead it with water or egg white, and apply it.
The description of a bandage for joints and bones that have deviated from their places, and it alleviates the pain that affects them, and for bone cracks and fractures: Take bleached wool and dip it in vinegar and cooked oil and place it on the affected area. This bandage does not have bone-setting power.
But it is excellent in soothing hot swelling and relieving pain in particular. The description of another bandage which sets broken bones: take the leaves of the deaf fig and the leaves of wild poppy, pound them together, and apply them moist. The description of another brief bandage used when a bone fracture is set.
And you want to resolve the remaining swelling, take of the root of white lead, chamomile, violet flowers, and wheat flour, one part of each. Pound everything together and knead it with white of egg if the member is not inflamed; if it is inflamed, knead it with coriander water or with water, and apply it.
The description of another bandage stronger in resolution than the first, used when a hard swelling occurs at the setting of a bone: Take of the root of white lead, flaxseed, fenugreek, rosemary, marjoram, violet flowers, and chamomile, one part of each.
Pound everything together and knead it with vinegar water, or with fresh water, or with egg white, all according to the heat of the member and the stillness of its fever.  As for Hippocrates, he did not mention in his book that it should be placed on the broken member when it is set.
Except for the cerate made from wax and oil only, and he described it as being moderate between thickness and thinness. As for Galen, he saw that things which contain dryness with some heat, such as myrrh, aloes, frankincense, and the like which we mentioned, should be placed on the broken member when it is set.
The description of a bandage which benefits weakness and pain: Take equal parts of alum, chickpea flour, human hair that is clipped or bird feathers, white lead and salt. Pound, sift, and knead it, and bandage with it. As for the amount that the bandage should remain...
Then it is loosened; it is that you look; if there is no pain, itching, or movement of the broken bone from its place in the affected area, do not loosen it for many days.  If there is severe itching or worrying pain, or swelling in the area.
Then hasten to loosen it at once, and do not delay that at all, and remove the bandage from it. Then take a soft cloth or a wet sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area with it until the itching and pain subside, then let the member rest for an hour.
Then apply moistened wool soaked in vinegar and oil or rose oil, and bind it on for a night, until you are safe from hot swelling, and the swelling of the limb subsides and its pain goes away. Then return it to gentle tightening and a light bandage, and do not tighten it as you did the first time.
And treat it gently until it heals. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and inflammation, and all the symptoms have completely gone, and you need a bandage and tightening, then restore it as you did at first, equally. If nothing of what we have mentioned occurs in the limb.
Then do not loosen it except after three, four, five, or seven days, and it may be left for twenty days; all this depends on what appears to you of the state of the limb, as we said, until the fracture is set and the flesh is about to knit over it.
Then also increase the tightening more than your first tightening, and also increase the nourishing food of the patient beyond what was previously mentioned. If you see that the place of the fracture has dried and withered more than it should, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Then bathe it with lukewarm water each time you loosen it, and let that be every three days, and loosen the tightening a little. For by this action, nourishment flows to the limb and it heals quickly. As for what ignorant bone-setters do, of breaking the limb again.
If it is not set properly at first, and is set crookedly, then that is a mistake in their action and a great deception. If it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and acted upon it, and I have not seen any trace of it from any of them at all. And the correct thing is not to do it.
Chapter Two.
On accidental fractures in the head.
The types of accidental fractures in the head are numerous, their forms varied, and their causes diverse.  Some fractures are caused by a sword blow, and it may either sever the bone completely until it reaches the membrane beneath the bone. Just as an axe does to wood.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called "axe-like".  Alternatively, the sword may cut some of the bone and sever only its surface, without the cut penetrating completely. This type of fracture is called a simple fracture. The wound in these two types of fracture may be either large or small.
And there are fractures which are comminuted or contused; their cause being a blow with a stone, or a fall onto a stone or something similar. This fracture may be penetrating, nearly reaching the membrane beneath the bone, or it may be on the surface of the bone.
The wound in these two types of fracture may also be either large or small. And there are fractures which are hidden in the bone, fine as a hair, being a slight fissure.
Therefore this type of fracture is called hairline. And there is a fracture caused by a fall or a blow with a stone or the like, which drives a part of the bone inwards, causing a depression at the site, just as happens to a copper pot when struck, a portion of it being driven inwards.
This occurs most often in the soft bones of the head, such as the heads of children. All these types of fracture may have loose and non-loose fragments. We shall describe the treatment of all of them in their proper place. We recognize all these types of fracture by examining them.
And examining them with probes and removing the corrupted flesh from them. As for the hairline type, it is recognized by examining the bone, rubbing it and smearing it with ink; the fracture then appears black. As for the treatment of fracture, first look to the symptoms of the patient.
If you see among his symptoms those which clearly indicate danger, such as vomiting bile, prostration, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, protrusion of the eyes and redness, and similar symptoms, do not approach the patient or treat him, for death is inevitable in most cases with these symptoms.
But if you see symptoms that do not alarm you and you hope for his recovery, then begin his treatment. And if the wounded man comes to you immediately after his injury and it is in the winter.
Then you should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day in any case.  And if it is in the summer, then you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane under the bone spoils and those symptoms which we described appear.
If the fracture of the bone has reached the membrane covering the brain and there is shattering and bruising, then you should cut away the shattered and bruised part as I describe to you.  This is to shave the head of the wounded patient.
And uncover the bone in whatever way is possible for you and according to the shape of the wound and what is easiest for the patient. If, when you uncover the bone, you see bleeding or a hot swelling, then treat it as necessary.
This is to pack the area with cloths soaked in a syrup and rose oil, and to dress the wound until the swelling subsides and the bleeding stops. Then begin to scrape and remove the bone; this can be done in one of two ways.
As for the first method, it is to cut the bone with a fine saw with a narrow blade.  And this is its image:
Then use another saw, slightly wider than the first. And this is its image:
Then also use another saw, wider still than the second.  It is necessary that you have several saws of different widths, some wider and some shorter than others, and that they be extremely sharp at their edges, and let them be of Indian iron or good steel.
And use gentleness in working the saw, lest you shake the head and injure it. If the bone is strong and solid, it is necessary that you perforate around it before using the saws, with the drills which are called non-immersive drills; and they are called non-immersive drills.
Because they do not go beyond the limit of the cranial bone to what is beyond it, because the drill has a round edge below its sharp head, similar to a ring or small circle, preventing it from penetrating and exceeding the thickness of the bone.
And it is necessary for you to have many of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of that bone, so that you have for each cranium a drill whose sharp point is in length and shortness according to the thickness of that cranium. And this is an image of three types. Of the drills: large, medium, and small.
And as for the method of perforation around the fractured bone, it is that you place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated, then you move the drill to another place, and you make the distance between each hole the size of the thickness of the awl or similar.
Then cut with the saw between each two holes, and do this with the utmost gentleness as we said, until you remove the bone, either with your hand or with something else of the instruments which you prepared for that.
Such as forceps and fine hooks. And it is necessary that you be very careful that the drill or saw does not touch anything of the peritoneum.  Then if you have removed the bone and it is free from the peritoneum, if it was attached to it, and you have taken it out, then it is necessary to cleanse.
And smooth the roughness of what remains of the bone with another instrument similar to the saw, except that it should be thinner and finer than the other saws.  If anything remains of the small bones and splinters, then take them gently with what you have of the instruments.
Then you treat the wound afterwards with cauterization and ointments which will be mentioned. And as for the other method of this operation, it is a very easy method, far from danger, which Galen mentioned and greatly praised. And this is his statement: First you should begin by uncovering the part of the bone where the fracture is most severe and obvious, until, when you have uncovered that part, you place under it the end of this lenticular saw, and this is its picture:
Its lenticular part should be smooth so that it does not cut anything, and its sharp part should be on its sides extending lengthwise as you see, so that the lenticular part rests against the peritoneum and the face of the sharp cutting edge is against the bone, then you strike the saw from one side.
with a small hammer until you cut through all the bone gently as it turns, and you are safe from the membrane, so that nothing frightening happens to it at all, even if the surgeon were the most ignorant and cowardly of people, yes, even if he were sleepy.
If anything of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some parts of the bone, scrape it off with the tip of the lenticular saw itself and carefully free it from it, for it will be freed from it without injury or fear.
But if the bone fracture did not penetrate to the membrane, and what was broken of the bone was its surface and roughness and small fragments remained in it, then it is necessary to remove that roughness and extract those fragments with fine forceps, of which various sizes have been made so that you can use in each place that which is most suitable and best according to what the work requires.
And the same broken bone and its shape, and it is necessary that you use first in scraping the bone the widest of those forceps, then use after it a finer one, and continue to do that successively until you come to use the finest and thinnest of them all.
As for the other small, hair-like cracks and slight fractures, it is necessary to use for each one a treatment according to what leads to its healing, and this is something that is not hidden from anyone who has the slightest experience in this craft and has studied what we have written and explained in large fractures.
If the membrane remains exposed when you extract the bone, then it is necessary that you take a linen cloth the size of the wound and dip it in rose oil and place it on the mouth of the wound, then take another folded or triangular cloth. And dip it in syrup and rose oil and place it on the first cloth, and do this as gently as you can so that you do not burden the peritoneum, then use a wide bandage on top and do not tighten it except to the extent that it only holds the wound.
And leave it with this treatment for a day or two until you are safe from the hot swelling, then untie it and use afterwards medicines with a drying quality, such as iris roots, crushed costus, crushed myrrh, zedoary, and the like; and that is to make powders from these medicines.
And sprinkle it on the wound as it is dry; and in general, use in that a medicine that cleanses and does not sting, and strive in your treatment of the wound that it be clean, that there be no rancid fat or dirt in it, and do not leave the pus to gather in it at all.
Because if pus gathers on the membrane of the brain, it spoils and rots it, and from that happens to the patient a great calamity; and it may occur in the peritoneum of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if one neglects its treatment.
Blackness on its surface is observed; if the patient exhibits the symptoms that we have mentioned, then know that he is inevitably doomed; and if the blackness occurred only from a medicine that was placed on it, and it was in the power of that medicine to cause that blackness.
It is necessary that you take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil and beat them well and smear them on a cloth, then place it on the peritoneum, then treat it with the various treatments that are necessary until it heals.
Chapter Three.
On the setting of a broken nose.
Know that only the upper two parts of the nose break, or one of them, because they are bone, for the lower part of it is cartilage and does not break; rather, contusion, crookedness, and flattening occur to it.
If one of its parts is broken, then it is necessary that you insert your little finger into the hole of the nose and straighten that fracture from the inside with your index finger and thumb from the outside, until you return the nose to its natural shape. Let this be done by you gently and carefully, so that your action does not cause the patient pain.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and the finger does not reach it, then it should be straightened with the end of a probe of slight thickness. If the fracture is on both sides, then do likewise, and let him hasten to set it on the first day of the fracture.
If possible; otherwise, after the seventh or tenth day, when the hot swelling subsides, then insert into the nostril a tent of linen rags if the fracture is on one side, or insert two tents if the fracture is on both sides.
Let the tents be of a thickness such that they fill the nostril.  Some of the early bone-setters mentioned that the tents should be moistened with fat and changed every day, but I do not see that this is so; rather, the tents should be moistened in egg white mixed with mill dust.
Then leave the tents until the bone sets and the cartilage hardens.  Goose quills, after having been wrapped with soft rags, may be inserted into the nose in place of the tents; this will make the retention of the fractured nose firmer and prevent the patient from being unable to breathe.
This is not necessary; if you wish, you may do it, and if you wish, you may make tents. If a hot swelling occurs in the nose during your work, apply a compress to the nose with kypros or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil, or something of diachylon ointment.
If a hot swelling does not occur, you should dress it externally with fine semolina and fine frankincense mixed with egg white, then place a soft bandage over it, and do not tie the nose at all, if the nasal bones are fractured slightly.
Or if they are shattered, you should incise them and remove them with a suitable instrument, then suture the incision and treat it with ointments suitable for healing and closing wounds.  If a wound occurs inside the nose, you should treat it with tents and use lead tubes. Until it heals.
Chapter Four.
On setting the lower jaw if it is fractured.
If the lower jaw is fractured and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, then if the fracture is only external and has not broken into two and is not concave inwards, then its identification is easy.
Then, if the fracture is in the right side, you should insert the index finger of the left hand into the patient's mouth; and similarly, if the fracture is in the left side, insert the index finger of the right hand, and gently raise the prominence of the fracture from the inside to the outside.
And with your other hand from outside the bone, you should control it to straighten it. If the fracture of the jaw has broken into two, then it is necessary to use traction from both sides in a straight line until you are able to straighten it. If it has happened to the teeth, it will loosen.
Or if they are separated, then tie what you hope will remain with a gold, silver, or silk thread. Then place a small splint on the fractured jaw, then place a folded cloth on it, and place on the cloth a tight large splint or a piece of leather the length of the jaw. Then tie it from above according to what seems suitable to you to tie it and agrees with its placement so that it does not come undone, and instruct the patient to be patient and still, and make his food soft liquids. If you think that something has changed in the shape in any way, then hasten to untie it on the third day.
Then tie it from above according to what seems suitable to you to tie it and agrees with its placement so that it does not come undone, and instruct the patient to be patient and still, and make his food soft liquids. If you think that something has changed in the shape in any way, then hasten to untie it on the third day. Then repair what you bandaged with mill dust mixed with egg white or semolina flour after removing the splint from it, and place a soft poultice on the bandage. As long as that bandage adheres to it and the condition of the bone does not change, leave it.
Do not untie it until it heals and the fracture is solidified. Often this fracture solidifies in three weeks. If a hot swelling occurs during that time, use what we have repeatedly mentioned to calm it until that swelling goes away.
But if the fracture is with a wound, look; if a splinter or splinters have become separated from the bone, be gentle in removing those splinters with whatever instrument suits you for removing them. If the mouth of the wound is narrow, widen it with a scalpel to the extent of your need.
Then, when you have removed those splinters and nothing remains of them, stitch the wound if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the ointments suitable for that. And stitch the wound until it heals.
Chapter Five.
On the setting of the clavicle if it is fractured.
The clavicle is most often fractured in front, at the end of the shoulder, and its fracture is of one of three types: either it is fractured and broken into two without splinters, which is easiest to set;
or splinters occur in the fracture, which is more difficult to set; or the fracture is accompanied by a wound.  If the fracture is without a wound, the procedure is to have two assistants, one to hold the arm next to the fractured clavicle, and the other to extend the neck toward the other side.
Then you should set the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be, and there is neither protrusion nor deformity. If you need more extension, you should place a ball of rags or wool under the patient's armpit.
The size of the ball should be according to your need.  Extend and raise the clavicle and press the ball with your hand until the fracture is set as it should be. If you cannot pull the end of the clavicle outwards because it has gone inwards, then the patient should lie on his back.
A moderately sized pillow should be placed under his shoulder, and the assistant should press his shoulder downwards so that the clavicle, which is deep, rises upwards. Then set the fracture and smooth it with your fingers.
If you feel that a splinter of the clavicle has broken off and is moving, you should incise over it and remove that splinter gently. If the splinter is embedded in the bone, try to cut it with one of the cutting instruments prepared for this purpose. After placing under the clavicle the instrument that protects the peritoneum, which is an instrument of wood or iron, and this is its image:
It resembles a spoon without a bend. Its width should be according to the size of the bone, whether large or small, and its length also according to what is possible for the work. Let it have two ends, as you see, one end wider and the other narrower.
If the wound opening that you incised when removing the bone splinter is wide and you are safe from hot inflammation, join the edges of the wound by suturing. If the opening is small or you fear hot inflammation, dress the wound with lint and pledgets according to the size of the incision.
If hot inflammation occurs, moisten the lint in rose oil and vinegar or wine and apply it. As for setting a bone if it is without a wound or incision, it is to apply to the bone a plaster made from mill dust with egg white. And you place the soft splint on it, then place the ball under his armpit if he needs it. Then take a bandage that is very long and its width is a cubit or thereabouts. Then apply a folded pledget over the splint and plaster, then take a splint of thin wood. Let its width be three fingers and its length likewise. Then wrap it in a cloth, then wrap that cloth with the splint in the part of the bandage which falls on the place of the fracture, then tighten the bandage on the fracture as you wind it. And pass it over his neck and under his sound armpit and under his injured armpit, and pass it repeatedly on each side, and as you see that the tightening fixes the fracture firmly, which is not hidden from you.
And the goal of all this is that the splint does not move from the broken bone. Therefore, you should check on the patient every day; whenever the bandage loosens and you see that the splint has moved, correct it and tighten the bandage. Then have the patient sleep on his back, and place a small pillow under his armpit when he sleeps at night.
So that his arm will be raised from his side, and the clavicle fracture will be elevated with the elevation of the shoulder, or tie his arm to his neck, and do not untie the bandage unless an incident occurs in the area, such as itching or swelling, until twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see a reason for it. Reduce [the fracture] and leave it until the clavicle fracture heals and consolidates, and it becomes stronger and firmer; this happens mostly within twenty-eight days. And it may be in some people in less than that.
Chapter Six.
On the reduction of a fracture of the shoulder.  The shoulder rarely fractures in its wide part; rather, its margins fracture.  Whenever a part of it fractures, or it fractures in its middle, this is known only by touch.  Therefore, depending on what the shape of the fracture is, treat it accordingly.
Straighten it and reduce it to its natural shape by every means you can. Then apply to the area mill dust with egg white and soft tow. Place on top a pad of folded cloth, then place a wide splint of wood over it.
Thin enough to fit the whole shoulder or slightly wider. If, under the splint, there is a lump in any part of the shoulder, smooth that lump with soft tow until the splint lies evenly, then bind it from above with a long bandage.
Bind it tightly and make sure the splint does not move from its place. Check the bandage every day; whenever the bandage loosens, tighten it and straighten the splint if it moves from its place. Let the patient lie on his sound side. The shoulder heals in twenty [days].
days or twenty-five days. When this time is complete, unbind it, and you are safe, for it is among the bones that are not feared for their shattering or displacement. If a splinter of bone protrudes and is irritating under the skin, incise over it and extract it. And do what was mentioned in the fracture of the clavicle to alleviate the hot swelling if anything of that occurs.
Chapter Seven.
On the reduction of a fracture of the chest.
The chest may be fractured in its middle, and this rarely occurs; but its extremities are more frequently fractured and shattered. Among its symptoms, if its middle is fractured, is that it inclines downwards, and severe pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing occur.
And sometimes blood is expelled, and the depression in the fractured bone is evident and not hidden from the touch. Its reduction is that the patient lies on his back, and a pillow is placed between his shoulders, then his shoulders are compressed, and the ribs are brought together by the hands from both sides, and gentleness is employed in straightening it in every way that is possible.
And continue until the shape of the bone is restored as it should be, then apply a bandage and a splint, and place over it a splint of thin wood from willow or elm or something similar which is light, after wrapping it in a cloth. Then gently bind it to the fractured bone lest it move, and pass the bandage around to the back several times, and tighten it firmly, then examine the bandage at all times, and whenever it loosens, tighten it.
And if necessity dictates its removal due to suppuration occurring in the location, or pain or swelling, then proceed with its removal, and remove the bandage, and treat what has occurred in that location; then reapply the bandage if you see fit to do so. and face, and bind it firmly until it heals.
Chapter Eight.
Concerning the setting of ribs if they are fractured: Know that fractures of the ribs occur in the thick portions adjacent to the back, and their ends in front are subject to contusion because they are cartilaginous, and the knowledge of this is not hidden from the sense upon examination with the fingers.
And set it by straightening the fracture with the fingers in the accessible way until the shape is properly aligned, then bandage and bind the fractured bone with a splint if it needs that.  If the fracture of the ribs is inclined inwards, then severe pain occurs to the patient.
And it sinks like the sinking that occurs to one with a chest wound, because the bone sinks into the diaphragm, and also dyspnea, cough, and expectoration of much blood occur to him, and this is difficult to treat, and the ancients devised many stratagems in this.
And some of them said that it is necessary to make the patient's food that which produces flatulence and wind so that the abdomen swells and expands and the fracture is driven outwards, and we dislike this lest it confirms the occurrence of hot inflammation if it has not occurred, and if it has occurred, then it increases it and confirms it.
And some of them said a cupping glass should be placed on the area, then sucked strongly, and this is more similar to the reasoning, except that it is feared that the cupping glass will draw impurities to the area due to its weakness, and some of them said that the area should be covered with wool dipped in hot oil.
And it becomes a pad between the ribs until it is full, so that the bandage is even when you wrap it around, then treat the patient with the treatment of the chest wound in terms of food and medicine, if the patient is exhausted by a severe matter that he cannot bear. And the bone was sinking into the diaphragm, a harmful sinking, and we feared for the patient, so it is necessary that we incise the area and uncover the broken rib, then we place under it the instrument which preserves the peritoneum, which was previously described, and we break the bone gently and remove it.
Then we bring together the edges of the wound if it is large by stitching and we treat it with ointments until it heals; if a hot inflammation occurs during this, then act quickly, wetting pads in rose oil and placing them on the area, and treat the patient internally with what alleviates the inflammation.
And he lies on the side on which sleep is easier for him until he recovers.
Chapter Nine.
On setting the vertebrae of the back and neck.
As for the bones of the neck, if a fracture affects them—and this rarely happens to them, and what mostly happens to them is bruising—and similarly the vertebrae of the back also, if this happens to someone and you want to know whether he will recover or not. Then look; and if you see that his hands have become relaxed, numb, and dead, and he is not able to move them, nor extend them, nor flex them, and if you pinch them or prick them with a needle he does not feel it and does not find pain in them, then know that in most cases he will not recover, and he is dying.
And if he moves them and feels the pinch and prick in them, then know that the marrow of the bone has been saved and that the patient will recover with treatment.  If the vertebrae of the back are similarly affected and you want to know whether he will recover or not.
Then look at his legs; and if you see that they have become relaxed and what happened in the hands has happened in them, then if he lies on his back, wind and feces are expelled involuntarily, and if he lies on his stomach, urine is expelled involuntarily. And if he lies on his back and wants to urinate, he is unable to do so, then know that he is dying, so do not bother with his treatment. If nothing of this happens to him, the matter is less serious.  The treatment for what has happened is that you aim to reduce the hot swelling.
By placing on the injured vertebra rose oil alone, or with roasted egg yolks, applying it three times a day, until the hot swelling subsides. Then apply to the place one of the strengthening, drying compresses, and bind it tightly with a bandage and instruct him to remain still and quiet.
And he should not sleep except on the side where he feels no pain, until he recovers. If a splinter or something that has broken off from the bone has occurred at the time of the injury, then it is necessary to incise the skin and remove that bone. Then bring together the edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures, then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If the last bone of the coccyx, which is the tailbone, is broken, then it is necessary to insert the thumb of the left hand into the anus.
And set the broken bone with the other hand, as much as you are able to achieve the setting, then apply the compress and splint if needed, then bind it.
If you feel a broken splinter in it, then incise it and remove it, and treat the wound with the previously mentioned treatment until it heals.
Chapter Ten.
On the setting of a fractured hip.
Hip bones rarely fracture; but if they do fracture, it is in such a way that they are shattered at their ends and split lengthwise, and incline inwards.  The patient experiences pain in the affected area, and numbness and tingling in the leg on the side of the fracture.
Its treatment is that you pass your hand over it until you ascertain the nature of the fracture. If the fracture is only at the ends, then set that fracture as best you can, until its shape resembles its natural form.
If the fracture is lengthwise, or if it has inclined inwards, lay the patient on his stomach so that you can set the fracture.  Once you have set it, apply a bandage, and then apply a splint of wood or leather, and bind it tightly.
Do not fear that the fracture will shift or the splint will come loose. Fill the hollows of the hips with padding so that the binding is even. Instruct the patient to lie on his back or on his sound side. If a hot inflammation should arise, …
desist from setting and binding it until the hot inflammation subsides. Apply what will alleviate it, as previously described. Then return to setting and binding it as it should be. If there are splinters in the bone, or some shattering at its ends, they should not be removed.
They should not be touched, but rather smoothed from the outside, as we have said, and the binding should be left until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the setting of a fracture of the humerus.
The humerus is that which is between the elbow and the head of the shoulder. If it is fractured, then it is set in one of two ways. One is that you take a smooth, curved piece of wood, of moderate thickness, in this manner:
And you tie two bandages to its ends, then it is suspended from a high place, and the patient sits on a chair, then his broken arm is placed on the wood until his armpit is attached to the middle of the curve of the wood, then something heavy is hung from above it.
Or a servant stretches it downwards, then the physician sets the fracture with his two hands until he returns the fracture to what is proper.  The other method is that the patient lies on his back and his hand is suspended from his neck with a bandage.
Then you order two servants, one to hold above the fracture with his hands and the other to hold below it, and each stretches to his side. And if you wish the stretching to be stronger, then tie below the fracture with a bandage and above it with a bandage, and each of the servants stretches to his side.
If the fracture is near the head of the humerus, then it is necessary that the middle of the bandage be under the armpit and the other under the fracture towards the elbow.  Likewise, if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that the bandage be in that place and on the elbow itself.
Then you set the fracture gently without force, until when the fracture is set as it should be and unites well, then you bandage it if no hot swelling appears. If hot swelling appears, then leave bandaging it until the seventh day and place on it moistened wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil.
Until the swelling subsides, then bandage it.  The method of bandaging is that you apply the compress to the fracture, then apply a bandage of new cloth over the compress, then you bind the forearm to the humerus itself and place his hand open on his shoulder.
And you apply the cloth and bandage to the humerus and forearm so that the forearm acts as splints if nothing prevents you from doing so and nothing changes in the broken bone. If you fear that something might change, then use splints.
And that is to place on the fracture itself a splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints, and let there be the width of a finger between each splint, and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with an addition of three fingers on each side.
Then you bandage the splints with the bandage that I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And that your binding on the site of the fracture should be tighter.
And the further from the fracture, the less tight the binding. If you see that the placing of the splints and the binding as we said is appropriate at the time of your setting of the limb, then do so.
And if you fear a hot inflammation, leave off the binding and the splints until the seventh day, as we said. Then examine the bandage every three days, lest there occur at the site an irritation or swelling, or the nourishment be prevented from reaching the limb by reason of excessive tightness.  Then correct all this as we mentioned.
But if you are confident that none of that will occur, then do not loosen the bandage except after many days. And let the patient lie on his back with his hand on his stomach, and let a cushion filled with wool be placed under the arm, moderately.
And examine at every time of night or day, lest the shape of the broken limb be disordered or the bandage become loose. Then correct all this with your effort, and let the patient's food be of the kind we have presented, that is, let the food be light at first, until the bone begins to knit.
Then it is necessary to increase his food. For it is the custom of the arm and leg to knit in forty days. Then it is necessary to loosen [the bandage], and he should use the bath and be treated with ointments which are suitable for that. If the fracture is severe and comminuted,
then do not loosen the bandage from him until fifty days or two months.
Chapter Twelve.
On the setting of a fracture of the arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, and they are called the ulna; one of them is small, and it is that which is next to the thumb, and the other is large, and it is situated under the small one from below.  So perhaps the greater ulna is broken alone, or the smaller one alone, and perhaps they are broken together.
And when the smaller upper ulna is broken, then its setting is easy and its healing is quicker. And when the lower ulna is broken, its fracture is bad and its healing is difficult. And the worst is if the two bones are broken together. If the bone which is broken is the smaller upper ulna,
the physician, when setting it, should make its extension easy and gentle until he straightens it. And if the large ulna is broken, then he should make its extension stronger. And if both ulnas are broken, then he should make the extension much stronger.
And it is necessary that the shape of the hand, when it is set and extended, be placed extended on a cushion, and the thumb of the hand should be higher than all the fingers, and the little finger should be lower than the other fingers, and the patient should sit squarely on his own.
And let the cushion be opposite him in height, lest the patient suffer difficulty.
Then a servant extends the arm from below, either with his hand or with a bandage, and another servant extends from above likewise. Then the physician straightens the bone until he returns it to the best shape he can.  If there are splinters in the fracture of the bone, then they are removed.
Return each splinter to its place to the best of your ability. If a splinter appears that is detached and is piercing the skin, and there is no hope of setting it, then make an incision on it and extract it in the manner we mentioned previously. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, then it has been given a separate chapter.
Then take the treatment for that from there. If a hot swelling appears at the beginning of your setting, then apply a compress with qirūṭī prepared with rose oil and white wax, and let it be moderate between thickness and thinness, and bind the compress on it gently until the swelling subsides.
Then remove the qirūṭī and apply the prepared bandage of mill dust with egg white. Then apply the splints, and let the splint that is placed on the fracture itself be a little wider and stronger. And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in most cases.
Whether the fracture was in one forearm bone or in both forearm bones together, then make your binding on the location of the fracture stronger and tighter, and whenever you move the binding upwards or downwards, make the binding slightly looser, as mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And let the compresses wrapped around the fracture be soft and moist, and not very hard. And let the thread with which it is bound be of special linen, moderate between thinness and thickness, as we described. And examine the limb and bandage after a few days.
If something happens that needs to be corrected, such as itching that appears in the limb, then the limb should be washed with warm water until that itching subsides, and the limb should be left unbound for a night so that it rests, then the binding should be resumed.
If the binding has loosened and the bone has shifted or something similar, then correct all of that to the best of your ability.  And look also, if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightening, then it should be loosened slightly and left for a few days until nourishment flows to it, then tighten it.
If nothing of what we mentioned occurs to the patient, then it should not be untied except after twenty days or so. Then suspend the patient's hand to his neck, and let his arm be straight, and he should be careful to avoid restless movements, and let him sleep on his back.
Know that this fracture of the arm heals in thirty days, or in thirty-two, and perhaps it heals in twenty-eight days; all that depends on the states of the temperaments and the states of strength.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the setting of a fracture of the hand and fingers.
The metacarpus of the hand and the phalanges of the fingers rarely suffer fracture, but they frequently suffer contusion.  So, when a fracture or contusion occurs to the hand,
the patient should sit cross-legged, and before him a chair levelly placed.
Then he places his hand upon it extended, then the assistant extends the broken bones and the physician sets them, until when they are well set, then it is necessary to apply a bandage and a splint, if there is not a hot swelling, then a splint is applied over it according to the place.
And it is inserted into a soft rag; and if the fracture is downwards towards the palm of the hand, then make a kind of ball from a rag and order the patient to grasp it with his broken hand, then it is tightened with a long rag.
And let the splint be of soft leather so that it conforms to the skin with the bending of the whole hand, and it is tightened as it should be; and if the fracture is outwards, then it is necessary to place a splint above and another splint below in the hand so that the hand is open and straight.
Then the bandage is applied as the hand turns and is interlaced between the fingers with the bandage; and if the fracture affects one of the phalanges of the fingers, if it is the thumb, then let it be set as it should be, then it is bandaged with the hand, and if you wish, you can make for it a small upright splint to support the fracture.
And it does not move; and if the fracture is to the other fingers, such as the middle, index, little or ring finger, then let them be set and bound with the next sound finger, or bind them all together, which is better, or place a small upright splint upon them.
As we said in the case of the thumb, and examine during your setting and afterwards for hot swelling, and counter it as necessary whenever anything of that occurs, as described repeatedly.
Chapter Fourteen.
On the setting of a fractured thigh.
The thigh bone is frequently fractured and is apparent to the touch because it moves forwards and backwards; and its setting is by tightening a bandage above the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, the patient lying on his face.
Then each bandage is extended to its side moderately; this if the fracture is in the middle of the bone. But if it is near the head of the thigh, then it is necessary to tighten a soft bandage, either of wool or the like.
At the head of the thigh towards the groin so that the extension is upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture; and similarly if the fracture is near the knee, let the bandage be near the knee so that the extension is downwards. Then the physician straightens the bone with both his hands until he restores it to its natural form.
And the bone unites well; then it is necessary to apply the bandage and tightening, if no hot inflammation occurs in the limb; but if inflammation does occur, leave it for some days until the hot inflammation subsides, then return to its treatment.
As for its tightening, it is necessary to wrap a firm, wide turban twice or three times around the fracture, and what remains is left. Then the leg is twisted until the heel is at the origin of the buttock, and a long thread is inserted between the thigh and leg near the knee from below, and the ends of the thread are above from both sides.
Then wrap around the leg and thigh what remains of the turban. Then place splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture itself, and place one splint on the leg bone. Then stuff the space between the thigh and leg with soft rags so that the tightening is even.
Then begin with strong tightening from the middle at the site of the fracture, three or four turns; and the farther the bandage is from the site of the fracture, let your tightening be less, softer, and looser.
Then take the ends of the thread that you had inserted between the thigh and leg, and tie with it what is next to it of the splints from above; then pass the ends of the thread downwards until you reach the heel of the foot, and tighten with them also the ends of the splints from the other side.
So that the bandage does not move from its place. Then leave the tightening on it as long as no pain, swelling, or puffiness, and the like, occurs in the limb; if any of that occurs, hasten to untie it and correct whatever of that has happened, as we have repeatedly mentioned.
If there is a protruding splinter in the bone, it should be straightened if you can; otherwise, make an incision over it and remove it, and treat the wound as previously mentioned until it heals. This fracture of the thigh may be bound without the leg being included in the splints.
As we mentioned in the case of the humerus and forearm, except that its setting in this way does not result in lameness for the patient.  But if it is set alone, without the leg being included, the patient will inevitably be lame.
Know that the thigh heals in fifty days, or a little more or less; all this depends on the differences in temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the fracture of the kneecap.
Fracture of the kneecap is rare; however, contusion is frequent. If a fracture does occur, it is either a fissure or a shattering into fragments; and this may occur with or without a wound.
You will ascertain all this by touch, and you will treat it by aligning the separated fragments with your fingers until they are reunited and joined, as far as accuracy, gentleness and skill permit; then apply a bandage and a circular splint if necessary.
Tighten the bandage appropriately from above; then treat all the conditions we have described for other fractures, such as hot inflammation and the like, by counteracting each symptom with the appropriate remedy, until healing occurs.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the treatment of fractures of the leg.
The leg has two bones, one thick, called the tibia, and the other thin, called the fibula;  they are subject to the same types of fracture as the bones of the arm. Therefore, its treatment is the same as that of the arm, and the procedure is identical. If both bones are fractured, the leg will be displaced in all directions; if the thinner bone is fractured, the leg will be displaced forward; and if the thicker bone is fractured, especially lower down, the result is obvious.
Therefore, use traction and reduction, and apply splints accordingly, except that if the leg fracture is severe with many fragments, traction should be gentler and lighter, and you should take care in its treatment.
In treating the leg, there is something more than in treating the arm: after you have set the bones and completed your work, take two splints of pine wood, the kind used in plastering rooms, placed between the cracks in the boards, or made from palm leaves or similar material.
Choose splints of moderate thickness, not thin ones, and let their length equal that of the leg from the knee down. Then wrap each splint with two layers of cloth along its length, and place one splint on each side of the leg.
Let them extend from the knee to the bottom of the foot, then tie the splints in three places: at both ends and in the middle. With this binding, the leg is prevented from tilting to either side and is well supported. A wooden gutter along the length of the leg may also be used.
It is placed in it to keep it from moving, and this is especially necessary in fractures accompanied by a wound.  Then examine the leg daily and tend to it carefully, watching for swelling, inflammation, or other complications. When any such complication arises, treat it accordingly until healing occurs. A leg fracture heals in about thirty days.
Chapter Seventeen.
On fractures of the leg bones and toes.
As for the heel, it is never fractured; as for the leg bones, they may be fractured, and the toes are also rarely fractured, but more often bruised.
If a leg bone is fractured and you see that the bones have overlapped, let the patient stand with his foot on the ground as if walking, then you place your foot on the elevated part of the bones, and then tread on them and straighten them.
Until they return to their places; then apply a bandage and splint from above, and place a small board with two flat ends under the sole of the foot; then firmly bind the foot after wrapping it with cloths and whatever else you need.
If three or four days pass, untie the bandage, for you will find the bones straight, whether they were fractured or dislocated. The procedure is as you see. As for if some of the toes are fractured, set them and straighten them according to what I described to you in setting the fingers of the hand.
Then make a splint for the fractured toe along the length of the toe, and let it be slightly wider than it. Then place under the foot the board that I described to you and bind it firmly. If two, three, or more bones are fractured,
make a splint for each toe, appropriately sized, and layered in a soft cloth, and fasten the board to the bottom of the foot, and let each end of the board rest outside the sole of the foot to ensure a good hold.
And you should not forget to attend to all that we mentioned to you in other fractures, from the symptoms that we mentioned, and treat each symptom appropriately.
Chapter Eighteen.
On the fracture of the woman's pubis and the man's penis.
When a woman's vulva is fractured, seat her cross-legged, then gently bend her backward little by little, and let her be held from behind, then let the midwife pack her vulva with cotton until it is full and becomes like a ball in her vulva.
Then the woman is shaken and her pubis is raised little by little; then that cotton comes out until it is at the opening of the vulva like a ball, and the fracture of the bone returns. Then a pad is placed on her back; and when she wants to urinate, the cotton is gently removed so that she may urinate.
And it is returned in the way it was first inserted, then she returns to her first pad. She does this for seven days or so, for it will heal. And if you wish, take a sheep's bladder, tie a tube to its mouth, and insert the whole bladder into her vulva.
Then blow strongly into the tube until the bladder inflates inside the vulva; then the fracture returns. Then pack it with cotton and remain as described until it heals. As for when the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, it is treated in the same manner.
And its treatment is as we described for the hip bone. The correct treatment of these unusual fractures, which rarely occur, especially for someone with some experience and understanding of this book, is not hidden, because the fracture itself will in most cases guide you.
Understand the correct way to treat and bind it. As for a fractured penis, take a goose's windpipe, insert the penis into it, then apply a bandage of cloth, bind it, and leave it for three days or so until it heals.
Chapter Nineteen.
On the treatment of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
Whoever suffers a fracture with a wound, especially if the bone is large, such as the femur or humerus, or similar, should immediately be bled if the conditions for bloodletting, as we have previously explained, are met.
If the wound bleeds, you should immediately stop it by applying powdered verdigris if nothing else is available. Then treat the fracture that very same day, do not delay.
If no hot inflammation occurs, then if hot inflammation does occur, delay treatment until the ninth day until the hot inflammation subsides, and do not touch it on the third or fourth day at all, for it will be exposed to bad consequences.
If the fractured bone is protruding through the skin, exposed, then you should gently try to reposition and align it with your hands with slight extension. And if you cannot reposition and align it with your hands, then reposition it with this instrument, which is an iron instrument of a length of seven or eight fingers. And its width is according to the size of the wound.
Therefore, the physician should have three or four of them, according to what he needs for treatment in each type of fracture.  Let them be round and slightly thick so that they do not bend when pressure is applied during use.
And let the tip be sharp, with a curve at its end, and let the upper part be thicker, and from its middle to the bottom, much thinner.  And this is its image:
And it is called in Greek *peron*, meaning a small lever.  Then its sharp, curved end should be placed on the end of the protruding bone and pushed with it gently, until, when the bone is returned and somewhat aligned, you complete the alignment of the fractured ends on top of each other.
If the broken end is thin and the instrument does not grasp it well, then it is necessary to cut the end of that bone until the instrument can grasp it. If you are unable to reset the bone in the way we have described at all, then cut it with a similar cut to those we have mentioned.
Or saw it with one of the saws, however you can. Then remove any roughness and thin scales remaining on the bone. If, after resetting it, the patient feels severe, persistent pain, know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you are able to return it to its natural position, do so, for you will greatly benefit the patient.  When you have finished setting the bone, dip a cloth in a black astringent drink, especially if it is summer, and do not apply a poultice or anything greasy to the wound.
Lest putrefaction and corruption occur in it. Then, when you have finished setting the bone, apply splints and leave the wound uncovered by cutting a hole in the bandages with scissors, the size of the wound.
And beware, with all caution, of tightening the wound with the fracture, for many ignorant physicians have done this, causing their patients either death, or gangrene, or tetanus. Let your binding be gentle and loose, unlike the binding of other fractures.
If the wound is bad, or a large wound, and you fear some of the bad symptoms we have described, and he feels disturbing pain in the place, then you should not apply splints. Make bandages from strong cloths in place of the splints and bind it with them.
If after a day or two you see that pus has begun to form in the wound, remove the cloth you placed on it with the drink, then use lint and ointments with which we are accustomed to treat wounds, such as the four-ingredient ointment and the like.  You should loosen the bandage.
And examine the wound every day, evening and morning, until it heals.  You should position the limb so that the pus flows down easily. If many days pass and the wound does not heal, nor does the pus cease, know that there are small bone fragments.
You should probe the wound. Whatever of those fragments is loose, remove and extract them. Whatever is not loose and is piercing the limb and causing pain, then work at cutting and removing them by whatever means you can.
If the wound shows signs of inflammation, gangrene, or another type of corruption and putrefaction, then you should treat each symptom with a corresponding treatment as previously described in its chapter.
What you should note and keep in mind is that if a large bone is broken and projects from a limb, such as the thigh bone, humerus, or similar large members, do not attempt to pull or remove it. For death often results from such an attempt. Rather, leave it until it putrefies; perhaps it will fall off by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see it is suitable for treatment; otherwise, leave it.
Chapter Twenty.
In the treatment of complications that arise after certain fractures.
This complication often arises after the fracture heals, especially those near the joints, making the limb unsightly and perhaps preventing it from its natural function.
Examine it; if the complication is soft, then use astringent medicines such as aloe, frankincense, myrrh,  bdellium, acacia, and the like.  Take some or all of these and mix them with an astringent syrup, egg white, or vinegar.
Apply it to the complication in a bandage and bind it tightly. Leave the bandage undisturbed for many days, then unbind it and reapply another until the complication disappears, God willing, or bind a tight lead plate to it.
For lead has the property of removing anything superfluous in the limbs. If the complication has ossified and hardened, and necessity dictates its removal, incise it from above and cut away the excess growth, or scrape it off with a scraper until it is gone, and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
In the treatment of a fracture, if it has healed but the limb remains thin and not as it was originally.
If a bone fracture has healed, but the limb remains thin and weak, this is due to many causes. One of them is either due to excessive loosening and tightening of the bandages, or to excessive tightening of the bandages such that nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb, or to excessive and repeated manipulation, or to excessive movement at the wrong time, or to a deficiency of blood and weakness in the patient's body.
The treatment of this is to nourish the patient and enrich his body so that his blood increases, and to use the bath and to bring him joy and happiness and the like, then to apply pitch to the limb so that the pitch draws much nourishment to it, or to repeatedly manipulate it with lukewarm water. until nourishment flows to it and it returns to its natural shape.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
In the treatment of fractured bones if they are set crookedly and prevented from functioning properly.
If, after a limb has healed, a crookedness or projection of the fractured bone, or a complication appears, and the appearance of the limb is thereby disfigured. However, if the limb has not been prevented from its natural function, then the opinion of those who claim that the limb should be broken again should not be accepted; many ignorant physicians and bone-setters in our country have done this.
And this action is utterly reprehensible, leading to great harm, the least of which is disability; but if the crookedness and complication are recent, then it should be treated with water in which emollient herbs such as mallow leaves and root, and rosemary, and the like, have been boiled.
And it should be bandaged with emollient bandages such as well-made diachylon, or the sap of mallow root should be taken and pounded with chicken fat and butter, and bandaged with it, or ripe figs should be taken and pounded with pigeon dung, and similar medicines which are called resolvents.
And sometimes the complication will resolve with constant gentle rubbing by hand, and the movement of the limb in every direction at all times should be used; but if the crookedness is old and severe and hardened, and treatment with instruments is necessary.
Then it should be incised above and the connection of the bone released, and what remains of the complication or bone should be cut with fine cuts, and gentleness should be used with effort and care, then the wound should be treated as previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
A dislocation is the displacement of a joint from its place, which hinders movement, disfigures the limb, and causes the patient severe pain and suffering.  If a dislocation occurs, one should immediately attempt to reduce it.
One should not delay at all, for if he delays, the place will swell and become inflamed, making reduction of the dislocation difficult. Therefore, one should not delay, nor move, nor extend it while it is swollen, because this often causes the patient spasms and harmful pains.
But if this occurs, one should immediately bleed the patient, then leave him until the swelling subsides somewhat. Then, bathe the limb with warm water and oil, and then gently reduce it, and treat each limb as described in its place.
The chapters on dislocations are also arranged, as in fractures, from the top of the body to the bottom.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
Rarely do both jaws dislocate, and their dislocation occurs in one of two ways: either they slightly leave their places and relax a little, or they dislocate completely so that they relax. toward the chest, so that the saliva of the patient flows and he cannot retain it, nor can he close his jaw, and his tongue stumbles in speech. But if the dislocation is slight, it often returns by itself with the greatest ease.
But if the dislocation is complete, it is necessary to hasten its reduction quickly and not delay it at all.  This is done by a servant holding the head of the patient, and the physician inserting the thumb of one hand into the origin of the jaw inside his mouth, if the jaw is dislocated on one side.
or he inserts both thumbs if the jaw is dislocated on both sides, and the rest of his fingers from the outside, with which he manipulates it, and he orders the patient to relax his jaw and release it to go to every side, and the physician manipulates the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
If its reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are dislocated, then use fomentations with hot water and oil until their reduction is easy, and do not delay their reduction at all, as we said. When they return and become straight and the patient's mouth closes and they do not relax, then apply to them pledgets of cloth with a poultice made of wax, oil, and rose water.
Then bind it gently with a loose bandage, and let the patient sleep on his back with his head raised between two pillows, lest he move it to the right or left, and let him not attempt to chew anything, but let his food be soft gruel.
Until the pain subsides and the jaw is firmly set, then let him eat whatever he desires, and let him use it gently and not strain to open his mouth when eating, drinking, or yawning until the jaw is firmly set and healed.
If the reduction of the jaws is difficult, if they become dislocated at some time and do not return to their places, then fevers and persistent headaches often result from this, and perhaps the patient's abdomen will become distended, and perhaps he will vomit pure bile. If you see this, then know that it is damaged.
And many die from this condition within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On the reduction of the clavicle and the tip of the shoulder.
As for the clavicle, it does not dislocate from the inner side because of its connection to the chest; it may dislocate outwards, and this is apparent to the touch. Its treatment is that the patient should lie on his back and extend his arms.
Then press the location with your palm strongly, and it will return. Then apply a bandage and splints and bind it. As for its end which is near the shoulder and connected to it, it rarely dislocates. If it should dislocate, then it should be reduced and aligned as we have mentioned and as seems appropriate to you.
Then apply a bandage and splints and binding, and instruct the patient to observe rest and stillness until he recovers. With this same treatment, the tip of the shoulder is reduced if it also leaves its place.
Chapter Twenty-six.
On the reduction of the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder dislocates in three ways: one is that it dislocates towards the armpit, downwards; the second is that it dislocates towards the chest; and sometimes it dislocates above the shoulder, but this is rare.
It does not dislocate to the rear because of the shoulder blade, nor does it dislocate to the front because of the nerve.  Most often it dislocates and goes downwards towards the armpit, especially in those who have little flesh, for in them it goes out quickly and enters quickly.
But as for those who have much flesh, it is otherwise; that is to say, it goes out with difficulty and enters with difficulty.  And sometimes a blow or a fall happens to some people, so that the shoulder swells with a hot swelling, and they think that it is dislocated; so it is necessary to examine that until you ascertain its truth.
Then you proceed with its treatment.  And the dislocation is recognized if it is downwards towards the armpit: if you compare the dislocated shoulder with the sound shoulder, you will find a clear difference between them, and you will find the head of the shoulder distorted, and under the armpit, on palpation, the head of the shoulder as if it were an egg.
And the patient is not able to raise his hand to his ear, nor to move it in all movements. And similarly, if it dislocates towards the chest or upwards, you will find that apparent to the touch, it is not hidden.
And this dislocation is easily reduced if it is recent or if the patient is a child.  Its reduction is that a servant raises his hand upwards, then you place the thumbs of your hands under his armpit and raise the joint forcefully upwards to its place, while the servant raises his hand and extends it upwards.
Then he lets it down; then it returns quickly. If it does not return by what we have mentioned, and the dislocation has been for many days, then the patient should bathe in hot water and use things which relax and soften, such as cooking the root of mallow, fenugreek and rue in water and using it.
Then the patient lies on his back, and you place under his armpit a ball of wool which is moderate between softness and firmness; then the physician places his heel on the ball and grasps the patient's hand with his hand and extends it downwards.
And he pushes the ball with his foot, then it returns to its place. And if you wish to reduce it in this way, you have a taller man than the patient stand by his side, and he puts his shoulder under the patient's armpit and raises his armpit upwards until the patient is hanging in the air. And another servant pulls the patient's hand down to his belly. If the patient is light, then something else should be hung on him to weigh him down; then the jaw returns immediately.  And it may also be reduced in another way.
And that is to fix in the ground a long piece of wood, its head being round like the pestle of a mortar, neither thick nor thin; then it is placed under the patient's armpit, after placing a soft rag on the head of the wood, and the patient standing along the length of the wood.
Then you extend his hand downwards on the other side, and extend his body also forcefully from the other side; then the joint returns to its place quickly. If it is difficult to reduce it by all that we have mentioned, then use this treatment: you take a piece of wood about two cubits long. And its width is the size of four fingers and its thickness is the size of two fingers; it has a round head to facilitate its entry into the depth of the armpit in this manner:
Then you tie a soft rag on the round head lest the wood harm the patient; then it is placed under the armpit, and the whole hand and arm are extended on the wood downwards, and the wood is tied to the arm, forearm, and hand.
Then the arm is placed on a crossbeam, level with the width, and the hand is extended downwards, and the rest of the body is left hanging from the other side; then the joint enters immediately. If its entry is achieved in any way possible, then a moderately sized ball of wool should be placed under the armpit.
Then the prepared bandage of mill dust, frankincense, and egg white is applied to the whole shoulder, as it goes around from above; then the ball is firmly tied under the armpit, and the bandage is wound from above, and his hand is hung from his neck.
And he is left without moving his hand for seven days, and the patient's food should be little so that the limb may strengthen, for this hastens its healing. Then, after seven or five days, it is untied and exercised; if it is firm and does not relax, then it is healed.
If the joint dislocates repeatedly due to dampness or some other cause, then cauterization with three points should be used, as described in the chapter on cauterization.  If all this has been done and the bandage is loosened after seven days, and the joint is not firm,
then the bandage and tightening should be repeated many times; if it is not firm, and it has fallen and relaxed, and you cannot raise it upwards, then know that the nerve in the head of the humerus is severed, or stretched, or relaxed; then know that the joint will never be firm in its place.
As for the dislocation which is towards the chest and breast, and to the back, its reduction is by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns; and all the bandaging and treatment are used until it is healed.  If, after healing, numbness appears in the limb and movement is slow,
let the patient use the bath many times until that numbness softens and returns to its former nature.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On the treatment of dislocation of the elbow.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty and likewise returns with difficulty also; and it dislocates to all sides, especially to the front or to the back; and its dislocation is not hidden from you, because it is under sight and under touch, to whichever side it is dislocated.
And if you compare the dislocated elbow with the sound one, that will be apparent to you clearly by the hollowing of the joint; and he cannot bend the arm nor touch his shoulder with it; and you should hasten and reduce the dislocation at once before a hot swelling occurs in it.
For if a hot swelling occurs in it, its reduction is difficult, and perhaps it will not heal at all, especially if the dislocation is to the back; for that is the worst of all kinds of dislocation and the most painful, and very often death ensues with it.
And its reduction, if it is of a kind that can be reduced, is that a servant extends his hand with both his hands and his arm extended, and the physician's hands above and below the elbow, and he pushes the joint with the thumbs of both his hands, or with the base of his palm, until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is to the front, it may be reduced by bending the hand once until the base of its palm strikes the shoulder which it faces; and if the dislocation does not return to its place, then use very strong extension, which is that two servants extend the arm.
And two servants also hold the patient so that he does not move during the extension; then the arm is rotated to every direction after wrapping a folded cloth or a wide bandage around his hand; and when the physician touches the joint with his hands, he anoints them with oil so that it helps in easily sliding the joint.
Then he pushes the joint strongly until it returns; and after its return, it is necessary to apply a bandage containing astringents and desiccants with egg white, and it is tightly bound, and the arm is suspended from the patient's neck, and it is left for some days.
Then it is untied; and if the joint is firm in its place, then untie the bandage from it and leave it; and if you see that the joint is not yet strengthened, then reapply the bandage and leave it also for some days until it strengthens, then untie it; and if there is swelling after the return of the joint and its unbinding,
and difficulty in movement, then let him use fomentation in the bath and gentle massage and manipulation until it softens, or place on the joint the udder of a fat sheep, then bind it and leave it on him for a day and a night, then remove it and put him in the bath; and when he sweats, then massage the joint moderately.
Then reapply the udder once, twice, and three times with entering the bath until it softens; and if you wish to apply moistened, light ox-dung with fat and bind it on him, do that repeatedly, for it softens and returns to its former state.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
In the treatment of a dislocated wrist.
The wrist often becomes dislocated, and its reduction is easy unlike other joints, except that it is necessary to hasten its reduction at the time it becomes dislocated before the place becomes swollen or a hot swelling appears.
And its reduction is that you place the patient's wrist on a board, and an attendant extends his hand, and the physician places his hand on the prominence of the joint and pushes it until it returns; however, it is necessary to look if the dislocation has gone to the inside of the hand.
So let the patient place the back of his hand on the board during extension and reduction, and if the dislocation is protruding to the back of the hand, let the palm of his hand be placed on the board so that the physician's hand falls on the same prominence of the joint; if it returns immediately, otherwise, bind it with a bandage that soothes the swelling.
And leave it; do not manipulate it again, for it will not tolerate it, and you will not be able to reduce it after days have passed, except that the joint remains crooked and does not harm the patient except if the hand becomes weak and unable to grasp anything.
Then you know that the nerve has been severed or bruised, and there is no remedy for it except cauterization; perhaps it will benefit, and perhaps it will not benefit at all. When the reduction of the wrist is complete, apply the bandage that we described, then tighten it and leave it for five days.
Then it is untied, and the hand is exercised; if its movement is difficult and there is some stiffness in it, soften it with warm water and rubbing repeatedly until it softens.
Chapter twenty-nine.
In the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may be dislocated in any direction; if a finger is dislocated towards the back or palm of the hand, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns, then bind the tip of the finger and suspend it towards the direction in which it was dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release it and extend it until it is straight that day; if it is at night, bind it in the same way, but continue to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night; do this for several days until it strengthens.
And likewise do with it if it is dislocated towards the palm of the hand, binding it towards that same direction and doing to it as you did before until it heals; and likewise do with it if it is dislocated in any other direction.
Chapter Thirty.
In the treatment of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
If a vertebra of the vertebrae of the back or neck is completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, then there is no treatment, for death quickly overtakes the patient.
And the sign of that is that the patient's stool is passed involuntarily, he is unable to retain it, and often some of his limbs become relaxed, either his legs or his arms, or one of them; and if one vertebra is displaced from its position, it often returns to its place.
And its displacement is in four directions; that which is displaced backward is called a hump. As for its treatment, you should look; if the hump has occurred from childhood, there is no treatment for it and no cure at all. As for that which has occurred from a fall or a blow, and the like…
The ancients mentioned it with various treatments in lengthy descriptions, most of which are of little benefit. I have shortened this, so that a little of it suffices for much of what they presented, by approximating the meaning and explaining it, and I have depicted the instrument differently from what they explained and described.
So I say that the hump which occurs in the front of the chest has no remedy and no cure, and so too that which occurs to the sides; only that which occurs in the back is treated, in the way that I describe, which is to stretch out the patient on his face.
on a level bench near a wall, and spread a wet cloth beneath him so that his chest is not harmed. Then place an upright wooden post, fixed in a hole in the ground at the head of the bench, and another post toward his feet at the other end of the bench.
And a servant holds the post—let it not be firmly fixed in the hole—and another servant holds the other post in that manner. Then wrap the patient’s chest and under his armpits with a soft, tight bandage, and extend the end of the bandage to the post at his head and tie it there.
Then tighten with another bandage above his hips, above his knees, and at his heels. Then gather all the bandages and tie them to the other post at his feet. Then each servant pulls his post with the bandage, and the two posts do not move from their fixed positions.
Except that they are not firmly fixed, as we said. And the physician places his hands on the hump forcefully until it returns, or he places a board on it and then leans on the board with his feet until it returns. If it does not return with this treatment, then take a board about three cubits long.
And dig into the wall, which we said should be near the patient, a place into which the end of the board fits. Then place the middle of the board on the hump, and the physician places his feet on the other end and pulls strongly until he presses the hump.
And it returns to its place. And if you wish to make it with a hand-twisted screw, then you plant in the ground at the head of the patient at the end of the shop two posts, each a cubit long, and at his feet at the end of the shop also two posts.
Let the distance between each post be a cubit. And a hole is made in each post through which the screw passes. And all the posts are firmly fixed in the ground so that they do not move at all. And insert a round stick, which is the screw in which the bandage is twisted, into the holes of the two posts.
And at its end is a hole in which a stick a cubit long is firmly fixed by twisting. And the same is done in the other two posts. Then tighten the bandage which you have tightened on the chest of the patient in the screw at his head, and the bandages which you have tightened on his legs in the screw at his feet.
Then a servant stands at each screw, twisting his hand with the twister with which he twists the screw, and the physician straightens the hump as we have explained. And this is an image of the screw, the shop, and the patient:
Then, after the vertebra returns and the place is straightened, it is necessary to apply a drying bandage with egg white, then tow, then place on top of the bandage a splint of wood whose width is three fingers or thereabouts, and its length is the extent of the hump.
And on some sound beads, then it is bound with the appropriate bandage, and the patient uses light food until he recovers. If some swelling remains in the place at the end of the healing, then it is necessary to use medicines that relax and soften, along with using the splint which we described for a long time.
And a lead plate may be used in this. And sometimes a swelling appears at the end of the vertebrae of the back, and it is thought to be a dislocation, and it is an extra bone that has grown.  Do not treat it with this treatment, for death might result.
Chapter thirty-one.
In the treatment of the dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and not to what affects other joints of slight displacement and depression.  The hip joint is dislocated in four ways.
That is, it is dislocated inwards, outwards, forwards, and backwards. It is most often dislocated inwards, and rarely forwards or backwards. The sign of its dislocation inwards is that if you compare the sound leg of the patient with the affected leg, the sound leg will be longer.
And the knee will be more prominent than the sound one, and the patient will not be able to bend his leg at the groin, and the place next to the groin will be noticeably swollen, because the head of the femur has gone there.
And the sign of that which is dislocated outwards is that its symptoms are the opposite of these symptoms. And the sign of that which is dislocated forwards is that he extends his leg completely, but he cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he tries to walk he cannot do so forwards.
And he retains his urine, and his groin swells, and when walking he treads on his heel.  And the sign of that which is dislocated backwards is that he cannot extend the knee, nor can he bend it before bending the groin, and his leg is also shorter than the other.
And the groin is relaxed, and the head of the femur is clearly at the position of the loin. As for the reduction of the types of this dislocation, you should look: if the dislocation is old, having persisted with the patient for some time, and no one has attempted to reduce it, and it has remained in its state, then there is absolutely no treatment for it.
Then you should not attempt to treat it.  But as for the one whose dislocation is recent, and whatever its type may be of the four forms of dislocation, hasten to twist the joint and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left, perhaps...
it will return and will not need other treatment. If it does not return in this way, then you should prepare a strong, capable assistant who will extend his leg from below, either with his hands or with a bandage tied around his leg above the knee, and another assistant who will extend it from above.
by placing his hands under his armpits, then tightening a soft bandage around the root of the thigh, and a third assistant holding the end of the bandage. The extension will be either from the front, from the groin towards the clavicle, or from behind towards the back.
And their extension will all be at once until the patient is raised from the ground with his body and remains suspended. This type of extension is common to the four types. If the dislocation returns as we have said, otherwise, each type will require the special treatment I will mention.
As for its special reduction, if the dislocation is inwards, the patient should lie on his sound side, then a bandage is applied to the root of the thigh between the head of the thigh and the area under the groin.
Then the bandage is extended upwards from the groin to the upper body towards the clavicle. Then another strong, capable assistant takes it with his arms and embraces the thick part of the affected thigh and extends it outwards with a strong pull, so that it returns to its place.
This method is easier than all other methods of treating this condition. If it proves difficult and does not respond to this type of treatment at all, then the patient's legs should be tied together with a strong, soft bandage around the heels and knees.
The distance between each [bandage] and its neighbour will be four fingers, and the affected leg will be extended two fingers more than the other. Then the patient is suspended by the head from a wooden beam in the house, and he will be two cubits from the ground.
Then you order a strong boy to embrace the head of the thigh, and another boy hangs onto the patient; and the other boy who is embracing the thigh pushes forcefully, so the joint returns to its place quickly. As for its special reduction, if the dislocation is outwards,
the patient should lie on the operating table as we described for the humpbacked patient, and a bandage is tightened around his affected leg in particular and his chest. Then two pieces of wood are placed, one at his feet and the other at his head, and then an extra piece of wood is placed in the middle of the table, very firmly secured.
A wet rag is wrapped around it so that it does not injure the patient; the wood is placed between his thighs so that he does not slip downwards when pulled. Then each attendant pulls on his side, and the doctor sets the hip with his hands; if it responds to reduction,
otherwise, place the board on him and press down as we mentioned in the case of the humpback, except that the patient should lie on his sound side. If the dislocation is forward, the patient's leg should be extended forcefully while he is in this same position on the operating table.
The physician places the palm of his right hand on the affected hip and then presses it with the other hand, meanwhile extending the pressure downwards towards the knee. If the dislocation is backward, the patient should not be pulled downwards.
He is raised from the ground, but should be placed on something firm, as he should also be if his hip is dislocated outwards, according to what we mentioned about his lying on the operating table on his face with the bandages tightened.
as we said before, and the pressure with the board should also be applied to the place where the joint came out. When the hip joint is completely reduced as it should be—and the sign of its reduction will not be hidden from you—you extend the patient's legs.
If you see them even and the patient can flex and extend his leg without difficulty, know that the limb has been reduced as it should be. Then bind the thighs together, apply the bandage and tighten it firmly with a turban so that the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient must remain still for three or four days. Then remove the bandage and compare the leg with the other. If you see them equal in size, know that the reduction has been successful and allow the patient to walk. If you see any laxness in it,
reapply the bandage and tighten it as you did before, and leave it for another three days. Then remove it, and he should walk slowly on it for a few days until it strengthens, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
In the treatment of the reduction of the knee.
The knee dislocates in three ways: inwards, outwards, and downwards, that is, backwards; it does not dislocate forwards at all.  The sign of its dislocation is that you order the patient to bring his leg to his thigh.
If it does not adhere to the thigh, then know that the knee is dislocated. The treatment for all types of its dislocation is that you seat the patient sitting with his legs extended, if he is able to do so, and a servant sits behind him to hold his waist and twist him slightly backwards, then you sit on his thighs.
And you place your back against his face and place his leg between your legs, then you grasp his knee with your hands and interlock them between your fingers on his knee, then you press with your hands on the sides of his knee strongly, and another servant extends his leg until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh softly and without force. Then bandage it and bind the leg to the thigh, then bind them both with a bandage for three or four days, then release them. And he should only use little walking for some days until it strengthens.
If it is difficult for you to return it by what we described, then use strong traction with the bandages which I previously described in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-Three.
In the treatment of the fracture of the heel.
The heel may be displaced slightly, or it may be completely dislocated.  Its dislocation is either inwards or outwards, and the sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen and prominent towards the side to which it dislocated.
As for the treatment of its slight displacement, it is easy to return it; this is done by gently pulling it with the hands and straightening it until it returns. As for its treatment if it is completely dislocated, then it is necessary that you seat the patient sitting, and a strong servant holds him from behind his back at his waist.
Then you grasp his foot from above with your right hand and from below his foot at the place of the heel with your left hand, then pull the foot towards you with your right hand and then with the left twice, then straighten it with the left and push the front of the foot with the right towards the leg without violence.
Do this twice as we have described, then push the front of the foot to the leg on the third time while you pull at the heel; if it returns in one or two times in this manner and you see the foot straight, otherwise repeat the action on it, for it will return.
If it refuses to return by what we have described, then lay the patient on his back on the ground and firmly fix a peg in the ground so that it lies between his thighs, having wrapped a cloth around it so that it does not hurt the patient; then a servant should hold his thigh.
Then another servant stretches the leg, either with his hands or with a rope that he ties around the neck of the leg; then each servant stretches in the opposite direction to his companion, and the peg remains between the patient's thighs holding him so that his body does not slip downwards during the stretching, then the physician sets the dislocation with his hands.
And another servant holds the healthy leg below, for the dislocation returns quickly; when the dislocation returns and you are certain of its return, apply the bandage and splint and bind it tightly with bandages and bind the foot with a bandage to the bottom, and it is necessary to protect the nerve which is above the heel from behind.
lest the bandage be too tight and hurt him; then leave it for two or three days; if the bandage loosens, tighten it, then loosen it on the third or fourth day, and the patient should abstain from walking for forty days.
If he attempts to walk before this time, you cannot be sure that the dislocation will not recur and be spoiled and will not accept treatment afterwards; if a hot swelling appears, then it is necessary to use in its calming what we have previously described in another place of treatment and application until it disappears.
Chapter thirty-four.
In the treatment of dislocations of the toes.
What is dislocated should be straightened with a slight pull without force; this is not difficult, but easy. If the dislocation is in some of the joints of the instep, then the patient should place his foot on a level surface of the ground.
Or on a board while he is standing as if walking, then you should place your foot on the dislocated joint and then press it down firmly with your foot until it returns and you see that it is straight and no prominence appears in the area.
Then place a board under the sole of his foot which encompasses the whole foot and has two ends; then bind it tightly and firmly for three days, then unbind it and keep him from walking for many days until it strengthens and the recurrence is prevented, God willing.
Chapter thirty-five.
On the types of dislocation which occurs with a wound or with a fracture or with both together.
When something of that sort happens and you attempt its treatment and setting, it frequently results in death.
Therefore, no one should undertake the treatment of such a thing except one who is skillful in the art, long experienced, gentle, compassionate, deliberate, not rash or impetuous, and that he should initially use only medicines which calm hot swellings and leave the patient alone.
For God's sake, except for what you hope will be safe from harm with mildness of the disease and you see in it some hope, then return it from the moment in the first instance before the hot swelling develops.
If the limb returns to what you intended, then use the treatment which calms hot swellings and treat the wound with whatever is suitable for it from drying ointments; if the dislocation is with a fracture and splinters are formed in the bone, then remove them. And follow in that what we mentioned in the simple diseases, which preceded in their places.
And exert your effort and keep yourself from entering the path of risk, as I have previously advised you, for that is more lasting for your reputation and safer for your honor, God willing.
