Know that in the cutting of this branch there is fear in many situations, for which reason it seems to me that it is better to leave it alone; and I will tell you the procedure and the appearances of the abscess.	You should know that cutting for this kind of hernia has an uncertain outcome and in most cases results in death; and therefore I think it better to let it be and to safeguard the patient. However, I shall mention the manner of operating for this and all kinds of tumour.	0.68736553
I say then that many abscesses arise in the body, and especially in the testicles; and this is for many reasons.	Now I say that many tumours arise from the bodies composing the testicles; and this from several causes.	0.77106416
When it is from a night artery, it is known by the condition of a hot abscess, when you press it with your fingers; and you should not touch it.	The sort arising from a swelling of the arteries may be recognized by a dispersal of the lump when you press upon it with your fingers; this should not be interfered with at all.	0.6763092
The one that is made from the swelling of a vein is known by its condition upon pressing it with the fingers, and one can safely make an incision on this type, and on other flesh; and you must cut the heart of the testicles, then stretch the testicle upwards, and draw it out from the white tunic, and free the suspensory ligament on all sides of the testicle.	The sort arising from a swelling of the vein will not disperse when you press upon it with your fingers. It is sometimes possible to cut down on this kind and also on the other fleshy tumours thus: make an incision in the skin of the testicles; then draw the testicle upward and out of the tunica albuginea, and free the suspensor from the vessels and tie the vessels, and cut the suspensor after you have freed it from all round the testicle.	0.82323307
If the testicle is already attached to this new flesh, then you must draw out the testicle and cut it; and if there is air in the tunic, or in what is inside the vessels, then you must free all that tissue, and cut it roundly.	Should it happen that the testicle is adherent to the fleshy growth, you will have to cut away the testicle itself and remove it. But should the adhesion have formed somewhere inside the membranes or in the space between the vessels, then you must free the adhesion as a whole and cut it away with a circular incision.	0.6935431
And if the growth of the flesh is in the back part, then you must cut it all out and extract the testicle, as we have said.	If the fleshy growth should be at the site of the junction which is behind, you will have to cut the whole thing away and remove the testicle as we have said.	0.8559397
And when your work is completed, fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine, then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.	And when your operation is finished, pack the wound with wool moistened with oil of roses and wine; then dress in the usual manner until healed.	0.8401315
