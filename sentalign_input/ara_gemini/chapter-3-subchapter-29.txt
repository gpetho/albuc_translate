Chapter twenty-nine on the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may dislocate in any direction.
So when a finger dislocates to the back or palm of the hand, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns (to its place).
Then, bind the tip of the finger and suspend it towards the direction to which it was dislocated and leave it for two days, then release it and extend it until it straightens itself on that day.
If you tied it at night in the same manner, continue to untie it during the day and exercise it with movement and tie it at night, doing that for several days until it strengthens.
And do the same with it if it dislocates towards the palm of the hand, tie it towards the same direction and do with it what you did before until it heals.
And do the same with it whenever it dislocates in any other direction.
