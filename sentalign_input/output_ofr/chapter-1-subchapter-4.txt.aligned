of migraine	On the cauterization of chronic migraine.	0.4633722
When you treat a migraine as we have said before in the divisions of illnesses, and it is not effective, and you see that the previously mentioned cauterizations with medicine and iron are not sufficient, then it is necessary that you heat the cautery which is called "cultellare" until it is white;	When you have treated a migraine in the way we have described and with what we have mentioned in the sections on diseases, and the treatment is ineffective, and you perceive that the malady is such that the cauterization we have mentioned before does not suffice for it, either with caustic or with the actual cautery, you should heat an edged cautery to white heat after you have marked the place with a line half a finger's breadth long or thereabouts; and impress your hand once and maintain the pressure till you cut down upon the artery and reach the bone.	0.70445013
and thus mark on the painful area a line half a finger long, and remove your hand immediately, and take care not to cut the artery and that you do not reach the bone;	You must be careful of the mandibular joint which moves in chewing, that you do not cut the muscle or tendon that moves it, causing spasm.	0.48436984
and beware of the mandible that moves when one chews, and be mindful of the nerve that moves it so that spasm does not come to the patient, and beware of bleeding from the artery when it is cut, where cutting brings great fear, especially to him who does not know it, and who is not a student and experienced; and leave the work halfway done;	Have the utmost care of haemorrhage from the artery you have cut, for the occurrence of that is dangerous, specially with one who does not know what to do, having no experience or practice; it is better to refrain from operating.	0.6327908
but I will tell you how to stop the bleeding when the artery is cut, and I will show you the place where it is appropriate in this book.	We shall later on mention a treatment for accidental haemorrhage of the artery, in due detail, in its proper place in this book.	0.57019734
And if you see that this cautery is not enough for the illness, and the patient is suffering, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed;	But if you see that this cautery is not enough for this disorder and you see that the patient is of bodily fitness for it, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we have described, and treat the wound till healed.	0.84593886
and if you wish, administer the cautery that we mentioned in the chapter on the extraction of the artery, with the cautery that has two blades; and this cautery is better than that one and more helpful.	If you prefer, employ that cauterization which we have described in the chapter on the extraction of an artery, with the cautery of two blades; for that is a cauterization better and more effective than this.	0.8482616
