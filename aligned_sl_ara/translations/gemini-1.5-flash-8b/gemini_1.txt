The author of this book, when he had completed for you, my children, this book, which is the complete part of the science of medicine, and had reached the highest degree of clarity and explanation in it, saw fit to complete it for you with this chapter, which is the part of practical application.
Because practical application in our country and in our time is entirely lacking, so much so that its science almost ceased to be taught and its effect disappeared. But only a few traces of it remained in the books of the ancients, which the hands have corrupted, and error and confusion have affected, so that its meanings have become obscure and its benefits have receded.
Therefore, I saw fit to revive it and compose this chapter on the path of explanation, clarity, and conciseness, and to provide illustrations of cauterizing irons and other instruments of practice, as this is an additional means of clarification and a collection of what is needed.
The reason there is no skilled practitioner with a skilled hand in our time is that the practice of medicine is long, and the practitioner must first diligently study the anatomy, as described by Galen. So that he understands the benefits of the organs, their structures, temperaments, connections, and separations; and knows the bones, nerves, muscles, their numbers and origins; the arteries, veins, and their courses.
Therefore, Hippocrates said that physicians are numerous in name, but few in practice, especially in the craft of the hand.  We have mentioned a glimpse of this in the introduction of this book.
Because whoever is not knowledgeable about the anatomy we have mentioned is likely to make mistakes that kill people, as I have witnessed many who have imagined themselves knowledgeable in this field, claiming expertise without knowledge or understanding.
I saw an ignorant physician who incised a scrofulous tumor on a woman's neck, thereby severing some of the arteries of the neck, causing the woman to bleed to death in his hands.
I saw another physician, in attempting to remove a stone from an elderly man's bladder, was overly bold and extracted it with a portion of the bladder wall. The man died about three days later.  I was summoned to remove it, and considering the size of the stone and the patient's condition, I deemed it unadvisable.
I saw another physician who practiced medicine for the sake of profit among some of the important people in our town.
A dark-skinned boy, with a broken leg near the heel and a wound, presented. The physician, in his ignorance, quickly bound the fracture to the wound with bandages and splints in a tight manner, leaving no breathing space for the wound.
Then, he left it to its own devices, and after several days, forbade him from loosening the bandages until his leg and foot had swollen, and he was on the verge of death.
I was called to him, and quickly loosened the bandages. He found relief and his pain subsided, but the damage had already taken hold in the limb, and I was unable to stop it.
The damage continued to spread in the limb until he died.
I saw another physician treat a cancerous tumor.  After a few days, it ulcerated, greatly harming its owner.  This is because if the cancer is purely of a black humor, it should never be treated with iron.
Unless it is in a limb that can be entirely removed.
Therefore, my son, you should know that manual work is divided into two types: work accompanied by safety, and work that in most cases results in injury.
I have warned in every place in this book about work that involves risk and fear. You should avoid and reject it.
So that the ignorant might not find a way to speak ill and criticize, take care and caution for yourselves, and treat your patients with gentleness and firmness.
Use the best path leading to safety and a good outcome, and avoid dangerous diseases difficult to cure.
Keep yourselves free from that which you fear may introduce doubt into your religion and your worldly affairs, for this is the most lasting path to your honor and the greatest elevation of your status in this world and the hereafter.
Galen, in some of his advice, said, "Do not treat a bad disease, lest you be known as a bad physician.
This article is divided into three chapters.
The first chapter.
The chapter on cauterization with fire and with sharp medicines, arranged from the heel to the foot, with descriptions of the tools, cautery irons, and everything needed for manual work.
The second chapter.
On incision, lancing, bloodletting, cupping, surgeries, removing arrows, and the like, all categorized and arranged, with illustrations of the tools.
The third chapter.
On fractures, dislocations, and the treatment of sprains and the like, categorized and arranged from the heel to the foot, with illustrations of the tools.
The first chapter.
On cauterization.
Before we describe the procedure, it is necessary to describe its benefits and harms, and in what temperament it is used.
For I say that the discussion of the benefits and harms of cauterization is lengthy, a precise science, and a hidden secret, and many wise men have spoken on it.
They differed in their views, and I have condensed the essential parts of their discourse for fear of becoming too lengthy.
I say that cauterization is generally beneficial for every bad temperament, whether with or without a material substance, except for two temperaments: the hot temperament without a substance and the dry temperament without a substance.
As for the dry temperament with a substance, they differed in opinion. Some said that cauterization is beneficial in it, while others argued the opposite, stating that cauterization is unsuitable for an illness arising from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness.
It is impossible to be cured of a hot and dry ailment with a hot and dry remedy.  The one who disagrees says that cauterization by fire may benefit from a hot and dry illness that occurs in people's bodies. Because when you add a person's body and its moisture to the temperament of fire, you make the person's body cold.
And I say in agreement with him, because experience has revealed this to me on several occasions.  However, one should not presume this without thorough and extensive practice in the art of cauterization. And he must understand the differences in people's temperaments, the nature of diseases, their causes, symptoms, and duration.
As for the other temperaments, there is no fear from them, especially cold and moist illnesses; all physicians agree on their benefit from cauterization.
Know, my children, that the secret of effective treatment with cauterization by fire lies in its superiority over cauterization by a burning drug, because fire is a simple element whose effect is limited to the organ cauterized and it harms another adjacent organ only slightly.
Cauterization with a burning drug may extend its effect to other organs, and may cause a difficult-to-treat disease or even death in the treated organ.  Fire, owing to its noble and pure nature, does not do this unless excessive.
This has been made clear to us through experience, long service, and careful attention to the craft and the facts of the matter.
Therefore, I have dispensed with lengthy explanation; were it not unbefitting this book, I would have presented you with a profound secret concerning fire, how it acts on bodies, and how it eliminates illness using rigorous, philosophical, and demonstrative language that is above your understanding.
Know, my children, that there is disagreement regarding the time suitable for cauterization, and they consider spring to be the best time.
I say that cauterization is suitable in all times, because the harm caused by the season is absorbed by the benefit obtained through cauterization. Especially if the cauterization is for a severe, urgent, and critical ailment that cannot tolerate delay, for fear that it may result in a greater misfortune than the minor harm brought about by the season.
Do not, my children, consider what the common people and ignorant physicians imagine, that the cauterization which cures a disease will never return and make it a curse.
The matter is not as you suppose, for cauterization is like a medicine that changes the temperament and dries the moisture which is the cause of the ailments.
However, cauterization is preferable to medicine because of its rapid success, strong effect, and intense power.
The disease may return at some time in the future, depending on the patient's temperament, the strength and severity of the illness, the accumulation of humours in the body, and neglect of acquiring proper nutrition, and similar causes.
Unless the disease for which cauterization is used is a mild one, affecting a part of the body with few humours and moisture. For example, cauterization of a toothache and similar conditions may not cause the pain to return, and this will be the case at least.
And as for the common saying that cauterization is the final stage of medicine, it is a correct statement, not in the way they think, since they believe that no treatment will be effective, whether with medicine or otherwise, after cauterization.  The matter is otherwise.
The meaning of "cauterization is the final stage of medicine" is that if we have used various treatments for an illness, and those medicines have not been effective, and then we finally use cauterization and it is successful, this is why cauterization is called the final stage of medicine. Not in the sense understood by the common people and many ignorant physicians.
The ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than cauterization with iron.  They said this because of gold's moderation and preciousness. They said that the cauterized area does not become inflamed.  This is not universally true.
Because I have experimented and found that it only happens in some bodies, not others. Cauterization with gold is better than with iron, as they said.  However, if you heat a gold cautery iron in the fire, you cannot tell when it has reached the desired heat for the gold's redness.
Because it cools quickly, and if you increase its heat in the fire, it melts and is molded, causing the craftsman to have trouble.  Therefore, cauterization with iron is faster and more reliable for practice, God willing.
I have arranged this chapter on cauterization into sections, ordered from head to foot, so that the student may easily find what he needs, God willing.
The First Chapter.
Cauterization of the head: one cauterization.
This cauterization is beneficial for excess moisture and cold in the brain, which are causes of headaches, frequent colds from the head to the eyes and ears, excessive sleepiness, toothache, and sore throats. In general, for every illness caused by cold, such as paralysis, epilepsy, and catatonia, and similar illnesses.
The method of this cauterization is that the patient should first be induced to vomit using a purgative medicine that cleanses the head for three or four nights, depending on the patient's strength, age, and usual condition.
Then, you should tell him to shave his head with a razor, and then make him sit before you, squatting, with his hands on his chest.
Then, place the base of your palm on the base of his nose, between his eyes.  Wherever your middle finger ends, mark that spot with ink.
Then, heat the olive-oil cautery iron, which is depicted as follows.
If the bone has been exposed to the extent of a needle's head or a carbuncle, remove your hand.  Otherwise, reheat the iron, or use a different one if it has cooled. Until you see the bone as I described, then take some salt, dissolve it in water, and soak a piece of cotton in it. Place it on the area and leave it for three days.
Then apply a piece of cotton soaked in clarified butter and leave it until the inflammation from the burn subsides.  Then treat it with the four-fold ointment until healed, God willing.
They said that the longer a wound remains open, the more it discharges pus, and this is better and more beneficial.
Some have said that the skin should be cauterized to the bone, holding the cautery until some of the bone's thickness is burned, then the burned bone should be scraped off, and then treated.
Others said that the cauterization should be intense, affecting the bone strongly, until the bone comes off like a small piece of gold or a small flake.  They claimed that this releases the vapors of the head from that area and that the wound should be left open for a long time.
Then treat it until it heals.  I do not consider these two types of cauterization at all, except in some people, and by a risky method. I find leaving it alone is better.  With all due respect, if the head's natural connections are disrupted, as we have seen in other organs, the head weakens.
Especially when the patient's head is naturally weak. The first type of cauterization is safer and better in my opinion. Use it, and you will be safe, God willing.
Second Chapter.
On cauterizing the head also.
If a chronic pain occurs throughout the head, and this affliction persists in the patient, and poultices, plasters, flogging, ointments, and dressings have been used, especially if the single cauterization we described has not helped, then consider. If the patient's head is strong constitutionally, and not weak, and if he experiences severe cold, cauterize again a little above the previous one. Then cauterize a cauterization on each horn of his head until the thickness of the skin is gone and the bone is revealed to the degree we described. Cauterize a cauterization at the back of his head in the place known as the axe, and be gentle in this one, and do not expose the bone.  For the patient will experience intense pain, unlike the pain of all the other head cauterizations.  I will describe this cauterization in its place.
The cautery used for the horns and back of the head should be gentler than the cautery used for the middle of the head.  This is its form.
Chapter Three.
In cauterizing the chronic fistula.
If pain occurs in the fissure of the head, accompanied by headache, and the pain extends to the eye, then the patient should be purged with medications that cleanse the head, and employ the rest of the treatment that I have mentioned in the classifications of diseases. If this does not work, then there are two ways to cauterize it. Either by cauterization with a sharp, burning medicine, or by iron.
As for cauterization with the burning medicine, take one clove of garlic, peel it, and cut its ends from both sides. Then, slit the painful area of the temple with a wide scalpel, until a space is made under the skin that can accommodate the clove.
Then insert it under the skin until it disappears, then apply firm pressure with a bandage, and leave it for about fifteen hours, then loosen it and remove the garlic. Leave the wound for two or three days, then apply a dressing.
Place a cotton swab dipped in clarified butter on it until the area becomes purulent.  Then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If you wish, you can do this with some of the burning medicines that I have provided in the eighteenth chapter on burning medicines.
As for cauterizing with iron, it is done in this way: heat the cautery iron, which has this form:.
It is called the nail-shaped cautery because its head resembles a nail, with some protrusions and a small knob in the middle.
Then place it on the painful area and hold your hand while slowly rotating the iron, making the depth of the burn about half the thickness of the skin. Then lift your hand so as not to burn the underlying artery and cause bleeding, then soak a cotton swab in salt water and apply it to the area and leave it for three days. Then soak the cotton in oil and treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing.
If you wish, cauterize this vein with the sharp, pointed end of the cautery, and be careful not to cut the artery in this particular, non-chronic vein.
Chapter Four.
Cauterizing the chronic vein.
If you have treated the vein with the previous treatments mentioned and what we have described in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment is ineffective, and you see a cause that cannot be resolved by the initial cautery with medicine or cautery with fire. Then you should heat the sharp cautery until it glows white, after marking the painful area with a line about half a finger in length or similar.  Hold your hand, pulling tightly, once, until the artery is severed and approaches the bone.
However, you must be careful not to touch the jaw, which moves when chewing, lest you burn the muscle or nerve that moves it, causing spasm.
Be cautious and vigilant against the bleeding of the artery you have severed, for there is risk in severing it. Especially for someone who does not know what to do and has not been experienced in this, abandoning the action is preferable.
Treatment of accidental bleeding from the artery will be discussed in its place in the book, God willing, if you see a condition for which this cauterization is not suitable.
If you see the patient's body able to withstand it, cauterize a spot in the middle of the head as described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
If you wish, use the cauterization mentioned in the chapter on artery ligation with the two-bladed cautery, for it is a better and more effective cauterization than this.
Fifth Chapter.
On cauterizing earaches.
If an earache occurs due to cold and has been treated with laxatives and other treatments mentioned in the classification, but the pain has not subsided, cauterize the ear with the cautery called the "point," whose image is this.
Then, after heating it, drop it around the entire ear, or around both ears if the pain is in both. Move the cauterization slightly away from the base of the ear after marking the spot with ink.  The cauterization should be about ten drops for each ear, or thereabouts. Then treat the area until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Six.
In cauterizing the fistula.
The fistula treated by cauterization is of the type that arises from phlegm, as I mentioned in the divisions of diseases.
One should avoid cauterizing the type that arises from dryness and nerve spasm.
If you have treated this type of fistula with poultices, evacuations, and gargles, and your treatment has been unsuccessful, then the afflicted area should be cauterized three times. One at the base of the ear, the second slightly below the temple, and the third at the junction of the lips.
Make your cauterization on the opposite side of the affected area, because relaxation occurs on the side that appears healthy.
The cauterization should be performed with one cautery at the point opposite the upper part of the ear, slightly below the crown of the head, and another in the temple, its length equal to the length of the thumb.
Lower your cauterizing instrument until you burn approximately half the thickness of the skin. This is the image of the cautery, a type of knife, whose image we previously presented, but somewhat gentler, as you see. The knife should have a slight excess of thickness, then treat the area as previously mentioned until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Seven.
In cauterization of chronic stroke.
If the stroke becomes chronic and you treat it as we have mentioned, and your treatment is unsuccessful, and there is no fever in the patient, cauterize four times. One cauterization on each temple, one cauterization in the middle of the head, as we mentioned, and one cauterization at the back of the head, as previously stated.
The cauterization method, as previously mentioned, and one may also cauterize the mouth of the stomach, which would be more effective, then treat as previously mentioned.
Chapter Eight.
On cauterization for forgetfulness.
The one caused by phlegm should first be given large purgatives and cleansing grains for the brain.
Then his entire head should be shaved, and a mustard poultice, as described in the chapter on dressings, should be applied to his back repeatedly, for it is a form of cauterization.
And do this in the same manner as mentioned there.  If he is cured by this, then if not, cauterize him three times on the back of his head, positioned in a line from the top of his head to the bottom of his neck.
Make the space between each cauterization the thickness of a finger. Then treat the cauterization as previously described. If you wish to add more, and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize the middle cauterization.
If you wish to increase it, cauterize at the temples, then treat him until he is cured.  The cauterization should be an olive-shaped one, as previously described.
Chapter Nine.
On cauterization for paralysis and relaxation of the entire body.
First, cleanse the head with the washes we mentioned.  Then shave the patient's head and cauterize one cauterization in the center of the head, one cauterization on each temple, and one on the back of the head.
And three on the cervical vertebrae.  If, in a case of relaxation of the body, more than this is needed, and the patient can tolerate it, and the illness is strong and firmly established, cauterize four cauterizations on his spinal vertebrae. Cauterize deeply until most of the skin is burned, then lift your hand, and treat it as previously described until it is healed, God willing.  Use an olive-oil cautery iron.
Chapter Ten.
On the cauterization of epilepsy.
Only the epileptic whose epilepsy is caused by phlegm should be cauterized.  First, one should cleanse his brain with large syringes and with all other treatments mentioned in the section, if the patient is large and can tolerate the medications.
But if he is a child who cannot tolerate the medications, then use gargles and cleansing rinses for the brain many days beforehand, while also improving his diet.
Then shave his head, then cauterize with one cautery in the middle of the head, as described previously, and another cautery in the back of the head. And on each temple, a cautery.  If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, cauterize with the cauteries mentioned in the section on paralysis and relaxation of the body, on the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the spine.  The cautery should be olive-shaped, according to the method mentioned previously.
If the patient is a child, make the cautery gentle in this way.
Chapter Eleven.
On cauterizing melancholia.
If the cause of melancholia is putrid moisture and thick phlegm, cauterize with the cauteries we mentioned in the section on paralysis.
If the cause of melancholia is an excess of black bile and the patient's body is damp and putrid, purge it to purify the brain as previously described in the section on classification.
Then shave the patient's head, then make a tight cake of linen like a circle, then place it on the center of his head. The patient sits upright holding the cake from all sides. Then take one pound of old sheep's butter.
Then heat it moderately over the fire, as much as the finger can tolerate when inserted, then pour it into the circle on the center of his head and let it cool.  Do this once a week for the patient, along with good overall treatment, until he is healed, God willing.
And if you wish, cauterize him with many small, scattered points, without holding the cautery in your hand, but rather by a kind of puffing or slight touch.  This type of cauterization moistens the brain moderately.
Then apply a cotton pad soaked in butter or chicken fat.
Chapter twelve.
On cauterizing water flowing from the eye.
If you initially observe the symptoms of water flowing from the eye as described in the classifications, then immediately treat the afflicted person by cleaning their head and protecting it from all moisture. Have them sweat in a bath on an empty stomach for several days.
Then shave their head and cauterize a spot in the middle of the head, and then cauterize twice on the temples if the water flows from both eyes, or from one side only if the water flows from one eye.
Then, with the cautery, cut all the veins and arteries under the skin.  The cauterizations should extend along the length and breadth of the temples, and protect from bleeding.
If you see anything of it [a vessel], cut it at the point by whatever treatment is possible. We will come to the wisdom of ligating and cutting arteries and preventing bleeding.
Two strong cauterizations may be applied to the back of the head, under the bones.
Chapter Thirteen.
On the cauterization of chronic weeping.
If the tears of the eye are chronic and persistent, and originate from veins and arteries on the exterior of the head, and you are certain that it is due to excessive cold, thick, phlegmatic humor, cauterize it with the cauterization described previously for the initial weeping. A cauterization in the middle of the head, and two cauterizations on the temples, and two cauterizations at the back of the head below the bones.  If further cauterization is required, apply a cauterization on each side of the eye's tail, at the edge of the eyebrow, with a small cautery iron.
Chapter Fourteen.
On cauterizing a foul-smelling nose.
If treatment with what we have previously mentioned in the section on classifications does not work, promptly cauterize the patient's skull with the cauterizing pot three nights, then shave his head and cauterize the middle area with the olive-oil cautery iron. Then cauterize with the nail-shaped cautery iron, two cauterizations above the eyebrows, slightly beneath the hair. Be careful to avoid the artery—do not cut it.  This is an image of the nail-shaped cautery.
Chapter Fifteen.
On cauterizing relaxation of the eyelid.
If the eyelid is relaxed due to disease or moisture, cauterize the eyelid once with this crescent-shaped cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize slightly above the eyebrows, two cauterizations in each direction, keeping a distance from the temples.  Each cauterization should be the length of the eyebrow.
Do not overdo the cauterization, but only to the point where one-third of the skin is burned.  The cautery should be of this form.
Chapter Sixteen.
On cauterizing the eyelid.
If the eyelids turn inward, injuring the eye, then there are two types of cauterization for it. Either cauterization with fire or cauterization with a burning medicine.  As for cauterizing with fire, you should first instruct the patient to let their eyelids grow out if they pluck them, so that they become long and even.
If it injures them when they are growing, then bind his eyes with a bandage so that they do not move until they grow.  When they grow and become even, place the patient's head on your lap, then mark the eyelid with ink in the shape of a leaf of an as-tree.
Begin the mark near the eyelashes, then place a cotton swab soaked in egg white or in the saliva of the *bazr qutun* under the eyelid, then heat the cautery—this is its image.
Then cauterize in the shape you marked, little by little, in many applications, until the surface of the skin, which is in the shape of the entire as-leaf, is burned.  A sign of your successful work is seeing the eyelid has shrunk and the hair has lifted from the eye's flesh.
Then raise your hand, and leave it for three days.  Then apply a cotton swab with ghee until the scab comes off, then treat it with ointment until it heals, God willing. If any hair returns after a while, and the eyelid relaxes.
Then repeat the cauterization on that spot as you did at first. If the hair is on the lower eyelid, cauterize it until it returns to its natural position and does not injure the eye.  As for cauterization with a burning medicine, instruct the patient to leave the eyelashes to grow long and even.
Then make an image of an as-leaf from paper, then take from the usual soap and quicklime, one dirham or its equivalent of each, grind them thoroughly, doing so quickly so they do not dry. Then spread some of it onto the paper, shaped like an as-leaf, and place it on the one or both eyelids.  Place a cotton swab soaked in egg white under the eye, and the patient's head in your lap.
Place your index finger over the medicine and gently press it, moving it whenever the patient feels the medicine's sting, because it feels like fire.  As long as they feel the sting, leave the medicine and move it with your finger. If the sting subsides, remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
And observe. If you see the eyelid has risen as it does when cauterized with fire or cut, otherwise, reapply the medicine to the area where it did not take effect and did not turn black, until you have completed your work and the eye is cauterized. Then apply cotton with oil until the burn subsides.
Then treat it with the palm ointment or another, until it heals.  You should be extremely careful during the process to avoid getting any medicine in the eye.  If the eyelid relaxes after a few days and we fear something (hair?) in the eye.
Then reapply the medicine to the relaxed area of the eyelid, just as you did at first, and treat it until it heals. This is a picture of an as-leaf.
Know that people's eyes differ in size and age.  Therefore, your cauterization should be adjusted accordingly.  The correct method is not hidden from one with experience in this craft.
Chapter Seventeen.
On cauterizing the fistula that appears in the eye's entrance.
If you have treated the fistula as described in the sections on diseases, and your treatment was unsuccessful, then it is necessary to cauterize it in this manner.
Command the patient to place his head in your lap, and have an attendant hold the head firmly, without movement or shaking.
Then, place a cotton swab soaked in egg white or in the juice of the wild cucumber on his eyes. Then, heat the cautery iron, which is illustrated in this image.
It should be hollowed out, shaped like the shaft of a hawk's feather, on the side where the cauterization is performed. If you wish, it can be perforated on the other end, or if you wish, it can be solid, like a rolling pin, but this hollowed shape is the better for your work, God willing.
Then, squeeze the fistula if it is open, and remove the matter from it and dry it; or if it is not open, open it and remove the pus, then place the very hot cautery iron on it and hold it in your hand until you reach the bone.
Keep your hand slightly away from the eye when cauterizing, towards the nose, so that your hand does not miss or the patient becomes restless, and the cautery iron does not fall on the eyelid and damage it; if you reach the bone on the first cauterization, then do so; otherwise, reheat the cautery iron again if necessary.
Leave it for three days, then apply a cotton swab with ghee and treat it with the dried ointment until it heals. If forty days pass and it does not heal, apply the strong, corrosive medicine so that the bone is exposed, and then treat it as described in the relevant chapter, God willing.
Another method of cauterizing the fistula, mentioned by some early scholars, is to carefully cut the fistula, then insert a thin funnel into the cut. This is its form.
Pour into it, a quantity of molten lead weighing a dirham and hold the funnel in your hand firmly and tightly, and do not move the patient at all so that the molten lead does not drip into his/her eye.  It is necessary to place a cotton swab soaked in egg white or water over the patient's eye.
The lead will burn the fistula and cure it remarkably. If the fistula is cured by the cauterization and treatment described, then there is no need for further action. Otherwise, one must use a nasal perforation and return the fistula to the nasal passage, as will be described in the dedicated section.
Chapter Eighteen.
Cauterization of cleft lip.
A cleft in the lip, called a fissure, frequently occurs, especially in the lips of boys.  If the treatment described in the section does not work, apply a small, knife-like cautery iron to it in this manner.
Make its cavity as thin as a knife, then apply it heated quickly to the cleft itself until the cauterization reaches the depth of the cleft. Then treat it with the *qiyruqi* until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Nineteen.
Cauterization of the fistula occurring in the mouth.
If a tumor appears at the base of the gums, or in the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, then it ulcerates and bursts, and a fistula develops from the discharge of pus, and if treatment is unsuccessful, a cautery should be heated to a size appropriate for the fistula.
Then, insert it hot into the opening of the fistula, and hold it until the heated iron reaches its bottom and end. Do this once or twice. Then treat it afterwards with the treatment we mentioned, until it heals, God willing.
If the matter is cut off and it heals, otherwise, the area must be examined and the corrupted bone removed, as will be explained in its section, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
Loose Teeth and Gums.
If the gums have become loose due to moisture, and the teeth have moved, and treatment with medications has been ineffective, then place the patient's head on your lap.  Heat the cautery, whose image will follow after this, then place the tube on the tooth.
Quickly insert the heated cautery, and hold your hand there for a moment until the patient feels the heat of the fire reaching the root of the tooth. Then remove your hand. Then, repeat the application of the cautery as desired. Afterward, the patient should fill their mouth with salt water.
He should hold it for an hour and then spit it out.  The moving tooth will become firm, the loose gums will tighten, and the putrid moisture will dry up.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On cauterizing toothache.
If the toothache is due to cold or worms, and if treatment with medicines is ineffective, then cauterization can be done in two ways: either with oil or with fire.
For cauterization with oil, take cow's oil, heat it in an iron spoon or a dish.  Then take a cotton ball, wrap it around the tip of a rod, dip it in the heated oil, and place it quickly on the aching tooth.  Hold it until it cools.
Then repeat this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth. If you wish, dip wool or cotton in cold oil, place it on the aching tooth, and place the heated iron on top until the heat reaches the base of the tooth.
As for cauterization with fire, take a brass or iron tube, somewhat thick-walled so the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth. Then heat the cautery iron, place it on the tooth, and hold it until the iron cools. Repeat this several times.
The pain will disappear either that same day or the next.  Following the cauterization, the patient should fill their mouth with good oil and hold it for an hour, then spit it out.  This is a picture of the cautery iron.
Cauterize with any desired end, as is appropriate.  This is a picture of the tube.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On cauterizing pigs.
If pigs are afflicted with phlegm and cold humors, and do not respond to maturation with medications, and you desire rapid maturation, heat the hollow cautery iron, whose image is shown here, with both ends pierced.
To make smoke emerge from the other end during cauterization, place it over the tumor repeatedly, if necessary, until reaching the tumor's depth.  If the tumor is small, make the cautery iron the size of the tumor.
Then leave it for three days and apply a cotton swab dipped in ghee until what was burned by fire is gone.  Then treat it with ointment and lint until it is healed, God willing.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
In cauterization for hoarseness of voice and shortness of breath.
If phlegm predominates in the trachea, especially if the temperament is cold, the patient should first be purged with laxative medicines, then cauterized with a cautery in the neck at the base of the throat in the low spot.
Be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, and burn only half of the skin.  Then cauterize again at the neck joint, at the end of the last bead, using a strong, nail-shaped cautery, in the manner previously described.
Then treat him with what was mentioned previously until he is healed, God willing.
The twenty-fourth chapter.
On cauterizing lung disease and coughing.
If the cough and lung disease are caused by cold moisture, and the patient does not have fever or consumption, and the disease is chronic, cauterize twice above the collarbones, in the soft, empty, depressed areas, and once more in the center of the chest between the breasts.
The cautery should be pointed, as previously described.  If you prefer, the cauterization may be by dripping with the cautery called the 'point', the design of which was previously illustrated in the section on treating earaches.  The number of points should be approximately thirty.
Then treat him with what has been previously mentioned until he is cured.  You can also make a cautery with three prongs, in this style.  Use this cautery quickly, as it allows for three cauterizations in one application.  This is the design of the cautery.
Chapter Twenty-five.
On cauterizing the armpit.
If the head of the humerus dislocates due to slippery moisture or if it is not fixed when put back into place, so that it frequently dislocates and dislocates again with the slightest movement, as we have observed, then the joint should first be repositioned. Then the patient lies on their back or on their right side, and the skin inside the armpit is lifted upward with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint has dislocated inward.
Then the double-pronged cautery, which is shown in this image, is heated.
Then the skin is cauterized with it until it penetrates to the other side. The shape of the cauterization is four cauterizations. It may also be cauterized with a three-pronged cautery, in which case the shape of the cauterization will be six cauterizations, and the prongs are applied on the thinness of the tissue.
This is a picture of the three-pronged cautery.
And one more may be added to this number, making eight cauterizations. Then, crushed balls mixed with salt are applied to the cauterization. Then, the patient must rest and not move the limb for a while until it strengthens.  If the dislocation is upward, it rarely occurs.
Cauterize above the shoulder blade with one good, nail-like cauterization, or with many small, dotted cauterizations; the joint will become firm, moisture will disappear, and the patient will recover.
Chapter Twenty-six.
On cauterizing the stomach.
If the stomach has contracted a cold and excessive moisture, disturbing its temperament, and frequent discharges occur despite treatment with various remedies, then the patient should lie on his back, stretching out his legs and arms, and then be cauterized three times. Cauterize under the breastbone, to a depth of a finger's breadth, using a nail-like cauterizing iron.  Place two more cauterizations below, on either side of the first, so the cauterizations form a triangle, keeping them spaced apart to prevent confluence if they ulcerate.  The depth of the cauterizations should be approximately two-thirds the thickness of the skin, and the pattern should be triangular.
In this manner and to this extent, no more.
And if you wish, cauterize it with one large cauterization in the middle of the stomach, in this manner.
And the cauterizing iron used for this single cauterization should be circular in shape, in this manner.
And the stomach may be cauterized by puncturing, for those who are apprehensive of this cauterization.  This is done by marking points on the stomach according to the desired number with ink, then cauterizing them with a pointed cauterizing iron, then treating it with the previously described treatment until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On cauterizing the cold liver.
If a pain in the liver arises from coldness and dampness, or from a hot wind, to the point that it has departed from its natural state in excess, and the patient has been treated as described in the classification, but that treatment was unsuccessful. Then the patient should lie on their back, and three cauterizations should be marked with ink on the liver, in this shape and exact size, beneath the collarbones, where a person's elbow ends.
And each cauterization should be the thickness of a finger, and the cauterization should be straight along the body. Do not press the cautery iron firmly.
The burn should be about half the thickness of the skin, no more.  The patient should be standing on their feet, or if not able to stand, lying with legs extended and arms raised.  This is the shape of the cautery iron.
You may be able to cauterize these areas with a knife-like cautery iron, if you have skill and care in the craft, taking care not to overdo the cauterization and burn all the skin, thus burning the abdomen and reaching the intestines. The skin there is thin; know this.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
Cauterization of a liver tumor.
If an abscess appears in the liver, and you wish to know whether the tumor is in the liver tissue or in its membrane, if it is in the liver tissue, the patient will experience a heavy, dull pain.
If it is in the liver membrane, there will be a sharp, intense pain with it. If you see that the physicians have exhausted treatment, the patient should lie on their back, and then mark the swollen area with ink.
Then heat the cautery in the fire, the cautery that resembles a file, and this is its image. Cauterize it with a single cautery until all the skin is burned and the cautery reaches the membrane, so that all the pus comes out, then treat it with the treatment for abscesses until it heals.
This type of cauterization should only be used by those whose medical experience is extensive and who have treated such illnesses by repeated practice.  Only then should they undertake such a procedure; to leave it to me is better.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On cauterizing the fistula.
The ancients recommended cauterizing cold fistulas with the roots of the zarawand plant.  One takes a single, long, dry root of the zarawand, as thick as a finger.  Then, it is dipped in oil and held over the fire. Then, apply one cauterization between the collarbone and the neck, and two small cauterizations slightly slanted towards the area below the chin, avoiding the veins, and two large cauterizations above the breasts, between the third and fourth ribs.
And two more cauterizations between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly slanted backwards, another in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach.  Three cauterizations from behind, one between the shoulders and two on either side of the lower back, below the cauterization that is between the collarbones.
One should not apply the cauterization deeply, but rather superficially on the skin's surface, as a cauterization.  Some of the ancients have mentioned that some people use a heated iron implement shaped like a blade, heating it and inserting it between the ribs until it reaches the tumor itself.
The pus will drain, as we mentioned in the case of a liver tumor.  In this affliction, cauterization poses a danger; the patient may die immediately, or a persistent ulcer may form at the site.
Chapter Thirty.
In cauterizing the spleen.
If the treatment of spleen disease as described in the classifications was ineffective, then cauterization can be applied in three ways, each correct: one is to cauterize three or four times along the length of the spleen.
In the shape of the liver cauterizations previously described, with a space between each cauterization the thickness of a finger, or slightly more.  The cautery should have the same characteristics as mentioned for liver cauterization. Do not go too deep with the cautery, and the patient should lie on their back.
The other method is at the elbow.  Lift the skin opposite the spleen, where the patient's left elbow ends. Lift the skin across the width of the body so the cauterizations are along the body.
Then, insert the cauterizing probes very carefully until they pierce the skin on the other side. Then remove the cautery, resulting in four cauterizations.  If you wish, use the three-probe cautery.
Then treat the cauterized area after allowing it to discharge pus for many days. This is more effective than any other treatment mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-one.
On cauterizing dropsy.
Cauterization is useful primarily in dropsy of the abdomen. If, after treating the dropsy with the methods of treatment we mentioned in the classification, your treatment is unsuccessful, you should cauterize four times around the navel and once on the stomach.
Another cauterization on the liver, one on the spleen, and two behind the back, one opposite the chest and the other opposite the stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be approximately the thickness of the skin. Then the cauterization should be left open to discharge pus for a long time.
Do not neglect the patient after the cauterization with appropriate treatment so that the two concerned parties will be united to expedite healing. The shape of the cauterizing iron used for the back is pointed, as previously described, and the shape of the one used for the back is olive-shaped.
Chapter Thirty-two.
On cauterizing the feet and legs.
If they swell in dropsy and fill with yellow water, it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot at the point between the little finger and ring finger.
Place your hand with the cauterizing iron straight, do not bend it, then lift your hand and do not return it, for it will drain the yellow water, and the cauterizing iron will be in this form.
Then cauterize the legs, two cauterizations on each leg, using the sharp edge of the cauterizing iron.  Make the cauterizations along the length of the leg, one below the knee and another below that, towards the middle of the leg.  And cauterize each thigh, two cauterizations on each.
Leave the cauterization open without treatment for a long time, allowing the water to drain, then treat it with the rest of the methods we mentioned.
Chapter Thirty-three.
On cauterizing diarrhea.
If the diarrhea is due to cold and moisture, weakening the constricting and digestive forces in the stomach and intestines, and other treatments have failed to cure it, and you see the patient is strong enough to endure the cauterization, then cauterize a large area on his stomach. As mentioned previously, cauterize the stomach with a circular cautery iron, and apply four cauteries around the navel using a delicate pointed cautery iron.  Cauterize one or two large cauteries on the lumbar region above the coccyx.
If you see a considerable amount of moisture and the patient can tolerate it, cauterize one cautery on the pubis and one on each flank; and perhaps add two small cauteries near the large one on the stomach. This is a successful treatment, whose benefits are unfailing, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cauterizing hemorrhoids of the anus.
If there are numerous chronic hemorrhoids in the anus, or one hemorrhoid, and they are composed of thick, cold humors or corrupted moisture, and the treatment mentioned in the previous section was unsuccessful, cauterize the patient with three triangular cauteries on the lower part of the spine, slightly below the table.
And cauterize under the navel with a size equivalent to two fingers.  If you determine that the patient's stomach has cooled and their food is not digesting, and you see their face swollen, cauterize a large cautery on the stomach as previously described, and one on the liver. And another on the spleen with a nail-shaped cautery.  Leave the cautery open for a time, then treat the patient until he/she is healed, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-five.
On cauterizing warts.
After cutting it, if you cut the wart, heat the cautery, which resembles a needle, then insert it hot into the same cut wart, and press firmly until the cautery reaches the mouth of the vein from which blood flows. Do this once or twice.
If the warts are numerous, cauterize each one as described, then treat them with appropriate ointments until they are healed.  If you cauterize a large area on the cotton, it will be even more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-six.
On cauterizing the fistula in the perineum and its surrounding areas.
If the patient does not respond to the incision and treatment described in its place, and avoids it, perhaps he will be cured by cauterization.  If a fistula occurs in someone and pus and corrupt humours flow from it for a long time, the first thing you should do is measure it with a thin probe.
Then, determine the depth of its penetration with the probe, then heat the cautery iron, which resembles a nail, and insert it hot into the fistula itself, aligned with the depth of the fistula and the extent the probe reached. Cauterize it again until all those corrupted substances are burned, once, twice, or three times, as needed.
And beware of burning a nerve if there is one, or a large vein, if the fistula leads to the bladder or to the intestines.
And be mindful of all these places; you should only do this if the fistula is in a fleshy area and you judge it to be non-perforating.  Then treat the area until it heals. If the area seals, the matter ceases to flow from it, and it remains like that for a time, then know that it has healed completely.
And if the matter does not cease flowing from it, then know that it is perforated, or there is a corrupted bone within its depth, or something similar to that which will be mentioned in its proper place.
Chapter Thirty-seven.
On the cauterization of the kidneys.
If pain occurs in the kidneys due to cold or thick wind, and consequently the patient's sexual function diminishes, it is necessary to cauterize on the loins, on the kidneys themselves. Cauterize each kidney with the nail-shaped cautery that was previously mentioned.  One may perhaps cauterize a third time on the same area, resulting in three aligned cauterizations, which will be more beneficial.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
On the cauterization of the bladder.
If weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder due to cold and moisture, so that the patient cannot hold his urine, cauterize with one cautery below the navel, on the bladder, where the pubic hair begins; and cauterize with another cautery to the right of the navel and another to its left.
After each cauterization, the cauterization should be about the size of a thumb's breadth.  One or two cauterizations should be made on the lower back, if necessary.  The cautery should be nail-shaped, as previously described.
Chapter Thirty-nine.
On cauterizing the uterus.
If a material of cold and moisture occurs in the uterus, preventing conception, corrupting its substance, and making its discharge difficult, or causing pain during menstruation, it is necessary to cauterize with three cauteries around the navel, as mentioned in the cauterization of the bladder. One cautery should be applied to the lumbar region, below the back, or two, and the cautery should be nail-shaped.
Chapter Forty.
On cauterization of hip dislocation.
False humors may accumulate in the hip joint, causing dislocation.  A sign of this is that one leg will be longer than the other when compared.  If you find an empty space at the site of the dislocation, a nearly circular cautery should be applied to the affected area of the hip joint itself.
After applying the cautery around the joint, as if it were rotating so that the joint lies in the center of the circle, use the cautery depicted in the stomach cauterization procedure. If that is unavailable, use three cauteries with the large olive-shaped cautery.
Make the cauterization deep enough to reach all the skin, then treat it until it heals, God willing.
Chapter Forty-One.
Cauterization of the sciatica.
If pain occurs in the hip joint, caused by cold and dampness, and treatment as described in the classification was ineffective and prolonged, then the patient should be relieved of the thick humors with a powdered rotten substance or a powdered prickly pear, or similar.
Then cauterize it.  Cauterization has two types: either with burning medicines or with fire. Cauterization with fire can be done in several ways, one of which is to cauterize the hip joint itself three times in a triangular shape like this.
This produces a beneficial depth.  The interval between each cauterization should be the width of a finger. The cauterizing implement should be olive-colored.  A cauterization could be applied in the center on the head of the hip joint, making four cauterizations in total.  Alternatively, you may cauterize it with the circular method previously mentioned for the dislocation of the hip, with a single cauterization.
So that the circle surrounds the entire hip and burns all the thickness of the skin.  This is the method of cauterization for sciatica if the pain is confined to the hip itself and does not extend to the thigh and leg.
If the pain extends to the thigh and leg, cauterize the thigh twice at the location the patient indicates as painful, and once above the heel (ankle), a few finger-widths towards the outer side.  The cauterizing implement should be a knife-like one, and the depth of the cauterization should be only as deep as the skin's thickness.
If the patient indicates that the pain extends to the toes, cauterize the area he points out with the pointed cautery three, four, or more times as needed. If he indicates pain below the knee towards the leg, cauterize once there with a knife-like cautery.
In all your cauterizations, be careful not to reach a nerve or a large artery, lest you cause the patient a serious or protracted injury.
I have observed cases where someone cauterized above the heel, exceeding the necessary extent, causing the leg to swell to the point that the foot became gangrenous and completely decayed, ruining the entire limb.  Subsequently, diarrhea and death followed. If the pain is in both areas, cauterize them in the same manner.
Some learned physicians have described a hip cauterization using a cautery instrument shaped like a cup made of iron, with a diameter of half a cubit.  The rim of the cup is as thick as a date pit, or slightly thinner. Inside this cup is another cup, and a third cup within that.
The cups should be separated by the width of a thumb's breadth.  All the cups should be open on both sides, and their height should be about one or two thumb's breadths.  A handle of iron, firmly fixed to the cups, should also be included. This is its form.
Then it is heated in the fire until it glows red and sparks, and is placed on the affected hip area, with the patient leaning on their healthy side. Three circular cauterizations are made at once, then the patient is left for three days, after which the wound is bandaged with ghee and the wound is left open for several days.
Then, it is treated with ointment until healed.  The author of this book stated that this type of cautery is rarely used due to its unpleasantness and frightening appearance.  Few can endure it.  However, it is a good cautery for those who can endure it, and for those who have been afflicted in that area.
As for cauterization with burning medicines, it is done by making two cups like the rings into which the hinges of doors are placed, made of copper or iron.
They should have a height of about two fingerbreadths, and the distance between them should be about the thickness of a finger.  The bottom and top should be open, and they are held together in this manner.
Then, place them on the affected hip area, with the patient lying on their healthy side. Gently hold the cup, then pour a little hot, sharp water between the circles. Hold it for about an hour's worth of sand.  The patient must endure the stinging and burning, for it will feel like fire.
Until the stinging subsides. Then lift the instrument and wipe all the sharp water from the hip with fresh water.  Leave it for three days, and apply fat to it until the black marks of the burning disappear.  Leave it for some days until pus runs out, for this is most beneficial.
Then treat it with ointments until it heals. If the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make a mold for it to hold the water, just like you did for the hip. This is the description of sharp water, and I have established it in my treatise on the correction of medicines.
Take one part of potash and one part of quicklime.  Grind them both and place them in a new pot, which has a single small hole at the bottom, just big enough for a rod to enter.  Place another, glazed pot under the bottom of the first pot.
Pour fresh water over the potash and quicklime to cover them by a finger's width, after you have thoroughly pressed them with your hand. Leave the pot until the sharp water collects at the bottom of the glazed pot.  Then gather all of that water and pour it over another, freshly prepared, batch of lime and potash.
Then it will be extremely potent, useful in many medical procedures and for cauterizing other parts of the body, because it acts like fire itself.  Some medicines can also cauterize the hip, such as safflower, baladi honey, and lime with soap, ground up.
Galen, recounting an ancient treatment for hip pain and sciatica, highly praised it, claiming it needed no other treatment and cured the condition in a single application.
Even to the point that a person might be carried into a bath and emerge cured.  This involves taking fresh green shiṭraj, or if unavailable, fresh dried shiṭraj.  Grind it with some fat and apply it to the hip, leg, or thigh where the pain is.
Hold it in place for three hours, or as long as the patient feels the burning subside. Then, take them to a bath.  If their body is damp, place them in a basin. The pain will go away and they will be cured, God willing. If not cured, repeat the treatment after ten days.
Then he will be cured, God willing.  Know that no one should use these cauterizing medicines until the body is emptied. Dioscorides mentions that goat's dung, when used to cauterize sciatica, is beneficial.
The cauterization should be done as follows: soak wool in old oil, and place it on the deep spot between the thumb and the elbow, closer to the elbow.  Then, take dried goat's dung.
Then heat it in the fire until it becomes embers, then place it on the wool and let it extinguish.  Then take another, and continue doing this until the sensation reaches from the middle of the upper arm to the hip, and the pain subsides, God willing.  This type of cauterization is called cauterization with dung.
Chapter Forty-Two.
Concerning cauterization for back pain.
Pain in the back may arise from numerous causes, such as a fall, a blow, or excessive vomiting, and the like.  It may stem from the effusion of cold, damp material.  Cauterization is only effective in this specific type of case.
After the patient has vomited, using a remedy like a rotten herb, he should be cauterized on his back, where the pain is, in three rows the width of the table itself.  Having marked the area with ink, there should be five cauterizations, or more, in each row, according to the patient's tolerance and strength.
The cauterization should be done with a small cauterizing iron, or if preferred, with a medium-sized nail-shaped cauterizing iron, in three or four applications, in this manner.
Chapter Forty-three.
In cauterizing the initial stage of a lump.
This ailment often affects young children.  A sign of its early stage in a child is shortness of breath when standing or moving, and you will find a prominent bead, protruding beyond the other beads, at the end of the spinal vertebrae.
If you see this and wish to stop it, cauterize it with a circular cauterizing iron, in this manner. Cauterize each side of the vertebra evenly. If you prefer, cauterize around the vertebra with a pinpoint cauterizing iron, in two or three rows, with the points close together. Then treat the area until healed, as described.
And remember to use cauterization in the lump that arises from nerve spasm.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On cauterizing gout and joint pain.
If joint pains are due to cold moisture flowing to any part of the body, and if the pains occur in the legs, physicians customarily call it gout, especially.
If cold gout, the cause, is treated with the methods we mentioned in the classification, and the pain does not subside, then cauterization will alleviate it.  Cauterize around the joints of the legs with numerous cauterizations after emesis.  The cautery should be olive-oil based and of medium intensity, in this manner.
And if you need to apply small cauterizations on the leg, do so with a pointed cautery.  If the pain ascends to the knees or other joints, which often happens, cauterize each knee with three or four cauterizations on each side, using the same olive-oil cautery.
If more cauterization is needed, cauterize, but do not penetrate deeply; the cauterization should be only about the thickness of the skin.  If the pain ascends to the hips or back, use the cauterization methods described in their respective sections.
If the pain is only in the hands, apply small cauterizations around the wrists, in two rows.  If the pain remains in the fingers, apply a small cauterization to each joint and on the palm of the hand.  If, after several days, the pain ascends to the elbows or shoulders,
Cauterize both areas (elbows or shoulders) on each side.  The patient should not neglect good treatment and taking medication.  If the patient improves his diet and expels phlegm, he will recover with this cauterization, God willing.
Chapter forty-five.
On cauterizing hernias.
If a hernia appears in the groin, and some intestines and intestines descend to the testicle, and this is a recent occurrence, the patient should be instructed to refrain from eating that day and to use laxatives to evacuate his bowels.
Then, he should lie on his back before you, and you should instruct him to restrain himself until the intestines or bowels are expelled.  Then, you push them back with your finger, and mark the area under the hernia on the pubic bone with ink, a mark resembling a semicircle with its ends toward the upper body.
Then, heat a cauterizing iron, its appearance is...
...until it is white and emitting sparks. Then, return the intestines or bowels to their place, and have a servant place his hand over the spot so the bowels do not protrude again.  Spread the patient's legs apart, place a cushion beneath him, and another servant holds his legs.
And another on his chest, holding his hands.  Then, lower the cauterizing iron onto the mark itself, your hand holding the iron straight, until it reaches the bone; or repeat the process if it did not reach the bone on the first attempt.
And exert your effort to prevent the bowels from protruding while cauterizing, so as not to burn the patient, which would cause either death or great harm.  Know that if the cauterization does not reach the bone, your effort will be unsuccessful.  The cauterizing iron should be appropriate in size for children and adults.
Then, treat the cauterized spot after three days with ghee to remove the harshness of the fire.  Then treat it with other ointments until healed.  Let the patient lie on his back for forty days until the wound is sealed.
His food during his treatment should soften his bowels so the intestines do not protrude during bowel movements.  If he wishes to stand up after forty days, use a tight bandage and keep it on for another forty days.  Reduce exertion, overeating, drinking, and loud noises.
If he follows this procedure, he will be completely healed, God willing.  I will discuss the treatment of hernias by incision in its proper chapter, God willing.  As for a hernia that occurs throughout the abdomen and is new, if you want to prevent its growth, cauterize a circular area around the hernia, appropriate to its size. Let the burnt skin be about one-third of its thickness, then treat it as previously described.  It will not increase, God willing.  Some earlier authorities mentioned cauterizing the hernia with a triangular cautery in this manner.
After marking the hernia with ink, making a line across the top and another to the bottom of the hernia, and placing your hand in the middle with one single nail-like cauterization, the first cauterization is easier and better, God willing.
Chapter Forty-Six.
On cauterizing the fistula.
If, in some organ, a fall or blow causes pain that persists for a long time and is not relieved by medication, it is necessary to cauterize with a pinpoint cautery. The cauterization of each organ should be in accordance with its size, smallness, weakness, and strength.
And if the pain and fistula are removed by the first cauterization, then he is healed. Otherwise, repeat the cauterization, for it is a characteristic of these ailments that they spread from the organ to its neighboring areas.  Therefore, the cauterization must be continued until the patient is healed.
Chapter Forty-Seven.
On cauterizing leprosy.
As for those afflicted with leprosy, they may benefit greatly from cauterization, especially those forms of leprosy caused by the putrefaction of phlegm and black bile.
If you wish to cauterize him, observe. If the leprosy is in its early stages and you have treated it as described in our division, and it has not deteriorated or ceased, and you fear that corruption will affect all of the patient's humors, cauterize the head five times. One in the usual center of the head, the second below it towards the forehead at the end of the hair, two on the temples, and one from behind on the nape of the neck. Apply the cauterization somewhat vigorously, so that it affects the bone slightly.
Scales will peel off, making it easier for the thick vapors to escape.  Cauterize the spleen in the same manner as previously mentioned. If the leprosy has persisted and become evident, you should cauterize the head with the previously mentioned cauterizations. One cauterization on the tip of the nose, two on each cheek, two on the cervical vertebrae, six on the thoracic vertebrae, one large one on the coccyx, another above it on the same table, and two on each thigh. Two on each knee, one on each, two on the shoulders, two on the elbows, two on the ribs of the chest, and cauterize each joint of his fingers and toes, and each heel and wrist.
Preserve the nerves behind the heels so as not to burn them.  A cauterization may be applied to the pubic bone, another to the stomach opening, and another to the liver.  Know that the more cauterizations, the more beneficial and effective.
Know that the patient feels less pain from cauterization than a healthy person because their body has become numb.  The cauteries should be of varying sizes, according to the organs and joints, as previously described for the instruments.
Then treat the cauterization with fine kresna powder mixed with honey and other remedies until healing, God willing.
Chapter Forty-eight.
On cauterizing numbness.  If a part of the body is numb, and treatment with medications, ointments, and dressings is ineffective, cauterize the same numb part with cauteries, according to the size of the affected part.  Let your cauteries be slightly deeper in the thickness of the skin.
Then treat it with ointment until it heals.  Cauterization may also be used for some numbness that affects the hand and foot in the vertebrae of the spine, at the exit point of the nerve that moves that limb, and this will remove the numbness.
Only those knowledgeable about the anatomy of the organs and the exit points of the nerves that move the body should undertake this.
Chapter Forty-nine.
On cauterizing leprosy.
If leprosy persists and no medical treatment is effective, cauterize it with a slight depth, commensurate with the thickness of the skin, so that the whiteness disappears and its color changes.
Then treat it with lentil flour, rose oil,  celandine leaves, dove's blood, or hawk's blood, each ingredient one part. Mix them together, apply the mixture to a cloth, and keep it on the affected area until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
On cauterizing cancer.
If the cancer is in its early stages and you wish to stop its progress, cauterize it with a circular iron around it, moving it in a circle.  Some wise men advise a strong cauterization in the center, but I do not agree, as I fear it will ulcerate, and I have seen this happen several times.
Therefore, the correct approach is to cauterize around it in a circle, as we said, or with many small cauterizations.
Chapter Fifty-one.
On cauterizing the fistula.
If a fistula has developed and is slow to mature, either due to the agent that caused it, or the age of the patient (if they are elderly with little blood), or due to time, and you wish to hasten its maturation, then cauterize around it with many small, dotted cauterizations.
Then leave it, as this will hasten its maturation.  If you wish to further cauterize it, heat the cautery iron, which is of this form.
And place it in the center of the fistula, until it penetrates the skin. Let the cauterization be towards the bottom so that the discharge of pus is easier, then treat it as appropriate until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-two.
On cauterizing ulcers.
Ulcers are nothing but corruption that advances in the limb, consuming it as fire consumes dry wood. If you see an ulcer in a place suitable for cauterization with fire, heat a cautery iron with many small and large nails, according to what is appropriate for the location of the ulcer.
Then cauterize it from every side until all corruption is eradicated, leaving nothing behind. Then leave it for three days and apply powdered sulfur with oil to the cauterized areas until all the scab and all the corruption are removed.
Then treat it with healing ointments. If after three days you see that the flesh grows healthily without any corruption, then leave it alone. Otherwise, repeat the cauterization on any remaining corrupted areas. Ulcers can also be treated with a strong medicine.
It acts as a substitute for fire, providing quicker relief.  I have already mentioned the treatment of ulcers with strong medicine in the classification, so take it from there when needed.
Chapter Fifty-three.
On cauterizing inverted and non-inverted nails.
This affliction, a rough, painful condition, often occurs on the soles of the feet.  Cauterization can be done in two ways: either with fire or with strong water.
As for cauterization with fire, heat a hollowed-out cauterizing iron, resembling an eagle's beak, made of iron, fitting snugly around the nail on all sides and having a thin rim. Then, apply it, heated, to the nail.  Then, turn your hand with the cauterizing iron around the nail until the iron reaches the depth of the nail.
Leave it for three days to fester, then dress it with pounded wild barley mixed with salt and leave the dressing on it overnight. This will cause it to pull out from its roots.  Then treat the wound with a flesh-growing ointment until it heals, if the nails are not inverted.
It often occurs on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet.  Therefore, one should take a tube of copper, or iron, or of eagle's beak, and apply it to the nail or wart. Then, pour a small amount of strong water into the tube.
Hold your hand and rotate it gently, so that the rim of the tube affects the root of the nail.  The strong water will find its way to penetrate the root of the nail.  Let the patient endure the stinging of the strong water for a while.
Then leave it. The nail will pull out by its roots.  Do this to each one individually until you have dealt with all of them on the body.  Then, treat the areas after they have pulled out with flesh-growing ointments.
Chapter Forty-five.
Concerning the cauterization of the scabies.
If scabies occurs due to cold in the nerve, or a quarter fever, or something similar, then you should cauterize four or five times on the back, with a cauterization between each bead, and one on the chest. And cauterize his stomach with the olive-oil cautery, as the scabies will subside and hasten the ripening of the cold disease.
Chapter Fifty-five.
Concerning the cauterization of a boil that has occurred on the body.
Ugly boils, arising from thick, corrupt, cold matter, may appear on the body.  When they first appear, a gentle cauterization should be applied to the head of each boil with a stick whose end has been set aflame, or with the long end of a heated iron rod, or with a lens cautery.
And boils, in their initial eruption, may be cauterized in this manner.  The causing factor will not increase, and the patient will be cured, but it is necessary that this be done after the patient has been bled.
Chapter Fifty-six.
Concerning the cauterization of bleeding occurring when an artery is cut.
Bleeding often occurs from an artery that has been cut, whether in an external wound, or when incising a tumor or cauterizing a part of the body, and the like.  It is often difficult to stop the bleeding.
If this happens to someone, quickly apply your index finger to the mouth of the artery and firmly press it until the blood is contained under your finger and nothing comes out.  Then, place several small and large olive cauteries in the fire, and blow on them until they become very hot.
Then, take one, either small or large, depending on the wound and the location where the artery has been cut, and place the cautery on the same vein after quickly removing your finger.  Hold the cautery until the bleeding stops.
If the bleeding starts again when you remove your finger from the mouth of the artery and the cautery has cooled down, quickly take another cautery from the prepared ones in the fire, and continue doing this one after the other until the bleeding stops.
And be careful not to burn a nerve, which would cause another injury to the patient.  Know that if an artery is bleeding, it cannot be stopped, especially if it is a large artery, except in one of four ways: either by cauterization, as we have said, or by amputation if it has not already been severed. If it is severed, its ends will contract, and the bleeding will stop, or it may be tied with strong threads, or drugs that stop the flow and constrict the blood vessels may be applied.
However, attempting to stop it with a bandage, or by constricting with cloth, or by applying burning substances, and similar methods, will not stop it at all, except rarely.  If someone experiences this and there is no physician or medicine available, they should immediately place their index finger over the wound opening, as we have described.
He should press it firmly until the blood is contained and flows from above the wound and around the artery and finger.  The finger should be kept constantly on it with very cold water, until the blood solidifies and thickens and stops flowing.  During this time, one should consider what cauterization or medication is needed.
The second chapter.
Concerning incisions, punctures, cupping, and other surgical procedures.
In the first chapter, we have discussed every disease suitable for cauterization with fire and caustic medications, their causes and reasons, and the tools and types of cauterization, arranging this from head to foot in chapters.
I will follow the same method in this chapter, so that the student may easily attain what he seeks.
Before I begin with this, you children should know that this chapter contains even more uncertainty than the first chapter on cauterization.
For this reason, caution must be even greater, as in this chapter, the work often involves the emptying of blood, which sustains life, when opening a vein or making an incision on a tumor or puncturing an abscess or treating a wound or extracting an arrow or cutting into a stone or similar issues.  All these involve uncertainty and fear, and death often results.
I advise you against acting on doubtful matters, as various types of people with various ailments may come to you in this craft. Some may have grown weary of their illness and have accepted death.
Due to the severity of their illness and the prolonged duration of their suffering, and because the sickness shows signs of death, some may offer you their money to make you happy in the hope of health, and their illness is fatal. You should never accept help from those with such a condition.
Let your caution be greater than your desire and eagerness. Do not undertake anything of that sort without certain knowledge of the favorable outcome.  In all treatments of your patients, prioritize knowledge and warnings of what the outcome of safety will be.
For in that, you will have assistance in acquiring praise, fame, remembrance, and thanks. May God inspire you, my children, with wisdom, and may He not deprive you of correctness and success; indeed, that is in His hand. There is no god but He.
I have arranged this chapter into sections, following the previous chapter on cauterization from the head to the feet, so that what you desire from it will be easier for you, God willing.
Chapter One.
On the treatment of water that collects in the heads of children.
This ailment frequently affects children at birth if the midwife presses the child's head without gentleness. It may also arise from a hidden, unknown cause.
I have not seen this ailment in anyone other than children, and all whom I have seen of them have hastened towards death.  Therefore, I have seen fit to abandon treatment for it.  I have indeed seen a child whose head was filled with water, and the head grew larger each day. Until the child was unable to sit up due to the enlargement of his head and the moisture increased until he perished.
This moisture may either collect between the skin and bone, or beneath the bone, on the periosteum.  If the moisture is between the skin and bone, and the swelling is small, a single horizontal incision should be made in the center of the head, about two fingers long, to allow the moisture to drain.  This is the method of incision.
If the moisture is greater and the swelling larger, make two intersecting incisions, in this fashion.
If the moisture is beneath the bone, and the sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on every side, and the water sinks inward when you press it with your hand (this should not be hidden from you), then you should make three incisions in the center of the head, in this manner.
After the incision, all the moisture will drain out.  Then bind the incisions with linen and bandages.  Then cover from above with poultices and oil for five days.  Then loosen the bandages and treat the wound with ointments and plasters.  Do not overly constrict the head.  Give the patient a diet of all dry foods with little moisture.
Until the limb strengthens and heals. Another method of incision is to look where the swelling bone and the gathering of water are visible, because it may be more in the back of the head, or the front, or on the right or left.
You should make the incision where the swelling and the accumulation of water are apparent.  You should make the incision as best you can, taking care not to cut an artery and cause bleeding, because the patient will die from that bleeding while the moisture is discharged.
Chapter Two.
Cutting the two arteries behind the ears, known as the *hassisin*.
If someone suffers a severe affliction of the eyes or chest, and medication is ineffective, then the best treatment is to cut these two arteries.
If you wish to cut them, you should shave the patient's head with a razor, then rub the area with a rough cloth to expose the arteries.  Then, you should tighten the patient's neck with the help of their clothing.  Then, look for where the pulse beats, and their locations - the two sunken areas behind the ears.  They are rarely hidden, except in some people.
Then, mark them with ink, and then cut them with a dissecting scalpel, cutting to the bone.  This should be done across the width of the head.  If desired, insert the scalpel below the artery and sever it upward with the cut, and the length of the cut should be approximately two clenched fingers.
When the artery is cut, the blood will emerge with a pulsating flow, surging forward and continuously.  If the artery is not visible to the touch, then it is necessary to measure from the ear approximately three fingers' width.  Then, mark with ink and cut to the bone.  What is necessary...
About six ounces of blood will be released immediately on average, and perhaps more or less, depending on the strength of the patient and the fullness of their arteries.  Then, examine the wound. If any part of the peritoneum remains on the bone, cut it.
So that a hot swelling does not occur, then bind the wound with a linen thread, and treat it with ointments until it heals.
Chapter Three.
The arteries in the temples.
If a person experiences chronic headaches, or acute attacks from sharp humidity and heat in the muscles of the temples, or severe chronic headaches, and other similar conditions, and treatment using various medical methods has been unsuccessful, then we have tried in these cases, cauterizing or puncturing the arteries of the temples, as described.
The method for puncturing them is to shave the patient's hair on the temples, and locate the visible artery in the temple; its pulse will make it clear, and it is rarely hidden, except perhaps in some individuals.
Or, if it is obscured by intense cold, the patient should tighten their neck with their clothing, then you should rub the area with a cloth or apply warm water until the artery becomes clearly visible. Then take the lancet, which has this image. Then gently slice the skin with the lancet until you reach the artery, then insert a forceps and pull it upwards until you draw it out from the skin and free it from the membranes beneath it on all sides. If the artery is thin, twist it with the forceps' tip. Then cut off a portion equal to the distance between its ends, so that it constricts and no bleeding occurs. If it is not severed and cut, the blood will not subside at all. Then drain the blood from six to three ounces.
If the artery is large, it should be tied in two places with a strong doubled thread, whether of silk or bowstrings, so that pus does not quickly form before the wound heals and cause bleeding.
Then cut the excess between the ligatures; do this at once or after some time. If you wish, cauterize it to the bone with a small knife cautery, so that its ends are severed, and this will achieve the same result, or even better, as we have said.
However, if the patient has a fever or is feverish, because cauterization helps to consume moisture, it is more beneficial.  After removing the arteries, the wound should be packed with old cotton and firm dressings applied. After healing, treat with dry medications that promote flesh growth, and use compresses until healed, God willing.
If bleeding from the artery occurs during your procedure, immediately cut it off either by cauterization or by filling the area with alum and applying pressure to your hand until the blood stops. If none of these are available, use your finger to stop the blood.
Apply very cold water to the area until the inflammation subsides and the wound is properly closed.  A less drastic and easier method than removing the artery is to cauterize the vein with this double-bladed cautery after marking the two areas with ink.
Apply it very hot until it reaches the bone, and sever the vein in two places so that the ends are separated.  It will not heal with this cauterization. This is a picture of the cautery.
The two blades are sharp, resembling small daggers, but much less sharp than a knife.  If they were as sharp as a knife, the cold would reach them quickly, and the flesh would not separate quickly.  If they have some thickness, the heat of the fire will stick to them.
This quickly cuts the flesh, and is the best, easiest, and simplest method.  The distance between the blades should be the thickness of a finger.
Fourth Chapter.
For the treatment of persistent, hot, weeping of the eyes.
If the tears are constant and flow from the veins on the skull's exterior, and no medical treatment with drugs is effective, and you see the patient's face has turned red. He feels a tingling sensation in his forehead, like the crawling of ants, and his eyes are sunken and moist, with their edges eroded and eyelids adhering from the intensity of the tears.  Early treatments for this required this procedure, called the "sword treatment."  It involves ordering the patient to shave the hair from their forehead.
Then, three parallel incisions are made in the forehead, extending the length of the forehead. Each incision is about two fingers long, parallel to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, the second slightly offset from the movement of the temporal muscle, and the third on the opposite side.
And be careful not to sever the arteries on either side, keeping your hand away from contact with the jawbones.  After each incision, there should be a gap of about three fingers pressed together. Have with you prepared sponges or many dry cloths to absorb the blood.
Then insert the sharp, double-ended scalpel, which has this shape/appearance. From the incision next to the temple to the middle incision, scrape away all the skin between the incisions, along with the periosteum on the bone.  Then do the same from the middle incision to the third incision. Then remove the scalpel. And insert into the first incision another instrument called a one-sided, sharp, and one-sided, smooth, non-sharp scalpel. This is its image/shape.
Place the sharp side of the instrument upward, towards the flesh adhering to the skin, and the smooth side towards the bone. Push it until it reaches the middle incision, cutting all the vessels descending from the head to the eyes, without reaching the surface of the skin.
Then do the same from the middle incision to the other incision. After a moderate amount of blood has flowed, compress the areas of clotted blood. Then insert a cotton wick into each incision, and place a dressing moistened with a mixture of broth, oil, or vinegar and oil on top of it.
So that a hot swelling does not occur. On the third day, the ligaments are resolved. Use copious rinsing with lukewarm water. Then treat it with a poultice of basil and rose oil, and other remedies used for wounds, until it is healed, God willing.
Chapter Five.
On treating tears and discharges to the eyes from within the head.
When someone has had many severe, persistent discharges, and the eyes appear sunken and small, with impaired vision and ulcerated eyelids, with eyelashes falling out. And there will be a severe, painful ache in the depth of the head and repeated sneezing. Know from these symptoms that these substances and discharges arise from numerous deep veins. The best treatment for this is to have the afflicted person shave their forehead and then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead.
And there will be a severe, painful ache in the depth of the head and repeated sneezing. Know from these symptoms that these substances and discharges arise from numerous deep veins. The best treatment for this is to have the afflicted person shave their forehead and then make a single incision in the middle of the forehead. or slightly raise it transversely and begin the incision from the left temple to the right temple.  The incision should be to the bone. Keep your hand away from the chewing muscles of the temples, until the bone is exposed and all the blood is absorbed by a sponge.
Then separate the edges of the incision with used cotton or linen thread, and tie it from above with sutures.  Soak the sutures with medicine and oil to prevent inflammation.  Once you have resolved it and see that the inflammation is gone, you should rub the bone until the flesh begins to grow on it.
Then treat it with the dried preparation that promotes flesh growth, such as taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of calphonium, and preparing a salve from them.  This salve is used for the growth of flesh in wounds of this type.
Chapter Six.
On treating what falls into the ear.
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four types: either a metallic stone or a semi-metallic stone such as iron or glass; or a plant seed, such as chickpeas, nuts, and the like; or a liquid substance, such as water and vinegar, and the like.
Or, if it is an animal, when a pebble or a similar object that does not proliferate in the ear falls in, expose the ear to the sun.  If you see the pebble, apply a drop of violet or cypress oil to it, then attempt to remove it by moving the head or inducing a sneeze with a blunt instrument. And close the nostrils when a sneeze comes, after placing a bandage of linen or wool around the ear and extending the ear upward.  This treatment often removes the object. If it does not come out, then try to remove it with a gentle, soft material, which is depicted like this.
If it comes out with the soft material, otherwise try to remove it with a gentle, slightly curved blunt probe. If it does not come out with that, then make a brass tube and insert the end of the tube into the ear canal.
Seal the area around the tube with softened pitch, mixed with oil, so that air has no passage other than the tube, then pull it out with a forceful movement. Often the object is removed this way. If it does not come out by the methods described, then take a small piece of mastic or a similar gum used to catch birds, and place it at the tip of the probe.
After wrapping it tightly with cotton, gently insert it into the ear canal after the ear has dried from moisture. If the object does not come out using all the methods described, promptly perform an incision before a hot swelling or spasm occurs.
The method of incision is to first bleed the patient at the temples, letting out blood commensurate with their strength. Then, have the patient sit before you, tilting their ear upward, and make a small incision at the base of the ear near the cartilage, in the lowest part.
Make the incision crescent-shaped until you reach the stone. Then remove it with any available instruments. Immediately suture the incision and treat it until it heals.
If the object fallen into the ear is one of the kinds of seeds that swell and become inflamed, attempt to remove it using the methods mentioned. If that does not work, then take a thin, delicate probe, shaped like this.
Attempt to cut that type of fallen ear seed with it, but only do so if you are certain that the seed has become moistened by the ear's vapor, until it breaks into many small pieces. Then remove it with a blunt hook, a gentle swab, or suction.
As we mentioned, it is easier to remove it.  Concerning water in the ear, the patient should first use a censer to induce sneezing.  The patient should lie down on the affected ear, and fill the ear with some old cotton. If it comes out with this method.
Otherwise, take several smooth, thin stones, warm them slightly by fire, and have the patient insert one into the ear hole. The patient should then place one foot on that side and strike another stone against the stone in the ear.
He should continue doing this with stone after stone until all the water is removed. Water may also be removed by taking a piece of papyrus or feather, inserting one end into the ear, and holding the other end over a fire until most of it burns.  Then use another feather.
Do this repeatedly until all the water is removed, or draw it out with a tube as previously described for the stone.  As for removing an animal that has entered the ear, if it is small, like a flea or similar, treat it with what was mentioned in the section [or: classification].  As for...
If its body is large enough to be felt, try to remove it with lint and hooks. This is easier than anything else that might be in the ear.  As for removing worms that have developed in the ear, if you treated it with what we described in the section on [the treatment of] purulent swellings [or: the classification of purulent swellings] and your treatment was unsuccessful.
You should look into the ear in the sun. If you see any worms, remove them with lint or delicate hooks. If you see nothing, take a tube, this is its shape.
Narrow at the bottom, wide at the top. Insert the narrow end into the ear as far as the patient can tolerate, then suck forcefully.  Do this repeatedly until all the worms are expelled. If this does not work, seal around the tube with wax, as I mentioned to you regarding the stone.
If it is not expelled by what we have described, use the remedies for purulent swellings, which the ancients used to kill worms.  You will find this in the section on purulent swellings.  You can use this instrument to apply ointments and medications to the ear.  This is its shape:.
As you see, you make it from silver or brass, narrow at the bottom with a small hole, wide at the top. If you wish, the tube within the tube can be of solid brass. If you wish, take a reed and wrap cotton tightly around one end.
Then place the ointment or juice, or whatever medicine you want, in the tube that is in the ear. Then insert the reed with the cotton from above and squeeze with your hand moderately until the ointment is driven into the inner ear and is felt.
Administer it to the patient internally.  Let whatever you pour into the ear be warmed slightly over the fire. Be careful that the thing you instill is not excessively cold or excessively hot, as the ear cannot tolerate this.
Chapter Seven.
On treating the obstruction of the ear.
Some children may be born with their ear canals unperforated.
Some people may also experience an obstruction in the ear canal due to a wound or a growth. This obstruction may be deep within the ear canal, beyond the scope of sight.
It may also present slightly outside the canal, and be visible.  Obstructions deep within the ear, unseen, are often difficult to cure. Those visible should be placed in the sun. And examine it.  If you see the obstruction outwardly, open it with a gentle scalpel.  This would be its appearance.
Its tip will have a small, somewhat limited projection, while the rest of the scalpel will be smooth on both sides so as not to injure the ear. If the obstruction is due to a growth in the ear canal, grasp it with a delicate hook and cut it away gently until all of the growth is removed.
If the obstruction is deep within the ear, take a smooth, gentle probe, warm it slightly in the fire, then insert it into the ear canal.  If you feel the obstruction, along with the patient's perceived difficulty hearing, then gently remove it.
Be careful not to injure the ear drum. Then, insert a wick into the ear, fitting the size of the perforation.  Soak it in Egyptian ointment.  Do this for several days until you are sure the wound has closed. Or, take a wick, soak it in water, and sprinkle powdered za'farán on it.
Use it. If you see the ear swollen with a hot swelling, you should remove the wick and replace it with another wick that has been soaked in qīrūtī made with rose oil, so as to relieve the hot swelling. Then treat it until it heals.
If bleeding occurs, soak a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear. Use the other treatments for stopping bleeding mentioned in the chapter on hemorrhages.
Chapter Eight.
On the treatment of warts that appear on the eyelids.
These warts that appear on the eyelids may be moist or dry.  They should be grasped with a forceps or a hook and cut off at their roots with a scalpel, then powdered alum should be applied to the area.
If blood flows from it, cauterize it with a gentle, lentil-shaped cautery iron.  Cauterizing is better after cutting.  It often returns if any part of the roots remain. If cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and will not return.
Chapter Nine.
On the treatment of cold affecting the eyelids.
A condition resembling cold in its severity and hardness often appears on the eyelids.
Therefore, it is called "cold," which is a gathering of thick moisture in the upper and lower eyelid.  If the cold is prominent on the surface of the eyelid and moves in every direction, the treatment is easy.  Make a transverse incision.
Then carefully peel it away from every side until it is released.  Then suspend it with a hook and cut it. If you cannot cut it without penetrating the eyelid, that will not harm the patient.  If the incision is large, bring the edges together with sutures and treat it until it heals.
If it is small, there is no need to worry, for the ointment will heal and unite it. If the cold is inclined towards the inside surface of the eyelid, turn the eyelid inside out, and suspend the cold with a hook, without needing an incision, and remove it from all sides.
If the eyelid is penetrated by the incision, this will not harm anything. Then wash the eye with salt water after the cold is cut, and treat the area with something that will unite it until the patient is healed.
Chapter Ten.
On the treatment of the hordeolum that appears on the eyelid.
The hordeolum is a swelling that occurs in the layers of the upper eyelid.  It appears most often in children. It weighs down their eyes and causes them colds at night, and they cannot look at sunlight. Because tears come quickly to them.
Therefore, you see them leaning on their faces, and sleeping on them.  Their eyelids, beneath the eyebrows, are wet, swollen and puffed. The hordeolum is clearly visible.  If you press the area with your fingers, you feel the hordeolum between them.  The procedure is that the afflicted person should place their head in your lap.
Then, take a linen cloth, and make a wick from it, shaping a circle around the hordeolum on all sides.  Place it over the hordeolum and press with your fingers from all sides to collect the hordeolum in the center of the circle.
Then, with a lancet, make a transverse incision in the center of that wetness.  The incision should not be larger than that of a venesection incision.  As for depth, it is necessary to cut through the entire skin until reaching the hordeolum.
In most cases, the hordeolum will protrude from the incision as a white piece of fat.  Pull it out with a cloth wrapped around your fingers, moving your hand back and forth until it heals. Be careful not to enlarge the incision, lest the lancet damage the eye.
If the hordeolum does not appear upon the initial incision, gently increase the incision slightly until the hordeolum protrudes. Then remove it as described.  Dip a cloth in vinegar and water, apply it to the area and secure it with a bandage. Some people crush salt.
Place it in the incision to dissolve any remaining moisture.  Then treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs at the site, treat it with cooling compresses until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On the types of eye dressings.
If extra eyelashes grow on the eyelid, outside the natural direction beneath the normal eyelashes, and grow thick, they harm the eye and cause various ailments, such as constant tearing, eyelid relaxation, and white discoloration and thickening, which can even lead to the eye being impaired.
Eye dressings are of four types: either by cauterization with fire, or with a sharp medicine, as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, or the dressing may be by cutting and stitching, or with a splint, as I will describe.
You should place the patient's head in your lap, then turn the eyelid with your left hand. If it turns, then insert a needle with thread underneath the eyelid, and the needle with thread pierces through from above, near the hair itself.  Pull the thread upwards on the eyelid.
Turn it with a tool, then cut the inner side of the eyelid without the excess hair using a lancet from the larger incision to the smaller one.  Then, thread the suture and place a small pad of cotton or cloth underneath the eyelid.  Then, bandage the eyelid with a compress.
Like the shape of an asa leaf, except that the shape should be according to the amount of eyelid lifting required, as it may differ between people. Some may need a portion of the eyelid cut according to the amount of eyelid relaxation.
Some need a smaller cut, all depending on the relaxation of the eyelid. Then, make the incision with a lancet along the two lines that you marked, starting from the larger incision to the smaller one. Each incision should be near the natural hair, about the thickness of the tool.
Then, insert the hook into one of the corners of the skin, then peel it all off. Then, stitch the two edges together with a needle and thin wool thread, and clean away the blood.  Apply any adhesive material to the remaining threads on the eyebrows.
You may choose to do this, or not; then the stitches and threads remain for about three or four days, and then treat it. If you prefer, leave the wound without stitches and treat it with something that dries and contracts, as the eyelid will lift when the wound is closed. Stitching is better.
This method of lifting, mentioned by the ancients, is somewhat troublesome for the patient, but is good work and without danger.  Another method of lifting also exists, which is to shape the eyelid like an asa leaf, as we have described. Then, lift the eyelid with three hooks, either separated or grouped in this manner.
Then cut away the excess eyelid with a small pair of scissors, in this manner, making even cuts.
If you cannot hold the hooks in place, or if it is not successful, take a needle with thread, insert it into the center of the shape. Insert another thread near the larger incision, and a third near the smaller incision.  Hold the threads with your fingers evenly, then raise your hand in a measured manner.
Raise the entire marked skin as we described, then suture the edges of the wound and treat it until it heals.  If a hot swelling appears during your cutting or incision, subdue that swelling with *qirrooti* or similar soothing ointments.
The lower eyelid may also have its lashes turn inward.  In this case, use the cutting, suturing, and cauterization with fire and sharp medicine we previously described.  Cauterization with fire or sharp medicine is more gentle and less severe for the patient than cutting and suturing, and is preferable in these cases.
Cauterization with reeds is done in this manner:  Turn over the eyelid, and make the incision from the inside as described.  Then make two thin reeds or pieces of wood, their length equal to the length of the eyelid, and their width less than the width of a scalpel.
Nibble at the ends of each reed from both sides where the threads are held, then gently bring them together over the remaining eyelid.  Tightly tie the reeds from both sides. Leave it for several days, then the tightened skin will die, darken, and decay.
Until it falls away on its own. If it is slow to fall away, nibble it with a pair of shears, then treat it until it heals. When it is rejoined, the eyelid will be raised, and the lashes will not prick the eye. This is the shape and size of the two reeds, made in precisely these dimensions of length and width.
Chapter Twelve.
Removing irritating hairs from the eye with a needle.
If there is one or two hairs, the procedure is to take a thin needle, thread it with a smooth, fine silk thread, tie the ends together with a very gentle knot, and let the thread be about a span long.
Then, thread another, even finer thread, shorter than the first, onto the needle, tying its ends if desired.  The patient should place their head on your lap, near the light, so the work is clear, as it is delicate work.  Then, using the needle and thread, insert it into the root of the excess hair.
And gently pierce the eyelid until the hair is pulled out from above the natural eyelashes, then pull the thread out above the needle and remove the hair(s) – one, two, or three, but no more – from the needle.
Then, pull your hand so that the hair comes out along with the needle through the eyelid, with the natural eyelashes. If pulling the needle doesn't remove the hair, pull the needle downward with the thread you attached, so that the needle comes out from the upper hole.
Then, put the hair back in and pull both. Do this until the hair is raised at the upper hole, and you can see it clearly.  Then, remove the needle and thread, and close the eye; leave it closed for two or three days until the hair is anchored in place and flesh grows over it.
If the hair is short, either add a longer hair from the natural eyelashes so it is raised with it, or leave it until it grows longer, and then raise it.
Chapter Thirteen.
On treating the stye that occurs in the upper eyelid of the eye.
This stye, called a 'rabbit's eye', may be either natural or accidental.  An accidental stye results from an inflammation of a wound, a cut, a burn, or similar causes.
The treatment involves incising the inflammation, separating its edges, and placing a thread of linen between them, tying it off until it heals.  Things that dry and constrict should not be used in its treatment.
If you do this, the stye will return worse.  Instead, use things that loosen it up, such as fenugreek,  soaked in water with a crushed leek, flaxseed, and diachylon ointment mixed with some oils, and apply it to the thread and use it as a treatment.
The key to its treatment is to do everything possible to prevent it from sticking together in its original form.  This method we have described is just one way to improve the stye, not to restore the area to its previous condition exactly.
Chapter Fourteen.
On treating the stye in the lower eyelid.
This stye, which arises from the lower part, is truly a stye and is natural.  An accidental stye arises from a wound, cut, burn, or similar cause.
The method is to take a needle with a doubled thread, pierce the flesh, and pass it from the inner corner to the outer corner, so that the thread is on both ends of the flesh.  Then, pull the flesh upwards with the needle, and cut it with a broad scalpel.
If the eyelid returns to its proper shape, then fine.  Otherwise, take a spatula and place it on the wound; use it to turn the eyelid, and cut two incisions on the inside of the eyelid, so that the ends of the incisions meet at the angles of the incision already made, forming an angle. So that when joined, its shape will be similar to this shape.
Then, remove the flesh, as much as the sharp side is below the eyelid.  Then, gather the separated parts with two stitches, sewing them with wool thread.  Then treat it as previously mentioned with relaxing and softening remedies until it heals.
If the ulcer is from a cut, suture, or cauterization, it is necessary to make a small incision, also without affecting the eyelashes, as mentioned before.  Then separate the lips with softening as described.
In short, for treating an ulcer, whether from above or below, perform the procedure according to the ulcer's appearance.  The appearance of ulcers varies considerably.  The skilled practitioner devises a method in the best possible way.
So that the shape returns to its natural form or approaches it; the disease itself indicates what treatment and instruments are suitable in most cases.
Chapter Fifteen.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
This adhesion may occur in many people, causing the upper eyelid to adhere to the white of the eye, hindering its free movement and its natural function.  A pointed instrument should be inserted under the eyelid.
And lift it upwards or stretch it with a hook, then cut the adhesion with a gentle scalpel, not sharp like other scalpels, but rather blunt, so as not to unsettle the patient during the procedure, and for fear the scalpel may slip and injure the eye with its sharpness; your incision should be as if you are peeling away the adhesion.
And wait until the eyelid returns to its normal position and the entire adhesion heals.  Then, instill salt water into the eye to wash it or instill a solution of  zinc sulfate in water, then separate the eyelid from the eye using a linen wick.
Place moistened egg white on top of the eye.  After three days, use oiled cloths until healed.
Chapter Sixteen.
In cutting the nail and deep flesh tumors.
The nail is of two types: either nervous, resembling a thin, hard peritoneum, or non-nervous, resembling a hard, white moisture that, when touched by iron or attempted to be grasped with a hook, breaks apart.
A hook will not attach to either type.  Both types, starting from the largest part, gradually spread until they cover the eye and block the light and movement of the eye.  The method for cutting them is for the patient to place their head on a rock.
Then, the patient opens their eyes, and you raise the eyelid with your hand.  Then, you grasp the nail with a slightly bent hook, pulling it upwards.  Then, take a needle, thread a horsehair or cowhair and strong thread through it, bend the tip of the needle slightly, and insert it into the center of the nail.
Pierce it with the needle, tie the nail to the thread, pull it upwards, and peel the side of the nail closest to the pupil with the hair, as if spreading it to the end.  Then, cut the remaining part at the root of the growth with a gentle scalpel or small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the growth.
So that constant tears do not result from cutting it.  The nail may be pulled with the hook alone, or with the thread, as we said, then the smooth side is peeled with a scalpel, which appears in this image:.
And be careful not to touch the cornea with the scalpel, lest it cause a tear in the pupil. Then, after cutting, put some powdered salt or black antimony in the eye and leave it until the next day, then treat it appropriately until healed.
If the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert a needle or secure a hook, this type of nail is often treated with medications, and heals as described in the section. If you wish to cut it, open the patient's eye.
Take a gentle, smooth, blunt scalpel, like this image:. And carefully remove the nail from above with it.  If you see that it is crumbling and only affected by the scraping, put some antimony, red antimony, or powdered salt from your container into the eye, and compress the eye until the next day.
Then, repeat the procedure until it is all gone. However, if a hot boil appears in the eye, leave it alone and treat the boil until it heals, then resume scraping until it is healed.  And regarding the inflamed flesh...
If the growth is causing the eye excessive pain, hook it with a forceps and cut off a portion, but don't overdo it lest you cause tears to flow. Then, apply red or black antimony to the affected area until it heals.
Chapter Seventeen.
On the excision of warts and excess flesh growing in the eye.
In some people's eyes, red, overlapping flesh may grow until it covers the pupil or nearly covers, or spills over the eyelids, and sometimes the eyelids turn outward, resembling a rose.
The procedure involves placing the patient's head on your lap, then opening their eyes, and using appropriate forceps to grasp all the red flesh.
Or grasp it with a curette or a spatula, then cut the flesh one piece at a time until it is all removed, preserving the eye from injury during the procedure.  Your cut should be performed using the scalpel described in the chapter on removing ingrown nails, or with small scissors. As you would use for grasping splinters, as their image appears in the following chapter.
If your cutting is complete and all the growths are gone, fill the eye with pounded salt, or instill red, or similar caustic medicines into it. Apply a bandage of egg white to the outside of the eye to prevent inflammation.
If any growths remain, if bleeding is excessive, and you fear inflammation, leave the eye alone and treat it with something to reduce inflammation, then return to the procedure until healing.  Do the same with any excess flesh that appears in the eye of this type.
However, you should avoid treating any weak eye through natural means or by surgical intervention with iron. Do not insert your hand into any of these procedures until you see that the organ is capable of withstanding the procedure.
Chapter Eighteen.
In the excision of things from the eye.
The vessels are red veins that weave across the eye, preventing the sight from functioning and weakening the eye over time.  Therefore, you must first look; if the eye containing the vessels is strong, and there is no other illness except the vessels.
Then, the excision is to instruct the patient to place their head on your lap.  Then, lift those veins with one or two fine needles, depending on your skill, and the needles should be delicately curved in this manner:.
Or two needles joined in one body, in this manner:.
Then, gently excise those veins with a fine pair of scissors, and wipe the blood occasionally until you see that the eye is clear of those veins and the blood has drained.  Be careful not to injure the eye with the tips of the scissors.  Let your work be in the middle of the day in the presence of the sun.
Be very thorough in your work so that you do not cut anything other than those vessels. Once you are finished, instill green or red acacia into the eye, to consume any remaining vessels with its sharpness. If you are unable to excise all of them at that time, then bandage the eye to relieve eye pain.
Leave it for days until the pain subsides and the inflammation disappears. Then repeat the procedure in exactly the same way until it heals.  This is the image of the scissors used to remove them.
Leave it [and let the head of the patient be in the student's lap and another student wipe away the tears and examine the front and back of the eye.  And you]  The primary method for work is to open the eye with fixed or triangular instruments that a student holds.
Look closely.  The patient's head should be in the student's lap, and another student should wipe away the tears and examine the front and back of the eye. You have the option of starting the excision from the top or bottom of the eye.  It is best to first dry the two edges on the upper side, one at the end of the eyebrow and the other at the beginning.
Hold it between the middle and index fingers.  Then, hook instruments from below opposite them.  Then, hold it between the ring and little fingers, and gently lift your hand until you see all of the vessels rise.  Cut them from the smallest section, if desired, with scissors, or with a gentle scalpel.
Insert the needle into the vessels, and examine all the vessels until they rise above the conjunctiva. Do not cut or dry, for tears and blood will smear (mix) with it.
Then cut with scissors what extends beyond the eyebrow, from above and below, so that nothing remains protruding except for the cornea. If you can, lift it away from the cornea with the needle; this is better, and it may be possible in some cases.
If you cut it, it will form a crust for a few days, which will relieve the pain and prevent the inflammation.  Then, resume the procedure.
Chapter Nineteen.
Regarding returning the quill to the nose.
Physicians call the quill a naṣūr. If, having treated it with cauterization or a caustic, burning medicine as described previously, it does not heal, then the only solution is to lance the swelling when ripe and extract all the moisture or pus within it.
Until the bone is exposed.  If the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, scrape it with a tool of this form:
The scraper, called "al-khishna al-ras," is made of Indian iron, and its head is round like a seed. It has a fine, engraved pattern like a file or a scraper.  Place it on the diseased area of the bone and rotate it between your fingers, gently squeezing your hand, until you know that the corruption has been scraped off.
Do this several times, then bind the area with drying, astringent remedies.  If the area is sealed, flesh grows, the discharge stops, and forty days pass without recurrence, festering, or any other incident.
Know then that it has healed, or else there is no remedy but to return the naṣūr to the nasal opening in this manner:  Expose the bone again with iron or a caustic.  Once the bone is exposed, take a forceps of this form:
The end of the iron tool is triangular, and its shaft is a cone narrowing towards the end, as you see. Place it on the bone itself, near the nares, keeping your hand a little away from the eye. Then rotate the forceps until the bone is penetrated and the patient feels it.
By feeling air escaping from it when the patient holds their hand over their nose.  At that point, bind the area with drying, astringent remedies, as I have told you. If the flesh grows and the area hardens, then the matter that had been protruding externally will return to the nose, which will be easier for the patient, God willing.
Chapter Twenty.
On returning the protrusion of the eye.
If the entire eye protrudes, and there is no defect or loss of vision, the patient should be eased, then confined in a bandage, then a cupping vessel placed on the back of the neck without conditions and cupped gently.
Then place on the eye a poultice made from acacia, aloes, frankincense, and henna.  Then the eye is bound from above on the bandage with many bandages. The method for making the bandages is to take many soft cloths and fold each into four layers, making many of them.
Then place them one over another as much as needed for the eye, and bind them tightly with a firm cloth.  Replace the cupping vessel and cup again without conditions.  Then remove the cupping vessel and leave the eye bandaged for a day and a night.
If the bandage loosens during this time, it should be tightened.  Then remove the bandage after a day and a night, as we have said. If you see the eye has returned, then otherwise, repeat the bandage, the bandages, the tightening, and the cupping until it returns.
Chapter Twenty-one.
In cutting the sinew.
If a rupture occurs in the conjunctiva, then it swells and protrudes outside the eyelids like a sinew, disfiguring the person's appearance, and you wish to cut it, then the procedure is as I describe.
Insert a needle into the base of the sinew from bottom to top, then insert another needle with a double thread from the inside out, piercing it, leaving the first needle in place.
Then cut the bend in the double thread, tie part of the sinew around the needle with it and pull tight. Then remove the needle and apply a cloth moistened with egg white to the eye, leaving it until the threads and sinew fall out. Then treat the eye with a strengthening remedy.
Until the wound heals.  The sinew may be tightened from every side with a bandage until the eye swells more tightly.  Then it is lanced with a thin scalpel that reaches the back of the eye, causing the white moisture to flow out and the eye to droop and wither in its position. Then it is tightened until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-two.
On the treatment of abscesses.
This ailment, called an abscess, is a collection in the eye resembling descending water, but without it.  The method of treatment is that the patient sits upright on a chair, and then you grasp their head from both sides with your hands.
And you move it until you see the collection descend downward with your eyes. Then you stabilize it, and it does not move, and the light is released. The patient sees things as he used to. If it does not descend, we know that it is water. If the collection does not descend as described,
Otherwise, have the patient sit before you. Then take a thin scalpel and make a small incision just above the cornea where the adhesion meets the cornea at the limbus, until the material comes out.
If it comes out, instill warm water into the eye, which has been mixed with honey, or water in which you boiled licorice root and honey. Then treat with other remedies until it is healed.
The twenty-third chapter.
We have already described the types of water in the classification, and which are suitable for instillation, with detailed and explained words. Take that from there for accuracy.  Then, it is necessary that the patient sit before you, squatting facing the light near the sun.
Tie and firmly hold his healthy eye, then lift the eyelid with your left hand if the eye containing the water is the left eye, or with your right hand if it is the right eye.
Then, place the tip of the cup near the rim, with a thickness of a date-stone, onto the same white part of the eye, from the side of the smaller aperture. Then, push the cup forcefully while rotating it with your hand until it penetrates the white of the eye and you feel the cup has reached an empty space.
The cup should go to a depth equal to the distance from the child to the edge of the iris, which is the rim of the eye.  The copper will be seen by the viewer as if the eye were seeing it, due to the clarity of the cornea.  Then, move the cup upwards to the spot where the water is.
Then press it downwards repeatedly.  If water descends at once, the patient will see what has been opened to his vision at once, the cup being in his eye.  Then, rest a little. If the water rises, lower it again without removing the cup.
If it settles and does not rise, remove the cup gently, twisting your hand a little at a time.  Then, dissolve some clear, fine rock salt in the water and wash the inside of the eye with it.  Then, apply a moistened compress or wool to the entire outside of the eye.
Anoint it with rose water and egg white, and bandage the healthy eye.  As for us and our contemporaries, we place crushed cumin with egg white on it. If the cup will not enter the eye due to its hardness (because some people have very hard eyes),... Therefore, one should take the lancet called the *bayrid*, which has this form:
Pierce only the adhering tissue with it; do not go too deep.  Instead, lightly pierce the cup's position.  Then, introduce the cup as we described. When your work is complete, prepare a secure bed for the patient, with him lying on his back in a dark room.
He must refrain from all movement and coughing.  Provide food that softens his nature, and do not allow him to move his head to the right or left at all.  Keep the bandage on for three days. Then, remove it in that dark room and test his vision.
Show him objects, and then replace the bandage for another seven days.  You should not do this during or immediately after the cupping, but rather before the water rises quickly due to excessive looking.
If a hot swelling appears, then you should remove the eye bandage before the seventh day and treat it with something that calms the swelling. Once it has subsided, then release his vision. Place a cloth over his face, under which he trains his eyesight for several days while in the dark room. Then...
He is gradually released from the room and allowed to manage his affairs.  Know that the student cannot dispense with observing the procedure repeatedly before undertaking the action.  I have heard some Iraqis say that a cupping device is made in Iraq which draws out water.
I have not seen anyone in our country make such a thing, nor have I read about it in any of the books of the ancients.  It may be a recent invention.  Here are pictures of various types of cupping devices for your understanding.
They are made of copper, specifically, and their tip is precisely this thin, triangular shape with a sharp point.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
In the treatment of flesh growing in the nose.
Various excess growths may arise in the nose, some resembling many-legged scorpions, some cancerous and hardened, dark-colored, and some soft, non-dark-colored flesh.
For those growths that are soft, not malignant or cancerous, the patient should be seated facing the sun, their nostril opened, and a snare applied to the flesh, pulling it outward, then cutting the portion caught with a gentle, sharp scalpel on one side.
Until you know that all the flesh has been removed. If any remains that you cannot cut, detach it with one of the gentler tools, gently, so that no part remains. If blood or a hot swelling occurs.
If it is a malignant tumor, then cauterize it until the bleeding stops and all the flesh is gone.  Then, after the cutting, place in the nose vinegar and water or a drink, so that the nose opens and moisture flows into the throat.
Know then that it has healed. If the moisture does not drain properly, know that there is a new growth of flesh on the weakened bone, higher up than where the instrument reached with the cut. Then you must take a thick linen thread.
Tie many knots in it, and make each knot the size of a finger or smaller.  The patient must manipulate one end of the thread into their nose using a probe, or whatever means possible, to shape it like a button, and pull on it until it reaches the septum.
It will come out through their throat.  Children often do this sort of thing in school; it is easy for anyone who wants to do it. Then bring together the two ends of the thread, the one that came out of the mouth and the one that remained in the nose.
Then use the knots in the thread to dissect the flesh.  Continue until you know that the flesh has been separated by the knots in the thread.  Then remove the thread and apply a bandage soaked in Egyptian salve to the nose.  Do this for three days or more.
Until the salve eats away all remaining flesh.  Then, finally, a lead tube is placed in the nose for a few days until healed. If further drying treatment is needed, use that.
This is an image of the instrument used to instill ointments and medicines into the nose.
A silver or bronze vessel, shaped like a small lamp, with an open mouth and channel.
If you wish, make the tube closed like a reed and flatten the instrument's applicator.
It has a handle at its end, as you see, used to hold it when heating ointments or any other liquid substances within it.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On warts growing on the tip of the nose.
Warts often grow on the tip of the nose, increasing and enlarging over time, until they disfigure the appearance.
Therefore, one should cut it off at its first appearance and completely remove it, then apply either cauterization or a burning medicine, which serves as a cauterization.  If it has been missed until it grows large, observe; if it is hard, stony, dark-colored, and insensitive.
Do not use iron on it, for it is a cancerous tumor.  I have often seen that cutting this tumor brings great harm to the afflicted person.  If the tumor feels soft, not dark-colored, and I see that cutting it is possible throughout its extent. Drain the afflicted area and cut it without hesitation or delay. Treat the area with something that dries and contracts until healed.
Chapter Twenty-six.
On suturing the nose, lip, and ear. If its connection is separated by a wound or similar, know that if a separation of connection occurs in one of these cartilages, rarely will treatment succeed except in some individuals.
Therefore, if one of these things occurs, examine if the wound is fresh with blood.  If so, bring the edges of the wound together with sutures, then treat it until it heals.  If the separation of connection has separated its edges, and each gap is complete, then each gap should be scraped with the thickness of its visible skin until it bleeds.
Then bring the edges together with sutures, tighten them, and sprinkle powdered syagrus and frankincense on them.  Place a plaster of palm ointment, or other adhesive ointment, over it. Leave it tightened for two or three days, then loosen it.
And change the medication, and leave it until the threads come loose on their own. Then treat it with the ointment until it heals.  The method of suturing is to bring together the separation, either with needles as described in the suturing of the abdomen, or with thread, as I have explained there.
Chapter Twenty-Seven.
On removing the knots that appear on the lips.
Many people may develop small, hard tumors inside their lips, some resembling small thorns, others larger or smaller.  It is necessary to turn back the lip and cut each knot and remove it with tweezers.
And cut it from every side, then fill the area after cutting with powdered zea to stop the bleeding.  Then rinse with vinegar and salt, and treat the areas with astringents until the wounds heal.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On cutting excess flesh in the gums.
Often excess flesh grows on the gums, which the ancients called "apholis".  It should be grasped with tweezers or a scalpel, cut at its root, and allow the flow of blood or pus to cease. Then apply powdered zea to the area.
Or one of the astringent, dried powders.  If the flesh returns after treatment, it often does so; cut it again and cauterize it, for it will not return after cauterization.
Chapter Twenty-Nine.
On scraping teeth with iron.
Rough, unsightly scales may accumulate on the surfaces of the teeth, both inside and outside, and between the gums.  They may turn black, yellow, or green, leading to gum decay and discoloration of the teeth.
The patient should sit before you, head resting on your lap.  Remove the tooth or teeth showing scales and sand-like material until none remain.  Do the same for black, green, and yellow discoloration, and so forth, until cleaned.
If the first scraping removes all the impurities, then good.  Otherwise, repeat the scraping the next day, and again on the third day, until the desired result is achieved.  Know that teeth require various scrapers of different shapes and forms, according to the task at hand.
Because the scraper used for the inside of the tooth is different from the scraper used for the outside, and the one used between the teeth is different yet again.  Various shapes of scrapers should be prepared.
Chapter Thirty.
On the extraction of teeth.
One should attempt all possible treatments for toothache before resorting to extraction, for there is no cure after extraction since it is a noble substance.  Only extract a tooth if absolutely necessary.
If the patient is determined to have the tooth extracted, one must ensure that the toothache is fully confirmed. Often the patient is mistaken about the location of the pain, believing it to be in a healthy tooth and extracting it.  The pain does not go away until the diseased tooth is extracted.  We have seen this many times in the actions of barbers.
If the source of the pain is definitively located in the tooth, then one should use a strong forceps to cut around the gum on all sides.  Then gently move it back and forth, using fingers or fine forceps, until it is loose.
Then, firmly grasp the tooth with large forceps, holding the patient's head between your knees to keep them still.  Pull the tooth straight to avoid breaking it. If it does not come out, take one of those instruments and gently insert it underneath the tooth from all sides, moving it as you did before.
If the tooth is decayed or has a hole, you should fill the hole with cloth and seal it tightly with a thin, pliable piece of material, to prevent it from breaking when you pull on it with the forceps.  Carefully cut around the gum on all sides.
Use caution so as not to break the tooth, leaving fragments that will cause the patient greater harm than the original pain.  Do not imitate the careless actions of barbers, who extract teeth without using the methods we have described.
Often they inflict great harm on people, the least of which is breaking the tooth and leaving the roots, some or all of them, behind. Or, they may pull out part of the jawbone, as we have witnessed repeatedly.  After extraction, the patient should rinse the area with a drink or with vinegar and salt.  If bleeding occurs at the site, which frequently happens, then crush some alum and apply it to the area.
Otherwise, if the alum does not help, use a pair of delicate forceps.  The forceps should have long tips and a short, thick handle, so as not to bend when you grasp the tooth.  Here is a description of the large forceps.
They should be, as you see, thick in the handles, so that when grasped, they do not give way or bend. The tips should be short.  They should be made of Indian iron or tempered steel, with the tips firmly joined and fitted with teeth that interlock for a secure grip.
The tips may also be shaped like a file, making them stronger and more precise.
Chapter Thirty-One.
In the extraction of tooth roots and the removal of fractured jawbones.
If, when extracting a tooth, a root has broken off, you should apply a piece of cotton soaked in oil to the area for a day or two to allow it to relax, then use forceps or pliers. Which resemble the beak of the bird called the bulruj.  This is an image of the pliers.
If these pliers are not effective in removing it, you should drill on the root and expose all the flesh with a lancet, then insert the tool which resembles a small lever, this is its image.
Short, slightly thick, and not pointed, so as not to break.  If the root is extracted this way, good.  Otherwise, use the other tools, the image of which is this: The first is triangular, with some thickness.
Another delicate triangular image.
We may also use this tool with two branches, whose image is also this.
And with other tools and instruments mentioned in the inventory of the teeth, we may also use this tool that resembles a large fishing hook, whose image is this.
Triangular, bent, with some slight thickness so that it does not break, and not pointed.  Know that the tools for teeth are numerous, and likewise the other tools are practically countless.  A skillful craftsman may invent tools for himself according to the indication of the work and the diseases themselves.
Because some diseases have not been provided with tools by the ancients due to their variety, if a bone of the jaw or one of the bones of the mouth breaks or rots, search for it in its place with appropriate tools and pliers mentioned in extracting the roots.
And we use a curette, this is its image.
It should have some slight thickness to grip the bone so that it does not slip until the bone is removed, and we treat the area with appropriate remedies. If the bone has a slight rot, remove its rot and blackness until it is clean, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-Two.
In the spreading of protruding teeth.
Teeth, if they sprout out of their natural course, mar the appearance, especially in women and slaves.  One should look closely; if a tooth has grown behind another,
If it cannot be spread or cooled, remove it. If it is adhering to another tooth, cut it off using this instrument, whose image is this:
It resembles a small beak, made of sharp-edged Indian steel.  Cut it in several days, because of the tooth's hardness and to avoid dislodging other teeth.  If it is protruding and firmly fixed, cool it with an Indian file, the image of which is this.
It should be entirely of Indian steel, with very fine engravings, like the file used for making needles.  Cool the tooth gradually over many days, gently, so as not to dislodge it and cause it to fall out.  Then, smooth it further with some other instruments.
If a tooth has broken, causing pain to the tongue when speaking, it should also be cooled until the roughness of the fracture disappears, it becomes smooth, and no longer hurts the tongue or impairs speech.
Chapter Thirty-three.
On fastening loose teeth with silver or gold thread.
If older teeth become loose and shift due to a blow or fall, and the patient cannot eat because they fear the teeth will fall out, and treatment with astringent medicines has failed.
The solution is to tie them with gold or silver thread. Gold is preferable, because silver will corrode and fester after a few days, while gold remains unchanged. The thread should be of medium thickness and thinness, just wide enough to fit between the teeth.
The method of fastening is to take the thread, insert its loop between the two sound teeth, then weave the ends of the thread through the loose teeth, one or more, until you reach the sound tooth on the other side.
Then weave back to the starting point, pulling gently and skillfully to ensure no further movement.  The thread should be tightened near the roots of the teeth to prevent slippage.  The excess ends of the thread are then cut with scissors, joined and twisted together with some material, and hidden between the sound tooth and the loose tooth.
To prevent tongue irritation, and the patient will keep it tightened for as long as needed.  If it loosens or breaks, tighten it again with another thread, and the patient can use their teeth in this way for a lifetime.  This is how the teeth are fixed, with two sound teeth and two loose teeth, as shown.
A single or two teeth that have fallen out can sometimes be repositioned and fastened as described, and remain.  However, only a skilled craftsman can accomplish this.  Sometimes a bone, such as ox bone, is carved to resemble a tooth and placed in the position of the missing tooth. And it is tightened, as we said, and remains in place.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On cutting the ligament that lies beneath the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament beneath the tongue may be a natural part of the human anatomy, or it may be the result of a healed wound.
The procedure is to open the patient's mouth, hold their head in your lap, and lift their tongue.  Then, cut this nervous ligament transversely until the tongue is released from its constraint.  If it is somewhat firm and knotted, as might be the case from a healed wound, then insert a probe and split it transversely until the ligament is severed and the knots are unraveled.
Beware of cutting too deeply into the flesh, as this might sever an artery and cause bleeding.  Then, after the incision, rinse the mouth with rosewater or a mixture of vinegar and cold water.  Place a linen thread under the tongue for the patient to hold in place every night.
To prevent it from re-adhering.  If bleeding occurs, apply powdered alum to the area.  If the bleeding is excessive, cauterize the area with a lentil-shaped cauterizing iron. Then treat it with other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter Thirty-five.
On removing the toad that has developed under the tongue.
A tumor resembling a small toad may develop under the tongue, hindering its normal function, and possibly growing until it fills the mouth.  The procedure is to open the patient's mouth facing the sun and examine the tumor.
If you see it dark-colored or black, hard, and the patient feels no sensation, do not attempt to treat it, for it is cancer. If it is tending towards white and moist, use forceps to pry it open and gently cut it with a scalpel, freeing it from all sides.
If blood flows excessively while working, apply powdered alum until it stops, then continue the procedure until the tumor is completely removed.  Then have the patient gargle with vinegar and salt.
Then treat it with further appropriate treatment until it heals.
Chapter Thirty-six.
On the treatment of tonsil tumors.
Any tumors growing in the throat may present glands within the throat resembling those found externally, called tonsils.  If these are treated as described in the previous sections and do not heal, ...
If the tumor is hard, dark-colored, and insensitive, do not use the knife.  If it is red and its origin thick, also avoid the knife, fearing blood loss. Instead, allow it to ripen, either by applying compresses or by spontaneous rupture.
If it is white, round, and its origin thin, then it is advisable to cut it.  Before doing so, observe whether the inflammation has subsided completely or diminished somewhat.
Then, have the patient sit facing the sun, with their head resting on your lap, and their mouth open.  Take an assistant, who will press the patient's tongue downwards with an instrument, which appears as follows:
Made of silver or copper, thin like a knife.  After pressing the tongue with it and the tumor is clearly visible, take a forceps and pierce it into the tonsil, pulling it outwards as much as possible without pulling any of the surrounding membranes.
Then, cut it with an instrument, which resembles scissors but has bent tips, each with sharply pointed ends.  Made of Indian iron or Damascene steel.
If this instrument is unavailable, cut it with a scalpel, which appears as follows:
Sharp on one side and blunt on the other. After cutting one tonsil, cut the other in the same manner.  Then, after the cut, the patient should gargle with cool water or vinegar and water.
If bleeding occurs, gargle with water boiled with pomegranate rind or rue leaves, or similar astringents, until the bleeding stops. Then treat it until healed. Other tumors may grow in the throat, besides the tonsils, and these are cut in the same way as the tonsils.
I treated a woman for a tumor that had grown inside her throat, resembling a small, hardly sensitive polyp, which nearly blocked her throat.  The woman was breathing through a narrow passageway, and it had prevented her from eating and drinking.
She was close to death if she had lived another day or two.  The tumor had grown two branches that protruded through her nostrils.  I acted quickly, impaling one with a hook and pulling it out.  A suitable piece was extracted.
Then I cut it where it emerged from the nostril, then did the same with the other nostril.  Then I opened her mouth, pressed down her tongue, and impaled the tumor with the hook.  I cut off some of it, and only a small amount of blood was released.
The woman's throat opened up, and she immediately drank water and then ate.  We repeatedly cut away at the tumor over a long period, and it kept growing back what we removed, thus extending the treatment for both of us.
I devised a method and cauterized the tumor inside her throat, which stopped its growth.  Then I left the area and do not know what God did for her after I departed.
Chapter Thirty-Seven.
On cutting a tumor of the larynx.
If a tumor, called *'unaba'* descends to the larynx and swells, being white and oblong, it is called a *'amud'*; if it is thick at the bottom and round, it is called *'unaba'*.  If treated as described in the classification and the treatment does not succeed...
If the hot tumor has subsided and is thin, it should be cut.  If it is a collected, round mass without length, and is blood-red, or dark-coloured, or black, or without sensation, it should be avoided.
There is risk to the patient.  Therefore, if it is as described, white and long, the patient should sit facing the sun, and the tongue should be pressed down with the instrument previously described, then the snare should be inserted into the *'unaba'*.
Pull it downwards and cut it with one of the two instruments mentioned in the section on cutting the tonsils.  Only the excess beyond the natural state should be cut, without more, for if you cut more, you will harm the voice and speech.
Then, after cutting, use what we described in the section on cutting the tonsils and treat it until it heals.  If the patient refuses the cutting, then use the cauterization technique without fear or caution.  The method of cauterization involves a sharp medicine, and the head of the patient should be placed on your lap.
Then, press down the patient's tongue with the instrument we mentioned, then take the sharp water mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, mix it with quicklime, not extinguished, and make it neither thick nor thin, and fill the concavity of this instrument.  This is its image/form.
The tip of the instrument, where you place the medicine, has a concavity like the concavity of a marud spoon.  Place the instrument with the medicine on the throat itself, and the patient should lie on their side so that saliva runs out of the mouth from inside the throat, so that nothing goes down the throat and hurts them.
Then, hold the instrument with the medicine and press it on the throat for about half an hour until you see it has turned black and the burning of the medicine subsides.  If you wish, take a piece of cotton, wrap it around the tip of a marud spoon, and soak the cotton in the medicine.
Insert the marud spoon with the cotton into the opening from above so that the cotton adheres to the throat.  Do this repeatedly until you achieve the desired degree of cauterization of the ulcer. Then leave it; it will wither and fall off in three or four days. If you need to repeat the medicine, do so.
After the cauterization, wipe around the ulcer with cotton soaked in clarified butter, removing any remaining medicine.  Then, rinse with cool water and treat externally with lotions, and internally with gargles, until it heals. This type of treatment is safer than cutting and avoids fear.
The throat can also be treated with methods gentler than cauterization and cutting, such as fumigation.  Take frankincense, zofah, savory, wormwood, safflower, chamomile, and similar herbs. Gather them all, or some of them, in a pot and immerse them in vinegar.
Bring it to a boil, with the pot sealed with clay.  A hole is made in the center of the cover, over which the hollow instrument is placed.  This instrument is made of silver or copper.
Insert the end with the pomegranate into the patient's mouth so that the vapor rises to the throat through the tube until the throat is healed. Then repeat several times until it withers.  Be careful not to use this treatment at the onset of the swelling.
For it often aggravates the swelling.  Instead, it should be done when the hot swelling has subsided. If you do not have this instrument, take a tube and attach a hard-boiled egg shell to its end, so as to prevent the patient's mouth from burning.
Because the egg shell prevents the heat of the vapor from burning the mouth. This is a good and safe treatment.
Chapter Thirty-eight.
On removing thorns and other foreign objects lodged in the throat.
Thorns, fish bones, or other objects often lodge in the throat.  One should remove any visible ones with the instrument, pressing the tongue with it in the light.
To see what is in the throat.  If something is hidden in the throat and cannot be seen, the patient should vomit before their food has digested in their stomach.  Perhaps the lodged object will come out with the vomit, or the patient may swallow a piece of a twig or a piece of lettuce stalk.
Or a piece of dry bread might be swallowed.  Or a piece of soft sea sponge is taken, tied to a thread, and swallowed.  If it reaches the place of the thorn, pull the thread quickly.  Repeat this several times.
Often the thorn or bone adheres to it and comes out.  If it does not come out by the methods described, use a lead instrument like this...
It is slightly thicker than a stylus.  At the tip, there is a curve. The patient, holding their head up, gently inserts it into their throat, avoiding touching their larynx to prevent coughing, and pushing the bone or thorn out.  Or the physician inserts it with their hand.
Having the patient insert it is better, as they know the location of the lodged object.  They push it downward or pull with the instrument upward, as best they can until it comes out.
Chapter Thirty-nine.
Removing a leech lodged in the throat.
If treating the leech with the medications mentioned in the classifications did not work, then examine the patient's throat in the light of the sun after pressing their tongue down with the instrument that I described to you.
If you see the leech, pull it out with a small hook or a gentle, secure forceps. If that is not possible, take a hollow tube, insert it into the patient's throat near the leech, and then insert a heated iron into the tube.
Do this several times. The patient should abstain from drinking water all day, then take a bowl filled with cool water, open their mouth over it, and gargle without swallowing a drop.  Move the water back and forth with their hand periodically.
If the leech feels the water, it will fall off. If it does not come out with the method described, fumigate the throat with urine and hellebore using the instrument described for fumigation of the larynx. Do this several times; this will cause it to fall off.
The method for fumigation is to take a vessel containing embers heated by fire, covered with a lid having a hole in the center.  Insert the end of the instrument into the hole. Place the incense in the vessel. The patient places their mouth on the end of the tube and closes their mouth tightly to ensure the incense reaches their throat.
The leech will fall off at this point. If it does not, the fumigation is repeated several times. The patient must endure thirst and eat salty food and garlic, but not drink any water.  The leech must come out with this procedure. This is an illustration of the instrument used to pull the leech from the throat if it is seen.
It resembles pliers, as you see, except for this curve that enters the throat. Its ends are like a bird's beak, with the roughness of an emery board.  If it bites something, it does not let go.
Another instrument is used to restrain the tongue.  It is a wide ring of iron, the size of the mouth, positioned above the tongue. It is inserted into the mouth, lying on its side, keeping the mouth open against the patient's will.  The patient cannot remove it until it is removed.
Description of the instrument that opens the mouth in this exact manner.
Chapter Forty.
It discusses the lancing and incision of tumors.
Tumors are of many varied types, as will be described one by one in this book.  They differ in lancing and incision in two ways: one is the nature of the tumor itself and the humors it contains.
The second type [of difference] is from the locations in the body where they occur, because a tumor arising in the head is different from one arising in the buttocks, and a tumor in a fleshy area differs from one in a joint; each has its own operative procedure.
Some tumors should not be lanced until the pus has matured and is fully formed; others, such as those close to joints, should be lanced while still unripe and not fully matured.
Because if a tumor occurs near a joint and spreads until it affects the surrounding tissues, it may damage the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing weakness or paralysis of that limb, or the tumor may be near a vital organ.
Because if you delay lancing it until it matures, you will damage the vital organ, or if it is near the buttocks, you should lance it while unripe.  You should lance a tumor that is unripe and near the buttocks to prevent the infection from spreading deep into the rectum and causing a fistula.
The condition may become incurable.  You should know when to lance fully matured tumors, which is when the tumor pain subsides, the fever disappears, redness and pulsation diminish, the tumor head softens, and other symptoms subside.
The incision should be made at the lowest part of the tumor, if possible, for easier drainage downwards, or at the thinnest and most prominent part of the tumor.  If the tumors are on the hands or feet, the incision should run along the length of the limb.
The incision should be made in the muscles, tendons, nerves, and arteries, and generally in all flat, non-flexed areas.  For areas that are flexed, the incision should be made according to the specific location.  If the tumor is in a fleshy area, it is better to leave it unlanced.
Until its maturity is complete, as we said. If you lance it before that, the pus will drain excessively, causing considerable harm and filth, and perhaps its edges and cavity will become hard. Some tumors may need a transverse incision, depending on the extremity, if necessary.
For small tumors, a single incision should be used; for large tumors, a wide incision or multiple incisions, in proportion to the size of the tumor.  Some tumors may require skin excision or incision if they have become like a perforated pouch.
Some have developed a dead or necrotic appearance, like many abscesses and cysts. Some are incised with a three-sided opening, while others are excised in the shape of a rue leaf, such as a hernia.
Some tumors require a circular or crescent-shaped incision, and similar cuts. Tumors without a head, such as smooth, flat tumors, should only be lanced with a simple incision. If the tumor is large and has accumulated pus over a long period, and you have lanced it, do not rush to drain all the pus at once.
Instead, drain some of it, and then compress the tumor for another day, and then drain some more pus. Repeat this process gradually until all of it is removed.
Especially if the patient is weak, a pregnant woman, a young child, or an elderly person, the vital spirit is often weakened by sudden pus discharge.  The patient may die unexpectedly; therefore, exercise extreme caution in these cases.
After lancing these tumors, you should clean and examine the wound. If the tumor wound is small or the incision simple, use a bandage made of linen or old cotton.  If the tumor is large and there are multiple incisions,
You should insert a thread into each incision, so that some of them connect. If part of the skin has been cut or eroded by the tumor, you should fill it with old cotton or linen strips without moisture and bandage it for three days.
Then remove it and treat it with appropriate ointments until it heals. If bleeding occurs during your work, use cold water and vinegar, after soaking a linen cloth in them, and apply it to the bleeding area repeatedly.
If bleeding persists, you should use the treatment and remedies described in many places in this book and in the classification.  If it is winter and the tumor area is richly supplied with nerves, you should wet the dressings with warm water and oil.
And place them on the affected area. If it is summer and the areas are fleshy, you should apply dressings soaked in water and oil, or water and cool oil, until, as we said, the third day. Then, you should undo the bandage and clean the tumor.
Use similar treatments until it heals.  This is the general knowledge you need for treating tumors. As for detailed methods, every tumor's treatment is described in a summarized, categorized manner.
Chapter Forty-One.
On the incision of tumors that appear on the scalp.
Small tumors appear on the scalp, which are a type of swelling containing sacs.  They resemble a hen's egg sac and come in various types, including fatty ones and those containing moisture resembling mud.
Some contain moisture like mush or soup, and others are hard and stony.  All of them are harmless to incise and remove, unless an artery is encountered during the incision.
The procedure for incision is to first probe it with the instrument whose image will follow, called the *midas*, so that you know what it contains. If it contains moisture, incise it lengthwise with a simple incision, like this:
Begin the incision from line ~b~ to line ~c~. If the moisture has drained, dissect the sac containing the moisture and remove it entirely, leaving nothing behind.  Often it returns if any is left.
Then, dip a piece of cotton in the astringent ointment, if available, or in salt water, and fill the wound with it. Leave it for another day, as it will consume any remaining sac tissue. Then, reapply the cotton with the astringent a second and third time if needed.
Until you are certain that no part of the sac remains. Then treat the wound with ointments until healed. If the swelling contains fatty tissue, incise it in this manner:
Make a cross-shaped incision, and place forceps on the edges of the wound.  Dissect it from all sides, and make every effort to remove the peritoneum containing it. If an artery is encountered, do as described previously.  Also, do this with the swelling if it is hardened from the incision.
The treatment is the same as mentioned.  Incising hardened swellings is easier, because they contain little blood and moisture. Some of these swellings, in the head of some people, contain no moisture at all. I incised a swelling in...
the head of an old woman and found the swelling as hard as solid, rough, white stone. No one could break it, even if they threw it, it would only splinter.  Other swellings on the head, unlike this one, such as those found in the heads of children, are different.
At the roots of the ears, make a simple incision in all of them, and cut along the bottom so that the material flows downwards more easily. Then treat it with the appropriate treatment.
Chapter Forty-two.
Concerning the incision of swine-like tumors that often appear on the neck. These tumors frequently appear on the neck, under the armpits, and in the groins, and may appear elsewhere on the body.  One may appear on the neck, or there may be many, and some arise from others.
Each such tumor is contained within its own membrane, like the swellings and tumors of the head, as we have described.  These tumors are of many types: some are stony, some contain moisture, and some are malignant, not responding to treatment.
Of those I saw, some were pleasing to the touch, their surface appearing close to the color of skin, and movable in all directions. They were not attached to the neck's nerves, veins, or arteries, nor were they deeply embedded. Therefore, it should be incised simply from top to bottom of the body, in this manner, from line ~J~ to line ~B~.
Peel it away from all sides, stretching the edges of the skin with a hook or two, or many hooks if necessary, as we have said for tumors of the head.  Remove it little by little, being careful not to cut any vein or nerve.  The scalpel should not be overly sharp.
So that your hand does not make more cuts or cause the patient distress, and you do not cut what is unnecessary. If you cut a vein or artery and are unable to proceed, apply powdered styptic or some of the astringents that stop bleeding to the wound.
Close the wound and leave it until the inflammation subsides, the wound relaxes, and it begins to fester.  The bleeding will stop at that point, so continue with your work until you are finished.  Then, probe with your index finger to see if there are any remaining, small, similar tumors.  Cut and remove them.
If there is a large vein at the base of the tumor, it should not be cut from its base. Instead, it should be tied with a strong double thread and left to fall away of its own accord without causing harm.  Then, fill the wound with used cotton that has been soaked in Egyptian ointment, and then treat it.
If you have cut the entire tumor, then you should bring the edges of the wound together and stitch it immediately after confirming that there is no remaining excess.  However, if you see that excess remains, due to the size of the tumor, then...
In that case, you must aim to cut the base and origin of the tumor, and use the stitching and other methods that we have described.  For tumors containing moisture, apply a simple compress where you see the area of ripening.  Place the compress beneath, as we have said.
Then, after the compress, apply bandages soaked in Egyptian ointment, or similar, to consume any remaining corruption.  Once you see that the wound is clean, treat it with ointments that promote healing until it is healed.
Chapter Forty-three.
On the incision of the throat for a tumor occurring within the throat.
The ancients mentioned this incision of the throat, but I have not seen anyone in our country perform it, and this follows their words.  However, those suffering from quinsy should avoid incision of the throat, as it will not benefit them.
In order that all the tumors and lungs may be diseased, and for those with a hot tumor in the mouth, throat, or tonsils, if there is no problem in the trachea, incision of the throat should be used to escape the harm caused by suffocation.
Therefore, if we wish to do this, we should incise the throat below three rings of the trachea, or four small transverse incisions between two rings, to the extent of the incision in the diaphragm, not in the cartilage.  This location is suitable for the incision.
Because it is devoid of flesh and its blood vessels are distant, if the surgeon is timid, he should stretch the throat skin with a hook, then cut the skin until, if he reaches the trachea, he should avoid the blood vessels if he sees any.
Then he should cut the diaphragm which we described, and he should determine the incision of the trachea from the phlegm that emerges from it, along with what is punctured, and from the cessation of sound.  He should leave the wound open for a time.  And when the time of fear of suffocation has passed, he should bring the edges of the wound together from the skin.
Then he should suture it alone, without the cartilage.  Thereafter, the remedies which promote flesh growth should be used until it heals.  Said the author of this book: The explanation of this passage which we have recounted is that if they see the patient with his throat obstructed by one of these tumors which we have mentioned...
When the patient was near death, and he feared imminent death, they would go to incising the throat, so that the patient might breathe somewhat through the wound and thus escape death.  They were instructed to leave the wound open until the disease's course was completed, which would be about three days or so.
Then they instructed to suture the wound and treat it until it healed.  What I witnessed myself, a servant took a knife and slashed her throat, cutting some of her lung's trachea.  I was summoned to treat her. I found her weakening, as a slaughtered animal does.  I uncovered the wound.
I found little blood coming from the wound, so I realized she had not cut an artery or vein. Air was escaping from the wound.  I quickly sutured the wound and treated it until she healed.  Nothing further happened to the servant except a slight hoarseness in her voice.
And after a few days, she returned to her best condition.  From this, we say that incising the throat is not dangerous.
Chapter Forty-Four.
On incision of the tumor appearing on the larynx from the outside, called the laryngeal tumor.
This tumor, called a laryngeal tumor, is a large tumor the color of the body, and is common in women. It comes in two types.
Either it is natural or it is accidental; as for the natural one, there is no remedy.  As for the accidental one, it is of two kinds; one resembling fatty tumors, and the other resembling the tumor that arises from arterial complication.  Incising it is dangerous. Therefore, it is not appropriate to use iron on it at all, unless it is small.  If you probe and investigate it with a probe and find it resembles a fatty tumor and is not connected to any blood vessels, then incise it as you would a tumor. And remove it with the sac it is contained in, if it is in a sac; otherwise, remove it entirely. Then treat the area with the appropriate treatment.
Chapter Forty-five.
On incising various tumors.
Tumors are of many kinds, and all their types have been mentioned in the classification.  Here, it is necessary to explain the difference between a tumor and an abscess, since it is problematic.  I say that an abscess is accompanied by heat, fever, and terrifying pain until the boil's fervor subsides. And when the pus is complete, the fever and intensity subside. A tumor is not accompanied by heat, fever, or pain. It is enclosed in a serous sac, a special covering, and is the same color as the body.  Its beginning is like a boil and it becomes like a grape, larger or smaller.
And it is of two types: either fatty or containing moisture. The colors of moisture are numerous, as mentioned in the classification. Therefore, when treating a tumor, one must first probe and examine it with the instrument called the probe, as its image will be shown in the chapter after this one.
Estimate the size of the tumor, then withdraw the probe and observe what follows. If a flowing moisture of any color emerges, make a simple incision, as described in other tumors. If no moisture follows the probe, know it is fatty.
Make a firm incision on it in this manner, as I have instructed you, and suspend it with hooks. Carefully dissect the skin from all sides and, if possible, remove the sac intact along with the tumor.
If the sac is punctured during the procedure and you cannot remove it whole, which often happens, remove it piece by piece until nothing remains.  If any part remains, small or large, the tumor will likely recur.
If you are overcome and a small portion remains, cauterize the wound with sharp cautery after you're finished.  Then, suture the wound and apply something to soothe the inflamed tumor. Treat it with other remedies until healed. If the tumor is large, stitch its edges and treat them with something that promotes healing.
If a bleeding vessel, whether pulsing or not, obstructs you, immediately apply powdered alum to the affected area.  Leave it applied for two or three days until the wound has suppurated and the bleeding subsides.  Then return to removing any remaining tumor tissue.
Chapter Forty-six.
In the forms of instruments.
Which operate on the fissure and the wound, among them are the forms of probes, which are three types: large, medium, and small.
Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
Made of tempered iron, square-ended and tight to facilitate quick entry into tumors.  These are the images of probes, also called "cold" instruments, and come in three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large probe.
Image of a medium probe.
Image of a small probe.
Suitable for exploring tumors, wounds, fistulas, and cavities to discover bones or other things inside.  It is made round, polished, and smooth like whetstones, from Chinese bronze, or from espadrilles, or from copper, or from iron, or from silver. The best of these are made from espadrilles.
Probes may also be made of black lead, and are suitable for probing fistulas that have a winding curvature, as its flexibility will follow those windings.  These are also three types: long, medium, and short.
According to the needs of each fistula's depth, its thickness should match the fistula's width and narrowness.  Image of a large lead probe.
Image of a medium lead probe.
Image of a small lead probe.
Images of forceps, which are numerous types.  Some are simple, meaning they have one hook; these come in three sizes: large, medium, and small.  There are also blind forceps, which come in three types.  There are also forceps with two hooks, which come in three types.  And there are curved forceps with two hooks. There are three types of these.  There are also forceps with three hooks, which come in three types.  All these types require their own specific location.  Image of a large, simple forceps. Image of a medium-sized simple forceps. Image of a small simple forceps.
Image of a large blind forceps. Image of a medium-sized blind forceps.
Image of a small blind forceps.
Image of a large forceps with two hooks. Image of a medium-sized forceps with two hooks. Image of a small forceps with two hooks.
Image of a large forceps with three hooks.
Image of a medium-sized forceps with three hooks. Image of a small forceps with three hooks.
These are images of scalpels used to cut and dissect tissues and tumors.  There are three types, large, medium, and small. Image of a large scalpel.
Image of a medium-sized scalpel.
Image of a small scalpel.
Its blades, with which it cuts, are limited, and the other ends are not limited, but are made this way so that they can be used to dissect tissue when there is fear of cutting a nerve or artery, and so that the patient may have a little relief from the burning sensation that results from the excision of a tumor.
These are images of retractors, which are of three types: large, medium, and small. Image of a large retractor.
It is made of polished copper, like that used for kohl, and on one end, a wide, spoon-like shape made of two layers, with the scalpel blade concealed within its head, resembling a bird's tongue, which moves in and out as desired.
Images of the scalpels that are used between the fingers when removing tumors, and are not felt by the patient.  There are three types, large, medium, and small.  Image of a large scalpel.
Images of leeches used to cut off bleeding. There are three types, large, medium, and small.  Image of a large leech.
They are made of copper or china, slightly elongated and rounded, as you see.  And thin.  You should have these leeches, large and small, to cut blood quickly when necessary, and when no medicine is available.
But they are not used to cut blood in every part of the body, but rather in fleshy areas such as the muscles of the leg, thigh, arm, breast, abdomen, groin, and similar fleshy, moist organs.
And other small instruments can be made from them, resembling pistachio shells in this shape.
Blood is cut with them if it flows from a phlebotomy site, or when a vein or artery is cut.  It can also be made round, in this shape.
Chapter forty-seven.
In the treatment of the male breast.
The breast of some men, resembling that of women, may swell at the time of puberty, becoming swollen and unsightly.  Therefore, if one dislikes this, it is necessary to incise the breast with a crescent-shaped incision, of this form.
From line ~B~ to line ~C~. Then scrape away all the fat, then fill the wound with the medicated plaster, then stitch the edges of the wound together and treat it until it heals.  If the breast droops and relaxes due to weakness in the underlying structure, as occurs in women.
Therefore, it is necessary to make incisions in its upper sides, in the form of two crescent-shaped incisions, each of which connects to the other at their ends, so that the larger line encircles the smaller one, in this manner. From line ~B~ to line ~C~, then the skin between the incisions is scraped, the fat is removed, and the previously mentioned sutures, astringents, and necessary treatment are applied until it heals.
If you are unable to remove all that needs to be removed, either due to the patient's distress or bleeding, you should fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it until it consumes the remaining fat, then treat it until it heals.
Chapter Forty-Eight.
On treating tumors that appear under the armpit.
These tumors that appear under the armpit are of the swine type, hard and contained within a cyst. Some contain moisture. Those containing moisture should be incised with a crescent-shaped incision, like this.
From line ~b~ to line ~c~.  If all the moisture in the tumor has been discharged, absorb it with worn-out cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove the cotton.
And treat it with the appropriate ointment until it heals. If the tumor is of the knotted swine type, incise it as described for the swine type tumors, as mentioned above. If the wound becomes purulent, use cautery as previously described.
Chapter forty-nine.
Incising the tumor that appears near the artery or vein, called an aneurysm.
If an artery is wounded and the skin above it adheres, a tumor often results.  Similarly, a vein can also cause swelling and a tumor.
The signs by which one knows whether the swelling and inflation are from an artery or a vein: if from an artery, the tumor is oblong, compact, deep within the body; if you press the tumor with your finger, you feel it like a creaking sound.
And that which is from the vein, the swelling is round, on the surface of the body.  Incising these tumors is dangerous, especially those in the armpit, groin, and neck, and in many other parts of the body, if they are very large.  It is necessary to avoid treating them with iron.
Also, those in the extremities or head should be avoided.  For those that are a swelling of the arterial opening, make a lengthwise incision in the skin, then widen the incision with hooks.  Then, dissect the artery and free it from the membranes.
Until it is exposed, then insert a needle beneath it, piercing it to the other side.  Tie the artery with a doubled thread in two places, as I instructed you regarding the arteries in the temples.  Then, pierce with a scalpel the area between the ligaments, until all the blood within it is expelled.
The swelling will subside, then use a treatment that produces pus, until the ligaments fall off.  Then, treat with appropriate ointments until it heals.
If the swelling is from a vein rupture, you should grasp as much of the swelling and skin as possible.  Then, insert a needle beneath the area you have grasped, passing it through with a double thread, until you bring it out the other side. Then, firmly tie the swelling with it, as I described to you in tying the abscess on both sides with the ends of the thread. If you fear the threads will slip, insert another needle with a different thread under the entire swelling at the intersection point of the first needle.
Tie your threads in four places, then slit the swelling in the middle.  Once what is within has come out, cut off any excess skin and leave what was tied.  Then, apply a compress soaked in potion and oil. Then use a treatment involving twisting and ointments until it heals.
Chapter Fifty.
In the swelling that arises from nerve twisting.
As swelling occurs in arteries and veins, so too does swelling occur in the nerve if struck or caused by excessive exertion, or similar.  This is more common in the wrists and ankles.
And in every location where joints move, it is a hard swelling resembling the color of the rest of the body, and in most cases is painless.  If pressed firmly, the patient feels a sensation akin to numbness, and the swelling is not deeply embedded in the body.
Rather, it is beneath the skin and moves in every direction, but does not go forward or backward.  What is in the joints should not be treated with iron, for it may cause a lasting injury.  And what is in the head or forehead...
Cut the skin with a scalpel. If the swelling is small, grasp it with a forceps and cut it from the root. If large, tie it with a ligature and dissect it, then remove it. Close the wound with stitches and treat it until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-One.
On the removal of warts that appear on the abdomen.
Warts, called "fungi" because of their resemblance to mushrooms, often appear on the abdomen and other parts of the body in many people.  Their base is thin and their head thick; sometimes their edges thicken, and they can range from small to very large.
I observed a man with two warts on his abdomen, resembling mushrooms in appearance.  Their bases were thin and white, their edges thickened, and they constantly secreted moisture. I removed them, weighing approximately eighteen ounces for one and six ounces for the other.
If the wart is moist, white, and thin-based, cut it with a wide scalpel, having heated cautery instruments at hand, as considerable bleeding often occurs when removing them.
If bleeding is excessive, cauterize it. If the patient is fearful of cutting with metal, take a strong lead thread and bind the wart.  Leave it for two days, then increase the tension of the lead.  Continue tightening the lead.
Continue tightening until the wart breaks off and falls off of its own accord. If the wart has a thick base, there is some risk and danger in removing it completely, especially if it is on the abdomen.  However, it may be possible to cut it in half or partially remove it.
Then cauterize it to prevent recurrence, and treat the wound until it heals. Beware of removing a wart that is dark, insensitive, and poorly defined, for it is a cancerous tumor. We will discuss cancer later.
The Fifty-Second Chapter.
On the treatment of umbilical protrusions.
Umbilical protrusions arise from various causes: either from a rupture in the peritoneum lining the abdomen, through which the intestines or bowels protrude, as occurs in other hernias; or from blood emanating from a vein or artery, as previously mentioned; or from gas that has accumulated within it.
If it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum and the protrusion of viscera, the tumor will be similar in color to the body, soft and painless, and of varying position. If it is due to the protrusion of the bowels, its position will be even more varied than we have described.  When you press it with your fingers, it will disappear and then return, and perhaps accompanied by gurgling.  It will greatly increase in size during bathing and severe exertion.  If it is due to moisture, it will be soft.
If it does not disappear when pressed with your hand, and neither increases nor decreases in size, if it is due to blood, the swelling will appear dark in color with these symptoms. If it is due to a growing mass of flesh, the swelling will be hard, firm, and remain at the same size.
If it is due to gas, the touch will be soft.  The course of action in this case is to observe.  If the umbilical protrusion is due to blood from an artery or vein, or gas, then one should refrain from treating it, for there is danger and deception in this, as I informed you in the chapter where I discussed tumors arising from arteries and veins.
If the umbilical protrusion is due to the bowels or viscera, you should instruct the patient to hold himself, stand upright, and extend himself, then apply a bandage around the entire umbilicus. Then, instruct him to lie on his back before you.  Then, use a wide scalpel to incise around the umbilicus at the area marked with the bandage.  Then, elevate the center of the swelling upward with a large hook.  Finally, tie the incision site with strong thread or fine silk thread, securely.
Tie the bandage in a knot, then open the center of the constricted swelling above the bandage and insert your index finger into it.  Feel for the bowels. If you find the bowels have been caught by the bandage, loosen the knot and push the bowels back into the abdomen. If you find a viscus, pull it out with a hook.
And cut off the excess. If an artery or vein is encountered, tie it securely. Then, return to your task. Take two needles, and thread them with strong threads.  Insert both needles into the incision you made around the swelling, so they pierce it firmly. Then pull the swelling tight in four places on the needles.
If you wish, remove the needles and leave the area until the pulled flesh rots and falls off on its own, or cut it if it becomes thin and rotten. Then treat it with the appropriate ointments until it heals. If the umbilical protrusion is from flesh grown there.
Or if it is from moisture, then you should cauterize the swelling, as we said, and remove the blood or moisture found within. Then treat it with what will heal the area.
Chapter Fifty-three.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have previously mentioned the types of cancer in the classification, and how to treat it with medications, and warned against treating it with iron lest it ulcerate.  We have also mentioned cancer that develops in the uterus and warned against treating it.
The ancients stated that if the cancer is in a place where it can be completely removed, like cancer in the breast or the thigh, and similar accessible organs, it should be removed entirely, especially if it is small and newly formed.  However, if it is advanced and large, it should not be approached.
I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen anyone before me achieve this.  If it is accessible, as we have said, the procedure is to first make incisions, multiple times, to remove the black fluid and then dissect it if it is evident that there is an abundance of blood vessels.
Then, the afflicted area is incised in a way that allows for access to the work.  Then, appropriate hooks are placed on the cancer and it is scraped from all sides, along with the skin, thoroughly, until nothing of the roots remains.  Allow the blood to flow, and do not cut it quickly.
Instead, squeeze the affected areas and remove all the thick blood with your hand or with any suitable tools. If during the procedure, you encounter a significant blood flow from a cut artery or vein, cauterize the vessel until the bleeding stops, and then treat the affected area with other methods until healed.
Chapter Forty-five.
On the treatment of tumors.
We have previously informed about the classification of types of dropsy, how water accumulates, the signs of each type, and their treatment with medication.  Only the serous type is treated with iron; the phlegmatic and fleshy types must not be approached with iron at all.
If you have treated this serous type of tumor with medication and it has not been successful, examine whether the patient has extreme weakness or another illness besides the tumor, such as...
If there is coughing, diarrhea, or similar ailments, avoid treating it with iron, as this is dangerous. If you see the patient is strong, has no other illness but the tumor, and is neither a child nor an elderly person, then proceed as follows: place the patient standing before you. and a servant behind him will press his abdomen with his hands and push the water downwards towards the pubic region. Then, take a pointed scalpel like this:
narrow at both ends, long, and pointed at the end, like a scalpel, but with a small, slight curve so that it does not penetrate the intestines when working, thereby injuring them.  Then, see if the tumor originated from the intestines.
If the tumor originated from the intestines, the incision should be three finger-widths below the navel, along the line above the pubic bone. If the tumor originated from a liver disease, make the incision three finger-widths to the left of the navel. If the tumor originated from a spleen disease, make the incision three finger-widths to the right of the navel.
Also, the incision should not be on the side the patient wants to lie on, so that fluids do not flow to that weakened area.  Then pierce the skin with the instrument, then insert the instrument into the incision and lift your hand.
Using the scalpel, separate the skin from the peritoneum, as if peeling it, to a depth similar to the size of a fingernail. Then, pierce the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches an empty space, the location of the fluid.  Then remove the fluid and insert the instrument, which has this shape:
It resembles a thin tube made of silver, copper, or smooth polished leather, with a small hole at the bottom and three holes on the sides, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
Its tip might have a needle-like point, similar to the shape of a writing quill, as illustrated here:.
At its upper end, there is a ring. If the instrument reaches the fluid, it will drain from the body onto the instrument, emptying a moderate amount of fluid at a time.  If you drain more than necessary at once, the patient may die from the dissolution of the animal spirit.
Or it may lead to a near-death faint.  But drain only as much as strength permits, guided by the patient's pulse strength and complexion. Then remove the instrument and seal off the fluid, as it will stop flowing on its own.
Because of the skin covering the hole in the diaphragm, which you were told to seal in that manner, then return the instrument another day if you see the patient is able to tolerate it.
Remove also only a small amount of fluid.  Do this for several days, always being cautious of error so that only a small amount of fluid remains. If you fear for the patient and leave a significant amount of fluid behind, treat it with burial in hot sand.
Much sweating in the bath and sun, endurance of thirst, and treatment with dried medicines until recovery, and cauterization of the stomach, liver, and spleen after removing the fluid as described previously.
Chapter fifty-five.
In treating infants born with unperforated or narrow or misplaced urinary openings.
Some boys may be born with their urethras unperforated, and it is necessary to perforate them from the moment of birth.
With a very thin scalpel in this manner:.
Then, place a thin lead nail in the opening, tie it, and hold it for three or four days. When urination is desired, remove it and then replace it. If you do not insert the lead, the urine passing through the area may cause it to close.
And as for those with a narrow opening, it is treated with lead, as we have mentioned, for many days until it widens.  And those whose opening is in the wrong place, meaning some are born with the opening at the end of the urethra and are unable to urinate forward.
Until the urethra is lifted by hand upward.  It is not born before that the semen cannot reach the uterus in a straight line, which is a very serious issue.  The method of treatment in this case is for the patient to lie on their back.
Then, stretch his urethra firmly with your left hand, and trim the head of the urethra with a sharp blade or scalpel, like the edge of a pen, or as if you were carving something, to create a raised center resembling the urethra, so that the opening is in the center as it should be.
Be cautious during your work to prevent bleeding, as it often occurs.  Address the bleeding with something to stop it and treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-six.
Concerning the ulcer that appears in the foreskin, the glans, blackness, corruption, and adhesion of the foreskin to the glans.
This ulcer often appears in the urethra, as a swollen fleshy protuberance.  It can be malignant or benign.  The benign type should be treated with a delicate hook.
Cut it completely away to cleanse it, then apply a cotton swab dipped in Egyptian ointment, followed by treatment with palm ointment until healed.  However, if the ulcer is malignant and dark, cauterization should be employed after cutting and removing it.
If the ulcer is in the foreskin of an uncircumcised person, and some of the ulcer is inside the foreskin and some outside, then the ulcer inside should be removed first.  Once it has healed, then treat the outside.
Because if you treat them both simultaneously, you cannot be sure that the foreskin will not perforate.  It can also occur in women, and in the foreskin, blackness and corruption may appear.  Therefore, any blackened tissue or tissue that threatens to or has already corrupted should be excised.
Then apply honey, crushed and sifted pomegranate rinds, and crushed karsina  on top. Then treat it with other remedies until it heals. If bleeding occurs, use a crescent-shaped cautery iron in this manner:.
Cauterization is beneficial for both cases, namely, bleeding and the ulcer if it corrupts.  If the foreskin completely detaches at any time, a lead tube must be inserted into the urethra so that the patient can urinate through it.  As for the foreskin sticking to the glans...
This adhesion occurs in those whose foreskin was healthy and did not require circumcision.  Adhesion may also occur due to an injury or a tumor.  Therefore, it should be separated with a sharp scalpel until the ligament is loosened and the glans is free on all sides.
If it is difficult to distinguish them through examination, one should separate a bit of the glans and foreskin.  The foreskin is thin; it may perforate quickly due to its thinness. Then separate the foreskin from the glans using a thin, cool wet linen cloth to prevent them from sticking again.
Then treat with a styptic potion until it heals.
Chapter fifty-seven.
On the cleansing of boys and the treatment of their errors.
Circumcision is nothing more than separating the connection, like other surgeries, but since it is performed by our will and used particularly on boys, it is necessary to delineate the best course of action.
The easiest path to safety, I say, is that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not used in their religions, but rather, it is what we have acquired.
Through experience, I have found that many artisans and barbers use cleansing with knives and scissors, and use a bandage and ligature, and cutting with a nail.  I have tried all these methods.
I found no better than cleansing with scissors and tying with thread, because cleansing with a knife often damages the skin, since the foreskin is two layers.  Perhaps the upper layer is cut, but the lower layer remains.
One is then forced to make another cut, causing renewed pain, and cleansing with a cautery does not prevent cutting the urethral tip, because it might enter its opening.  As for cleansing with a nail, the skin might tear, spoiling your work, or the boy's foreskin might be too short by nature.
Many are born in this condition, and thus do not require cleansing.  I have seen this.  As for cleansing with scissors and tying with thread, experience has revealed its superiority to me, because the scissors make a uniform cut, since the blade on top is like the blade on the bottom.
When you squeeze your hand with the blades in alignment, you make a cut of equal measure and in a single motion.  The thread then acts as a wall for the urethral skin from all sides, preventing any mistakes.  First, you must reassure the boy.
Especially if he is someone who understands a little, that you are only tying the thread to his urethra and leaving it for another day.  Then, cheer him and please him in every way you can.  Whatever he accepts with his mind, then place him before you, standing tall.
Do not have him sit, and keep the scissors hidden in your sleeve or under your foot.  The boy's eyes should not see them or any of the instruments.  Then, insert your hand into his urethra, blow on the foreskin, and lift it upward until the glans appears.
Then clean it of any accumulated dirt.  Then tie the marked area with a doubled thread.  Then tie a second knot slightly below that.  Then, using your thumb and forefinger, grasp the lower knot firmly, and cut between the two knots. Then quickly lift the foreskin upwards and withdraw the glans.  Then allow the blood to flow a little, for this is best and least likely to cause inflammation of the urethra.  Then wipe it with a damp cloth.  Then sprinkle dried, burned gourd ash over it; this is the best I have tried, or else fine sawdust; it is also excellent.

Then wipe it with a damp cloth.  Then sprinkle dried, burned gourd ash over it; this is the best I have tried, or else fine sawdust; it is also excellent. Then apply a poultice made of a crushed hard-boiled egg in rosewater, mixed with soft, fragrant rose oil, to the area, wrapped in a cloth.  Leave it on for another day, then continue with the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
This is an image of a suitable scissor for the procedure.
The scissors should be straight, sharp, and nail-like.  The blades should be the same length as the handles.  A common mistake in the procedure is that the inner skin might be completely or partially turned inside out during the cut.  Therefore, you should gently stretch the skin with your fingernail before the area swells.
Cut it [the skin] evenly. If you cannot hold it with your fingernail, pull it with a hook and cut it. If three days pass and the area beneath the glans remains swollen and inflamed, leave it until the hot swelling subsides and gently peel it off.
Cut it according to what is suitable for you, and be mindful of the glans.  If some of the glans is cut, it will not harm. Treat it with the poultices we described in the section on poultices.
If more skin is cut than necessary and it retracts upwards, this also does not cause much harm. Treat it as we mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Fifty-Eight.
On treating urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder occurs due to blockage by a stone, clotted blood, pus, or overgrown flesh, and similar things.  If you treat this with the various treatments described in the classification, as we mentioned.
If the urine does not pass and you perceive the retention is due to a stone that has harmed the neck of the bladder, the patient should be placed on their knees, prostrate, then a person should ride on their back, stretching the patient's abdomen towards their back, and the patient should hold themselves in place as much as possible.
In this case, the neck of the bladder will be forced to push the stone backward, and the urine will pass. If the urine does not pass by the method mentioned and the patient's condition worsens, then the removal of the obstruction by an instrument called a catheter, of which this is an image [of], must be used.
It is made of silver, thin and smooth, hollow like the tube of a bird's feather, about a cubit and a half long.  It has a gentle funnel at its head.  The method of using it to draw out urine is to take a doubled thread and tie to its end wool or cotton securely.
The thread's end is inserted into the bottom of the catheter, and any excess wool is trimmed with nippers to ensure it fits snugly inside the tube, like a stopper.  Then, the catheter is lubricated with oil, butter, or egg white, and the patient sits on a chair.
The patient's bladder and urethra are lubricated with wet dressings or lukewarm oil and water.  Then, the catheter is gently inserted into the urethra until it reaches the base of the urethra.  The urethra is then pulled upwards towards the navel, and the catheter is pushed inside.
Once the urethra is pulled, the catheter is pushed inside until it is near the rectum.  The penis is then tilted downwards, with the catheter inside, and pushed further until it reaches the bladder and the patient feels a void.
This method is used because the urinary passage is curved.  The thread with wool is pulled slightly taut, allowing the urine to follow the wool.  Then it is removed, and the urine is drained.  The catheter is then reinserted.
Continue doing this until the bladder is empty and the patient feels relief.
Chapter Fifty-Nine.
How to inject the bladder with a syringe.
Images of suitable instruments for this purpose are made of silver or hollowed ivory.  They have a long, thin tube, and are intended for dripping water and medicines.  This is done using an instrument called a syringe.  Here is its image:.
Made of silver or hollowed ivory, it has a long, thin, hollow tube.  The entire tube is hollow except for the end, which is solid and has three holes: two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
The hollow part where the nozzle is located should be just enough to fit it without any extra space.  Thus, when something is pulled with it, the moisture will be pulled; and when pushed, it will be pushed further, as is done with the oil-firing instrument used in naval warfare.
If you want to remove moisture from the bladder, insert the tip of the syringe into the moisture and pull upwards with the nozzle. The moisture will be drawn into the syringe. Then, insert the tip into the urethra as described in the catheters, and push the moisture out using the nozzle.
This moisture will reach the bladder and the patient will feel it.  This is also a picture of a gentle enema for the bladder.
It is made of silver or lead, its upper head resembling a small funnel, and underneath it is a groove where the cord is placed.  Then, a camel bladder is taken, and the moisture that one wants to inject into the bladder is placed inside.  It is then firmly tied between the two holes with a double thread.
Heat the moisture slightly over the fire, then insert the tip of the enema into the urethra.  Then, firmly press down on the bladder with the moisture until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder, take a piece of parchment, shape it into a circle, and pierce it all around.  Then, pass a strong thread through these holes, in a circular motion.  Assemble the circle as one assembles a tray, after placing inside it the moisture, ointments, or water desired.
Then tie it to the instrument and use it as you did with the bladder, pressing with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter Sixty.
On removing the stone.
We have previously discussed the types of stones, their treatment with medicine, and the differences between stones formed in the kidneys and those formed in the bladder, along with the signs of each. We have also described stones requiring manual removal and incision.
This is particularly the stone formed in the bladder, and that which originates in the urethra.  I will describe this with clear explanation and brevity.
I say that bladder stones are most often found in children.  A sign is that the urine expelled from the bladder is thin, like water.
Sand appears in the urine, the child rubs and plays with their penis, and often the testicles hang down and spread out.  The anus also protrudes in many cases.  Children recover more easily from this up to the age of fourteen, whereas it is more difficult in the elderly.  Young adults fall somewhere in between.
The larger the stone, the easier the treatment; the smaller the stone, the opposite is true.  Therefore, in treatment, the patient should first be given an enema to remove all the debris in their bowels, since this may prevent the stone from being found during examination.
Then, the patient's legs are held and shaken downwards to bring the stone to the neck of the bladder, or they are made to jump from a raised position several times.  Then, the patient is seated upright before you, with hands under their thighs, so the entire bladder inclines downwards, and then it is examined.
Palpate it from the outside. If you feel a stone in the space, immediately make an incision on it. If it is not at all within your reach, then you should lubricate the index finger with grease from the left hand, if the patient is a child, or the middle finger.
If it is a fully developed male, then insert it into their rectum and search for the stone.  Once it is under your finger, move it little by little to the neck of the bladder, then press on it with your finger and push it out towards the place where you want to make the incision.
Then order a servant to squeeze the bladder with his hand, and order another servant to stretch the labia upwards with his right hand, and with his other hand stretch the skin below the labia towards the place where the incision should be made.  Then take the scalpel, which has this form:
Make the incision between the anus and the labia, not in the middle, but on the side of the left pubic region.  The incision should be aligned with the stone, your finger in the rectum, pressing it outwards in an oblique manner so that the incision is wide on the outside and narrow on the inside, to the extent possible for the stone to exit.
Do not increase the pressure. Perhaps the finger in the rectum will push the stone out during the incision, with little difficulty. Be aware that some stones have angles and edges, making their removal difficult.
Some are smooth, like acorns, and round, making removal easy.  If a stone has angles and edges, increase the incision slightly. If it does not come out this way, you must devise a method, perhaps grasping it with a firm instrument, having a tip like a scraper.
So that it grips the stone and does not slip, or insert a delicate, curved instrument beneath it. If you cannot manage it this way, widen the incision slightly.  If much blood is present, cauterize it with a cautery iron.
If there are multiple stones, remove the largest first into the bladder opening, then make an incision.  After that, remove the smaller ones.  Do the same if there are more than two.  If the stone is very large, it is unwise to make a large incision, as this could expose the patient to one of two dangers.
Either he will die, or he will suffer from constant urine leakage, because the area will not heal.  However, try to push it out. Or devise a method for breaking it with forceps to remove it in pieces.
Once you have completed your procedure, treat the large wound with kandar, sopor, shiyan, and a tight bandage. Place a moistened cloth with oil, syrup, rosewater, or cool water on top to reduce inflammation. The patient should lie on their back, and do not loosen the bandages until the third day.
When the swelling subsides, bathe the area with copious amounts of water and oil.  Then treat it with the نخلى (palm) ointment and the basilikon ointment until healed. If a large, inflammatory swelling, ulceration, or similar occurs at the wound site, or if blood clots in the bladder, preventing urination, this can be diagnosed by the presence of blood in the urine.
Insert your finger into the wound and remove the blood.  If it remains, it will lead to the corruption and putrefaction of the bladder.  Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt.  Treat each type of issue with the appropriate remedy until it heals.
Throughout the treatment, the thighs should be tied together to hold the medications in place on the area. If the stone is small and lodged in the urethra, causing inflammation and preventing urination, treat it with the methods I've described before it becomes fractured.
Often, this treatment method obviated the need for incision.  I have tested this approach using a file of hardened steel, shaped as follows:
The tip of the file is sharpened to a point, and it is attached to a stick.  Then, a thread is used to tie the penis below the stone, to prevent it from returning to the bladder.  Then, the file is gently inserted into the urethra until it reaches the stone itself.
Rotate the file against the stone slightly, aiming to pierce it from the other side.  Urine will flow immediately. Then, press on the remaining part of the stone outside the penis. It will crumble and exit with the urine, and the patient will recover.
If this treatment is not possible due to an obstacle, tie a thread below the stone and another above the stone. Then, make an incision on the stone within the penis between the ties and remove it.
Then, the thread is loosened, and the coagulated blood from the wound is cleaned.  The thread was tied below the stone to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other thread above the stone so that when the thread is loosened after the stone is removed, the skin returns to its place to cover the wound.
Therefore, when tying the upper thread, you should lift the skin upwards, so that when you are finished, it returns and covers the wound, as we have stated.
Chapter Sixty-one.
On removing stones in women.
Stones rarely develop in women.  If one of them presents with a stone, treatment is difficult and impossible for many reasons.  One is that the woman may be a virgin, and another that you will not find a woman who allows herself to be examined by a physician.
If she is virtuous or from a household of women with modesty, and the third that you do not find a woman skilled in this craft, particularly in manual work.  And the fourth, that the location of the incision for a stone in a woman is far from the stone's location, requiring a deep incision.
And there is danger in this. If necessity dictates it, one should find a skilled female physician; this is rare.  If unavailable, seek a virtuous and compassionate physician, or bring a skilled midwife or a woman with some knowledge in this craft.
You should have her present and instruct her to do all that you command her to do, first to examine the stone. If the woman is a virgin, you should insert a finger into her vagina and search for the stone. If found, you should press it under your finger.
Then you should instruct her to cut it open. If she is not a virgin, but a married woman, instruct the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's vagina and search for the stone, after placing her left hand on the bladder and squeezing it well.
If she finds it, she should guide it out from the opening of the bladder downward to the extent of her ability, until it reaches the root of the thigh. Then she should make an incision along the middle of the vagina, near the root of the thigh, whichever side the stone is felt in that area.
Her finger should not leave the stone, pressing underneath it.  The incision should be small at first. Then, the instrument should be inserted into that small incision. If she feels the stone, she should widen the incision as much as she knows is necessary for the stone to come out.  Know that there are many types of stones.
Among them are small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, and those with branches. Know their types so that you can ascertain what you want. If blood prevails, sprinkle the powdered alum on the area and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, then resume your work.
Until the stone comes out.  Prepare the instruments mentioned for removing stones in men, to aid you in your work.  If you are overwhelmed by bleeding and know the bleeding is from a severed artery, place the styptic on the area.
Tighten it firmly with bandages. Leave it and do not repeat it. Leave the stone; do not remove it. For sometimes the patient may die.  Then treat the wound. When the severity of the bleeding subsides after days and the area becomes infected, return to your work until the stone is expelled.
Chapter Sixty-two.
In the fracture of the watery membranes.
Watery membranes are the accumulation of moisture in the white peritoneum which is under the skin of the scrotum surrounding the testicle.  It is called the scrotum.  It may also be in a special membrane which nature prepares for it on one side of the testicle.
Until one might think it is another testicle. It lies between the skin of the scrotum and the white peritoneum that we mentioned. This only happens rarely.  This collection of fluid arises from weakness affecting the testicles; this substance is deposited on them.  It may also be caused by a blow to the testicles.
This moisture can be of various colors; either yellow, or bloody red, or dark-green, or white-watery, which is the most common.  The signs by which it is recognized are...
Where the water accumulates, if it is in the white peritoneum we mentioned, the swelling is somewhat oval in shape, like an egg, and the testicle is not visible because the moisture surrounds it from all sides.
If the moisture is in a separate membrane, the swelling will be round on one side of the testicle.
Therefore, one might imagine it to be another testicle. If the moisture is between the scrotal skin and the white peritoneum, it can be felt.  To determine the color of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe whose image was previously given; judge its color based on what is within the probe's impression.
If we turn to treatment with leeches, the patient should be bled, if possible, and if you find his body is full. Then he should lie on his back on a slightly raised surface, placing many cloths underneath, and you should sit on his left side.
And instruct a servant to sit on his right, extending the patient's penis to one side of the scrotum and towards the flank of the abdomen. Then, take a wide scalpel and incise the scrotal skin lengthwise from the center to near the pubic area.
The incision should be straight and parallel to the line that divides the scrotal skin in half, until you reach the white peritoneum.  Carefully peel it back, avoiding cutting it.  Focus your peeling on the side closest to the testicle, and extend the peeling as far as you can.
Then, widely separate the water-filled peritoneum and remove all the water.  Then, separate the edges of the incision with forceps, lift the peritoneum upward without touching the scrotal skin, and cut the peritoneum as you can, either in one piece or in sections.
Especially its thin side, for if you do not completely sever it, you cannot prevent the water from returning.  If the testicle protrudes from its sheath during your work, return it to place, then close the edges of the scrotal skin with sutures.
Then treat it as you would any other surgical wound until it heals. If the testicle is damaged from another disease, you must tie off the vessels in the sac to prevent bleeding, then sever the testicle from the sac, remove the testicle, and treat it as previously described.
If the accumulated fluid is in both sides, know that there are two hernias.  Incise the other side as you did the first, or if you prefer, perform the procedure once and then clean away the blood.
Place wool soaked in oil or rose oil into the incisions.  Place another layer of wool soaked in a mixture of liquid and oil over that, and spread it over the testicles and the abdominal area.  Place folded cloths, the *rafā'id*, on top of that. Bind it from above with the six-pointed bandage in this manner:
Then take two cloths, sew them together, and fill them with fluffy wool in this manner.  Make the straps for binding out of damp cotton or wool, and secure them tightly with the belt of the trousers.  One of the straps should run from the buttock to the back.
The second strap should run towards the pubic area, with the other two straps on the lower part of the thighs, and the remaining two on the inner sides of the thighs.  Secure all the straps to the belt of the trousers.  This hernia can also be treated by cauterization instead of incision with an iron.
This is done by taking a thin, heated cautery iron and making an incision in the scrotum's skin, continuing until the white membrane containing water is exposed.  Take another cautery iron in this manner:
It resembles a Greek eye, then cauterize that membrane while hot until all moisture is expelled. Then, grasp the membrane with forceps and cauterize the containing layer, cutting it as much as possible to remove it completely, while preserving the testicle, avoiding any contact with fire.
Know that this method is safer and avoids blood loss, and is better than incision.  If during the incision or cauterization you encounter a hot swelling, blood loss, or anything else, then you should treat each occurrence with the appropriate remedies as previously described.
If the patient is timid and cannot endure this procedure due to its unpleasantness, then let him use the cauterization method as described, if it is appropriate according to the previous indications.
If the discharge is watery, the patient should sit on a high chair.  Then cauterize the swelling below with a wide probe.  Keep the cauterization along the body, and make the opening wide enough for all the water to drain.  Then apply cotton to the area and bandage it.
Allow the remaining water to drain, then treat it until the wound heals.  If the water does not drain during the cauterization, it is likely because the white membrane is obstructing the wound opening, preventing the water from exiting.
In that case, you should insert a goose feather, or the instrument used to extract water from abscesses, as previously shown, or slightly enlarge the wound opening.
Know that the water may return and accumulate after six months or so.  If it does, cauterize it in the same manner, and the patient should endure the days.
Chapter Sixty-three.
On the fissure of fleshy tissues and their treatment.
Know that a fissure on these fleshy tissues is a perilous condition, often leading to death.  Therefore, we advise against intervention and for a non-invasive approach.  I will now describe the procedures for handling them and the types of tumors.
I say that many tumors can arise in bodies composed of two layers.  This occurs from various causes, either from a sharp discharge accumulated in the layers or from a blow.  The tumor's color matches the body's color and is devoid of moisture.
The tumor is hard, and it may be calcified, its color like lead, and without sensation.  It may also result from the constriction and swelling of the arteries, as previously mentioned, or from swelling of the veins.  If from the swelling of the arteries, this is recognized by the scattering of the tumor.
If you press it with your fingers, it should not be incised.  As for that which arises from swelling of the veins, nothing disperses upon pressing with the fingers.  This type may be incised, along with other fleshy tissues.
This is done by incising the scrotum's skin, then pulling the testicle upward and removing it from the white peritoneum.  The attachment is separated from the vessels, the vessels are tied off, and the attachment is cut after it is separated from all sides of the testicle. If the testicle has adhered to the growing tissues.
Then the testicle must be extracted and cut.  If the adhesion is between any of the peritonea or between the vessels, then all such adhesions must be separated and cut in a circular fashion.
If the fleshy growth is at the point of adhesion, which is on the back side, it must all be cut, and the testicle removed, as we have said.  Once your work is complete, wash the wound with wet wool soaked in rose-scented oil and medicate it with other treatments until it heals.
Sixty-fourth Chapter.
On treating dropsy with hydrocele.
Hydrocele is a swollen, twisted mass resembling a bunch of grapes, with relaxation of the testicles.  It makes movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.  The treatment for this condition is similar to that previously mentioned.
However, it is necessary to describe the procedure as practiced by our predecessors.  I say that the patient should sit on a raised chair, then push the testicles downward, and grasp the skin of the scrotum with your fingers, near the vessels close to the penis.
A servant of yours holds it and stretches it forcefully.  Then, using a wide, sharp scalpel, make a slanted incision alongside the vessels until the vessels are exposed.  Then, dissect from each side, as I described to you in the dissection of the arteries of the temples, and insert a needle with a doubled thread into them.
Tie it at the initial points where the hydrocele appeared and tie it again at its end. Then, cut it in the middle with a vertical incision along the body and remove the foul, putrid moisture collected within.
Then, treat the wound as with other surgical wounds that require time to heal. Removing the vessels that nourish one testicle is acceptable.  If the hydrocele affects all vessels, then one testicle must be removed along with the vessels so that the remaining testicle will not be deprived of nourishment. Before cutting the vessels, it will wither and be of no use.
Chapter Sixty-five.
In the treatment of intestinal obstruction.
This obstruction occurs when a fissure appears in the peritoneum extending across the abdomen near the groin, and the intestine from that hernia protrudes into one testicle.
This hernia is either from a fissure in the peritoneum or from its extension. These two types arise from various causes, such as a blow, a leap, a shout, or lifting something heavy, and the like.  If it's from an extension of the peritoneum, the hernia develops gradually over a long period.
It does not occur suddenly.  The swelling is gradual, extending inwards as the peritoneum constricts the intestine.  If it is from a fissure in the peritoneum, it is accompanied by a severe immediate pain at the onset, and the swelling will be distinctly visible under the skin nearby.
The intestine protrudes and passes outside the peritoneum.  The hernia may also include intestinal contents, making it an intestinal and fecal hernia.  It might also include wind, or the intestinal contents might become stagnant, potentially leading to the patient's demise.
Because it causes severe pain and rumbling, especially if constricted.  Treating these types of ailments with iron is dangerous, so one should avoid that.  The procedure is to instruct the patient to return the intestine into its cavity with their hand, if possible.
Then the patient lies on their back before you, and their legs are raised.  The skin near the groin is then pulled upwards, and the entire scrotum is incised lengthwise.  Hooks are inserted into the edges of the incision, as needed, to widen the opening.
The incision should be large enough to allow the hernia to emerge. Then, the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin is peeled back until the tough, white peritoneum is exposed on all sides.  At that point, insert your index finger below the hernia sac.
Separate the white peritoneum beneath the hernia sac from the second peritoneum, thus releasing any adhesions behind the hernia.  Then, with your right hand, pull inwards towards the scrotal skin.  Simultaneously, with your left hand, pull the white peritoneum upwards and lift the hernia sac towards the incision.
Instruct the attendant to pull the hernia sac upwards, and you release any adhesions behind it completely.  Examine with your finger to ensure there is no twisted intestine within the tough white peritoneum.  If you find any, push it back into the abdomen below.
Then take a needle with a thick thread, twisted from ten strands, and insert it at the end of the peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin near the incision.  Cut the ends of the thread, leaving four strands. Then, interweave the strands in a secure manner and tie the peritoneum, which we mentioned is beneath the scrotal skin, tightly on both sides.  Then also wrap and tie the ends of the threads securely, so that nothing can reach the blood vessels supplying the area. To prevent a painful swelling, also tie a second knot, external to the first, a distance of less than two fingers. After these two ligatures, leave a length of peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin equal to the width of a finger.
To prevent a painful swelling, also tie a second knot, external to the first, a distance of less than two fingers. After these two ligatures, leave a length of peritoneum beneath the scrotal skin equal to the width of a finger. Cut the remaining portion entirely around and remove the hernia sac. Then, make an incision below the scrotal skin, one that bleeds and oozes as we previously described. Then use wool soaked in oil and place it in the wound. Apply the ligature as we described.
The white peritoneum, which we mentioned, may need to be cauterized after cutting it to prevent bleeding, which often occurs. Leave the ligature until it falls off naturally. If it takes too long to fall off, apply warm water and something that will cause sweating to hasten its removal.
Then treat the wound with all the other treatments for surgical wounds until it heals.
Chapter Sixty-Six.
In this case of flatulence, I have seen no one dare treat it with iron.  The ancients have described a method, as we described for the flatulence with a hernia, which involves tying the vessels gently below the incision.
Then, make an incision in the middle and treat the swelling to open it, until the vessels fall out. Treat the wound as we described until it heals.
Chapter Seventy-Six.
In the hernia that is in the groin.
The hernia in the groin may appear, as we said, but nothing from the intestines descends into the groin. If it does descend, it is slight and returns at all times.
But if it lasts a long time, the tear in the peritoneum increases, so that the intestines and the hernia descend into the scrotum. This occurs because of the extension of the peritoneum which is in the groin, as we said. This is because the peritoneum extends, then relaxes and bulges the place, and its treatment is by cauterization, as I have previously described.
And it may be treated with iron in this manner: the patient lies on their back before you, then you cut the swollen protruding hernia site transversely, about the size of three fingers. Then you cauterize the peritonea beneath the skin.
Until the white peritoneum beneath is exposed, then you take a probe, place it on the protruding peritoneum and press it inward towards the abdomen. Then you stitch the two protruding parts of the peritoneum on the probe's edge, and join one to the other with stitches.
Then you withdraw the probe, and do not cut the peritoneum at all, nor touch the testicle or anything else, as I instructed you in treating intestinal hernia. Then treat it with the treatment for surgical injuries.
If the threads are severed, clean and close the wound until it heals, then the peritoneum will contract and the hernia will not increase.
And this is the best method in this location, because it is closer to safety.
Chapter Sixty-eight.
Relaxation of the scrotum skin.
The scrotum skin often relaxes in some people without the underlying tissues relaxing, which makes the appearance unsightly.  Therefore, whoever wishes to treat this, should have the patient lie on their back.
And he cuts all the relaxed skin from the thick skin, then brings the edges together.  If you wish, first stitch the excess relaxed skin with three or four stitches, ensuring they are secure, then cut between the stitches.
Then treat it with the treatment of other surgical wounds until it heals and the stitches fall out.
Chapter Sixty-nine.
On castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion.
For this reason, I should not have mentioned it in this book, but I have done so for two reasons.  One is so that a physician, when asked about it, will have knowledge of it, and will know how to treat those affected. The other is that we often need to castrate certain animals for our benefit.
Such as sheep, oxen, and cats, and similar animals.  I say that castration is of two types: either by crushing or by cutting.  In the case of crushing, we place the animal in hot water until its testicles relax and soften and hang down.
Then you crush it with your hand until it breaks down and no longer feels distinct when touched.  As for castration by cutting, you should hold the animal and grasp the skin of its testicles with your left hand, then tie off the attachments and cut a single incision into each testicle.
Until the testicles appear, then cut them after removing their coverings, leaving no part of the tunics except the thin tunics that are on the vessels. This type of castration is better than the one that is done by crushing.
Because crushing may leave some of the testicles, and the animal will desire mating, and then the wound is treated until it heals.
Chapter Seventy.
In the treatment of hermaphrodites.
Hermaphrodites in males come in two types. One type appears as a space below or on the scrotal skin between the testicles, shaped like a woman's vulva with hair, and urine may flow from the area on the scrotal skin.
And in females, there is one type, occurring above the vulva on the pubis like small, protruding male testicles, one of them resembling a man's penis, and both resembling the vulva.  Treatment for all three types.
The two types of males and the single type of female: the excess flesh should be cut away until the effect is gone, then treated as other surgical wounds until healed.  As for the second type of male from whom urine emerges from the scrotal skin, there is no procedure nor healing.
Chapter Seventy-One.
On cutting the penis and the protruding flesh of women's vulvas.
The clitoris may increase in size beyond the natural state, becoming unsightly and misshapen.  In some women, it may enlarge to the extent it resembles that of men, interfering with sexual intercourse.
The excess clitoris should be grasped with your hand or forceps and cut away, but do not cut excessively deep into the root, lest there be profuse bleeding.
Then treat it with surgical remedies until healed. As for the growing flesh, it is flesh that grows in the mouth of the uterus, filling it up.
And it may protrude outwards, like a tail. Therefore, some of the earlier physicians called it the "tail-like disease". It should be cut, like the clitoris, and treated until healed.
Chapter Seventy-Two.
On treating varicose veins.
Varicose veins are when a woman's vagina is not perforated or the perforation is small, and this may be either natural or accidental. The accidental case stems from a prior ailment, and may result from excess, overgrown tissue.
Or thin or thick peritoneum, either deep within the uterus, or on its sides, or at its top or bottom. It prevents sexual intercourse and procreation, and possibly menstruation.  The midwife can diagnose it by observation.
If the obstruction is visible and close, but if not visible, then she should probe with her fingers or a probe. If the obstruction is from thin peritoneum, and is close to the labia, then promptly pierce it. This is done by making a sort of flap on the labia, and then placing both thumbs of the hands together.
The woman should be on her back with her legs spread, and then the labia should be pulled firmly until the thin peritoneum is pierced and the obstruction is opened. Then, take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area.  The woman should be sexually intimate every day to prevent the area from closing again.
If the peritoneum is thick and dense, it should be cut with a wide scalpel, resembling a thin, flat blade. If the obstruction is from overgrown flesh, it should be suspended with forceps and cut. Have with you remedies to stop bleeding without causing further injury, such as gum arabic, dates, and frankincense mixed with egg white.
Then a wide lead tube should be used to prevent the wound from closing quickly.  It is held in place for days, and dried flax thread is used.  Then, treat with the usual methods for treating abscesses until healed.  Additional growths of flesh may appear in the uterus, and these should be cut in the same manner.
Unless it is a cancerous tumor, a cancerous tumor in the uterus should never be treated with iron.
Chapter Seventy-Three.
On treating hemorrhoids, warts, and red pimples that appear in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are the swelling of the mouths of the veins, causing the continuous flow of much blood.  If the hemorrhoids progress, they become warts.  We have already described their types and signs in the classification, and we will mention them here.
Concerning which hemorrhoids and warts are treatable and which are not: I say that hemorrhoids and warts that are deep within the uterus and do not become apparent to touch are not treatable with iron.  Those that are in the mouth of the uterus and are felt are the ones to be treated.
The woman should enter a cool room, then use a lancet or a rough cloth to remove the warts from their roots, cutting them off.  Then, after bleeding from one of the blood-stopping instruments, sprinkle it with something that stops the bleeding, without causing further irritation.
Such as acacia, myrrh, frankincense, and similar substances. Then raise her legs to the wall for an hour, then lower them into cold water.  If the bleeding persists, have her sit in a decoction of sumac, pomegranate peels, oak bark, and similar substances.  Then take barley flour, mix it with honey and vinegar.
Apply this as a poultice to her back.  If the bleeding stops, then cease. Otherwise, apply leeches to the lower back, breasts, and chest without any stipulations. Then take wool, soak it in the juice of asphodel or the juice of goat's rue or the juice of buckthorn twigs, mixed with oak-bark infusion, and apply it to the affected area.
If the swelling subsides, treat the area with ointment until healed.  As for the red scab, it resembles the heads of boils, rough in appearance.  It is necessary to cut off what appears of it, just as described for warts, and treat it until healed.
Chapter seventy-four.
Concerning the treatment of abscesses appearing in the uterus.
Many types of tumors may appear in the uterus, such as cancer, hard tumors, ulcers, gangrene, eating sores, polyps, hemorrhoids, fissures, warts, and hot tumors.  All of these diseases and their types and signs have been described in the classification.
Therefore, in this section, we must discuss the hot tumor appearing in the uterus, if it is among the tumors that gather over a period of time, how to treat it with iron.  One must observe if the initial pain of the tumor is sharp, with throbbing, inflammation, and fever.
If you see it red, and if it is sensitive to touch, do not rush to treat it with iron. Treat it with what aids in maturation until these symptoms subside.  Then, the woman should sit on a chair with two seats, leaning back.
And she should bring her legs together towards the lower abdomen, with her thighs spread apart, and place her arms under her knees, securing them with a suitable bandage.
Then the midwife should sit on the right side and use the instrument for opening the cervix, whose image will follow later.  If you wish to use this instrument, you must first assess the depth of the woman's uterus to ensure the instrument does not penetrate deeper than the uterus.
If the instrument is too deep, it will harm the patient.  If the instrument is deeper than necessary, applicators should be placed on the lip of the cervix to prevent the entire instrument from entering the uterine cavity.  The spiral that runs within the instrument should be situated at the top.
While you hold the instrument, the attendant turns the spiral until the cervix is opened. If a boil appears and is soft and tender when felt by hand, it should be incised at its head with a wide scalpel.  If the entire discharge has been evacuated.
A soft wick soaked in rose oil or green oil with some astringent should be placed in the wound. The wick should protrude from the incision in the cervix, and pure wool soaked in boiled baker's water should be applied externally to the uterus and pubis.
Then, after two days, it should be treated with the appropriate ointment until healed.
The uterus and wound may be washed by injecting water and honey, then water boiled with licorice root or long wormwood. Then, return to the ointment. This is if the boil is hidden and inside the uterus.
Iron should not be used for treatment; rather, it should be treated as described in the division.
Chapter seventy-five.
On instructing midwives on how to treat live fetuses that emerge in an unnatural form.
The midwife should first know the natural form of childbirth.  Signs include the woman's desire to descend, to breathe air, and the lessening of her postpartum discomfort.
And if the expulsion of the fetus is rapid, know that this birth is natural.  The fetus will emerge head-first, with the placenta either attached or hanging from the umbilical cord.  If you see these signs, you should press her abdomen to facilitate the rapid expulsion of the fetus.
If it descends head-first, the placenta descends with it, and it is cleaned well of those impurities.  Any birth other than this is unnatural and reprehensible, because the fetus may emerge on its feet, and its hands or feet may emerge before its head.
And one hand or one foot, or its head and hand, or it emerges curled up, or perhaps turned upside down, and similar reprehensible forms.  The midwife should be skillful and gentle with all these things, and cautious of mistakes and errors.
And I am explaining each form and how to manage it so you may recognize it. If the fetus emerges headfirst—the natural way—and the woman feels intense pain, and childbirth is difficult, and you see her strength weakening, have her sit on a chair and have women restrain her.
Then bandage her uterus with cooked herbs and moist ointments.  Then the midwife should insert a small scalpel between her fingers, to cut the placenta, or cut it with her fingernail, until the moisture within drains out.  Then press the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
If it does not descend, the woman should be injected with the juice of fenugreek mixed with the grease of an ointment, then after the injection she should be encouraged to cough and be induced to sneeze with a stick, and her mouth and nose should be held. The fetus will emerge shortly. If the fetus's hands emerge first, they should gently be pushed back in, little by little.
If entry is still not possible, place the woman on a raised platform and lift her legs up.  Then shake the platform on the ground, and the woman should hold on to prevent falling during the shaking.  If the hands do not enter and the fetus dies, cut off the hands and pull out the rest of the fetus.
Or tie his hands with a cloth and pull them gently, and he will come out.  If the fetus emerges on its feet, the feet should be pushed upwards, then the fetus should be turned gradually until it is straight, then one of the legs should be pulled gradually.
If they emerge to the thighs, encourage her to cough and sneeze her with a stick, and it will emerge.  If it does not emerge as described, then gently reposition the fetus bit by bit until it is in its natural position, then it will emerge smoothly. If it still does not emerge using all the methods described.
Take the juice of hyssop, the juice of fenugreek, ointment of shirg, and dissolved gum. Grind them well in a mortar. Then apply this mixture to the woman's vagina and lower abdomen.  Then have her sit in lukewarm water until the hips are submerged.
If you see that the lower part has softened, make her a pessary of myrrh and have her tolerate it. If she holds the pessary for an hour, have her sit on a chair, then make her cough and close her mouth and nose, and gently press on her lower abdomen. The fetus will emerge immediately.  If the fetus emerges on its knees and hands...
If it emerges in this manner, gently insert your hands a little bit. Then have the woman lie on her back, her legs dangling downward while lying on a bed, and her hands clasped together. Then gently press on her upper abdomen bit by bit. Then remove the pillows from under her legs so that her feet are elevated. If the fetus does not emerge, take both her legs and move them vigorously. Then press gently on the upper hips bit by bit until the fetus rises upward. Then the midwife inserts her hand and positions the fetus gently.
Instruct the woman to strain until the fetus emerges. The fetus emerges sideways, with one arm dangling.  Try to reposition the arm. If you cannot reposition it, have the woman stand up and walk.  If she cannot walk, have her lie down.
Shake her legs vigorously. Then use the poultice I described, made from saliva. If it is expelled, have her sit on a chair and try to reposition the arm and straighten the fetus. Have the woman cough and instruct her to strain until it emerges.
The fetus emerges on its back, arms outstretched, face toward the mother's back. The midwife should grasp the fetus's arm and gently turn and straighten it.  Once straightened, apply the grease and saliva we described to the area.
Then instruct her to move slightly, and when she does, have her sit on a chair.  Instruct her to lean to her right side, then to strain and cough with the instrument.  If this is done, the fetus will emerge upright on its side.
If it descends into the cervix in this condition, with the placenta, cut the placenta with your fingernail until it is free of moisture.  If it is attached to the fetus's face or neck, cut it from the umbilical cord to prevent suffocation and death.  Then push the fetus inwards to the proper position.
Instruct the woman to strain repeatedly, for this will cause easy expulsion.  For the delivery of twins or multiple fetuses, know that twins are common, and triplets or quadruplets are sometimes born alive, but this is rare; a quintuplet is unnatural and will not survive.
They are surrounded by a single placenta, even if numerous, and are separated by a membraneous partition connected to the umbilical cord of each.  They may emerge like a single fetus, a natural and easy expulsion, or they may emerge as a difficult expulsion as previously described.
If any of them are difficult to deliver and take on the unnatural forms we have mentioned, treat them as previously described.  Let the midwife be gentle, acting with care and patience, and employing any resource available to ensure safety.
Fetuses that can be conceived in the womb may be one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or more than ten.  It has been confirmed that one woman miscarried seven and another fifteen, all conceived.
By the estimation of the all-knowing and all-powerful God, this all should be in the knowledge of the midwife, as she may encounter such a case some day and deal with it appropriately.
Chapter Sixty-Seven.
In the removal of the dead fetus.
If, after treating the dead fetus with the treatments described in the section, it does not come out and you are forced to use your hands, you must examine the woman. If she is strong and has no symptoms that cause concern of harm, the woman should lie on her back on a bed.
Her head should be tilted downward, and her legs elevated. A servant should hold her firmly from both sides, or tie her to the bed, to prevent her body from moving when the fetus is extracted.
Then, the mouth of her uterus should be moistened with moist ointments, along with the saliva of the [a certain type of bird], fenugreek, and linseed. Then, the midwife should anoint her hand with these ointments and saliva, then gently insert it into the uterus.  Thereafter, she should seek a place to insert hooks into the fetus and the appropriate areas for this.
Examine, and if the fetus is positioned to descend headfirst, insert the hooks into its eyes, nape, mouth, palate, under its chin, collarbone, or in areas near the ribs or beneath the clavicles.
And if it is descending feet first, then in the pubis and the middle ribs.  One should hold the hook in the right hand, and curl it between the fingers of the left hand.  The hand should be gently inserted and a hook planted in one of the aforementioned locations.
Until it reaches an empty space, then insert another or a third hook, if necessary, to ensure the pulling is balanced and does not lean to one side.  Then, the pulling should be even and not simply in a straight line, but moving to all sides.
To facilitate its exit, as is done with a tooth when extracted.  And in between, the pulling should be relaxed.  If it becomes lodged in one place, then the midwife should anoint some fingers with the ointment and insert them to rotate what is obstructed.  If some part of the fetus is expelled, then move the hooks to other locations.
She should slightly elevate it to do this until the entire fetus is expelled.  If a hand emerges before the rest and cannot be returned due to its constriction, then a cloth should be wrapped around it, and it should be pulled out until, when the whole hand is out, it is severed.
Either at the wrist joint or at the elbow.  Similarly, one should do this with the other hand and the legs. If the fetus's head is large and faces pressure during its exit or if there is accumulated water in its head, then a pointed, sharp instrument should be inserted between the fingers.
With it, the head is split open to release the water, or it is punctured with the instrument called the *mashdak*, the image of which appears with the images of other instruments in the subsequent section.
Likewise, if the fetus has a naturally large head, one must split the skull or puncture it with the *mashdak*, as we said, and then remove the bones with the forceps. If the head emerges and becomes constricted at the collarbone, then one should split it open to release the moisture within the chest.
Then the chest will contract. If the chest does not contract and cannot be removed, cut as much as you can.  If the lower abdomen is swollen or contains a tumor, it should be incised to allow the moisture to drain out.
If the fetus is on its feet, pulling it and positioning it toward the cervix is easy.  If it is constricted at the abdomen or chest, it should be pulled with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and the abdomen or chest should be split open to allow the contents to drain.
If all the other organs have been removed and the head remains lodged, the midwife should insert her left hand. If the cervix is open, she should insert her hand into the neck of the uterus, locate the head, and pull it with her fingers towards the cervix. Then she should insert a hook or two hooks and pull it with them.
If the cervix has contracted around a hot tumor, it should not be forced.  Instead, moist, fatty substances should be applied, bandages used, and she should sit in relaxing, moist water.
If the fetus is on its side, if possible, use the methods described for a living fetus. If not, it should be cut open and removed.  Nothing of the placenta should be left inside at all.  After finishing your treatment, use the methods described for hot tumors that appear in the wombs.
If bleeding occurs, she should descend into binding waters and use all other treatments.  I have seen a woman who conceived, then had a fetus die within her, and later conceived again.
Then the other fetus also died.  After a long time, a tumor appeared on her abdomen, swelled until it opened, and discharged pus.  I was summoned to treat her and treated her for a long time, but the wound did not heal.  I then applied some powerful, astringent ointments.
Then a bone came out of the area, and after a few days, another bone emerged. I was amazed by this, as the abdomen has no bones. I concluded that they were from the bones of the dead fetus.  I probed the wound and removed many bones from the fetus's skull.
I continued doing this until I removed many bones, and the woman was in excellent condition.  She lived for a time, with a small amount of pus discharging from the area. I have included this unusual case here.
Because it contains knowledge and assistance for what the skilled physician attempts with his hands in treatment.
Chapter Seventy-seven.
It contains images of the instruments needed for removing the fetus.
Image of a spiral for opening the cervix.
This binder, with which books are bound, has two spirals at the ends of the planks, but this spiral should be gentler than the binder and made either of ebony or boxwood. The width of each plank should be the thickness of two fingers.
Their edges are about a finger's width, and their length is one and a half spans.  In the middle of the planks, there are two pegs of the same wood, fastened to them.  Their length is half a span or a little more, and their width is about two fingers or a little more.  These pegs.
They are the two that enter the cervix to open it when you turn the spirals; an image of another tool for the same purpose, gentler and lighter.
Made of ebony or boxwood, shaped like tongs, but with two pegs at the end, as you see.  The length of each peg is about a span, and their width is two fingers. If you wish to open the cervix with it...
Then place the woman on a couch, with her legs spread apart.  Insert these two pegs, together, into the cervix.  While holding the end of the instrument between her thighs, then open your hand with the instrument, as you would with tongs, to the extent that you want to open the cervix. Until the midwife achieves what she desires; an image of another spiral mentioned by the ancients.
Image of the instrument used to expel the fetus.
Image of the instrument used to crush the fetal head.
It resembles a pair of scissors, with teeth on the tip, as you see.  It can also be made into a rectangular shape, like tongs, with teeth like a saw's teeth, to cut and separate.
Image of a device as well.
Image of a hook.
This hook should have a little thickness so it doesn't break when pulling the fetus.  Image of a two-pronged hook.
Image of two broad dissecting instruments for cutting the fetus.
All these instruments, the more varied their types and the more prepared they are by the craftsman, the faster his work and the higher his standing amongst people.  Therefore, do not despise any instrument for having it prepared, for you will inevitably need it.
Chapter seventy-eight.
In the removal of the placenta.
If the placenta is retained after childbirth, it is necessary to instruct the woman to hold herself, then to make her sneeze with a cupping instrument, and to grasp your hand over her mouth and nostrils. If it comes out in this way, then do so; otherwise, take a certain amount.
Pierce a hole in the cover and place in it herbs that open the cervix, such as fennel, dill, parsley, chamomile, rue, and centaury, or some of these herbs.  Soak them with water and heat on the fire.  Then place a silver tube on the hole of the pot's cover, and the other end in the mouth of the uterus.
Hold it until the steam reaches the bottom of the uterus, then make her sneeze as we said, and the placenta will quickly come out.  If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, instruct the midwife to dip her left hand in the grease of the she-camel or the saliva of the horned viper.
Then, she should insert it into the vagina and search for the placenta. If she finds it, she should grasp it and pull it out slowly, little by little. If it is stuck deep in the uterus, insert the hand as we described, until she finds the placenta, and then pull it out slowly, gently.
So that the uterus does not fall when pulled too hard, it should be gently moved sideways, left and right. Then, the amount of pulling should be increased.  This will then respond and become free from the adhesion. If the cervix is closed, we have described treatment with sneezing, the pot remedy, and the herbs.
If it does not come out with all the methods described, be careful not to use force when pulling again. Instead, tie what has come out of it to the woman's thigh. Then, inject her with the four-component ointment.  It will cause suppuration after a few days.
It will dissolve and come out. However, if it becomes suppurated, a foul odor will rise from it to the stomach and head, harming the patient.  Therefore, the appropriate fumigation should be used.
Therefore, some early practitioners tried fumigation with incense, and dried figs.  The image of the apparatus with which the woman was fumigated during retention of menses and the placenta, and similar conditions, is as follows:
It is made of lead, resembling a funnel, or made of copper. The narrow end is placed at the vulva, and the wide end on the fire. Incense is placed on the embers, held until it is gone, and then more is placed.
Chapter Seventy-Nine.
In the treatment of the unperforated rectum.
Many boys are born with an unperforated rectum, often blocked by a thin membrane.  The midwife should pierce this membrane with her finger, or if not, use a sharp scalpel to dissect it, being careful not to touch the muscle.
Then apply wool soaked in wine and oil, and treat with ointments until healed.  If you fear it will close up again, insert a lead tube into the opening for many days, removing it when the child wishes to defecate.
The rectum may also be blocked by a scar from a wound or a tumor.  In this case, the scar tissue should be incised, and treated with the remedies mentioned previously, and with cauterization.

In treating warts that occur on the lower part of the body.
Warts that occur on the lower part of the body are a complex, thickened growth near the anus, externally or in the space on one side. They can be one or more in number.
If this thickened growth becomes chronic, it may open and discharge a watery, whitish fluid or thin pus.  Some of these warts may penetrate into the rectum and bowels.  Those that do not penetrate may be identified by the discharge of stool and flatulence when using the enema.
And worms may also be discharged from them.  Some warts, if in the space and penetrating to the bladder and urethra, may also penetrate to the hip joint and tailbone.  A wart that penetrates the rectum is also identified from the one that does not penetrate.
Insert your index finger into the rectum and insert a thin probe of copper or iron into the wart, if the wart is not winding.  If it is winding, insert a thin lead probe or a horsehair.
Until you feel the probe or hair in your finger. If you do not feel it at all, and nothing of stool, wind, or worms emerges from the opening, as we have said, know that it is not penetrative.  Proceed with treatment immediately.
If the wart penetrates the bladder or urethra, the sign is the discharge of urine from it and the failure of the area to heal with medications.  If it penetrates the hip joint or tailbone, the sign is the probe reaching there.
If it is not winding toward the bone, with pain on one side, and constant pus discharge, and if it does not respond to treatment and does not heal with ointment, then these penetrating warts will never heal.
Treatment is futile for those who attempt to treat them by the ignorant physicians.  As for the non-penetrating, non-chronic ones, healing is hoped for with iron, as I describe and as I have experienced.  The patient should lie on their back before you.
Raise the patient's legs up, and angle their thighs toward their abdomen.  Then, insert the copper or lead probe into the wart, if there is a winding path, to ascertain where the probe ends. If the patient feels it near the anus, then you should insert your index finger into the anus.
If you feel the probe has penetrated through your finger, exposed without feeling any skin or flesh between your finger and the probe, then know for certain that it is penetrating, and do not exhaust yourself with it, for there is no healing from it, as we have said.
They say that it heals in some people rarely.  Of the treatments that may be helpful, heat a thin cautery according to the size of the wart, as previously mentioned, and insert it into the wart until it reaches the vicinity of the anus, then repeat it two or three times.
So that you know that all the excess, compacted flesh, resembling a bird's feather tube, has been burned.  Then treat it with a wick moistened with clarified butter until the burned flesh comes out.  Then treat it with healing ointments, if it heals.
Otherwise, it will never heal with any other treatment.  However, if you insert the probe and it does not reach your finger in the anus, and there was a thick layer of flesh or skin between it and the probe, and you see the wart close to the skin's surface, then cut the skin from the beginning of the wart. And as you make the cut with the probe, which is in the wart, until the cut reaches where the tip of the probe ends, the probe is removed and falls out.  Then clean out the compacted flesh, resembling a bird's feather tube, and leave nothing of it.
Then treat it with healing ointments until it heals. If bleeding overwhelms you and prevents you from completing the excision of the flesh, the best thing to do and the quickest remedy is to cauterize it with fire or a sharp medicine, because cauterization with fire combines two beneficial actions: burning the excess flesh.
And stop the bleeding and dry the moisture. Then treat it with a wick moistened in clarified butter or powdered sulfur mixed with oil until the area becomes suppurated and the burned flesh comes out in the pus. Then treat the wound with healing ointments that promote the growth of firm flesh.
These are the remedies that have a binding and drying effect.  If it is bound, it has healed and there is no need for a return visit.  If the wart extends deep into the anus and is far from the surface of the body, insert your finger into the anus and probe with it.
If you feel the probe and between it and you there is a barrier of peritoneum or flesh, and it is close to penetrating, then there is no action in it except by way of hope and expectation, that is to use one of three methods: either to cauterize it, as we said.
Or to cut it open until you reach its bottom so that you can easily insert the wick and treatment from close.  Do not continue the incision lest you sever the surrounding muscle of the anus, causing involuntary bowel movements. Then treat it as we mentioned, and perhaps it will heal as we said.
Or to penetrate that barrier and pierce it after cutting it open close to the anus, as we said, either with a probe or another sharp-edged instrument. Then clean away all the coagulated flesh that is in the incision as far as you can with thoroughness.
Then close the whole wound, including the incision and the upper opening, until it is sealed and the wart remains open inside the anus, which will be less burdensome for the patient.  The wart may heal in this manner.
If, when inserting the probe into the wart, it is found on the side of the anus near the body surface, along with the skin and the ring of the anus, then use a probe with a pierced tip, like a shoemaker's awl, in this manner:
And insert a twisted thread of five threads or thereabouts into it. Then insert the probe with the thread into the wart until it reaches the bottom. If it is penetrating into the edge of the anus from within, near the anus.
Then pull the thread out of that hole by inserting your finger into the anus and pulling the end of the thread. Join both ends together and tighten them, and leave it for one or two days.  Every time the thread cuts through the flesh, tighten it firmly until the flesh between the ends of the threads breaks and falls away.  Then treat the wound until it heals and is cured.
If the opening of the wart is not penetrating, then penetrate it as much as possible, but if it is very deep, do not do this because of the muscle, so as not to cut it. Then do as we mentioned above until it heals.
The image of the pointed lancet with which warts are pierced should have a very sharp curvature on one side and a blunt side on the other, so as not to cut anything unnecessary, as you see.
Chapter Eighty-one.
Concerning hemorrhoids that bleed, their cutting, and the treatment of fissures.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either within the anus, resembling red sacs or like grapes, sometimes small, sometimes large, and blood constantly flows from them.
They may be single or multiple. Some are outside the anus, on its edges. However, those outside the anus are generally less moist; a yellowish or slightly bloody fluid constantly drips from them, and they are the same color as the skin.
Treatment for those inside the anus is to instruct the patient to defecate and strain until the anus protrudes and the polyps are visible. Then quickly grasp and remove them with forceps or a fingernail, cutting them at their roots.  If the forceps cannot hold them due to moisture and laxity,
Then grasp it with a rough cloth or a piece of sharpened wood, or pull it out with your fingers, and cut it. After cutting, sprinkle sharp powders over it to act as cauterization, or cauterize it as described in the chapter on cauterization.
Then treat it with further remedies until healed. If the anus does not protrude, administer an enema with a slight sting to wash what is inside the anus and encourage its rapid protrusion when the patient strains.  As for the polyps outside the anus, treatment is easy and simple.
To treat it, grasp it with your fingernail or forceps, cut it, and then treat it as previously described until healed.  If one dislikes cutting with iron, one should use a needle.  Take a threaded string and insert it into a needle.
Then pull the polyp upwards and pierce it with the needle at its base from the opposite side, wrap the ends of the string below the needle as it lies across, firmly pull the polyp, then tie the string and remove the needle.  Do this with all the polyps, leaving one unpierced.
To cause the excess blood to drain, place a cloth soaked in rose or quince fat on the anus, tell the patient to rest, and leave it until the polyps fall out. If the polyps fall out, treat them with ointments and other remedies until healed.
Concerning the treatment of fissures, they often arise from dryness of the stool and a blockage of the temperament. If they are chronic and no medicine is effective, it is necessary to scrape them with a scalpel or your fingernail until they become moist and the upper crust which prevents healing is removed.
Then treat it until it heals as it should. If it does not heal, scrape it more forcefully than before until it bleeds and peels, then treat it, and it will heal.
The Eighty-second Chapter.
On the treatment of ingrown nails, both ingrown and not, dry warts, and the pimple.
The ingrown nail is a round swelling, the color of the body, resembling the head of a nail, that can occur throughout the body, especially on the soles of the feet and toes, and causes pain when walking.
It is necessary to cut around the nail, and to grip it with a lancet or a hook and pull it out from its root, then treat it.  If you wish, cauterize it as described in the relevant chapter.  As for dry warts, each is a small, rough, hardened, round protuberance on the surface of the body.
They frequently appear on the hands of children.  Treatment involves stretching the wart, cutting it, or piercing it with a silk thread or a hair until it falls off.  If you wish, cauterize it as previously mentioned with fire or a strong medication.
Ingrown and non-ingrown warts can be removed with the instrument I have described in the treatment of the pimple.  The pimple is also a small, hardened, thick protuberance on the surface of the body, extending deep into it, and if cold affects it, it is felt as if stung by an ant.
It can be found throughout the body, and occurs most often on the hands.  Treatment involves taking a strong tube made from a goose feather or an eagle feather, placing the tube around the pimple so that the tube surrounds it from all sides, and then turning your hand with the tube until it breaks the skin around the pimple.
And it is placed deep into the flesh, and the pimple is pulled out from its root.  If you wish, you can do this with a copper or iron tube in this way:
The top of the tube should be smooth and flexible, so that the fingers can easily grip and twist it.  If you wish, cauterize the pimple as previously mentioned in the cauterization of warts in the chapter on cauterization.

Images of instruments used for injections in ailments of the rectum, diarrhea, and colic.
The injector may be made of silver, tin, or hollow or hammered copper.  Small and large versions of this instrument may be made, depending on the users. Those used to treat young children, or those with narrow or painful rectums, should be very slender.  Image of a large injector:.
Its upper funnel, where the syringe is attached, should be wide in this fashion, with a barrier where the syringe is attached, as you see.  The lower end, which enters the rectum, should be very smooth and tight, with two holes on one side and a single hole on the other side.
The size of the hole should be the thickness of a reed, or slightly thicker. The syringe, in which the medicines are placed, is made from the bladder of an animal or the thin skin of a sheep, in the form of a small tray, with a diameter of a span.
It is pierced with numerous holes, as it rotates, with the distance between each hole being the thickness of a finger.  Then a strong thread of doubled yarn, of ten threads or so, is inserted into these holes, and the syringe is thus gathered together like a tray. If the medicine is placed within it, tighten the head of the injector between the stones firmly, then inject with it. This is an image of the circular syringe and the hole:.
The method of injection is to fill the membrane or bladder with the medicine, while it is warmed to the patient's tolerance.  Be careful not to make it too hot or too cold. Then the patient lies on their back and raises their legs.
A mat or blanket is placed underneath.  Then, the tip of the injector is lubricated with oil, or egg white, or licorice saliva, or the like.  Then, it is gently inserted into the rectum.  Then, the syringe attendant holds the syringe with both hands and squeezes it firmly until all that is in the injector is emptied into the intestines.
Then the injector is removed, and the patient lowers their legs to the wall. If the medicine prompts expulsion, let him hold on as much as possible. If he sleeps with it all night, it will be more effective in relieving congestion. If it is used for ailments of diarrhea, and expulsion is rushed, then repeat the injection until recovery.
If there are hemorrhoids or painful tumors in the rectum, the injector should be very gentle, smooth, unlike the injectors used for children. This is a picture of a gentle injector with its skin stretched tightly over it.
Chapter Eighty-Four.
In the treatment of wounds.
I have previously mentioned the classification of treating conditions similar to burns, and I am now describing their treatment here with both hands and medications in detail.  I say that wounds differ according to the nature of the injury and the location of the wound.
The causes of wounds are numerous, such as a blow from a stone, a cut from a sword or knife, a stab from a lance or stick or arrow, and other similar things.
And as for wounds according to the location on the body, such as a wound on the head, neck, chest, abdomen, liver, and similar organs.
I am describing the treatment of some wounds to make them a standard and rule for all wounds, and I will begin with simple head wounds in particular, because the complex ones will be discussed in the first chapter of the third book of this book.
I say that if a simple wound occurs on the head, and it is not a fracture, then if it is from a blow with a stone or the like, and only the skin has been bruised, and the wound is large, and you fear the onset of a hot swelling, then immediately lance the wound with a lancet on the spot. Do not delay this, and draw out blood according to its strength, if nothing prevents the phlebotomy, especially if the blood flowing from the wound is little. Let the phlebotomy be from the opposite side of the injured area.
Warn the patient against fullness, drink, and thick foods. If something prevents the phlebotomy, then he should reduce his food intake, avoid meat and drinks, and if a hot swelling occurs on the wound, apply a cotton swab dipped in rose oil alone or with a drink that has astringent properties.
If you fear a hot swelling, then apply to the wound, if it is fresh and bloody and the air has not changed it (as I will describe to you shortly), and if the air has changed it, apply some ointments.
Until the pus matures, then treat it until it heals. If the wound is large, and from a sword cut or the like, and its edges do not come together naturally, then bring them together by stitching as I describe in the stitching of abdominal wounds.
If the skin has exposed the bone and is hanging, and its adhesion is only in a small amount, then cut it, and then treat the wound with medications that will build strong flesh to replace the skin.  Instruct the patient to eat foods with strength, such as heads and similar.
If a putrefaction occurs in the skin and it is not attached to the bone, then cut out all the putrefied part and remove it, and then treat it.  If in these wounds there is an artery or vein bleeding and the bleeding does not stop with medication, then search for the artery.
If you strike it and it does not cease, then sever it with a lancet and tie it off.  If the situation demands it, and what we have mentioned is not effective, cauterize it until the bleeding stops.  If these wounds are small and superficial, their treatment is easy and simple; it suffices to apply this powder while they are bloody.
Before the air changes it, the preparation of the powder is: one part frankincense, two parts cinnamon, and three parts slaked or unslaked lime.  Grind all of them, sift, and fill the wound with it, and tie it tightly so that it adheres firmly.
It will clot with the blood, then tie it from above with bandages, and leave it without loosening as long as it does not swell. The medicine will not be removed until it heals.  The lime alone can accomplish this if the frankincense and cinnamon are not available.
This action can also be performed with lime in many large wounds, if its application is skillful and the wounds are fresh and bloody, and the air has not altered them.  However, if the air has changed them somewhat, especially if it is in the summer.
Therefore, there is no effective use of this powder; treat it with the remedies we mentioned, applying some ripening ointments or a poultice of barley flour made with water and honey, until the pus forms.  Then treat it with other remedies until it heals.
If a slight fracture of the bone occurs in the wound, extract it with a compress.  We have described the treatment of head fractures in the section on the neck.  If the wound is on the neck, there is no difference in treatment from that of a simple head wound.
If a nerve or artery in the neck has been severed, if it is a nerve, there is no remedy except to avoid treatments that cause strong constriction, like verdigris, alum, and similar substances, because they harm and contract the nerve.
Nothing cold should be applied to the wound at all, because the essence of the nerve is cold, and its connection to the brain, which is the noblest of organs.  Use remedies that are gentle, such as soaked, washed, fresh water-soaked nard, or rose-and-lead ointment.
If the wound is also washed with fresh water and other mineral stones in this manner, and apply moist poultices.  If the wound is large, use sutures or bring the edges together with bandages, then treat it until it heals.
If the wound has a cavity and pus has collected at the bottom, drain it at the lowest point. If an artery has been severed in the wound and you see blood flowing, tie it off or cauterize it if necessary.
If part or all of the cartilages of the windpipe have been cut, but the veins are intact, bring the skin edges together with sutures on the windpipe. Do not touch the windpipe, but smooth it and return it to its natural shape, then tie it tightly and leave it for several days.
Then treat it with astringent and drying ointments until it heals.  If the wound has affected the bone, probe it. If there are bone fragments, remove all or as many as possible. If you cannot, leave it until the wound becomes necrotic and heals, making removal easier.
If the wound is fresh, sprinkle it with the powder we described. If bone in the wound becomes necrotic and forms a fistula, treat it as described in the chapter on chest and shoulder surgery.
If the wound is from a spear or knife, and you see a cavity, look to see if air comes out when the patient breathes. If so, know that it is a fatal wound. If there is no cavity and it is fresh with blood, do not apply the powder immediately nor tighten it, lest blood be trapped in the cavity.
Otherwise, it will recede to the heart and kill the patient. However, apply a drawing ointment, and reapply it twice a day. If you do not have an ointment, place a cotton pad in the wound to absorb the moisture that comes out of it, and have the patient sleep with the wound on top.
To drain what gathers there. If three days or more have passed and the patient has no spasms, bad palpitations, or shortness of breath, and you see that all their other conditions are sound, know that the wound is intact. Treat it with bandages and other remedies until it heals.
If it cannot be seen and the pus is constantly discharged, know that it has become a fistula. Treat it as such.  The patient should lie on their wound so that what gathers there may drain. If the wound is on the chest or back, treat it with the mentioned stitching.
If it is large or small, if it has affected the bone and broken off fragments, examine the wound and immediately remove those fragments if they are loose. If they are not loose, leave them until...
The wound will fester, and then it will be easier to remove them. As for other injuries occurring in other parts of the body, the treatment is the same as we have described.
Chapter Eighty-five.
On abdominal wounds, intestinal prolapse, and its repair.
A wound that appears on the abdomen may be large, small, or medium. A large wound may expose one or several intestines, making their repositioning and suture more difficult and challenging.
A small wound can also present difficulties in another way, making its repair more challenging. If the intestines are not immediately returned to their proper position, they swell and thicken, making them harder to reposition.  For this reason, the most favorable wound is the medium one, because the return of the intestines is not as difficult as it is with the other two types.
Know that there are four types of abdominal sutures. Two are general, suitable for abdominal and other bodily wound repairs, while the other two are specific, primarily used for abdominal wounds, though applicable to other injuries as well.
I will describe them to you one by one with explanation. If the wound is small and something from the intestines protrudes, its return may be difficult for one of two reasons: either because the wound is small, as we said, or because the intestines have been inflated due to the cold air.
If this is the case, it is necessary to warm it by dipping a sponge or damp cloth in lukewarm water, or water in which herbs such as iz-khar, su'adi, and sinbal have been boiled.  Apply this to the intestines until the swelling subsides.
A drink with a binding quality may also do this, and is better than plain water for resolving the swelling. If you see that the swelling has subsided, moisten the intestines with water in which khutmi or khabazi herbs have been boiled, as this will facilitate their return with greater ease.
If its return is still not possible after this treatment, make a small incision in the wound using a lancet for treating boils.  The initial treatment, if successful, is preferable to incision; only resorting to incision after all other methods have failed.  (Here is an illustration of the tool.)
Its one curved side is limited, and the other side is unlimited. The thin end is not as thin as a scalpel blade, but slightly blunted.  It is a tool resembling a small awl, as you see. If the wound is wide and the intestines have entered, then it is necessary that their return is to their natural position.
Its specific location, if possible, is best. However, if the wound is wide and in the lower abdomen, the patient should lie on their back with their legs raised higher than their head. If it is in the upper abdomen, the head and chest should be raised higher than the lower part of the body.
Likewise, if the wound is on one side of the abdomen, always make sure the side with the surgery is higher than the other side.  This is how it should be used in major and minor surgeries.
For minor surgeries, position it as best you can. Then, summon a helpful assistant who will hold the entire wound with both hands, bringing the edges together, and then expose sections of it to the surgeon one by one.
This is a common method of stitching. Take a needle or several needles, appropriate to the size of the wound. Leave about the thickness of the little finger at each edge of the wound.  Insert one needle without thread into the edges of the skin. Inserting it into the edges of the peritoneum (lining of the abdomen) beneath the skin from inside, so that the edges of the skin and the peritoneum are brought together, forming four layers.  Then, with a doubled thread around the needle, tighten it repeatedly from both sides until the edges of the wound are firmly joined.
Then, leave another space of about the thickness of a finger, and insert another needle.  Thread it with the same thread as the first needle, continuing in this manner using as many needles as required to close the entire wound.  The needles should be of medium thickness.
Because very thin needles readily cut through the flesh, and thick needles have difficulty penetrating the skin, therefore the needles should be of medium thickness.  The needle should not be inserted too close to the edge of the skin.
So that the flesh is not cut quickly and the wound reopens before healing, nor should the stitches be too far apart, so that the wound does not fail to heal. Then, cut off the ends of the needles so they do not harm the patient when they sleep, and make for them a protective covering of linen from each side, securing the ends of the needles.
And leave it until you know that the wound has healed. This type of stitching with needles is thus most suitable for minor surgeries, since one or two needles, or so, may suffice for the stitching.
As for the method of stitching for the common people, it is to gather together the four edges—that is, the two edges of the skin and the two edges of the peritoneum—at the same time with a needle that has an even thread of moderate thickness, and then, after the needle has passed through all four edges, it is returned from the same side from which it started.
So that the thread is interwoven from the top of the wound, making the stitches like the stitches used to secure bags of goods.  And place a space of the thickness of the little finger between each stitch. This type of stitching is known to all people.
With this stitching, a surgical procedure was performed on a man in his abdomen who had been wounded by a knife. The surgical opening was more than a span, and approximately two spans of the small intestine had protruded.  The wound was in the center of the abdomen.
After the intestines remained outside the wound for twenty-four hours, they were returned. The wound healed in about fifteen days, and he was treated until he was completely recovered.  He lived many years afterward, functioning normally in all aspects.  The physicians had previously judged that he would not recover.
Surprisingly, I did not treat it with any ointment, because I was in a location where there were no medications.  I used worn cotton on the wound twice a day, and I ensured it was washed with honey water until it healed.
As for one of the specific types of stitching, I mention it according to Galen's text: Begin stitching from the skin, inserting the needle from the outside to the inside.  Once the needle penetrates the skin and the muscle, continue in a straight line along the entire length of the abdomen.
Leave the edge of the peritoneum on the side where you inserted the needle.  Then insert the needle into the opposite edge of the peritoneum, from inside to outside.  Then, insert it again into this same peritoneal edge, from outside to inside.
Leave the edge of the peritoneum on this side, and insert the needle into its opposite edge, from inside to outside.  Along with inserting it into the peritoneum, insert it into the edge of the mesentery on its side, until it penetrates completely.
Then, beginning again from the same side, trace it along the edge of the peritoneum on the opposite side, and remove the needle from the skin near it, then return it to that skin and trace the edge of the peritoneum on the other side along this edge of the mesentery.
Remove it from the skin on its side. Do this repeatedly, repeating it until all the surgical wound is stitched in this manner.  The general description of this stitch is like that of a furrier's stitching for furs.
By stitching the peritoneum once from one side with the edge of the skin, and leaving it once from the other side, until it is empty.  As for the second, special type of stitching, also mentioned by Galen, this is his text.
It is that you stitch it in the manner some healers stitch it, by bringing every part to its matching counterpart naturally; joining the edge of the peritoneum to its other edge, and the edge of the mesentery to its other edge.  This is as I describe to you.
The needle should be inserted into the edge of the mesentery closest to you, from the outside, piercing it from the outside to the inside; leaving the edges of the peritoneum. Then return the needle and pierce from the outside to the inside of both edges of the peritoneum; then return it again.
And pierce it from the inside to the outside in the other edge of the mesentery on the opposite side. This type of stitching is better than the common, easy stitching previously mentioned. This is Galen's text. Some have said that stitching the abdomen with two needles can be successful. That is, to insert a single thread into both of them, beginning by inserting the needle from your side, piercing it to the other side. Then insert the other needle from the opposite side, piercing it to your side, in the manner of stitching sacks.
Know that if the rupture is in the middle of the abdomen, stitching it is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen.  As for treating the wound, its treatment is the same as for other wounds.  If you find the wound fresh with its blood before the air alters it, replace the intestines, stitch it, and make it firm, then apply a medicated dressing.
If the wound has been altered by air, apply some of the ointments you have available until it suppurates, the sutures fall out, and the peritoneum and mesentery adhere.  Then treat it like any other wound until it heals.
If you do not have medicines available, apply to it, from when it begins to suppurate, old cotton.  Change it twice a day as I instructed you until it heals.  If the wounds are simple, you will not need any further treatment in most cases, unless you fear the wound will cause pain to the major organs.
You should dip soft wool in moderately warm oil or rose oil and place it around the areas between the groin and the armpits.  If he feels pain or foulness in his intestines, which often occurs, irrigate with a lukewarm, black astringent drink.
Especially if the foulness has reached the intestines and become a penetrating wound into the interior.  Know that what is thick from the intestines heals more easily, and what is thin from them heals more difficultly.
As for the intestine known as the jejunum, it will not heal at all from a wound occurring in it, due to the many and large veins within it, the thinness of its substance, and its proximity to the nature of the nerve. If the protruding part of the wound is the mesentery, and you have caught it promptly, return it according to how you returned the intestine itself.
If it has been a while and it has turned green or black, you should tie it with a thread above the blackened area so as to avoid a blood flow, for there are veins and arteries in the mesentery. Then cut what is below that ligament.
And you should hang the ends of the thread from below the wound, outside of it, so it is easier for you to pull it out and remove it when the mesentery falls and the wound becomes purulent.  This describes a wound that appears in the intestine. Now, if a perforation in the intestine appears and is small...
For it may sometimes heal in some people, as I have seen a person who had been wounded in the abdomen by a spear thrust, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach. The wound healed and became a fistula, from which feces and wind were expelled. I treated it, not expecting a cure. I continued to treat him until he recovered and the area healed.  When I saw the area had healed, I feared for the patient that some misfortune might occur in his belly, but no such misfortune occurred at all, and he remained in the best of health. Indeed, he ate, drank, engaged in sexual activity, bathed, and exercised in his service.  Some experienced practitioners have stated that if a small wound appears in the intestine, it should be treated in this manner.
One should take large, large-headed ants, then bring together the edges of the wound.  Then one places one of these ants, its mouth open, on the edges of the wound. When it grasps and closes its mouth, its head will be severed; it will adhere and not come loose. Then another ant is placed near the first one.
Continue doing this with several ants, according to the size of the wound. Then close and sew the wound. These heads remain adhered to the intestines until the intestines heal and the patient recovers without any harm.  The intestines can also be stitched with fine thread.
One takes the end of this thread from the animal's intestines after it has entered the needle.  Then, one takes the end of the thread from the intestines and cuts it, and ties a fine linen thread to it.  Then that thread is inserted into the needle. The intestinal thread is used to stitch the intestines, then returned to the abdomen.  This type of stitching with ants and intestines is only a matter of hope and expectation.
However, if the tear is large and extensive, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines, there is no remedy, and there will be no recovery at all.
Chapter Eighty-Six.
On the treatment of the common cold and nasal polyps.
Know that any wound or tumor that becomes chronic, longstanding, and ulcerated, without healing and continually discharging pus, is generally called a fistula, wherever it may be located.  And we call it a cold or a fistula.
It is, in fact, a hard, compacted, white mass, without pain, having a cavity like the cavity of a bird's feather.
Therefore, some have called it a feather.  Sometimes it is moist, continually discharging pus, and sometimes the moisture might stop. This moisture can be copious or scant, thick or thin.
I have previously stated in the classification of surgical conditions that any ulcer that does not heal and in which flesh does not grow is due to one of nine causes: either insufficient blood in the body, or poor quality blood, or the presence of hard flesh within the ulcer and on its edges that prevents the growth of healthy flesh. Or because the ulcer is excessively contaminated and dirty, or because the ulcer itself is foul and the material it discharges is poor in quality, or because the treatment is unsuitable, or because of a widespread epidemic disease in the locality, or because of a local affliction.
Or because the ulcer is excessively contaminated and dirty, or because the ulcer itself is foul and the material it discharges is poor in quality, or because the treatment is unsuitable, or because of a widespread epidemic disease in the locality, or because of a local affliction. As was observed in the city of Zaragoza, where the maturation of diseases is difficult and the healing of tumors is slow by nature, or because it contains one or multiple bones.  All of these causes, their signs, and their treatments with medications were detailed in the classification.
Here I must inform you of the treatment for fistulas and nasal congestion, which is done by manual means. Know that fistulas can occur in all parts of the body, some terminating in large vessels, arteries, or nerves.
or to the peritoneum, or to the intestines, or to the bladder, or to a rib, or to a vertebra of the spine, or to a joint of the complex joints like the hand and foot, and some lead near to a major organ and the like.
Those fistulas of this nature are among the difficult-to-heal diseases, which do not accept treatment and dealing with them is arduous and fraught with ignorance.  If there are fistulas that do not reach the locations mentioned, and I hope for and expect treatment for them.
If you wish to ascertain this, take a probe of copper or iron. If the fistula runs straight, probe it with that. If there is a bend in the fistula, probe it with a thin lead probe, since lead is pliable.
If it slants upon entry and bends toward the bend, if the fistula has many openings that you cannot locate with the probe, inject one opening; the moisture you inject will travel to the other openings and flow out.
Then, investigate in any way possible to determine if there is bone or nerve, if the fistula's bottom is distant or close, or if it is a single fistula with many openings.  Determine all of this to the best of your ability by inquiring and examining the pain when you touch the area.
And similar are the signs and causes of the tumor.  If you ascertain all of this accurately, then proceed to treatment with confidence.  It is then to look to see if...
If the fistula is visible, close, or in a healthy area distant from a joint, nerve, artery, vein, or one of the locations mentioned to you, then incise the fistula as described previously, and remove the hardened tissue, corrupted flesh, and excessive flesh from within.
And treat any flesh or warts that grow in its mouth, until it heals. If the fistula is deep-seated and is straight, then you should incise it deeply as much as possible and clean it of all corrupted flesh.
Then use finely twisted, sharp medicaments and push them into the fistula's bottom, which you can locate with an instrument. Do this repeatedly until the sharp medicine consumes any remaining corruption in the fistula's bottom.
Then apply ointments that promote healthy flesh growth until it heals. If it does not heal with that, cauterize it as previously described. If the cause of the fistula is bone, and you are certain of this, explore and incise it as I have instructed you, unless something prevents you from doing so.
If it is a vein, nerve, or a major organ, as we said, and the bone is exposed to you, and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then scrape it until its corruption is gone, then treat it with something that will heal it until it is cured. If it does not heal and the pus persists as it was,
Know that you have not reached complete eradication of the corruption.  Expose all of it again, and thoroughly scrape and clean it to the best of your ability. Then apply a dressing. If it heals, well and good. If not, know that the corruption lies in a deep, hidden place of decay. Expose it all again.
Thoroughly scrape and clean it with the utmost effort, if the corrupt bone is small and you can extract it, remove it with the finest forceps suitable for this.
If there are many bones, thoroughly remove them all; do not leave any behind. If any ligaments obstruct their removal, and cutting them poses no risk, cut those ligaments and the flesh, if any, and free the bones.
If you cannot remove the bones at that time, apply something to the wound to cause putrefaction, and leave it for some days until the flesh and ligaments around those bones are putrid. Protect the wound so that the opening you made during your work does not close.
Instead, if you fear this, apply a cotton swab soaked in powdered sulfur mixed with oil, or a cotton swab soaked in Egyptian ointment or one of the green ointments.  When these ligaments become putrid and the bones separate, they will be easier to remove and extract.
If it is a single large bone, such as a thigh bone or a similar bone, and only its surface has become corrupted, thoroughly scrape it to remove the blackness and corruption, then close the wound.  If a large portion has become corrupted, and the corruption has reached the bone marrow, it is necessary to spread the wound.
Cut it completely to where the corruption ends.  Then treat it until it heals.  I will tell you about a case of a man who had a corruption in his leg to provide an example and aid to your treatment.  This man was young.
About thirty years had passed, and he had pain in his leg due to a cause originating within the body, such that materials reached the leg and swelled into a large tumor.  There was no external cause.  Then time went on with the errors of the physicians, until the swelling opened.
A large amount of material flowed from it, and he was poorly treated, until the leg became rotten and had many openings, all discharging pus and bodily moisture.  A group of physicians treated him for approximately two years, but none of them were skilled surgeons.
Until they came to me. I saw his leg, and a large amount of material flowed from those openings. The man's body had wasted away, and his complexion had turned yellow.  I inserted a probe into one of those openings, and the probe reached the bone.  Then I examined all the openings.
I found that some of them connected to each other from all sides of the leg.  I proceeded to open one of those openings until I exposed some of the bone.  I found it corrupted, decayed, blackened, and rotten, with holes penetrating to the marrow.  I reported what I had uncovered.
I removed the corrupted bone, and I believe that there was no other corruption in the bone except what I had cut and exposed. I believe I had removed it completely.  Then I used joining medications for a long time, but the wound did not heal.  Then, I exposed the bone again, beyond the first exposure.
I found the corruption connected to the bone. I exposed what I saw of that corruption.  Then I attempted to mend it, but it did not heal or unite. Then I exposed it again.  I continued to cut the bone piece by piece and attempted to mend it, but it would not heal, until I had cut approximately a span of bone.
I removed it with its marrow.  Then I mended it with medications, and it healed quickly and recovered.  This repetition of work and incision was necessary because of the patient's weakness and low tolerance, and my fear of his death, as he frequently fainted from excessive vomiting.  He recovered completely.
Firm flesh grew in place of the bone, and his condition improved in his body. His strength returned, and he was able to manage his affairs.  He suffered no impairment in his walking that harmed him in any way.  If a bone had broken in any part of the body,
It is necessary to expose it in this manner: take a bandage and tie it to the end of the protruding bone.  Have someone pull it upward.  Then take another bandage made of thicker wool than the first.
Then tie it to the flesh beneath the bone, pulling its end to draw the flesh downward.  Expose the flesh in the area you want to expose so that the saw does not injure the flesh. Place a piece of wood or board beneath the bone from below, firmly.
For if you do this, the saw will not be prevented from cutting the corrupted bone.  The incision should be slightly above the area of corruption, so that there is no corruption within the bone's cavity, which would not appear on the surface.  This will prevent you from needing to make another incision.
If the bone is corrupted but not protruding, and its parts are joined together, with the corruption in the middle or in some part of it, expose the flesh from all sides. Then place the wood underneath, and make the incision from the side where the corruption is located.
Once you have finished the incision, make another one on the other side.  Let the incision be slightly away from the corruption, as we said. If the corruption is in a joint, cut the corrupted joint itself, and make an incision on the bone where it connects on the other side.
If the corruption is in the connection of two joints, there is no remedy except removal. If the corruption is in the hand or foot, the treatment is extremely difficult. However, you should scrape off the corruption, however it presents itself, and remove and cleanse it in any way possible.
By whatever means you can make it work, as long as you do not encounter a vein or nerve.  Know that the saws and chisels for cutting these bones are numerous, depending on the position, arrangement, thickness, thinness, size, smallness, hardness, and fragility of the bones. Therefore, it is necessary to prepare a tool suitable for each type of work.
Know that the work itself will indicate the type of tool you need, if you have long experience and knowledge of the arts of this craft, because the expert craftsman, having seen many types of diseases, knows well. He can thus devise tools for each disease, and I will illustrate for you a variety of tools at the end of this chapter.

Chapter seventy-eight.
In the severing of limbs and the spreading of bones.
Limbs may become putrid either from an external cause or from an internal one.  If you treat this corruption with medicinal remedies and the treatment proves ineffective, and you see the corruption spreading in the limb, nothing will stop it.
Then you should sever the limb where the corruption has reached, so that the patient is saved from death or from a great affliction worse than losing the limb. A sign of this happening is that the limb will turn black, as though fire had burned it.
Or it may rot after becoming black, so that the rot spreads to the adjacent limb and takes hold of the entire body.  Proceed with its amputation; likewise if the cause of the corruption is from the sting of venomous creatures, such as the sea scorpion, serpent, or centipede, and the like.
If the corruption or sting is in the tip of a finger, amputate the finger, and do not delay the spread of the corruption to the hand. Likewise, if it has taken hold of the hand, amputate it from the base of the forearm, and do not delay the spread of corruption until it affects the elbow of the arm.
Likewise, if it has reached the arm, amputate the arm at the elbow joint itself. If the corruption spreads and you see it reaching towards the shoulder, do not amputate the shoulder at all, for that would lead to the patient's death. Employ other treatments to the extent of your ability.
Likewise, do this with the leg. If the corruption has reached the toe, amputate the toe at one of the phalanges. If it has reached the foot, amputate the entire leg. If it has ascended to the knee, amputate the leg at the knee joint.
If the corruption has reached above the knee, there is no remedy but to abandon it and allow the patient to succumb to death. The method of amputating or spreading the limb is to tie a bandage at the lower portion of the place you intend to cut, and tie another bandage above the place.
One attendant stretches the lower bandage downward, and another stretches the upper bandage upward. You yourself expose the flesh between the bandages with a wide scalpel until all the flesh is uncovered, then cut or spread it.  It is necessary to place linen cloths on all sides.
So that the saw does not touch the correct place and cause the patient excessive pain and a hot swelling. If bleeding occurs during your work, cauterize the place quickly or apply some hemostatic agents, then return to your treatment until you are finished.
Then bandage the injured limb with a suitable bandage and treat it until it heals. I tell you an example of a case that occurred to a man in his leg, this very affliction which I am describing to you.  It was a blackening of the leg with a burning sensation like fire.
This corruption first appeared in his finger, until it spread to the whole limb.  The man, when he saw the corruption spreading through the limb and the intense pain and burning, cut it off at the joint, and recovered.
After a long time, this same corruption appeared in his index finger.  He came to me, and I treated it with the remedies I had on hand, after cleaning his body.  The corruption did not yield, and it began to spread to the other finger.
Until the corruption spread to the whole hand, and he asked me to cut it off.  I refused, hoping to be able to control the corruption, and fearing for his life if his hand were amputated because he was weak.  When he lost hope in me, he left for his home.
I was later told that he ultimately cut off his entire hand and recovered.  I have related this story to be a help in similar illnesses, and as an example for guidance.
Chapter Eighty-eight.
In the treatment of abscesses and how to inject medicines into them.
If a tumor occurs in some fleshy organ and the duration of the tumor extends to a period, and then it bursts or opens and expels all the contents that were within, leaving the area empty as if it were a vessel.
And the skin on it, like a tattered garment, has thinned, and was not so deeply corrupted as to affect the bone, nerve, or ligament.  Therefore it is entitled to be called an abscess, and is not termed a fistula unless the duration extends to the point that the corruption affects any of these organs.
Then it is called a fistula or a sore, and its treatment is to cut away all that skin, as it surrounds it, especially if it has thinned and become like a tattered garment, and you are certain that it is not adherent to the area due to its corruption.
If you suspect that the skin is still attached, and the corruption has not reached that degree, and there is still thick flesh on the skin, then treat it with an injection.  Observe the abscess; if it is large and the pus emanating from it has a foul odor, then inject it with the Egyptian medicine.
Which is vinegar, oil, honey, and verdigris, equal parts, mixed in a vessel and cooked over fire until the medicine thickens and reaches the consistency of honey, then take what you need of it, dilute it with water and honey, and inject it into the abscess.  Tie off its opening and leave the medicine inside for about two hours.
Then remove it by squeezing; repeat this for several days until the abscess is cleansed and the foul odor is gone.  You may also inject it with ash water, if you do not have the other medicine. This means take the ashes of the wood of vines or the ashes of oak wood and pour water over it.
Then filter it and inject it until you are certain that the abscess has been washed out. If the patient is not responsive to the Egyptian medicine or ash water, then inject it with water and honey mixed with some pulverized verdigris.
Or inject it with honey and drink mixed together, because honey cleanses and washes, and the drink adheres to the abscess, especially if the drink has a strong astringent and drying quality.  If you have done this repeatedly and are certain that the abscess is no longer corrupted, then inject it with something that promotes the growth of flesh within it.
For example, take some of the palm ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and a binding drink, or inject it with other remedies and ointments whose properties we have described in the section on ointments. If the opening of the abscess is narrow and the injecting tube cannot fit,
Widen it slightly with an iron instrument, or place a thread dipped in Egyptian ointment or Syrian ointment within it, so that it widens. Similarly, if the opening is also wide, bring together its edges with stitches, leaving as much space as necessary for the injecting tube without excess.
Also, if the opening from which pus is draining is elevated, then slit it at the lowest point so that the pus drains downwards, because if the pus is confined within the depths of the abscess, it prevents the flesh from growing there.
If you cannot slit the abscess downwards as desired, then try to position the limb so that the pus drains easily, as you find convenient, and make sure that no pus remains trapped inside.
As for the uniting remedies that are applied to the abscess from the outside, and how to apply them, take one of the uniting ointments that matches what you want, and spread it on a linen cloth; let the cloth cover the entire abscess. Then, using scissors, cut a hole slightly larger than the opening of the abscess.  Spread some soft ointment on another cloth, sized to fit the hole, and place it on top, slightly away from the abscess opening to facilitate the drainage of pus. Do not remove the larger cloth until later.
For several days, the cloth over the abscess opening should be removed frequently to drain the collected pus.  Note whether the pus is copious or scant, and whether it is mature or immature.
Also, examine the abscess itself to see if the patient feels pain, and if there is swelling.  If your treatment continues in this manner and you see the substance draining from the abscess opening is scant,
Know that the abscess has adhered, or is close to adhering.  Then, treat it again tomorrow or on the third day.  When you treat the wound, replace the cloths and renew the ointment.  If thin pus is discharged from the abscess after a long period, do not despair of its adhesion.
Then recovery is near, because some people experience slow tissue growth in their wounds, and others experience rapid growth.  If non-matured pus is discharged from the abscess after many days, know that the abscess has not adhered.  If the abscess adhesion is delayed,
Then, increase the application of drying medicines.  Let the medicines be moist in consistency, but dry in potency, like the palm ointment, if more opoponax has been added.  A particularly effective treatment is to use palm ointment.
It can be treated with rose-water and sprinkled with moderate-strength old wine, then mixed with it and used.  A similar process can be employed if you do not have palm ointment.  Honey, when boiled until it thickens, may be used instead, or take myrrh, aloe, and frankincense, grind them all together and sprinkle them onto the honey while it's on the fire. Then apply it to a cloth and bind it to the abscess, or apply the boiled, thickened honey, sprinkle the medicines onto it, and place the cloths over it and bind it.
Similar treatments can use long-stemmed fennel, iris root, chickpea flour, and wormwood, either singly or combined. Grind and sift them, sprinkle them on the described honey, and use it. If the abscess persists and does not heal with this treatment, know that there is corruption within it.
If it has affected the bones, or other hard nerves or ligaments, treat it like a boil as previously described.
Eighty-ninth Chapter.
In the treatment of the impacted nail, the injured fingernail, the removal of excess finger, and the separation of joined fingers.
The "daḥs" is a thick growth of flesh that develops beneath the toenail or fingernail, and sometimes on other fingers. If left untreated for too long, it swells into a hot tumor.
Or it may fester and decay, even consuming the nail's root, perhaps destroying it entirely, and the decay may even reach the bone, so that it gives off a foul odor and the fingertip becomes broad and discolored, turning livid. If you treat it with the methods described in the previous section, and the treatment is not successful,
then you should cut away all the excess growth from the nail with a blade, and then cauterize the wound.  Cauterization is very effective in this case. However, if the bone is healthy and the nail is also healthy,
and if the nail's edge has pressed the flesh inward, causing it to be poked and irritated, then a thin strip of material should be placed under the edge of the offending nail, lifting it upward, and the flesh should be carefully severed.
and apply caustic, burning medicines to the remaining flesh until it is all gone, then treat it with ointments until it heals.  However, if the decay has affected the bone, then you must cut away and remove that bone, as it will never heal as long as there is infected bone.
If you see decay and ulceration spreading along the finger, cut it off at one of the phalanges, as previously described, and then treat it until healed.  If the nail is struck or injured and causes severe pain, you should first apply blood-letting.
Then, using a sharp scalpel, split the nail with an oblique cut from top to bottom, and be careful not to reach the flesh underneath the nail, as this would cause the afflicted area severe pain and lead to excessive flesh growth at the site. Then treat the area with remedies that alleviate pain.
And as for the extra finger which sometimes grows on the hands of some people, it may be entirely fleshy, or it may contain bone in some parts, or it may have a nail, and some parts may grow from the base of a joint of some fingers.
Or it may grow on some of the finger's phalanges; those which grow on some of the finger's phalanges do not move, and those which grow near the finger joint may move.  Whatever part is purely fleshy can be easily removed by cutting it at its base with a broad scalpel.
However, if it grows from the base of the joint, treatment is difficult; therefore, avoid cutting it.  If it grows on the finger at one of the phalanges, one should first cut the flesh in a circular fashion, around the bone, then use one of those appropriate saws to divide the bone.
Then treat it until it heals.  As for the adhesion that sometimes occurs between fingers, it frequently happens, either present at birth, or resulting from the healing of a wound, burn, or similar injury.  It is necessary to sever this adhesion.
So that the fingers return to their natural state.  Then place between them a piece of linen or cloth soaked in rose oil, so that they do not quickly reunite; or place a thin sheet of lead between them, until the area heals properly.
Likewise, if adhesion occurs between a finger and the palm, sever the adhesion in a manner appropriate for the proper form of the limb.
Chapter Ninety.
In cutting the tendons.
Tendons are twisted, thick veins filled with dark, black fluid that occur in most parts of the body, but most frequently in the legs, particularly in the legs of runners, carriers, and laborers. First, it is necessary to use frequent vigorous rubbing of the body to remove the black fluid.
Then, bleed the affected person with leeches.  As for treatment with iron, there are two types: one is to cut and remove the black blood; the other is to slice the tendon and remove it entirely.  For cutting, first soak the leg in hot water.
Until the thick, murky blood dissolves.  Then, tie the patient's leg from above the thigh to below the knee with a bandage.  Then, cut the tendon in one, two, or three wide incisions.
Then, with your hand, remove the black blood from the bottom of the leg to the top, and from the top to the bottom, until you have removed as much blood as you deem sufficient, or as much as the patient's strength can tolerate. Then, bandage it and instruct him to avoid foods that produce black fluid.  Emetics and bleeding should be repeated.
When the veins are filled and harm the patient, as for slicing, it is done this way: shave the patient's leg if it has much hair, then have them enter a bath and soak their leg in hot water until it turns red and sweats, or have them exercise vigorously.
If a bath is not available to heat the limb, then cut the skin along the tendon, either near the knee or at the heel.  Then, open the skin with hooks and dissect the tendon from all sides until it is visible to the touch.
When it appears, you will see it red and shiny.  Once it is freed from the skin, it will appear like a tendon. Then, insert a probe beneath it until it is raised and exposed beyond the skin.  Secure it with a smooth, blunt hook. Then, make another incision near the first incision, about the width of three fingers.
Then, peel the skin from the tendon until it is exposed. Then, raise it with the probe as before and secure it with another hook, as you did at first. Then, make another incision, or several incisions, if necessary.
Then, dissect and cut it at the end of the incision near the heel. Then pull and dissect it until it emerges from the second incision, then pull it toward the incision above it. Do this until you pull it out through the third incision, the highest of all the incisions. Then cut it.
If pulling and dissecting does not work, insert a needle with a strong, doubled thread, tie it, and pull it. Insert the probe beneath it and twist your hand in every direction until it emerges, being careful not to break it.  If it breaks, dissecting it will be very difficult.
This will cause harm to the patient. Once you have completely dissected it, place wool soaked in a beverage and rose oil or other oil on the surgical site. Treat it until it heals.  If the tendon is spasmodic, with twists and turns in various directions.
If it is not straight, as we said, you should make an incision along each twist and turn. Then secure it with hooks until you have dissected the entire tendon.  Be careful when making the incisions not to cut or injure the tendon, for this will make its dissection difficult, and you will have wasted your efforts.
Image of the incision used for the tendon.
Image of the blind hook.
It should not have a curve like other hooks, nor should the tip be sharp, so as not to injure the tendon.  It should be thick and smooth in its bend, because if it is thin, it will cut the tendon with its thinness.  Rather, it should have the advantage of thickness, as we said.
Chapter Eighty-nine.
On the tendons of the civil body.
This tendon arises in the legs in hot countries like Hijaz and the Arab countries, and in hot, sparsely fertile lands.  It may also arise in other parts of the body besides the legs, arising from a festering that occurs beneath the skin.
As it occurs within the bodies of snakes and worms, and the festering of gourds and worms that develop between skin and flesh.  A sign of the beginning of this tendon's occurrence is that a severe inflammation occurs in the leg, then the area swells, and then the tendon begins to emerge from the location of the swelling.
As if a root of a plant or animal.  When its tip appears, it should be wrapped around a small piece of lead weighing one to two dirhams, tied, and the lead left hanging from the leg.
Whenever anything emerges from it to the outside, wrap it in the lead and tie it. If it grows excessively, cut off some of it and wrap the remainder. Do not cut it from its origin before all of it emerges, because if you cut it, it will retract and enter the flesh, causing a swelling, festering, and a bad ulcer in the area.
Therefore, it should be gently coaxed and pulled out little by little until its entirety is expelled and nothing remains in the body.  Sometimes, this tendon can grow to five or ten cubits in length in some people.
I have heard that it has emerged from a man to a length of twenty cubits.  If it breaks during your treatment, insert a reed into its opening and push it deep into the body until all the material within is expelled.  Attempt to heal the area with medications for several days.
Then treat it with the treatment for tumors.  This tendon may have many branches, especially if it appears in a joint of the leg or on the leg itself, creating many openings and branches emerging from each opening. Treat it as described in the classification and as previously mentioned.
Chapter Ninety-Two.
On the fissure on the worm generated beneath the tendon, called the affliction of cattle.
This disease is called in some of our countries "affliction of cattle" because it often affects cattle.  It is a small, single worm that develops between the skin and flesh, crawling throughout the body, both upward and downward.
Its movement from one limb to another can be sensed, until it pierces the skin at a spot, emerging and creating a lesion from the corruption of certain fluids, as occurs with worms, snakes, and gourd seed in the abdomen.
Its danger lies in its potential to crawl throughout the body, ascend to the head, and reach the eye, possibly rupturing it and causing its loss.  This frequently occurs.  Therefore, if you wish to treat it and extract it, this can only be done when it is crawling and its presence is sensed.
Therefore, you should tightly bind the area above and below it with a good bandage, then cut open the area and remove it. If it has burrowed into the flesh and you cannot find it, apply cauterization with fire to the affected area until it is burned.  Its greatest potential harm is the damage to the eye, as mentioned.
If you see it has moved to the head, near the eye, tightly bind the area below it on the forehead, then cut open and remove it.  The patient should be treated with laxatives to cleanse the body of corrupt fluids and should avoid foods that promote corruption.
Chapter Ninety-Three.
Concerning the incision of the disease known as the "nafar".
This disease, called "nafar" in our country, is a pain that appears in certain parts of the body and then spreads from one part to another.  I have seen it as I describe to you.
I was called to a woman in the countryside who showed me a slight swelling in the vein of her arm.  After an hour, I saw this swelling creeping up her arm towards her shoulder as quickly as mercury.
If it moves from one place to another, the pain leaves that spot and settles in the shoulder.  Then, after an hour, it spread throughout the rest of her body, even to the other arm, and she told me it was circling her entire body as I had witnessed.
I was astonished by the speed of its movement from one part of the body to another.  Before this, I had only heard of this disease causing pain to move from one part to another, but I had never witnessed it firsthand as I saw in this woman.
I attributed it only to the fact that the woman was from the desert, with a lean body and exposed veins.  This is why this moving pain was evident.  It should not appear in a similar manner in those who are wealthy, with soft bodies and hidden veins.
If you wish to treat it, and the patient feels the pain, if it manifests as we have described, then tightly bind above and below the affected area with urgency, and cut into it until the trapped wind is released and the pain subsides.
If you do not see it, treat it by shaking the body and remedies that expel and disperse wind, like rotten seed and the seed of the skabinge plant, and similar medications.
Chapter Ninety-Four.
On the removal of arrows.
Arrows differ according to their types and the locations where they strike the body.  Their differences by type include large and small, hollow and solid glass ones, and those with three or four angles.
Some have tongues, and some have splinters.  As for their location in relation to the body's organs, they fall into two categories: either in major hollow organs like the brain, heart, liver, lungs, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and the like. If an arrow strikes one of these organs, and the signs of death, which I will describe to you later, appear, then you should avoid removing the arrow, for in most cases, death will follow. If these bad signs do not appear and the arrow is not deeply embedded within the organ, remove it and treat the wound.  Signs of a head injury by an arrow piercing the bone and injuring the meninges include severe headache, stupor, and dizziness.
If these bad signs do not appear and the arrow is not deeply embedded within the organ, remove it and treat the wound.  Signs of a head injury by an arrow piercing the bone and injuring the meninges include severe headache, stupor, and dizziness. Redness in the eyes and tongue, spasms, mental confusion, vomiting, and possibly bleeding from the nostrils or ears.  Speech and voice may be lost.  A white, gruel-like substance may flow from the wound, similar to the watery discharge of meat.
If these signs appear, refrain from treating the afflicted person and removing the arrow, if it has not already come out.  As for the signs of an arrow striking the heart, if it is near the left breast, and you feel it as if it has lodged in something solid rather than something hollow...
The arrow may also move with a pulsating motion, and black blood may flow from the wound.  This may be followed by cold extremities, cold sweat, and unconsciousness. Know then that death is inevitable.  A sign of an arrow wounding the lung is a frothy blood discharge from the wound.
The blood vessels near the neck swell, and the patient's complexion changes.  He breathes rapidly and craves inhaling cool air. If the arrow strikes the diaphragm in the chest, it is usually near the small ribs, and the breathing will be heavy with severe pain.
He sighs and all the shoulder muscles move. If the arrow strikes the liver, intense pain follows, and blood resembling the liver in color flows from the wound. If the arrow strikes the stomach, undigested food may be discharged from the wound.
The matter is clear; if the arrow strikes the abdomen, causing festering and discharge of feces, stool, or ruptured intestines from the wound, there is no hope for treatment or removal of the arrow. If the arrow strikes the bladder, urine will be discharged.
If something protrudes from the wound and the patient's pain intensifies, know that he is doomed.  However, other organs, such as the face, eyes, throat, shoulder, arm, spine, collarbone, thigh, leg, and similar organs, usually survive the ordeal.
Unless the arrow strikes an artery or nerve and is not poisoned, I inform you of some observations about these arrows to guide your treatment.  An arrow struck a man's eye socket, at the root of his nose.
I extracted an arrow from the other side, beneath the earlobe, and he recovered without any harm to his eye.  I also removed another arrow for a Jew, which had lodged in his eyelid, under the lower eyelid. The arrow was mostly hidden, and I only retrieved the small tip which was attached to the shaft.
It was a large arrow from a composite bow, with a square, smooth iron head, lacking ears.  The Jew recovered without any further eye trouble.  I also removed another arrow from the throat of a Christian.  The arrow was Arabic.
It had ears, and I cut between the windpipes, as it had penetrated his throat.  I carefully removed it, and the Christian survived and recovered.  I also removed another arrow from a man's abdomen, and we thought he would die from it.
After about thirty days, and without any improvement, I incised around the arrow and carefully extracted it. He recovered and suffered no further harm. I saw a man with an arrow in his back, where the wound had become inflamed.
Seven years later, the arrow emerged from the base of his thigh. I saw a woman with an arrow in her abdomen, where the wound had become inflamed. The arrow remained, and her condition did not change; she experienced no adverse effects on her normal activities.
I saw another man with an arrow in his face, where the wound had become inflamed. He experienced little pain.  Many cases like this occurred.  I removed an arrow from a Sultan's commander, who had an arrow lodged in the middle of his nose, slightly to the right side.
The arrowhead disappeared entirely. I was called to treat him three days after the arrow struck.  The arrow wound was very narrow. I probed it with a fine instrument, but felt nothing.  He was experiencing a prickling sensation and pain beneath his ear, on the right side.
I hoped this prickling was from a part of the arrow, so I applied a dressing that promoted drawing out and maturation. I hoped the area would swell and the arrow's position become apparent, so I could open it up.  However, nothing happened to indicate that the arrow had reached that area.
I continued to apply the dressing for many days, but nothing happened. The wound eventually closed. The patient was hopeless about removing the arrow for a long time, until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose.  He told me, so I applied a strong, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days.
Until it opened, and I probed it. I felt the thin arrowhead that adhered to the shaft. Then, I continued to open the wound with that strong medicine, until the arrowhead was clearly visible. It took approximately four months.
Then, when the wound widened and I could insert forceps, I pulled and moved it, but it wouldn't come out. I kept trying various instruments until, one day, I grasped it with strong forceps, as their image is shown later in this chapter.
The physicians had determined that his nasal cartilage could not be repaired, but I repaired it. The wound healed and the patient recovered completely, unharmed by anything. I am telling you how to remove some arrows so you can use this as a standard and a guide for what I have not mentioned.
Because the parts of this craft and its details cannot be grasped by description or encompassed by a book; instead, the skillful craftsman compares the little to the much, and what is present to what is absent, and he devises a new action and a new instrument in unusual cases.
Concerning this craft, I say that arrows are removed from the members where they are lodged in two ways: either by pulling from the point of entry, or from the opposite side, which is the way out.
If the arrow is protruding into fleshy tissue, pull it out. If it does not come out at the time of its lodging, you should leave it for a few days until the surrounding flesh decays, making it easier to extract.  Similarly, if it is lodged in bone.
If it does not come out, leave it for days and try pulling and moving it each day, for it will come out. If it does not come out after days, you should pierce around the arrow in the same bone from every side with a fine awl until you widen the space for the arrow, and then pull it out.
If the arrow is lodged in the skull, penetrating one of the brain cavities, and some of the symptoms I mentioned appear, refrain from pulling the arrow out and leave it until its condition improves after a few days.
Proceed with pulling out the arrow. If it is deeply embedded and you cannot pull it out, use the awls around the arrow as I described, then treat the area until it heals.  However, if the arrow is hidden in a part of the body... And if it is not felt, search for it with a probe. If you feel it, pull it out with instruments suitable for the task. If you cannot reach it because the wound is constricted and the arrow is deep, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the way,
then widen the wound so you can get to the arrow and extract it. If it has two barbs, grasp them and remove all the flesh caught on them from all sides using any method possible.  If you cannot remove the flesh by breaking or twisting the barbs, proceed.
If you attempt to remove the arrow in any location, use tongs to twist it in all directions to extract it. Be extremely gentle so that the arrow does not break, making it harder to pull out. If you cannot remove it after some time,
leave it for a few days until the surrounding flesh becomes putrid, then try again. It will be easier at that point. If bleeding occurs, use the treatments we mentioned in the relevant section.  Be careful not to cut a vein, nerve, or tendon, and use any method possible.
In every way you can, remove the arrow gently, carefully, and firmly, as described.  When pulling the arrow, the patient's position should be the same as it was when the arrow entered; this is best.
If you cannot do that, use whatever methods you can.  As for an arrow that exits on the opposite side, either something will protrude from the wound, or you will feel the arrowhead near the surface of the skin.
Make an incision over it, keeping the incision large enough for the tongs to grip.  Then pull it out; it will be easier to remove.  If it's lodged in bone, twist your tongs in a circle until the arrow is loosened in the bone, then pull it out.
Otherwise, leave it for a few days and try again until it comes out. If the arrowhead is still attached, push it out with it.  If the arrowhead has fallen off and you want to use force, insert a hollow instrument into the arrow's shaft so that its cavity is inside the shaft's tip, then push it out.
If the arrow is hollow, push it out with an instrument that fits into the hollow, as this will make it easier to remove. If the arrow is poisoned, you should cauterize all the affected flesh, if possible, then treat it appropriately.
If the arrow is lodged in the chest, abdomen, bladder, or flank, and is close enough to be felt with a probe, and you can make an incision, incise, being careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and remove it.
Then suture the wound if necessary, then treat it until it heals.  Image of tongs used for removing arrows:
Its tips are like the beak of a bird, crafted so that if they grasp an arrow or something, they will not release it.  They are made in various sizes, large, small, and medium, all according to the size of the arrow, the width of the wound.

This one has a solid tip, like a rod, to easily enter the hollow arrow and push it out.
Chapter Ninety-five.
On bloodletting.
Thirty veins are customarily opened in the body.  Of these, sixteen are in the head: the two pulsating veins behind the ears, known as the *ḥassisīn*; and the two veins on the temples, visible; and the two veins at the corners of the eyes, known as the *nāẓirīn*.
The vein rising in the middle of the forehead, the vein at the tip of the nose, the two veins in the neck, the two veins in the upper lip of the mouth, the two veins in the lower lip, these veins known as the *jayārak*, and the two veins beneath the tongue.
As for the veins opened in the arm and hand, there are five veins: one of them is the *qayfāl*, which is on the outer side; the common people call it the vein of the head.  The *ʾakḥal*, which is the middle vein, is composed of a branch of the *bāsiliq* and a branch of the *qayfāl*; the common people call it the body vein.
And the *bāsiliq*, which is situated on the inner side; it is also called the axillary vein.  The common people call it the belly vein and the arm cord.  It is located on the elbow, where it adheres, and it is the one that clearly appears above the thumb; and the *ʾasīlim*.
It is the vein between the little finger and the ring finger, with two branches.  In the leg and foot, there are three veins: one below the knee on the outer side, the second is the saphenous vein, located at the heel on the inner side, and the vein of the women, located at the heel on the outer side.
And in the other leg, three veins like them.  As for the two veins behind the ears, their opening is beneficial for chronic colds, migraines, gout, and chronic bad head sores, and their opening method is as I describe.
This is done by shaving the patient's head and rubbing the back of the head where the veins are with a rough cloth until it is well rubbed, then the patient's neck is constricted with a turban so that the veins appear behind the ears in the low parts of the head.  Then one probes these with a finger. Where one feels a pulse under the finger, mark the place with ink.
Then take a scalpel, which is known as a lancet, and insert it under the vein into the skin until the scalpel reaches the bone.  Then lift the vein and skin upward and sever the vein with the skin, making a complete cut.  The length of the cut should be the length of two fingers pressed together.
Or a similar amount of blood is drawn, then they are tied with ligatures and left until healed.  Their cutting and cauterization were discussed earlier in the book.  As for the arteries in the temples, their opening is beneficial for chronic migraines, severe headaches, persistent ophthalmia, and sudden, intense eye discharge.
Their opening, as I describe, is to constrict the patient's neck with a turban so that the arteries become clearly visible and their pulse is evident under your finger.  Then mark the location with ink.  Next, raise the skin above the artery with your index finger.
Insert the lancet beneath and lift the artery upward, severing it as you did with the other veins.  Draw the amount of blood needed. Then loosen the constriction on the patient's neck and place your finger on the artery for a while.
Then apply a bandage and ligature, tying it tightly from above.  Leave it until it heals. Their mention, cutting, and draining were previously discussed in the beginning of the book.  As for opening the forehead vein, its benefit, after opening the temporal vein, is for chronic facial ailments such as ringworm, sores, and chronic redness.
To open it as I describe, constrict the patient's neck with a turban until the vein appears.  Then take the instrument called the lancet, whose shape is shown here:.
Place the pointed end of the lancet on the vein and strike it from above with a mallet or similar object. Allow the blood to flow to the desired amount.  Then release the constriction on the patient's neck and apply a bandage until healed.
A wide lancet may be used, but it should not have a sharp point like other lancets, rather should have a slightly broad point.  Open it with a slight deviation, because the bone is close, and the lancet might break if it is thin.
As for the veins located near the eye sockets, their benefit is for eye ailments such as scabies, redness, and sores, and facial diseases.  The method of opening them is for the patient to tighten their neck with a turban, then open them while you stand over their head.  Make the opening slightly angled towards the length with a small, slightly broad lancet.
If the area has little flesh, the lancet might break if it has a sharp point.  Then drain the desired amount of blood and place a bandage over them.  Keep it on for one night, then remove it.  Opening the nasal vein is beneficial for high fevers.
Severe headaches and facial diseases like red sores on the nose, especially if chronic, are treated by this method.  The procedure is to have the patient tighten their neck, then hold their nose with your left hand and use a long, thin lancet.
Insert it into the middle of the nostril itself, between the nasal cartilage, in a straight line, because the vein is not noticeable there.  Blood will appear immediately.  You should use the lancet for a short time, drain the needed amount of blood, and then bandage it.  It will clot quickly.
As for the veins, opening them is beneficial for shortness of breath, the onset of leprosy, and melancholic diseases that appear on the skin's surface, such as black vitiligo, scabies, bad ulcers, and eating sores.  The method of opening them is to have the patient tighten their neck underneath them with a bandage, and the practitioner stand over the patient's head.
The patient sits on a chair, and the vein is opened lengthwise with a wide but gentle incision.  Then drain a moderate amount of blood, or as much as needed.  Do the same with the other vein, then remove the bandage.
The two veins are moderately squeezed so the patient does not suffocate, and left until the next day for the wound to heal.  As for the jugular veins, opening them after opening the cephalic vein is beneficial for mouth sores, gum disease, bad ulcers, cracked lips, and bad sores.
Those that are in and around the nose. The method of opening them is to have the patient sit in front of you, tighten their neck with a head covering, then turn their lips and look for the veins, one on the right side of the lip and the other on the left, and note their darkness.
Also, there are thin, dark veins around them, so cut them off completely.  If it is unclear and you do not know which they are, aim for cutting the largest and clearest ones.  Do the same for the veins on the lower lip.
As for the two veins beneath the tongue, opening them after opening the cephalic vein is beneficial for the constrictions that occur in the throat due to sore throat and mouth diseases.  The method for opening them is to have the patient sit before you facing the sun, lift their tongue, and look beneath the tongue on one side, and then the other, for veins, and they will be dark in color.
Open them and be careful, do not cut them deeply, for there are arteries beneath them; there is a risk of bleeding from these arteries.  As for the three veins that are commonly opened in the elbow, these are the ones that are opened by people in general, and there are two ways to open them.
Either with a wide, fragrant, or olive-shaped lancet, or else with a lancet of a knife-like shape, which is the incision [and this is its picture].  Picture of the wide, fragrant lancet:
It should be wide, as you see, to be suitable for opening hollow, full, prominent, visible, thick veins that contain thick, dark blood.  This is the image of the olive-shaped lancet:
This lancet is narrower and has a thinner tip, suitable for opening thin veins containing thin, yellowish blood.  This is the image of the incision lancet:
This incision lancet, which is suitable for incision, comes in various widths and thicknesses, depending on the width and narrowness of the veins as well.  One may infer other things from it, and it is well-known among artisans.
As for the jugular vein, which is one of these three veins, the benefit of its incision is that it draws blood from the ailments that are under the throat and neck, from the chest and abdomen.  The surgeon, when making the incision, should be cautious and be careful of what is below it; if there is an artery beneath it, and if he errs and increases the penetration of the lancet, he will cut the artery.
This will cause bleeding, therefore, its incision should not be made with a lancet for piercing, but rather with an incision by the lancet. If the jugular vein is not clearly visible, it should be avoided and one should turn to another vein or search for one of its branches.
Or you may open the arm's vein, for it is clear and you may cut it with the incision lancet, as we said. If you wish to open it directly, you should, before tying the arm, feel the area until you identify the pulse point and then mark it with ink.
Then tie the arm and cut the vein in an oblique incision with the lancet, as we said, and be careful that the blow is away from the artery. When you see swelling at the point you marked with ink after tightening the bandage, this swelling is the inflation of the artery. Avoid it.
If you see the blood during the venesection leaping like a young child's urine, and the blood is thin and red, know that it is arterial blood.  In that case, quickly place your finger on it for a long time, then remove your finger. If the bleeding stops, it often does.  Tighten the arm.
Leave it, and warn the patient about neglecting it. Let it be on a pillow and do not move it for days until it heals. If the bleeding does not stop and you are overcome, and no medicine is available at the time, cut the artery if it appears to you, as its ends constrict and the bleeding stops.
Or take a pistachio shell, split it and take one half.  Tighten it firmly over the vein with a bandage and splints until the next day.  If the bleeding stops, do so.  Otherwise, treat it with the previously mentioned methods of applying cauterizing agents to stop the bleeding.  Stopping the bleeding is not usually difficult in most cases.
Due to the small size of the wound and the effectiveness of the bandage on the arm, be aware of this.  As for the dark vein, the benefit of venesection is that it draws blood from the top of the head and the lower part of the body, because it is composed of a branch of the basilar vein and a branch of the cavernous vein, as we said.
The person performing the venesection should be careful of the location of the vein, for beneath it is a nerve.  If the lancet penetrates deeper and strikes the nerve, numbness will result, difficult to perceive, and possibly not heal at all. This nerve is often felt.
If in some people it is hidden and thin, not easily seen, then make your incision for venesection with a shallow cut to avoid the nerve as much as possible. If the vein lies between two nerves, cut the vein lengthwise.  As for the cavernous vein, the benefit of its venesection is that it draws blood from the head.
It is beneficial for eye diseases.  Specifically, if you wish to venesect this vein, make the incision with an olive-shaped lancet or a wide, fragrant lancet, as it is the safest of all veins, because there is neither an artery nor a nerve beneath it.
However, when performing venesection, you should avoid the muscle head with the lancet and seek the soft spot.  It will not harm if, on the first attempt, the vein is not hit, and it can be venesected again.  However, it may swell in some people if it is not opened on the first attempt.
But that swelling will not harm it.  As for the method of venesection, its symptoms, and what should precede its correction, first you should know that venesection is used either to preserve health only.
Or it is used in diseases.  The venesection that is used to preserve and maintain health, and to guard against the onset of illness, should be done in one of the three veins in the elbow, namely the cephalic, the radial, and the basilic veins.  And it should be done in the early spring, if signs of fullness appear.
The venesection should be performed on a Sunday or a Tuesday, after three hours of daylight have passed.  As for venesection used in illnesses, it has no fixed time; but whenever the need and necessity arise, whether during the night or day.
At every hour and every time.  Boys should not be bled until they reach fourteen years of age, nor should elderly men who have passed sixty years of age.  If anyone intends to perform venesection for any reason whatsoever...
He should cleanse his bowels before venesection with a gentle enema if there is a lot of retained phlegm.  This is so that foul impurities from the bowels will not be drawn into the veins during venesection and harm the major organs.  The feverish, the drunk, and the intoxicated should not be bled until this passes from them.
Also, beware of venesection following dysentery, vomiting, fever, excessive sexual activity, exertion, athletic activity, late nights, and fasting—and anything that weakens the body or mind.  Then, consider thinning the humours beforehand if the blood is thick.
With foods, drinks, and medications, if possible.  Then he should enter a bath if nothing prevents him, or engage in some exercise so that the blood is thinned.  His venesection should be performed in the middle of the day, as we have said, and he should attempt to clear his mind of all bad emotions that day.
Such as worries, anger, and fear, and from all bodily ailments such as excessive fatigue and exhaustion, sexual activity, and the like.  Let the things people habitually use for their enjoyment, such as fragrances, herbs, and amusements, be present in his session, for each person according to their ability.
Then the bleeder sits on a cushion higher than the one the person being bled sits on.  Then the bleeder holds the arm and rubs it with his hand two or three times, then tightens the bandage with the tourniquet and twists it two or three times.  The tightening should be moderate.
Because if the tightening is not moderate, either excessive tightening will stop the flow of blood, or if it is too loose, it will also prevent the flow of blood. Then, after the tightening, the person being bled should rub their hands together vigorously.
Until the veins swell and become obvious to the touch. Then the bleeder wipes the lancet with a small amount of old oil, especially. Then he places his left index finger on the same vein, slightly below the spot where he wants to bleed, to prevent the vein from moving and to avoid hitting it. Because some veins are like tendons, which move when lanced.  And some are filled with air, so when the lancet is placed on them, they recede beneath the lancet and deceive the bleeder.  The lancet does not open the vein. If it does open it, the opening is narrow.
Therefore, the bleeder should be cautious and careful in all these matters. Then he lowers the lancet. If the vein opens on that first try, well and good. Otherwise, he should try again a little below or above that spot quickly if the area hasn't swelled up.
If the patient swells or feels pain, leave it a day or two and do not tighten the bandage, as it may cause a hot swelling.  He should not enter a bath.  Then he can have the bleeding repeated, if desired. If the lancet is inserted and the opening is small and the blood flow is thin.
And fearing that not enough blood will come out, he should reinsert the lancet into the same hole gently and straight, enlarging the opening a little, and do this quickly before the area swells, for in many people the area will swell if the opening is small.
If you see it has swelled, do not re-treat it, for it will not help you. Apply some bruised oil to it. It will ease the flow of blood, and is better in this situation than the oil itself, and any other ointments.
Use bruised oil in all your bloodletting of veins when the blood flow is difficult.  This remedy, the 'Fārūq' and 'Shakhzana', may also achieve this if applied to the area. The blood will become thinner and more fluid if it is thick.
If a large swelling occurs at the site of the bloodletting, which often happens, especially for those who have never had bloodletting before or if the vein opening was small, quickly apply a sponge soaked in slightly warmed salt water to the swelling and bandage it for an hour.  It will resolve.
This should be done after the blood has fully exited the vein itself or another vein.  If, after a few days, a black or green discoloration remains, it will not harm. If desired, apply some dissolved gum and resin.
Or something from the juice of the Fūdanj and the like.  A swelling and lump often occur when bloodletting the basil, so place your hand upon it. If you feel it pulsating when you press it, this is a bad lump, so be careful not to apply any of the remedies mentioned.
For it may bleed arterial blood; but bandage it with something constricting to solidify the area, and then treat it with the rest of the remedies until it heals.  One should remove blood from each person according to their strength and the prevailing color of their blood.
If the blood is black, let it flow until it turns red.  Likewise, if you see it thick, let it flow until it thins, and if it is sharp, until its sharpness is gone.  It is necessary for those who are strong and full and need to remove the blood in one sitting.
To widen the vein opening, and the lancet should be wide.  For those who are weak, the opposite is true.  The blood should be drawn in stages and the puncture should be narrow.  The best tool for opening a vein is a slanted, oblique cut, not a piercing.
This type of bloodletting is safe from bleeding and from nerve damage. It is better and safer than bloodletting across or lengthwise. If someone faints frequently during bloodletting, it is necessary to give them something to eat before the procedure, such as bread soaked in pomegranate juice or sherbet.
If he is healthy and has had the blood drawn three or four times, and if he is cold-natured, then he should eat bread soaked in myrrh drink, or honeyed drink scented with fragrant herbs, or in a good herbal drink, before the procedure.
If fainting occurs during bloodletting and is caused by excessive blood loss, then he should be given meat broth and thin herbal drink.  Fragrant perfume should be used, and his chest should be rinsed with it.  All other methods mentioned in the section on fainting should be employed.
For those who have been bled to relieve vomiting, and if one wants to further release and thin their blood, then one who had much blood released through bloodletting, and whose strength is weak, should release the blood little by little, as much as their strength permits, over several days.
And if someone wishes to further release and thin their blood, and their body is strong, then they should do so after seven or nine hours from the initial bloodletting.  However, if one wants to draw blood from their body to the opposite side of where it has gathered, then they should be treated on the second or third day.
If someone has a lot of hot, intense blood in their body that has caused a fever, then blood should be drawn in one session, a large amount, and the opening widened until fainting occurs, after you have observed all the necessary conditions of bloodletting. And place your hand on his pulse while the blood flows, to prevent death instead of fainting, for this often occurs if the bloodletter is unaware and negligence takes place. This should not be done if you intend to release or thin the blood again.
If the vein's opening closes and blood flow is difficult, do not forcefully prod or twist it; this is very harmful.  Instead, either leave it until you can bleed it again, or use the lancet blade to remove any blood clots in the vein's opening.
Or apply something dissolved in water, like salt, or a remedy like the antidote or the 'shakhzana' (a possible herbal preparation). Gently prod it until blood emerges. If the vein has swelled, leave it.
Do not touch it until the swelling subsides.  If, due to necessity, you must bleed it again, then either bleed above that spot, or bleed the other arm, or another vein.
Bleeding the brachial artery is done instead of the temporal and occipital arteries if those aren't available or are hidden, as it is composed of both.  To perform the procedure, the patient should immerse their arm in warm water until the veins are clearly visible and the forearm is red. Then, a moderate bandage is tied somewhat above the vein.
Then bleed the vein slightly off-center, neither laterally nor lengthwise, and make the opening wide.  Bleed it slightly above the wrist joint. If the blood flow is difficult, re-immerse the arm in the warm water vessel, and let the blood flow into the water.
Until you have obtained your desired amount. If it is summertime, you may not need to re-immerse the arm in warm water.  Re-immersion is most often needed in winter. Bleeding this vein is safer than from all other veins. Because there is no vein or nerve below it.  Bleeding from the ulnar vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments.  To perform the procedure, tie the wrist with a bandage or your hand after immersing it in warm water until the vein swells.
Because there is no vein or nerve below it.  Bleeding from the ulnar vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver ailments.  To perform the procedure, tie the wrist with a bandage or your hand after immersing it in warm water until the vein swells. The vein is very clearly visible.  Then bleed it slightly off-center.  If you sever it completely, it will do him no harm.  Be careful; do not use the lancet vigorously, as there is a nerve of the fingers beneath, and the area is devoid of flesh.  Then return the arm to the warm water.
Leave it [the arm] and allow the blood to flow. If you do not return it to the warm water, the blood will clot within the opening of the vein and cease flowing.  When you have extracted the required amount of blood, apply grease and salt to the vein to prevent rapid clotting.
Likewise, you should do this with every constricted vein.  Bleeding from the ulnar vein of the left hand is beneficial for spleen ailments.  Perform the bleeding procedure on it as you did on the second vein, identically.  Bleeding from the saphenous vein is beneficial for illnesses in the lower body, such as uterine ailments.
And for amenorrhea, kidney ailments, chronic ulcers of the thighs and legs, and similar ailments. The procedure for bleeding from this vein is to immerse the leg in warm water and apply massage until the veins dilate.  Then tie above the joint of the leg with a bandage. The vein is located near the heel, visible towards the big toe.
Many branches extend from it [the vein] throughout the leg.  Bleed it from the widest branch or at the heel where it joins, as this is the best and safest approach.  If you bleed it on the front of the leg, be cautious of the nerves beneath the skin on the front of the leg.
Make your incision with a twisting motion, as if you were intending to sever it, and have the lancet sharp. If the blood flow is difficult, immerse the leg in warm water and allow the blood to flow until it is exhausted.  If the bleeder misidentifies the vein on the first attempt.
If the bleeder misses the vein on the first attempt, then he should re-bleed slightly higher up. The area is safe, and there is no cause for alarm if you are cautious of the nerve, as we have stated.  Likewise, do this with the saphenous vein of the other leg. As for the femoral vein, its location, as we stated, is at the heel on the outer side.
Its benefit is for hip pain if it is due to hot blood.  The procedure for bleeding is to have the patient enter a bath and quickly pull the leg from the hip up to the heel with four fingers using a thin long bandage.  It will only appear that way.
If it appears, bleed it in any case, either twisting (which is best), or sever it or slit it, as the location is safe.  It is very hidden in most people, if you do not find it.
If it does not appear at all, bleed some of its branches, which appear on the back of the foot near the little and ring fingers. Be careful of the nerves and release the desired amount of blood.
Then release the bandage, place a cotton pad on the bleeding site, and bandage the area. It will quickly heal.
Chapter Ninety-Six.
On Cupping and its Application.
Cupping vessels may be made of horn, wood, copper, or glass. Cupping can be of two types: one is cupping with a mark and bloodletting, and the other is cupping without a mark.
And this cupping without a mark is of two types.
And cupping of the sides of the neck on both sides, and cupping of the chin below the lower jaw of the mouth, and cupping of the shoulders, and cupping of the coccyx on the tailbone, and cupping of the elbows which are the middle of the arms, and cupping of the legs, and cupping of the heels.
Cupping draws blood from the thin veins dispersed in the flesh, and for this reason, it does not weaken the strength like venesection.  Cupping, whether with or without fire, should not be used in illnesses resulting from fullness until the whole body is emptied.
If cupping is needed because of illness or custom, we use it at all times, at the beginning, end, and middle of the month, and at any time.
For some people, when there is an abundance of blood requiring removal by cupping, they experience heaviness and headache in the head, and some experience fullness, redness in the face, head, and neck, and some experience itching in the face, temples, and darkening and heaviness in their eyes, and some scratch the site of the cupping.
Some laugh excessively, some taste blood in their mouths, and gums bleed, and some spit blood. Some sleep excessively, and some see blood, redness, slain people, and wounds, and things similar to that in their dreams.  When we see any of these things...
Especially if it is in the middle third of the month, we then prescribe cupping after two or three hours have passed of the day.  The benefit of cupping at the neck is in relieving heaviness in the head and water flowing to the eyes.
However, it is necessary that this be done after the body has been emptied.  This cupping may be a substitute for a venesection of the temples.  One should beware of using it for those with a cold head or a cold, as it will harm them greatly.
Therefore, it is not appropriate for the elderly to use it, nor those with cold diseases in their heads.  Those who overuse it will develop forgetfulness.
Therefore, the cupper should lower the cup slightly to avoid the development of forgetfulness.  Cupping of the shoulder is a substitute for venesection of the temples and the veins of the neck.
Therefore, it is beneficial for asthma, shortness of breath, a splitting of the respiratory apparatus, coughs, and fullness.  The cupping of the shoulder should be raised slightly, because if it is positioned lower, it will cause weakness in the heart and stomach.
Cupping of the temples is beneficial for pains in the head, ophthalmia, migraine, constriction, and toothache. It is a substitute for venesection of the neck veins. The cupper should be instructed not to press too deeply with the instrument lest it sever an artery and cause bleeding.
Cupping under the chin is beneficial for sores in the mouth, gum problems, and similar mouth ailments.  It can substitute for venesection of the vessels in the lips. Cupping of the shoulders is beneficial for palpitations caused by fullness and heat.
Cupping of the inner forearms is beneficial for what the venesection of the three veins (the basilic, the temporal, and the cephalic) is beneficial for, because it draws blood from all those fine veins in the flesh, and draws those fine veins from other thicker veins, until the drawing reaches the three thick veins.
The cupper should be instructed not to press too hard, because the area is devoid of flesh and has nerves and arteries underneath.  A single cupping treatment on the coccyx is beneficial for hemorrhoids and sores of the lower rectum.
The cupper should be instructed to use a large, copper cupping vessel, because the area requires strong suction, and glass cupping vessels may break.  A great deal of pressure should be applied. Cupping of the legs significantly reduces fullness.
Because it draws blood from the entire body, it is beneficial for chronic pains in the kidneys, uterus, and bladder. It stimulates menstruation and is beneficial for boils and pimples. It substitutes for venesection of the safenous and saphenous veins. However, it greatly weakens the body, and fainting occurs in most people. Cupping of the saphenous veins is similar in benefit to cupping of the legs.
How to apply cupping: First, place the empty cupping vessel and apply moderate suction. Do not prolong the application of the cupping vessels, but rather apply and remove them quickly to allow the humors to be drawn to the area evenly. Continue to repeat this until the area becomes red and opens.
When the redness of blood appears, then apply pressure and resume suction gradually.  Then, observe the condition of the bodies.  For those with thin, porous flesh, a single application of pressure should suffice, so that the area is not ulcerated.
The cupper should widen the pressure, deepening it slightly, and adjusting the suction gently and with a light movement. If the blood is thick, it should be pressured twice.  The first time, to open a passage for the thin, watery blood; the second, to extract the thick blood.
If the blood is very murky, pressure should be applied a third time to achieve the goal. In general, if we want to remove a small amount of blood, one pressure suffices.  If we want to remove a lot of blood, we apply more pressure, especially if the blood is thick.
The pressure should be deep, but the moderate limit of pressure is only the depth of the skin.  What ointments should be used when applying cupping, and what waters, and what should the cupper be wary of?  For those with thick, hard, dry skin and narrow pores...
The areas for the cupping should be anointed with opening, softening, and dissolving ointments.  In summer, examples include the ointment of the Khariri, or the ointment of the violet, or the ointment of sweet almond, or the ointment of pumpkin seeds.
In winter, examples include the ointment of the narcissus, or the ointment of the lily, or the ointment of chamomile, or the hyacinth, and the like.  If the impurity is thick and cold, let the ointment be the ointment of marjoram, or the ointment of balm, or the ointment of frankincense, or the ointment of fennel, and the like.
If the cupper has wide pores and soft flesh, then ointment should be avoided.  These individuals should wash their cupping vessels after the procedure with rosewater, or cold water, or water from wild grapes, or water from pumpkin, or water from the root of the plant called *rajla*, and the like.  And, as for those whose blood is very moist...
They should wash their cupping vessels with vinegar, or with rue and sumac water, and the like.  As for those whose impurities are thick, they should wash their cupping vessels with aged wine, or marjoram water, or fennel or chamomile decoction, and the like.  Cupping should be avoided in the bath and after the bath.
Rather, it should be used one or two hours after leaving the bath.  One should not sleep after cupping.  This is what the cupper and the leeches should arrange before and after cupping.
First, one should consider if the cupper or leech is bilious, and if their blood is predominantly sharp and inflammatory.  Then they should take cooling agents like pomegranate, chicory with vinegar, lettuce, and orgeat, and the like.  Their food should be fowl, lamb, and various lean meats.
And whoever's temperament is cold should be given honeyed drinks, drinks made with *mayba* or *sakenjebeen* with seeds, and medium-aged aromatic wine, which is between old and new.  A small amount of food should be prescribed, and their diet should consist of fowl, quails, sparrows, and doves, well-cooked.  On the day of cupping and leeching, drinks should be more plentiful than food.
Sometimes, certain people may be given some of the Faruq theriac, musk medicine, or shiltha before cupping and before or after leeching, to strengthen the major organs and thin the blood.  However, feverish individuals should not be given it.
As for cupping without stipulations, these are the cuppings applied to the liver, spleen, breasts, abdomen, navel, kidney area, and groin.  Because these organs cannot withstand stipulations, the purpose is either to draw blood from one organ to another.
For example, placing a cupping on the breasts in cases of epistaxis, or to remove a cold wind that has lodged in an organ, such as placing a cupping on the abdomen and navel.  It loosens the organ, warms it, and removes the pain by dissolving that wind.
Cupping may also be placed on the kidneys if a blockage or stones are present, as its strong suction might open the blockage or dislodge the stones.  Similarly, it is used on the liver and spleen when wind is present, causing them to become agitated.  These cuppings may also be used, empty, by suction alone.
It may be used with fire, or filled with lukewarm water in cases of hemorrhoids.  A large cupping is filled with hot water alone, or water in which some suitable herbs have been boiled.
Then, filled, it is placed on the affected area, held, and removed, repeated as needed.  This is the image of a cupping that is used with fire.
Its mouth opening is the width of two open fingers, as depicted.  Its depth is half a span.  Near the middle of one side, there is a small hole that a needle can enter.  It is made of thick-rimmed Chinese or brass.
It is smooth, flat, and polished so as not to injure the organ when placed upon it.  In the center, a transverse brass or iron bar is present, on which the candle is placed for burning.  This cupping can be made larger or smaller than described, depending on the illnesses.
The practitioner's skill is necessary, for cupping for children and thin people is not the same as for men and those with larger bodies.  As for how to apply this cupping with fire to the affected area, you light a wick of tightly wound cloth or a small candle made of pitch, and place it on the center of the solidified bar in the center of the cupping.
So that the fire rises upwards toward the bottom of the cupping, to prevent the patient's body from burning.  Then it is placed on the affected area, and the finger is placed in the hole we mentioned, so that when we hold the cupping, we do not need to remove the finger.
Steam will escape through that hole, and the cupping will loosen at the spot. Then the wick is re-lit according to the procedure, and repeated if necessary. As for the cupping used in cases of dropsy, it does not have a solidified bar or a hole.
Instead, it is used by filling it with water and placing it directly on the affected area.  This is its form.
The larger the cupping, the better it is, as it can hold more water.
Chapter Seventy-nine.
On applying leeches.
Leeches are used mostly on parts of the body where cupping cannot be applied, either because they are small, like the lips and gums, or because the area is exposed, like the fingers and nose.
To use them, select leeches from clean, fresh water free of impurities, then leave them in fresh water for a day and a night to ensure they are hungry and have nothing in their stomachs. Then the body is first bled by venesection or cupping, and then the afflicted area is cleaned.
Until it turns red, then the leech is placed on it. When it is full, it will fall off. If it is possible to draw the affected area with a cupping glass, that is more beneficial. Otherwise, wash the area with vinegar, then with plenty of water, and massage and squeeze it. If bleeding continues after the leech falls off, and if it is a trickle, then dip a linen cloth in cool water.
Place it over the area until the bleeding stops.  If the bleeding is excessive, sprinkle powdered alum or astringent on it, or similar styptics, until the bleeding stops, or place sliced, peeled dates on the area.
Leave it until the dates adhere to the area; then the bleeding will stop.  If further leech application is needed, do not use the same leeches if others are available. If the leeches refuse to adhere, then wipe the area with fresh blood.
Or, pierce the area with a needle until some blood comes out, then place [the leech] there. If it senses any blood, it will adhere to the spot. When you want it to fall off, sprinkle some of the herb 'sabr' (or dates), salt, or ash on it, and it will fall off in that spot.
Chapter Three.
On Fractures.
This chapter, too, is among the essential topics in the medical arts, concerning the setting of fractures and dislocations of the bones.
Know, my children, that many ignorant physicians and laypeople might claim expertise in this chapter, having never perused the writings of the ancients or read a single word from them.
For this reason, this art of medicine has become lost in our country, and I have never encountered a single skillful practitioner in it. My knowledge of it comes from my long study of the writings of the ancients and my dedication to understanding them, until I extracted the knowledge from them.  Then, I dedicated my life to practice and skill.
I have presented in this chapter everything I know about this. My experience has been applied to this, after I have brought it closer to you, removing lengthy explanations, condensing it to the utmost brevity, clarifying it completely, and showing many images of the tools used within it.
This is an addition to the clarification, as I have done in the previous two chapters; there is no power except through God, the Most High, the Great.
Chapter One.
This chapter contains a summary of the treatment of fractures.  Before we begin describing individual broken and dislocated limbs, it is necessary to give some general comments and sections in the beginning of this chapter. This will first necessitate understanding and recognizing the truth for you, and for whoever else is eager to learn this noble profession.
If someone suffers a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall, one should first hasten to reduce the injury, or to ease it, or both. Unless prevented by factors like weakness or the person is a child or very old, or the weather is extremely hot or extremely cold.
Then, the patient's diet should be restricted to cold legumes, poultry, and venison.  Drinks, fatty meats, overeating, and any food that causes a rapid increase in blood flow are prohibited, until the swelling subsides and there is no further expected discharge to the area.
Then, the patient should return to his initial regimen, as usual.  If the fractured bone begins to knit, the patient should eat a very nutritious, thick, and substantial diet with viscosity, such as lentils, rice, heads of grain, and ox-tripe. Eggs, soft fish, and thick drinks, and similar foods, will lead to quicker and better healing of the fracture.  Know that fractures in robust men and the elderly will not readily heal to their original state.
Due to the dryness and hardness of their bones, a fracture in the bones of the elderly may not heal completely.  However, fractures in very pliable bones, like those of young children, may heal.  Nature produces a substance resembling glue, thick and strong, around the fractured bone, attaching it and drawing the bone fragments together until they knit.
Until it achieves the original strength and stability, so that nothing hinders its functions.
Therefore, the patient's diet should consist of foods with strength, viscosity, and thickness, as we mentioned.  Know that fractures vary according to the affected limb, as a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head, and a fracture of the chest is different from a fracture of the spine.
And so are all other limbs, each different from the others. We will describe each type of fracture in detail, separately, in its own section.  The type of bone fracture can also vary within itself.
For a fracture can be a simple break without splinters, or it can be a lengthwise break with splinters, detached fragments, and non-detached fragments.  The fracture may also occur with a wound and skin laceration, or as a slight crack.
Each type requires a specific method of treatment, as will be detailed in its respective section.  Recognizing a bone fracture involves its distortion, swelling, visibility to the touch, and the grating sound when touched with the hand.
If there is no visible distortion, no grating sound, and no discomfort or pain when palpating the bone, then there is no fracture.  It could be a strain, a minor fracture, or a slight crack, and it should not be manipulated with stretching or probing at all.
Instead, apply the appropriate medications to be described later, and then apply a gentle bandage.  Know that when a bone is compressed and broken in two without splinters, each piece has separated from the other.
Therefore, you should immediately attempt to realign and straighten the bone before a hot swelling develops.  If a hot swelling does occur, leave it for several days until it subsides, and then correct it by any means possible, using gentleness and skill.
Know that setting and straightening a bone is easier than one with splinters.  Then, it is bandaged as will be described later.  If the bone has splinters, the injured limb (hand or foot) must be extended from both sides.
Either by your hands if the limb is small, or by two ropes, or with both ropes and hands. Position the limb on a level surface in its natural shape.  Once the broken bone segments have been extended, return the displaced parts to their correct positions by any method possible, with gentleness and skill.
Take great care that your actions do not cause pain or suffering to the patient.  Strive to join the two bone fragments together in the best possible position.  In this process, you should touch and feel the bone fragments with your hand.  If you find anything out of place, correct and straighten it to the best of your ability.
Avoid excessive stretching and forceful manipulation, as many unskilled practitioners do.  Often, their actions cause a hot swelling or inflammation in the limb, as I have repeatedly observed.
After the setting, careful alignment, and bandaging, keep the limb still and at rest. Warn the patient not to move it during wakefulness, sleep, turning over, restlessness, bowel movements, or any other activity to the fullest extent possible.  Ensure that the position of the limb is one that minimizes pain.
If the patient feels pain or discomfort in a particular position, he should change it to one where he feels no pain, taking care that the new position is straight and aligned.
So that no deformity occurs if it is set.  Now, concerning the method of bandaging a fractured limb, as I have described it to you, know that fractured limbs vary in size, shape, and condition.  Those that are small, such as the arm, finger, forearm, and the like...
Therefore, the bandages for small parts should be gentle and soft, while for larger parts such as the thigh, back, and chest, the bandages should be firm and strong.  A wide bandage is needed for a large limb, tightening it evenly from all sides, without any unevenness.
Then, after completing the alignment, apply the appropriate plaster. Apply a soft bandage to the fracture site.  Then, wrap the bandage around the fracture three or four times, depending on the limb.  Slightly tighten the bandage, then move it upwards towards the higher portion of the fracture.
Tighten the bandage less than you did for the fractured area, then move away from the fracture slightly in your wrapping.  Gradually loosen the tension until you achieve some proper positioning of the bone, then take another bandage and wrap it around the fractured area as well.
Wrap several times, then move the wrapping towards the lower part of the fracture.  Maintain the tension and looseness described in the first, upper wrap.  Place soft bandages or cloths between the layers to correct any deformity in the fracture.
If there is a deformity, correct it; otherwise, do not insert anything.  Then wrap another bandage around it.  Finally, apply firm splints over these layers if there is no swelling or inflammation in the limb.
If there is swelling or inflammation, apply something to soothe the swelling and reduce the puffiness.  Leave it for a few days, then apply splints when the swelling subsides.  The splints should be made of cut and prepared cane strips, or splints made from sieve wood.
Made from pine, palm fronds, reeds, or similar readily available materials, and the width of each splint should be the same.
However, the splint placed directly over the fracture should be slightly thicker and wider than the others.  The length of the splint should be appropriate to the size of the fractured limb.  Image of the splint:
Then tighten the splints with another bandage, using the same tension as the first.  Secure them from above with strong threads, tightening more over the fracture site as previously described. The tighter the bandage, the closer to the fracture.
The threads should be of medium thickness and moisture content, preferably linen.  If the threads are too thick, like those made from twisted linen strips, as the ignorant sometimes do, it is a serious error.
Because the tightness will be irregular, and thin threads are also unsuitable as they do not allow the desired tension. There should be at least a finger's width between splints.
If the patient is pained by the edges of the splints after proper tightening, place soft pads or fluffy wool underneath so that nothing irritates him.  If the fracture is accompanied by a wound and the skin has been broken, we will discuss that separately.
Know that not every fractured limb should be splinted from the first day.  If the limb is large, splints should not be applied until five, seven, or more days, depending on the risk of inflammatory swelling.
This is a description of the dressings used by the ancients to treat fractures, dislocations, and sprains.  This is a general, concise dressing suitable for fractures and applicable to most temperaments, especially children and women, as it is neither excessively hot nor cold.
Take flour dust, the residue that clings to the millstones during grinding, knead it as it is without sifting it with egg white. Make the dough neither thick nor thin, then bake it.
Another dressing for fractures, dislocations, and sprains: take ten dirhams each of mastic, gum arabic, acacia, raisin, and poppy seeds; five dirhams each of myrrh and aloes; twenty dirhams of acacia; and twenty dirhams of Armenian or Roman clay. Grind all the ingredients together and mix with acacia water, or egg white if the patient's temperament is hot.  Use this dressing, as it is well-composed and quickly sets fractured bones, and is suitable for most people due to its moderate properties.
Another dressing useful for fractures and sprains: take ten dirhams each of poppy seeds, mastic, and white frankincense; five dirhams each of myrrh and aloes; six dirhams of acacia; and twenty dirhams of Armenian clay. Grind all finely, sift, and mix with water or egg white and apply.
A dressing for joints and bones dislocated from their places, and to relieve accompanying pain, and bone fracture: take prepared wool, dip it in vinegar and cooked oil, and apply to the affected area.  This dressing does not possess the strength to set fractures.
However, it is excellent for relieving hot swelling and pain. Another dressing to set a fractured bone: take the leaves of the common fig and the leaves of the wild poppy, grind them together and apply the paste to the area, moist.  Another brief dressing used for fractures.
If you wish to resolve the remaining swelling, take root of frankincense, chamomile, violet, and carnation flour, one part each. Grind all together, and mix with poultice if the limb is not inflamed. If it is inflamed, mix with coriander water or water, and apply.
Another stronger dressing for resolving than the first, used when a hard swelling occurs with a fracture: take root of frankincense, linseed, fenugreek, rosemary, violet, and chamomile, one part each.
Grind all together, and mix with dill water or fresh water, or poultice, according to the heat of the limb and the abatement of its heat.  Hippocrates, however, did not mention applying this to a fractured limb during its setting.
Except for the plaster made of wax and oil only, which should be of medium thickness, neither too thick nor too thin.  Galen believed that things containing dryness and some heat, such as myrrh, mastic, and frankincense, and similar substances, should be applied to the fractured limb during its setting.
A dressing for weakness and pain: take mugwort, chickpeas, shaved human hair or bird feathers, frankincense, and salt, equal parts. Grind, sift, mix, and apply as a dressing.  And regarding the amount of ligament to remain...
Then it should be resolved. Observe. If the patient does not experience pain, irritation, or movement of the fractured bone from its place, do not resolve it for many days.  If there is severe irritation, troublesome pain, or swelling in the area,
Then immediately resolve it and do not delay this at all. Remove the dressing. Then take a soft cloth or a damp sea sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and wash the area until the irritation and pain subside. Then allow the limb to rest for an hour.
Then apply moistened wool soaked in vinegar and oil, or rose oil, and bandage it overnight. This will help to alleviate the hot swelling and reduce the swelling and pain of the limb. Then gently reapply a light bandage, but not as tight as the first one.
Treat it gently until it heals. If you see that the swelling, redness, pain, and swelling have completely disappeared and a bandage and wrapping are now needed, then reapply them as you did originally. If nothing of what we have mentioned occurs in the limb,
Do not resolve it until three, four, five, or seven days later. Sometimes it may be left for twenty days.  All this depends on the condition of the limb, as we have said, until the fracture heals and the flesh begins to knit together.
Then increase the bandage more than the first one and increase the patient's diet as previously mentioned. If you see that the fracture site has become dry and emaciated more than it should, know that the nourishment is not reaching it.
Unbandage it with lukewarm water each time you loosen the bandage, every three days.  Slightly reduce the tightness.  By doing this, nourishment will flow to the limb and it will heal quickly.  As for what ignorant practitioners, the unskilled ones, do—re-breaking the limb—
If it is not set properly in the first place and is set crookedly, it is a mistake on their part and a great deception. Even if it were correct, the ancients would have mentioned it in their books and practiced it.  I have seen no trace of such a thing from any of them. The correct approach is not to use it.
The second chapter.
Concerning fractures of the head.
Fractures of the head are numerous, their forms varied, and their causes diverse.  Some fractures result from a sword strike, and in these cases, the bone may be fractured completely down to the peritoneum beneath the bone. As happens with wood.
And thus, this type of fracture is called "coming" or "penetrating."  Alternatively, the sword may only cut a portion of the bone, fracturing the surface but not penetrating completely; this type of fracture is called "simple extraction," and the wound from these fractures may be large or small.
Some fractures are caused by crushing or contusion, resulting from a blow with a stone, a fall on a stone, or similar.  This fracture may be penetrating, approaching the membrane beneath the bone, or superficial, on the surface of the bone.
The wound from these fractures may also be large or small.  There are also fractures that are hidden within the bone, subtle, like a slight fissure.
Therefore, this type of fracture is called "hairline."  A fracture can also occur from a fall or a blow from a stone, or similar, driving a part of the bone inwards, causing a depression in the area, similar to how a piece of copper is dented if struck, with a portion being driven inwards.
This is most common in the wet, young bone of the head, such as in children's heads.  All these types of fractures may have detached or non-detached fragments.  We will discuss the treatment of each in its place, and all these types of fractures are identified through examination.
Inspecting them with probes and removing any putrid flesh from them.  The hairline fracture is recognized by examining the bone, rubbing and staining it with ink, for the fracture will appear black.  The treatment of the fracture must first consider the patient's symptoms.
If you see obvious signs of danger in the patient, such as vomiting bile, prostration, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, fainting, high fever, bulging and redness of the eyes, and similar symptoms, do not approach the patient or treat him.  In most cases, death is inevitable with these symptoms.
If you see symptoms that do not cause alarm and hope for his recovery, then begin his treatment.  This is if the injured person comes to you shortly after the injury, and if this is during the winter.
In any case, you should strive to remove the bone before the fourteenth day. If it is in the summer, you should hasten to remove the bone before the seventh day, before the membrane below the bone rots and causes the symptoms we have described.
If the fracture has reached the membrane covering the brain, and there is crushing and laceration, then you should cut away the crushed and lacerated part, as I describe to you: shave the head of the injured patient.
Expose the bone in any way possible, according to the shape of the wound and what is causing discomfort to the patient.  If, during the exposure of the bone, you encounter bleeding or a hot swelling, address it appropriately.
This means to fill the area with cloths dipped in a mixture of wine and rose oil, and to clean the wound until the swelling subsides and bleeding stops. Then, begin to manipulate and remove the bone, and this can be done in one of two ways.
One method is to cut the bone with a narrow, delicate incision. This is its depiction:
Then, use another incision wider than the first. This is its depiction:
Then, use another incision even wider than the second.  You should have several different incisions, some wider than others, some shorter than others, and they should have extremely sharp edges.  They should be made of Indian steel or good quality فولاد.
Use gentle force when striking the incision to avoid jarring the head and causing injury.  If the bone is strong and hard, it is necessary to perforate it around the area before using the incisions, with the type of drill called a "non-dipping" drill.
Because it does not go beyond the skull bone's edge, for the drill has a rounded edge below its sharp head, like a small ring or circle, preventing it from sinking and penetrating the thickness of the bone.
You should have many of these drills, each suitable for the thickness of that bone, so that for each skull, you have a drill with a sharp tip the correct length and shortness according to the thickness of that skull.  These are images of three types. Of drills, large, medium, and small.
As for how to drill around the fractured bone, place the drill on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been pierced, then move the drill to another location, leaving the distance between each hole equal to the thickness of a reed or similar.
Then, using the chisels, cut between each pair of holes, doing this with the utmost gentleness, as we said, so that you remove the bone either by hand or with other tools that you have prepared for this purpose.
Such as scrapers and fine forceps.  You must be extremely careful that the drill or chisel does not touch the periosteum.  If you have smoothed the bone and separated it from the periosteum, if any was attached, and you have removed it, it should then be cleaned.
Any roughness remaining on the bone is smoothed with another tool similar to a chisel, but it should be thinner and more delicate than the other chisels. If any small bone fragments or splinters remain, remove them gently using the tools at your disposal.
Then, the wound is treated afterward with compresses and ointments, as will be described later.  The other approach to treatment is quite simple, free of risk.  Galen discussed it and praised it highly.  This is what he said. First, you should begin by exposing the portion of the bone where the fracture is most severe and prominent.  Once you have exposed that part, position the tip of this lenticular chisel beneath it.  Here is its image:
The lenticular part of it should be smooth, cutting nothing.  The pointed part, at its tapering ends, as you see, should be positioned so that the lenticular part rests against the periosteum and the sharp edge of the chisel is against the bone.  Then, strike the chisel from one side.
With a small hammer, so that all the bone is broken gently, as it turns, and you are safe from injuring the membrane, no frightening accident will occur, even if the surgeon is the most ignorant and fearful person, indeed, even if he is asleep.
If any part of the membrane remains attached to the bone in some areas, scrape it away with the tip of the lenticular chisel itself, and detach it gently; it will be removed without harm or fear.
However, if the fracture of the bone has not reached the periosteum, and the broken surface of the bone remains rough and splintered, then you should remove those roughnesses and splinters with various-sized delicate instruments, so that you can use the one most suitable for each location, according to what the work requires.
With the same broken bone and its shape, you should initially use the widest of those instruments to scrape the bone, then use a narrower one after that, and continue doing so in succession until you finally use the narrowest and finest of them all.
As for the other small, hairline cracks and minor fractures, each should be treated according to what will repair it; this is something obvious to anyone with even a slight degree of skill in this craft, who has examined what we have written and explained about major fractures.
If the periosteum remains exposed after removing the bone, you should take a linen cloth the size of the wound, soak it in rose oil, and place it over the wound's opening.  Then take another cloth, folded or triangular. Soak it in rose water and oil, place it on the first cloth, doing this as gently as possible so as not to weigh down the peritoneum. Then use a wide bandage on top, and tie it only tightly enough to hold the wound.
Leave it with this treatment for a day or two, until the hot swelling subsides. Then loosen the bandage and use the following remedies afterwards, those that are conducive to drying, such as iris root, cressn, kender powder, and zarawand, etc.  Make poultices from these remedies.
And sprinkle the wound with these dry powders.  In general, use a remedy that cleanses without stinging.  Do your utmost during treatment to ensure the wound is clean, free of grease, dirt, or pus; never allow pus to collect in it.
Because if pus collects on the dura mater, it corrupts and putrefies it, causing a great affliction for the patient.  This can occur in the peritoneum of the head when the bone is exposed, especially if treatment is neglected.
If a dark discoloration appears on its surface, and if the patient exhibits the symptoms we have mentioned, know that he is doomed.  If the discoloration occurred due to a medicine applied, and if the potency of that medicine was such that it would cause this discoloration, .
You should take one part honey and three parts rose oil, blend them thoroughly, and then apply the mixture to a cloth.  Place this cloth on the peritoneum and treat it with the appropriate remedies until it heals.
Chapter Three.
In setting a fractured nose.
Know that the only parts of the nose that can fracture are both or one of its upper halves, because they are bone.  The lower part is cartilaginous and does not fracture, but may be bruised, bent, or perforated.
If one of its halves is fractured, you should insert a small finger into the nasal cavity and straighten the fracture from inside with your index finger and thumb from outside, until you have restored the nose to its natural shape.  Do this gently, being careful not to cause the patient pain.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and your finger cannot reach it, a blunt, slightly thick instrument should be used to straighten it.  If the fracture is in both sides, do likewise.  The reduction should be performed on the first day after the fracture.
If possible, otherwise, after seven or ten days, when the acute swelling has subsided, insert a wick made of linen thread into the nasal cavity if the fracture is on one side, or two wicks if the fracture is on both sides.
Let the wick be of a thickness sufficient to fill the nasal cavity. Some earlier practitioners of bone-setting advised soaking the wick in ghee and changing it every day. I do not agree with this; the wick should be soaked in beaten egg white mixed with mill dust.
Then the wick is left in place until the bone sets and the cartilage hardens.  You may also insert goose feather tubes, wrapped in soft linen, into the nasal cavity in the area of the wick.  This would provide more secure fixation of the fractured nose, and to ensure the patient can continue to breathe.
This is not essential; you may do it if you wish, or you may simply use the wicks.  If a hot swelling develops on the nose during your work, bandage the nose with linen cloth or cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil or a preparation from the diachylon ointment.
If no hot swelling develops, bandage the outside of the nose with fine semolina and powdered kender mixed with egg white.  Then place a soft bandage over it.  Do not tie the nose at all, if the nasal bones are fractured in small pieces.
Or if it has fractured into pieces, you must cut through it and remove it using the appropriate tool.  Then suture the gap and treat it with ointments that promote healing and suppuration. If there is a wound inside the nose, treat it with a wick and use lead tubes. Until it heals.
Chapter Four.
On setting a fractured lower jaw.
If the lower jaw is fractured and the fracture is not accompanied by an open wound, if the fracture is only from the outside and did not break into two pieces and is curved inward, then its recognition is easy.
If the fracture is in the right side, the index finger of the left hand should be inserted into the patient's mouth.  Likewise, if the fracture is on the left side, the index finger of the right hand should be inserted and gently lift the fracture bump from inside to outside.
With your other hand outside the bone, control its alignment.  If the jaw fracture has broken into two pieces, then traction from both sides is needed to straighten it. If this has occurred in the teeth, it will heal.
Or, if parts have come loose, tie what you hope to remain together with a gold, silver, or silk thread.  Then, place a splint over the fractured jaw.  Then, place a folded cloth over the splint.  Put a large, firm bandage, or a piece of leather the length of the jaw, over the cloth. Then, bind it from above in whatever way you deem appropriate to bring it together so it does not move.  Instruct the patient to be quiet and still.  Give him soft foods to eat. If you suspect a change in shape, reopen it on the third day.
Then, bind it from above in whatever way you deem appropriate to bring it together so it does not move.  Instruct the patient to be quiet and still.  Give him soft foods to eat. If you suspect a change in shape, reopen it on the third day. Then, fix what you have bound with mill dust and egg white or semolina flour, after removing the splint. Apply a soft compress to the bandage.  As long as the bandage adheres and the bone's condition does not change, leave it.
Do not reopen it until the fracture is healed and strong. This fracture often strengthens in three weeks. If a hot swelling appears during this time, use the remedies we have previously mentioned to calm it until it disappears.
And if the fracture is with an open wound, if a piece or pieces of bone have separated, gently remove those pieces with whatever tool is appropriate. If the wound opening is narrow, widen it with a scalpel as needed.
Then, if you have removed all the bone fragments, suture the wound opening if it is wide; otherwise, apply one of the appropriate ointments. And suture the wound until it heals.
Chapter Five.
On the setting of a fractured collarbone.
The collarbone is most often fractured from the front, at the end of the shoulder blade.  Its fracture can occur in one of three ways: either it fractures and splinters into two pieces without causing splinters, which is easiest to set;
Or, the fracture may have splinters, which is more difficult to set; or the fracture may be accompanied by a wound.  If the fracture is without a wound, have two assistants; one to hold the arm near the fractured collarbone, and the other to pull the neck towards the other side.
Then, align the fracture with your fingers until it is in the proper shape, without a bump or deformity.  If further pulling is needed, a ball of cloth or wool should be placed under the patient's armpit.
Hold the bone according to your needs, pulling and elevating the collarbone, and pressing the ball with your hand until the fracture is properly aligned.  If you cannot draw the fractured end of the collarbone outward because it has become buried, the patient should lie on their back.
A medium-sized cushion is placed under the patient's shoulder blade, and the assistant presses down on the patient's shoulder blade so that the buried part of the collarbone rises.  Then, correct and align the fracture with your fingers.
If you sense that a splinter of the collarbone has broken off and is moving, you should carefully separate and remove it. If the splinter is embedded in the bone, use a suitable cutting instrument to extract it. After placing the instrument that protects the diaphragm under the collarbone, which is made of wood or metal, this is its image:.
It resembles a spoon, without a handle, and its width should be adjusted to the size of the bone, while its length should be determined by the work required. Let it have two ends, one wider and the other narrower, as you see.
If the wound you made when extracting the bone splinter is wide and you fear inflammation, stitch the edges of the wound together. If the wound is minor or you fear severe inflammation, close the wound with sutures and dressings proportionate to the size of the incision.
If inflammation arises, soak the dressings in rose-water and vinegar or a potion and apply them.  If the bone is swollen without a wound or incision, apply a bandage made of millstone dust mixed with egg white. Place a soft pad on it, and if needed, place a ball under his armpit. Then take a very long turban, about a span wide or so.  Place a folded dressing over the pad and bandage.  Then take a splint of thin wood. Make it three fingers wide and the same in length. Then place it in a cloth, and then place this cloth with the splint in the part of the turban that covers the fracture site.  Then tighten the turban around the fracture as it circles. Tie it around his neck, and under his healthy armpit and under his injured armpit, and return it repeatedly to each side.  How you see that the tightening secures the fracture firmly is obvious to you.
The whole point is that the splint should not move from the broken bone. Therefore, you should examine the patient every day.  Whenever the ligaments loosen and you see the splint has shifted, correct it and tighten the bandage.  Then, make the patient sleep on his back and place a small pillow under his armpit at night.
So that his arm is raised from his side, and the clavicle fracture rises with the shoulder blade, or tie his arm to his neck. Do not loosen the bandage unless a wound or swelling occurs in the area within twelve days.
Then renew the dressing if you see a reason for it. Maintain the traction and leave it until the clavicle fracture is set and consolidated, and it strengthens further in twenty-eight days. And it may be in some people in less than that.
Chapter Six.
Concerning the setting of a shoulder fracture.  The shoulder rarely breaks in its broad portion, but rather in its bony projections.  If a part breaks or if it breaks in the middle, this can only be known by palpation.  Then, according to the form of the fracture, apply a splint.
Reduce it [the fracture] and restore it to its natural shape by every possible means, then apply to the area a mixture of millstone dust, egg white, and soft plaster.  Place over this a bandage of folded cloth, and then apply a wide splint of wood.
Make the splint as wide as or slightly wider than the entire shoulder.  If there is a protrusion beneath the splint on any part of the shoulder, smooth out that protrusion with soft plaster until the splint lies flat.  Then tie a long bandage over it.
Tie it securely and ensure that the splint does not shift from its position. Examine the bandage every day; if it loosens, tighten it and adjust the splint if it shifts. The patient should lie on his/her healthy side, and the shoulder will be set in twenty [days].
For a period of one or twenty-five days.  Once this period is complete, remove the bandage with confidence, as it is one of the bones that do not fear shattering or displacement.  If a bone fragment protrudes through the skin and is causing irritation, cut around it and remove it. Do what has been previously described for the treatment of clavicle fractures, in the case of any inflammation occurring.
Chapter Seven.
On the treatment of fractured ribs.
The chest can fracture in the middle, though this is infrequent.  Its extremities, however, are more prone to fracturing and fragmentation.  If the middle of the chest breaks, it tends to sag downward, and the patient experiences severe pain, difficulty breathing, and coughing.
Sometimes blood may be coughed up, and the depression in the fractured bone becomes evident, readily apparent to touch.  To treat the fracture, the patient should lie on their back, with a pillow between their shoulders.  Then, the patient's sides should be pressed together, and the ribs should be brought together with the hands, from both sides.  One should carefully align the ribs from all possible angles.
And hold it until the bone's shape returns to normal. Then, apply a bandage and splint, placing a thin board of poplar, willow or similar light wood as a splint over it, after wrapping it in a cloth. Then, carefully tie it to the fractured bone so it does not come loose.  Wrap the bandage around the back in a circular motion several times and tighten it firmly.  Inspect the bandage frequently, and tighten it whenever it loosens.
If the injury requires removing the splint due to an ulcer, pain, or swelling, then immediately remove the splint and bandage, and treat any affected area.  Then, if appropriate, reapply the bandage. And maintain the pressure until it heals.
Chapter Eight.
In the setting of fractured ribs, know that fractures occur in the thick parts of the ribs adjacent to the back, and their anterior ends.  Impacts to these areas often cause fractures, as they are cartilaginous.  This can be easily determined through palpation.
Treat the fracture by aligning the broken pieces with your fingers until they are properly aligned.  Then bandage and splint the fractured bone if necessary. If the ribs are fractured inwards, the patient will experience intense pain.
And the pain is like the pain of a person with a fistula, because the bone pierces the diaphragm, and also causes shortness of breath, coughing, and profuse spitting of blood.  This is a difficult condition to treat, and the ancients resorted to numerous methods to treat it.
Some say that the patient should consume foods that produce wind and gas to inflate the abdomen, thus expanding it and pushing the fractured bone outward.  We reject this, as it could exacerbate the development of a carbuncle if one has not already developed, or if it has, it will only make it worse.
Some said a cupping device should be placed on the area, then forcefully suctioned.  This is more or less logical, but one fears that the cupping device, due to the weakness of the area, might pull excessively at the site. Some others suggested covering the area with wool dipped in hot oil.
The spaces between the ribs become filled in, so that the ligament is even when wrapped around. Then the patient is treated for a fistula, through diet and medication. If the condition is severe, the patient cannot bear it. The bone was piercing the diaphragm in a painful way, and we feared for the patient.  Therefore, it is necessary to make an incision over the area, expose the fractured rib, then place beneath it the instrument that protects the peritoneum, as previously described, and carefully cut and remove the bone.
Then, if the wound is large, we bring together the edges and stitch them, and treat it with ointments until it heals. If a carbuncle arises during this time, quickly apply poultices in rose oil to the affected area, and treat the patient internally with remedies to relieve the swelling.
He should lie on the side on which he sleeps more easily until he heals.
Chapter Nine.
On setting the vertebrae of the back and neck.
Concerning the vertebrae of the neck, if fracture occurs, this is rare.  More common are contusions, and the same applies to the vertebrae of the back.  If this happens to someone, and you wish to know whether it will heal or not, ... If you see his hands have become relaxed, numb, and lifeless, unable to move, stretch, or grasp, and if you pinch or prick them with a needle, he feels no sensation or pain, know that he will likely not recover; he is in danger.
But if he can move them and feel the pinching and pricking, know that the spinal cord is intact and the patient will recover with treatment.  If a similar condition affects the vertebrae of the back and you wish to know if it will also heal, ...
Examine his legs.  If you see that they too have become relaxed, exhibiting the same condition as the hands, and then, when lying on his back, wind and stool are expelled involuntarily, and when lying on his stomach, urine is expelled involuntarily, ... If, lying on his back, he cannot urinate, know that he is doomed.  Do not bother with treatment.  If none of these occur, the matter is less serious.  Treatment for what has occurred should aim to reduce the intense inflammation.
By applying rose oil alone, or with roasted egg yolks, to the affected vertebrae three times a day, until the inflammation subsides.  Then apply a strengthening, absorbent dressing to the area, binding it with a bandage.  Advise rest and stillness.
He should sleep only on the side that does not cause him pain until he heals.  If a piece of bone or something else has broken off as a result of the injury, the skin should be cut open and the bone removed. Then, if the wound is large, its edges should be brought together with stitches, and treated with healing ointments until it heals.  If the coccyx, the tailbone, has also fractured, the little finger of the left hand should be inserted into the anus.
The broken bone should be aligned with the other hand as much as possible.  Then, a dressing and splint should be applied if necessary, and it should be bound tightly.
If you feel a broken fragment in it, cut open the area and remove it.  Treat the wound with the previously described methods until healed.
Chapter Ten.
On the setting of a fractured hip.
The bones of the hips rarely fracture.  If they do, the fracture is usually a splintering at the ends, a longitudinal splitting, and a tilting inward.  The patient experiences pain, throbbing, and numbness in the affected leg.
To set it, place your hand upon it to ascertain the nature of the fracture.  If the fracture is only at the ends, then straighten the fracture in whatever way appears suitable to you, until it resembles its natural shape.
If the fracture is lengthwise or has tilted inward, lay the patient on his stomach until you are ready to set the fracture.  Once you have straightened it, apply a bandage, then place a splint of wood or leather over it and firmly bind it.
Do not fear the fracture shifting or the splint coming loose.  Fill in any hollows around the hips to ensure even pressure.  Tell the patient to sleep on their back or on their sound side, if a hot swelling appears.
Stop pulling and setting it until the hot swelling subsides.  Apply whatever remedies are appropriate to soothe it, as before. Then return to setting and firmly binding it as necessary. If splinters or fragments from the ends of the bone appear, they should not be removed.
Do not touch [the splinters], but rather straighten [the bone] from the outside, as we said. Leave it bound until it heals.
Chapter Eleven.
On setting a fractured humerus.
The humerus is the bone between the elbow and the shoulder. If it is broken, set it using one of two methods. One method is to take a smooth, slightly curved stick of medium thickness, like this:
Tie straps to each end of the stick.  Then suspend it from a high point.  The patient sits in a chair, and then places their broken arm on the stick, so that their armpit is positioned in the middle of the curve of the stick.  Then suspend a heavy object from above it.
Or an attendant supports the arm below.  Then the physician aligns the fracture with his hands until the fracture is set correctly.  The other method is for the patient to lie on their back, and have their arm suspended from their neck with a strap.
Then instruct two attendants to hold the fracture, one above and the other below, and to pull in opposite directions. If you want a stronger pull, tie a strap below the fracture and another above, and have each attendant pull in their direction.
If the fracture is near the shoulder joint, the strap should be positioned under the armpit and the other under the fracture, towards the elbow.  Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, the straps should be positioned in that area and on the elbow itself.
Then gently align the fracture without force, until it is correctly aligned and fits well.  Then tighten the bandage, unless a hot swelling appears. If a hot swelling appears, delay tightening until the seventh day. Apply moistened cotton soaked in vinegar and rose oil to the area.
Until the swelling subsides. Then tighten the bandage.  The method of tightening is to hold the dressing over the fracture, then place a new cloth wrap over the dressing.  Then bring the arm up to the upper arm and position the hand open on the shoulder.
Hold the bandages and tighten them over the upper arm and forearm so that the arm acts as a splint, unless something prevents this or the broken bone shows no change. If you fear the bone might shift, use splints.
Place a splint wider and stronger than other splints directly on the fracture. Leave a space of one finger's width between each splint. The length of the splints should be in accordance with the fracture, with an additional three fingers on each side.
Then tighten the splints using the tightening method described in the first section.
The tightening should be more intense at the site of the fracture.
The further from the fracture, the less the tightening. If you find the splint placement and tightening as described earlier during your setting of the limb, then do it.
If you fear a hot swelling, leave the tightening and splints until the seventh day, as we said.  Then examine the ligaments every three days to prevent inflammation, swelling, or the limb's inability to receive nourishment due to excessive tightening.  Correct all these issues according to what we have previously mentioned.
If you are certain that nothing of that sort will happen, do not loosen the bandage until many days have passed.  The patient should lie on their back, with their hand on their abdomen.  A padded sleeve filled with wool, of moderate size, should be placed under the arm.
Examine at all times, night or day, to prevent the fractured limb from changing shape or the bandage from relaxing.  Correct all this with your effort.  Provide the patient with food in the manner we previously described; initially, let the food be soft until the bone has strengthened.
Then, the food should be thickened.  The arm and leg usually strengthen within forty days.  At that time, the bandage should be loosened, and the patient should use a bath and be treated with appropriate ointments. If the fracture is severe or displaced,
Do not loosen the bandage until fifty days or even two months.
Chapter Twelve.
On the setting of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, called the radius. One is small, and it is the one next to the thumb. The other is large and is located underneath the small one, at the bottom.  Perhaps only the larger radius bone is broken, or only the smaller one, or perhaps both are broken.
If the smaller, upper radius is broken, its setting is easier and healing is faster. If the lower radius is broken, the fracture is worse and healing is more difficult. The worst case is when both bones are fractured together.  If the bone which is broken is the small, upper radius.
Therefore, the physician, when setting it, should gently apply a slight traction to align it. If the larger radius is broken, the traction should be stronger. If both radii are broken, the traction should be significantly stronger.
The hand should be positioned, when setting and pulling, extended on a cushion, with the thumb raised higher than all the other fingers, the little finger lower than the other fingers, and the patient seated upright.
Let the cushion be at his height so that the patient does not have difficulty.
Then, an attendant supports the arm from below, either with their hand or a bandage, and another attendant supports it from above.  Then, the physician aligns the bone, returning it to the best possible shape. If the fracture has splinters, remove them.
Return each splinter to its place; if a splinter appears protruding, irritating the skin, and you have no hope of setting it, cut into it and remove it as described above. If the fracture is accompanied by a wound, a separate chapter is dedicated to it.
Treat it from there [the separate chapter].  If a hot swelling appears at the beginning of the setting, apply a bandage with qīrūṭī (a medicated cloth) made with rose oil and white wax, of medium thickness, and bandage it gently until the swelling subsides.
Remove the qīrūṭī and apply a bandage prepared from mill dust and egg white. Then, apply the splints. The splint over the fracture itself should be wider and stronger. Know that, in most cases, six splints are needed for the arm.
The fracture may be in one ulna or in both ulnae.  Then, make the tightening over the fracture area stronger and firmer.  As you move the tightening up or down, gradually loosen the tension, as previously mentioned in the beginning of the chapter.
Use soft, damp bandages to wrap the fracture, avoiding overly firm bandages.  Use linen thread of medium thickness, as previously described, to secure it. Check the limb and ligaments after a few days.
If any problem arises, such as irritation on the limb, warm water should be applied to the limb until the irritation subsides.  Leave the limb unbandaged for a night to rest, then reapply the bandage.
If the bandage has become loose and the bone has shifted, or something similar has occurred, correct all of it to the best of your ability. Also, if the limb is deprived of nourishment due to excessive tightening, loosen the bandage slightly and leave it for a few days until the nourishment reaches it, then tighten it again.
If the patient experiences none of the problems mentioned, the bandage should not be removed until approximately twenty days have passed.  Then, suspend the patient's arm from their neck, keeping the arm straight.  The patient should avoid strenuous or jarring movements and sleep on their back.
Know that this arm fracture may heal in thirty days, or thirty-two, or perhaps in twenty-eight days, all depending on the constitution and strength of the individual.
Chapter Thirteen.
On setting fractures of the hand and fingers.
The metacarpals of the hand and the phalanges of the fingers rarely fracture, but often suffer contusions.  When a fracture or contusion occurs to the hand...
The patient should sit with legs folded, and a chair before him at the same level.
Then, the patient places his hand outstretched on the chair, and the hand bone's attendant extends and straightens it. The physician adjusts it until a good alignment is achieved.  At that time, a bandage and splint should be applied, unless a hot swelling has developed. Then, a splint is to be placed over the area.
Wrap it in a soft cloth. If the fracture is towards the palm of the hand, shape the cloth into a ball and tell the patient to grasp it with their injured hand, then secure it with a long bandage.
The splint should be made of soft leather so that the skin heals with all the hand's movements, and it should be tightened appropriately. If the fracture is outward, then a splint should be placed on top and another underneath the hand to keep it open and upright.
Then, the splint should be tightened as the hand moves and tied together with a bandage around the fingers. If the fracture is in one of the fingers, if it's the thumb, straighten it appropriately, then splint it with the hand.  If you like, you can use a small, separate splint to straighten the fracture.
If the fracture is in any other finger, such as the middle, index, ring, or little finger, straighten them and bandage them to the healthy adjacent finger, or bandage them all together, which is better, or use a small separate splint.
As we said about the thumb, and check carefully after setting the fracture and away from the hot swelling.  Address it appropriately if anything like that occurs, as previously described.
Chapter Fourteen.
In the setting of a fractured thigh.
The thighbone often fractures and is easily felt because it shifts back and forth.  Its reduction is done by applying a bandage above the fracture and another below, with the patient lying on their face.
Then each bandage's attendant stretches it evenly to their side, if the fracture is in the middle of the bone.  However, if it is near the origin of the thigh, a soft bandage, either of wool or similar material, should be applied.
At the origin of the thigh, towards the pubic area, the stretching should be upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture.  Similarly, if the fracture is near the knee, the bandage should be near the knee to allow stretching downwards.  Then the physician should align the bone with both hands until it is restored to its natural form.
The bone will heal well.  Then, the bandage and tension should be maintained unless inflammation occurs in the limb.  If inflammation occurs, leave it for a few days until the heat subsides, then resume treatment.
As for the tension, a wide, firm bandage should be wrapped around the fracture twice or thrice, leaving excess material.  Then the leg should be twisted so that the heel is at the origin of the thigh, and a long thread is inserted between the thigh and leg near the lower part of the knee, with the thread ends extending from both sides.
Then, wrap the remaining bandage around the leg and thigh.  Next, place splints on the thigh, directly over the fractured area, and create a single splint on the leg bone.  Fill the gap between the thigh and leg with soft padding to ensure even tension.
Then begin with firm tension from the middle over the fracture site, three or four turns.  As the bandage moves away from the fracture, the tension should be lighter, softer, and looser.
Then, take the ends of the thread you inserted between the thigh and leg, and tie the adjacent splints above it.  Then, pass the thread ends downwards to the heel of the leg and use them to tighten the splint ends on the other side.
So that the bandage does not shift from its position, maintain the tension as long as there is no ulceration, swelling, or puffiness in the limb.  If any of these occur, quickly loosen it and rectify any resulting problem as previously described.
If the bone has a fragment that pierces, it should be smoothed if possible.  Otherwise, cut around it and remove it. Treat the wound as previously described until it heals.  Sometimes, this thigh fracture can be splinted without including the leg.
As previously mentioned for the humerus and arm, splinting in this way does not cause lameness in the patient. However, if you splint only the arm, and not the leg as well, the patient will always be lame.
Know that the thigh takes fifty days or slightly more or less to heal, depending on the differences in temperaments and other conditions.
Chapter Fifteen.
In the fracture of the kneecap.
The kneecap rarely fractures, but it is often bruised. If a fracture does occur, it is either a crack or a splintering of its parts, and this may or may not be accompanied by a wound.
One must ascertain all of this through examination, and treat it by aligning the separated parts with the fingers until they come together, according to the best possible alignment, gentleness, and precision.  Then apply a bandage and a circular splint if necessary.
And apply further binding in accordance with that, then treat all situations described for other fractures, such as inflammation and the like, by responding to each symptom with the appropriate treatment until healed.
Chapter Sixteen.
On the setting of a fractured leg.
The leg has two bones, one thick called the tibia and the other thin called the ulna.  They are subject to the same types of fractures as the arm bones. Therefore, setting it is similar to setting the arm; the procedure is the same. If both bones are fractured, the leg tilts in all directions. If the thinner bone is fractured, the leg tilts forward.  If the thicker bone is fractured, particularly from below, this is evident to you.
Therefore, use extension and straightening, and bind the splints accordingly, just as in the case of the arm.  However, if the fracture of the leg is severe, with many fragments, the extension should be less and gentler, and apply your efforts to the setting carefully.
There is something extra in the procedure for the leg compared to the arm.  Once you have straightened the splints and completed all your work, take two pieces of pine wood, used for smoothing the surfaces of rooms, or pieces of palm fronds, or something similar.
Choose from them something of moderate thickness, not thin, and let its length be the length of the leg from the knee downwards. Then wrap each one with two layers of cloth lengthwise, placing one on the leg and the other on the opposite side.
Let them extend from the knee to the foot. Then tie the two pieces of wood in three places at the ends and the middle. With this restraint, the leg will not tilt to the right or left and will be properly straightened.  A trough of wood may also be used along the length of the leg.
Place it in this trough to prevent movement.  This is particularly important in fractures with accompanying wounds. Then examine the leg every day, paying close attention to any swelling, puffiness, or other such things. If anything of this sort occurs, address it appropriately until it heals. The leg bone will be rejoined in thirty days or thereabouts.
Chapter Seventeen.
In the fracture of the leg bones and fingers.
The heel bone is never subject to fracture.  The bones of the leg may be fractured, and the fingers rarely fracture; rather, they are more often injured by contusion.
If a fracture of the leg bones occurs and you see the bones overlapping, have the patient stand on the ground upright, then place your foot on the raised portion of the bones and press down, aligning them.
Until they return to their proper positions. Then, take the bandage and splint, place a small, flat board with two ends beneath the sole of the foot.  Securely bind the foot with the bandage, cloth, and other necessary items.
If three or four days pass, loosen the bandage. You will find the bones aligned, whether they were fractured or dislocated. The procedure is as described.  If some of the fingers are fractured, realign and straighten them according to the instructions given for realigning the fingers of the hand.
Then, create a splint for the fractured finger, extending the length of the finger and slightly wider than it.  Place the board, as previously described, beneath the foot and secure it tightly. If two, three, or more bones are fractured.
Place a splint of appropriate size, wrapped in soft cloth, on each finger. Secure the board beneath the foot.  Ensure each end of the board extends beyond the foot's sole for proper stabilization.
You should not forget to consider all the previously mentioned symptoms in all fractures, and address each symptom appropriately.
Chapter Eighteen.
Fractures of the female pubic bone and the male pubic bone.
When the woman's vulva is fractured, have her sit crouched, then gently lean her back slightly.  Have someone hold her from behind.  Then, the midwife should pack her vulva with cotton until it is full, like a ball.
Then, the woman should be shaken, and her pelvis raised slightly, bit by bit.  The cotton will then emerge, forming a ball at the entrance of the vulva. The fracture of the bone will then be reduced.  Then, apply a pad to her back. When she wants to urinate, remove the cotton gently so she can urinate.
And replace it in the position it was initially placed, then return to the first pad. Do this for seven days or so, and it will set.  If you wish, take a sheep's bladder, tie a tube of reed to its opening, and insert the entire bladder into her vulva.
Then, blow into the tube forcefully so that the bladder inflates inside the vulva.  The fracture will then be reduced.  Then pack it with cotton and keep it as described until it heals.  As for when the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, this [method] is used for its reduction.
And its reduction is as described for the hip bone.  The correct procedure for these rare fractures should be clear to you, especially for those with some skill, and who understand this book. Indeed, the fracture itself often provides guidance.
Following the correct method for its reduction and fixation, understand this.  As for the penis of a man, if it is fractured, take a goose's windpipe, insert it into the penis, and place a bandage of cloth over it, binding it. Leave it for three days or so until healed.
Chapter Nineteen.
On the reduction of bone fractures when accompanied by a wound.
Whoever is presented with a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially if the bone is large, such as the femur or humerus, or similar, should immediately perform venesection if the conditions for venesection, as previously mentioned, are met.
If the wound is bleeding, you should immediately cauterize it with powdered alum, if nothing else is available, and then proceed with the reduction of the fracture on that very day, and do not delay it.
If no inflammatory swelling occurs, if an inflammatory swelling does occur, then postpone the reduction until the ninth day, until the inflammatory swelling subsides. Do not approach it at all on the third and fourth days, as it exposes it to undesirable symptoms.
If the fractured bone is protruding and exposed on the skin, you should gently and gradually attempt to return it to its place and align it with your hands. If you cannot return it and align it with your hands, then return it using this instrument, which is made of iron, and is seven or eight fingers long. And its width should match the size of the wound.
Therefore, the physician should make three or four of these, according to the treatment needed for each type of fracture. Let them be rounded and have slight thickness, so that they do not bend when being poked during use.
And they should be sharp-pointed, with a bend at the tip. The top should be thick, and from the middle to the bottom, much thinner. This is its image/shape.
And it is called in Greek "perem," meaning a small lever.  The sharp, bent end should be placed on the protruding bone end and pushed once until the bone returns and is somewhat aligned, then the fracture ends are further aligned.
If the broken end is thin and the instrument does not grip it well, then the end of that bone should be cut so that the instrument can hold it.  If it is still not possible to restore the bone as described, then cut it with a similar cut as those mentioned.
Or spread it open with one of the saws, in whatever way is possible for you, then remove any remaining roughness and thin scales from the bone. If, after returning the bone, the patient experiences severe, harmful pain, then know that the bone has not returned to its natural position.
If you can return it to its natural position, do so, for you will greatly benefit the patient.  Once the bone is completely set, soak a cloth in a black astringent drink, especially if it is summer. Do not place any bandages or anything oily on the wound.
So that no putrefaction or decay occurs. Then apply splints when you have finished setting the bone. Leave the wound uncovered, making a hole in the bandages large enough for the wound using scissors.
Beware, most carefully, of tightening the wound along with the fracture.  Often the ignorant physicians do this and cause their patients either death, or ulceration, or a cold.  Let your tightening be gentle, loose, and different from the tightening of other fractures.
If the wound is bad, or large, and you fear some of the bad symptoms we have described, and he feels distressing pain at the site, then you should not apply splints. Instead, make bandages of strong cloths in place of the splints, and bind it tightly with them.
If after a day or two, you see pus beginning to form in the wound, remove the cloth soaked in the solution that you placed on it. Then use dressings and ointments as we are accustomed to use for wounds, like the four-fold ointment and similar ones.  You should also loosen the bandage.
Examine the wound each evening and morning until it heals and is cured.  The limb should be positioned so that the pus drains downwards easily. If the wound takes many days and does not close, or the pus does not stop, know that there are small pieces of bone.
You should then probe the wound with a probe.  Remove any of those fragments that have come loose.  If any remain unloosened, and are piercing the limb, causing pain, then cut them out and remove them by any means possible.
If the wound develops a cold, or an eating away, or another type of corruption or putrefaction, you should counter each symptom with a similar treatment as described in its chapter.
When a large, prominent bone, such as the thigh bone or the upper arm bone, or similar large bones, is fractured, do not attempt to pull it out or remove it. Often death results from this.  Leave it until it rots.  Perhaps it will fall out of itself after twenty or thirty days.
Then treat the wound if you see an opportunity for treatment; otherwise, leave it.
Chapter Twenty.
On treating the suppuration that occurs after some fractures.
This suppuration often occurs after the fracture has healed, especially when near the joints.  It disfigures the limb and may prevent it from its natural function.
If the suppuration is fresh, use astringent remedies such as mastic, frankincense, myrrh, asafoetida, acacia, and the like, taking some or all of these, and mixing them with an astringent liquid, egg white, or vinegar.
Apply it to the suppuration, tightly bandaging it, and leave the bandage on for many days.  Then, remove it and repeat the process until the suppuration disappears, God willing, or apply a tight lead plate over it.
Lead has a property of removing any matter in the limbs.  If the suppuration has hardened and become severe, and necessity demands its removal, cut through it from above, removing the excess tissue or scraping it with some instrument until it disappears. Then treat the wound until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-One.
On treating a fracture, if the limb, after being set, remains thin and not in its original form.
If a fractured bone is set and the limb afterward remains thin and weak, this is due to many reasons. One reason is either excessive loosening and re-tying of the ligaments improperly, or excessive tightening of the ligaments, preventing nourishment from reaching the limb, or excessive and improper poulticing, or excessive and inappropriate movement, or insufficient and weak blood in the patient's body.
The treatment for this is to nourish the patient and strengthen his body so that there is more blood in him, and to use baths, bring joy and happiness to him, and similar methods.  Then, apply asphalt to the limb to draw a lot of nourishment to it, or continuously poultice it with lukewarm water. Until nourishment flows to it and it returns to its natural shape.
Chapter Twenty-Two.
On the treatment of fractured bones that have been set crookedly and prevented from functioning properly.
If, after healing, a limb that has been set shows a crookedness or protrusion of the fractured bone, or a deformity, and the appearance of the limb is therefore marred. However, if the limb is not prevented from its natural function, then one should not accept the claim of those who assert that the limb should be broken from the head, a practice often performed by ignorant physicians and setters in our country.
This action is highly reprehensible and leads to great harm and likely injury.  But if the crookedness and deformity are recent, then it is appropriate to apply water in which relaxing herbs such as plantain leaves, its roots, and kings' crown, and similar ones, have been boiled.
And it is bandaged with relaxing dressings such as well-made diachylon, or the juice of the plantain root is taken and mixed with chicken fat and ghee, and bandaged with it, or the oily figs are taken, pounded with pigeon droppings and similar remedies called 'resolvers of inflammation'.
And the deformity will resolve through gentle, continuous massage with the hands, and the limb is moved in all directions at all times.  If the curvature has become severe, old, and hardened, and the need arises to treat it with iron.
Then it is necessary to cut it open above, releasing the connection of the bone and cutting off any excess deformity or bone with delicate cuts, using care and gentleness.  Then the wound is treated as previously mentioned until it heals.
Chapter Twenty-Three.
The jaw is a dislocated joint that prevents movement, spoils the appearance of the limb, and causes the patient severe pain and discomfort. If a person experiences a dislocated jaw, immediate repositioning is essential.
Delaying treatment is absolutely not permitted.  If delayed, the area will swell and become a hardened mass, making jaw repositioning difficult.  Therefore, it should not be delayed, nor should it be moved or stretched while it is swollen, for the patient often experiences painful spasms and discomfort.
However, if this occurs, the patient should first be bled, then allowed to rest until the swelling subsides somewhat.  The limb should then be bathed with warm water and oil, and the jaw gently repositioned.  Each limb should be treated as described in its respective section.
The chapters on the jaw are also arranged according to the preceding descriptions of fractures, from the upper to the lower parts of the body.
Chapter Twenty-Four.
On the treatment of the lower jaw.
The jaws rarely dislocate, and their dislocation occurs in one of two ways: either they slightly depart from their positions, relaxing slightly, or they completely and entirely dislocate, relaxing completely. To the extent of the chest, so that the patient's saliva drips, and he is unable to retain it, nor can he close his jaw or speak, articulating his tongue.  However, if the dislocation is slight, it often returns to its normal position easily.
But if the dislocation is complete, then it is necessary to promptly return it, and never delay.  The attendant should grasp the patient's head, and the physician should insert the thumb of one hand into the base of the jaw inside the patient's mouth, if the jaw is dislocated on one side.
Or insert both thumbs, if the jaw is dislocated on both sides, and use the rest of his fingers from the outside to adjust. He should instruct the patient to relax his jaw and let it go in every direction, while the physician adjusts and pushes the jaw back into its place.
If returning it is difficult, especially if both jaws are involved, use a hot water compress and ointment to make it easier to return them, and never delay their return as we have said.  Once they return and are aligned, and the patient's mouth is closed and the jaws are not relaxed, then apply strips of cloth soaked in ointment and rose-scented wax and ointment.
Then gently tie with a loose bandage. The patient should sleep on their back, with their head supported between two pillows so that they do not move it to the right or left, and do not attempt to chew anything; instead, their food should be soft and easily swallowed.
Until the pain is gone and the jaw is set, let him eat as he desires, and he should use it gently, and not exert himself to open his mouth for eating, drinking, or yawning until the jaw is set and healed.
If returning the jaws is difficult, when they have become dislocated and not returned to their positions, it often leads to fever, persistent headache, and possibly the patient's stomach will upset, and he may vomit repeatedly. If you see this, know that it is damaged.
Often, someone who experiences this dies within ten days.
Chapter Twenty-Five.
On the reduction of the clavicle and shoulder joint.
Regarding the clavicle, it does not dislocate from the inner side due to its connection to the chest.  It may dislocate outwards, and this is noticeable to the touch.  To reduce it, the patient should lie on their back and extend their arms.
Then, firmly press the area with your hand, and it will return to its place.  Then, apply bandages and splints, and secure them.  As for the portion of the clavicle near the shoulder, it rarely dislocates.  If it does, it should be reduced and set as described, and as much as you can manage.
Then you apply bandages, splints, and dressings, and instruct the patient to remain still and quiet until healed.  By the same treatment, the shoulder joint is reduced if it also comes out of place.
Chapter Twenty-Six.
In reducing the shoulder joint.
Know that the shoulder joint dislocates in three ways: one, downwards towards the armpit; two, towards the chest; and three, upwards, behind the shoulder.  This last is rare.
It does not dislocate behind the shoulder blade, nor in front of the nerve.  It most commonly dislocates downwards, towards the armpit, especially in those with little muscle, for it quickly exits and quickly re-enters.
However, in those with substantial muscle, the opposite is true; it exits with difficulty and re-enters with difficulty.  Sometimes, a blow or fall may cause the shoulder to swell with a hot, inflamed lump, leading one to believe a dislocation has occurred;  it is thus necessary to examine this carefully to determine its nature.
Then, in treating it, if the dislocation is downwards toward the armpit, if you place the dislocated shoulder against the healthy one, you will find a noticeable difference; you will find a deformity in the head of the shoulder and, under the armpit when touched, the head of the shoulder is like an egg.
The afflicted person cannot raise their arm to their ear, nor perform any other movements.  Likewise, if dislocated towards the chest or upwards, this will be evident upon examination.
This dislocation may be easily reduced if the shoulder is soft, or if the patient is a child.  To reduce it, have an attendant raise the arm above the head, then place your thumb beneath the armpit, and forcibly lift the joint upward to its proper position, while the attendant raises and extends the arm upwards.
Then, lower it downwards, and it will return quickly. If it does not return by the method described, and the dislocation has occurred many days prior, the patient should bathe in hot water and use remedies that loosen and soften the muscles, such as cooking the root of a plant called 'al-khatmi', fenugreek, and "crown of the king" in water, and apply it.
Then the patient lies on their back, and a ball of wool of moderate firmness is placed under the armpit.  The physician places his heel on the ball, holds the patient's hand in his hand, and extends it downwards.
And pushes the ball with his foot, and the dislocation will return to its proper place. Or, if you wish, use this method: have a man taller than the patient stand on the side, placing his shoulder under the patient's armpit and lifting the armpit upward so that the patient is suspended in the air. And another attendant pulls the patient's hand down toward the patient's abdomen. If the patient is light, something should be attached to weigh him down, and the joint will return immediately.  It may also be reduced by another method.
Another method is to place a long, round-headed wooden board on the ground, similar to the pestle head of a mortar, neither thick nor thin.  A soft cloth is placed on the top of the board, and the patient, standing along the length of the board, has the board placed under their armpit.
Then the patient extends their hand downwards on the other side, and stretches their body forcefully in the other direction, and the joint returns quickly to its place.  If reduction is difficult by all the previously mentioned methods, use this treatment: take a board about two cubits long. Its width should be about four fingers and its thickness about two fingers. It should have a rounded head to easily fit into the armpit, in this manner:
Then a soft cloth is tied to the rounded head so that the board does not injure the patient, and it is placed under the armpit.  The entire hand and arm are extended downward along the board.  The board is tied to the upper arm, forearm, and hand.
Then the arm is placed on a crossbar.  The arm is extended downward, and the rest of the body is allowed to hang from the other side.  Then the joint will enter its place.  If the joint enters by any means possible, a moderately sized ball of wool should be placed under the armpit.
Then the prepared dressing of mill dust with frankincense and egg white is applied to the entire shoulder, moving from above.  The ball is firmly tied under the armpit, and the bandage is wrapped around the dressing from above. The patient's hand is suspended from their neck.
The patient's hand should not be moved for seven days.  The patient's diet should be kept light to strengthen the limb, which speeds recovery.  The bandage is then removed after seven or five days, and the patient is encouraged to move the limb.  If the limb remains firm and does not relax, the patient is cured.
If the joint dislocates frequently due to moisture or another cause, cauterization with three layers of cauterizing material, as described in the chapter on cauterization, should be used. If all of this is done, and the bandage is removed after seven days, and the joint does not remain stable, ...
If the bandage and tightening are repeated many times, but the joint remains unstable, dislocates, and relaxes, and the patient cannot raise their arm, then know that the nerve in the head of the shoulder has been severed, stretched, or relaxed. In that case, know that the joint will never be stable.
For the jaw, which is towards the chest and breast, and to the back, it should be repositioned by pushing and pulling with the hands until it returns to place. All other methods of tightening and treatment should be used until it heals.  If, after healing, there is sensitivity or sluggishness in the limb, ...
The patient should use a bath frequently until the sensitivity subsides and returns to its original state.
Chapter Twenty-seven.
On the treatment of the elbow joint.
The elbow joint dislocates with difficulty, and also returns with difficulty.  It dislocates in all directions, especially forward or backward.  Its dislocation is not hidden from you, as it is situated under the sight and under the touch; its displaced form is evident.
If you compare the dislocated elbow to the healthy one, the dislocation will be evident to you through the depression of the joint. The arm cannot be bent, nor can the shoulder be touched. You must act quickly to reduce the dislocation before a hot swelling develops.
If a hot swelling develops, reducing the dislocation will be difficult, and it may never heal.  Especially if the dislocation is backward, this is the worst of all dislocations, the most painful, and often leads to death.
If it is possible to reduce the dislocation, the attendant should extend his arm fully outstretched with both hands, and the physician's hands should be positioned above and below the elbow.  He should push the joint back into place with both thumbs or the base of his palms.
If the dislocation is forward, the hand may be bent once so that the base of the palm strikes the corresponding shoulder. If the dislocation does not return, use very strong and forceful traction; have two attendants extend the arm.
Two attendants should also hold the patient to prevent movement during the traction. Then, the arm is rotated in each direction after wrapping a folded cloth or wide bandage around it.  If the physician is applying his hands to the joint, he should use ointment on it to aid in smoothly dislocating the joint.
Then the joint is pushed forcefully until it returns.  After reduction, a bandage containing compression, drying agent, and egg white should be firmly applied, and the arm should be suspended from the patient's neck for several days.
Then remove the bandage. If the joint is securely in place and the ligaments are released, leave it. If you see the joint hasn't fully stabilized, reapply the bandage and splint, and leave it for several days until it strengthens, then remove it. If swelling occurs after the joint is reduced and the bandage is removed,
If movement is difficult, use moist heat in a bath, gentle massage, and kneading until it becomes soft, or apply a thick, padded pad to the joint, bind it, and leave it on for a day and night. Then remove it and place him in a bath. Once he sweats, massage the joint gently.
Then reapply the pad one, two, and three times, with each bath, until it softens. If you want to use moist cow dung mixed with ghee and firmly bind it, do so repeatedly.  It will soften and return to its original condition.
Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On treating a dislocated wrist.
The wrist frequently dislocates, and its reduction is easier than that of other joints, but it is necessary to hasten its reduction at the time of dislocation, before inflammation or a hot swelling develops in the area.
To reduce it, place the patient's wrist on a board, and have an attendant extend the arm. The physician should place their hand over the joint protuberance and push until it returns.  However, it is necessary to observe if the dislocation has moved to the back of the hand.
Let the patient place the outside of their hand on the board when extending and reducing it.  If the dislocation is outward on the hand, then let the inside of the hand be on the board so the physician's hand can be placed over the same joint protuberance. If it returns immediately, do so, otherwise, secure it with a compress that is soothing for the swelling.
Leave it alone; do not repeat the attempt, for it cannot bear it, and you cannot reduce it after days have passed, but the joint will remain crooked. It will not harm the patient, unless the hand is weakened, and cannot grasp anything.
Then you will know that the nerve is severed or crushed, and there is no remedy except to apply cauterization.  Perhaps this will help, or perhaps not.  If the wrist is reduced, apply the compress that we described, then secure it and leave it for five days.
Then it is released, and the hand is exercised.  If its movement is impeded and some form of stiffness appears, soften it with heated water and rub it repeatedly until it becomes soft.
The twenty-ninth chapter.
On the treatment of dislocated fingers.
Fingers may dislocate in any direction.  If a finger dislocates to the palm's surface, whether on the front or back, extend the finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it returns to its place, then bandage the finger's head and secure it in the direction to which it dislocated.
Leave it for two days, then release it and extend it until it stands straight on that day.  If it is night, bandage it as described. Continue to loosen it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bandage it at night.  Do this for several days until it strengthens.
And do the same if it dislocates to the inside of the hand, bandaging it towards the same direction, and apply your first procedure until it heals.  Do the same if it dislocates to any other direction.
Chapter Thirty.
In the treatment of the dislocation of the spine's vertebrae.
When a vertebra of the spine or neck is completely dislocated, or many vertebrae are displaced from their positions, there is no treatment, for death quickly comes to the patient.
A sign of this is that the patient's stool is expelled involuntarily; he cannot control it.  Often, some of his limbs, either both legs, or both arms, or one of each, become relaxed.  If one vertebra is displaced from its position, it often relocates itself.
Its displacement can occur in four directions.  The one that moves backward is called a hump.  If the hump has developed from childhood, there is no treatment, nor will it ever heal.  However, if it was caused by a fall, a blow, or similar injury...
The ancients described various treatments with lengthy explanations, much of which is of little use.  I have summarized what is necessary, providing a concise approach, better than their extensive methods.  I have clarified the matter and illustrated the process differently from what they have described and explained.
Therefore, I say that a hump that develops in the front of the chest has no cure.  The same is true for those in the sides.  However, the only one that can be treated is that which develops in the back, specifically by the method I am describing.  This involves placing the patient on his face.
On a level platform near a wall, a damp mat is spread beneath to prevent injury to the chest.  Then, a vertical plank, planted in a hole in the ground, is placed near the head at one end of the platform, and another plank near the feet at the other end of the platform.
A servant holds one plank, not secured in the hole, and another servant holds the other plank in the same manner.  A soft, strong bandage is then wrapped around the patient's chest and under their armpits.  The end of the bandage is extended to the plank near the head and tied to it.
Another bandage is then tied above the hips, above the knees, and at the ankles.  Then all the bandages are gathered together and tied to the other plank, near the feet.  Each servant then pulls on their plank with the bandage, and the planks remain fixed in their positions.
However, the planks, as we said, are not secured. The physician places their hands firmly on the hump until it straightens, or places a board on it and leans on the board with their legs until it straightens. If it does not straighten with this treatment, a board approximately three cubits long is taken.
A space is hollowed out in the wall, near the patient, into which the end of the board is placed. The middle of the board is then placed on the hump.  The physician places their legs on the opposite end of the board and pulls firmly to apply pressure to the hump.
And it returns to its place.  If you wish, you can make it with a hand-wound torsion, which means driving two planks, each one cubit long, into the ground at the patient's head, at the end of the shop, and also two similar planks at their feet, also at the end of the shop.
Let there be a span between each plank. A hole is made in each plank for the torsion to run through. The planks are securely fastened to the ground so that they do not move at all.  A twisted stick, which is the torsion, is placed in the holes of the two planks to wrap the bandage around.
At one end of the stick is a hole, securely fitted with a stick one span long, which is twisted, and the same is done for the other two planks.  Then the bandage applied to the patient's chest is tightened to the torsion at the head, and the bandages applied to the legs are tightened to the torsion at the feet.
Then a servant stands beside each torsion, twisting the torsion with the twisting implement, while the physician adjusts the hump as previously described. This is an illustration of the torsion, the shop, and the patient.
Then, after the fracture returns to its proper position and the area is aligned, it is necessary to apply a bandage that has been dried with egg white, then padded, and then place a splint over the bandage made of a board, which is about three fingers wide or thereabouts, and as long as needed to cover the hump.
And place some correct beads over it, then bind it with the necessary bandage. The patient should use gentle food until recovery. If some swelling remains in the area at the end of the healing process, then it is necessary to use medications that loosen and soften, along with the use of the splint that we described for a long time.
A lead plate may also be used in this case.  A swelling may appear at the end of the vertebrae, and it may be mistaken for dislocation.  It could be an extra bone that has protruded.  Do not use this treatment for it, as death may result.
Chapter Thirty-one.
On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the shoulder joint are only subject to dislocation, and are not subject to the slight displacement and displacement that occur in other joints. The hip joint dislocates in four ways.
This is because it dislocates inward, outward, forward, and backward.  It dislocates inward most often, and rarely forward or backward.  A sign of an inward dislocation is that if you align the patient's healthy leg with the affected one, the healthy leg will be longer.
The knee will be more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient will not be able to bend their leg at the groin. The area below the groin will be swollen and clearly noticeable, because the head of the femur has moved there.
The signs of an outward dislocation are opposite to these signs.  The sign of a forward dislocation is that the leg is fully extended, but cannot be bent without pain in the knee.  If the patient attempts to walk, they cannot do so forward.
The patient retains urine and their groin is swollen. When walking, they place their weight on their heel.  A sign of a backward dislocation is that the knee does not extend, and the patient cannot bend it until the groin is bent.  The leg is also shorter than the other one.
The groin is relaxed, and the head of the femur is clearly visible near the hip.  As for the treatment of these types of dislocations, if the dislocation is longstanding and the patient has not attempted to reduce it, and it remains in its condition, then there is absolutely no cure.
Therefore, one should not attempt to treat it.  As for a recent dislocation, whatever type of the four types of dislocation it may be, promptly manipulate the joint, extending it inward and outward, and moving it to the right and left.  Perhaps...
If it returns, no further treatment is needed.  If it does not return this way, a strong, capable assistant should be positioned to extend the leg from below, either with their hands or with a bandage tied above the knee.  A second assistant should extend it from above.
The first assistant should place their hands under the armpits, then apply a soft bandage to the base of the thigh.  A third assistant holds the end of the bandage, and the extension is done either from the front, from the groin toward the collarbone, or from behind toward the back.
All the assistants should extend simultaneously until the patient is lifted off the ground and suspended.  This type of extension is common to all four types. If the dislocation is reduced as described, then no further treatment is necessary. Otherwise, each type requires a specific treatment, as I have described.
For a dislocation inward, the patient should lie on their sound side, and a bandage should be applied to the base of the thigh, between the top of the thigh and the area below the groin.
Then the bandage is extended upward from the groin to the upper body, towards the collarbone.  A strong assistant then takes hold of the thick part of the affected thigh with both arms and pulls outwards forcefully, and it will return to its place.
This method is easier than the other methods for reducing this limb. If this approach is unsuccessful and you cannot use this method at all, then the patient's legs should be bound with a strong, soft bandage, around the heels and knees.
Each bandage should be approximately four fingers' width apart.  The affected leg should be extended further than the other by about two fingers' width.  The patient should be suspended from the head by a beam in the house, with the beam a distance of two arms' length from the ground.
Then a strong servant should grasp the upper part of the thigh, and another servant should pull the patient upwards.  The servant grasping the thigh should push forcefully, and the joint will quickly return to its place.  As for its specific reduction if the dislocation is outward,
The patient should lie on a raised platform, as described in the section on the humpback, and the bandage should be tightly applied to their affected leg and chest.  Then, two boards should be placed, one at the patient's feet and the other at their head, and a further board should be placed firmly in the middle of the platform.
Damp cloths should be wrapped around the boards to prevent injury to the patient. The board should be positioned between the patient's thighs to prevent them from pulling down during the stretching.  Then, each attendant should pull in their respective direction, and the physician should align the hip with their hands, if it returns to its place.
Otherwise, place the board on the patient and apply pressure as described for the humpback case, except that the patient should lie on their healthy side.  If the dislocation is forward, the patient's leg should be stretched in this same position on the platform.
The physician places the palm of their right hand on the affected hip, then presses it with the other hand.  The pressure should be extended downward towards the knee.  If the dislocation is backward, the patient should not be pulled downwards.
The patient should be elevated off the ground, but placed on a firm surface.  The hip should also be externally dislocated, as previously described, when lying on the platform on their face, with the bandages tight.
As we previously stated, pressure should also be applied with the board to the area where the joint has dislocated.  When the hip joint has returned correctly, a sign of which is apparent, and that is the stretching of the patient's legs.
If you see both legs even, and the patient can flex and extend the leg without difficulty, know that the limb has returned correctly.  Then join the thighs, apply the bandage, and bind tightly with a turban so that the hip does not move in any direction.
The patient should remain at rest for three or four days.  Then, loosen the bandages and dressing, and compare the legs.  If you find them equal in size, know that the fracture has set. Release the patient to walk.  If you see any looseness, [do not release].
Return and bandage it, tightening it as before. Leave it for three more days, and then loosen it.  The patient should walk slowly for several days until it strengthens, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-two.
On the treatment of a fractured knee.
The knee dislocates in three ways: inward, outward, and downward (i.e., backward).  It does not dislocate forward.  A sign of its dislocation is that you should instruct the patient to bring their leg close to their thigh.
If the leg does not adhere to the thigh, know that the knee is dislocated.  The method of reduction for all types of dislocation is that the patient should sit down and extend their legs if able.  A servant should sit behind the patient, holding the patient's waist and gently turning it backward.  Then, you should sit on the patient's thighs.
You should place your back against the patient's face, and place their leg between your legs.  Then, grasp the knee with both your hands, interlocking your fingers around the knee.  Next, firmly press the sides of the knee with your hands.  Another attendant should extend the patient's leg until the knee returns to its place.
A sign of its return is that the leg adheres to the thigh with no forced movement. Then bandage it, securing the leg to the thigh, and wrap them both with a bandage for three or four days.  Then remove it.  For a few days, only allow limited walking until strength returns.
If you cannot reduce it by the method described, then use forceful traction with the bandages previously described in the treatment of the hip, until it returns.
Chapter Thirty-three.
On the treatment of dislocated heels.
The heel may be slightly displaced or completely dislocated.  Dislocation can occur either inward or outward.  A sign of dislocation is that the heel will appear swollen and prominent in the direction of the displacement.
As for treating its slight displacement, it is easily reduced by gently pulling and aligning it until it returns.  However, if it is completely dislocated, the patient should sit, and a strong attendant should hold the patient firmly from behind, in the middle of their back.
Then, with your right hand, grasp the foot from above, and with your left hand, from below at the heel.  Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, then with your left, twice.  Then extend it with your left hand and push the front of the foot towards the leg with your right hand, without force.
Repeat this twice as described. Then, on the third time, push the front of the foot towards the leg while pulling at the heel.  If it returns in one or two attempts, and you see the foot is aligned, then stop. Otherwise, repeat the procedure, as it will return.
If it does not return using the method described, then lay the patient on their back on the ground, and firmly insert a tightly bound rod into the ground, placing it between their legs.  It should be wrapped with cloth to prevent harming the patient, and an attendant should hold the patient's thigh.
Then another attendant extends the leg, either with their hands or with a bandage tied around the leg.  Each attendant pulls in the opposite direction. The rod, positioned between the patient's thighs, is held to prevent the patient's body from moving downwards during the pulling.  Then, the physician aligns the joint with his hands.
Another attendant holds the healthy leg downwards. If the joint returns quickly, then take the bandage and splint and secure it with tight bandages. Tie the foot with a bandage downwards.  Care must be taken with the nerve located above the heel from behind.
So that the bandage is not too tight and causes pain. Then leave it for two or three days. If the bandage loosens, tighten it again, then release it on the third or fourth day.  The patient should refrain from walking for forty days.
If the patient attempts to walk before this time, there is a risk that the joint will dislocate and become unusable, and treatment will no longer be effective.  If a hot swelling appears, use the treatments previously described in other sections for swelling and inflammation until it disappears.
Chapter Thirty-Four.
On the treatment of fractured fingers of the foot.
The fractured parts should be aligned with a gentle pull, without force. This is not difficult, but easy.  If the fracture is in some of the phalanges of the foot, the patient should place their foot on a flat surface.
Or on a board, while standing like a walker.  Then place your foot on the protruding joints, and press down firmly with your foot until they return to alignment and no protrusion remains visible.
Then place a board under the sole of their foot, encompassing the entire foot with two ends.  Bind it firmly for three days.  Then unbind it and keep them from walking for many days until it strengthens and a return is unlikely, God willing.
Chapter Thirty-five.
On the types of fracture that occurs with a wound, or with a break, or with both.
When something like that occurs and you attempt treatment and reduction, it often results in death.
Therefore, one should not undertake such treatment unless they are skilled in the craft, experienced, gentle, compassionate, cautious, and not rash or reckless.  In the beginning, they should use medications that relieve only the hot inflammations and let the patient recover.
By God's will, except for what one hopes will be spared from harm with the slightness of the disease, and where some hope appears, then return it from the very beginning, before the hot inflammation occurs.
If the limb returns to the desired state, use the treatment that relieves the hot inflammation and treat the wound with suitable drying ointments. If the fracture involves a broken bone with detached fragments, then remove them. Follow in that regard what we have mentioned concerning simple illnesses in the preceding sections.
Strive diligently and purify yourself from entering into a path of uncertainty, as I have previously instructed and advised you. This will be more lasting for your reputation and safer for your presentation, God willing.
