Chapter twenty-two on the treatment of leukoderma.	CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO. On the treatment of hypopyon.	0.7386005
This ailment, which is called 'kamana', is a duration that gathers in the eye, resembling dripping water, but it is not water.	This disease which is called 'hypopyon' is a collection of pus in the eye which resembles cataract but is not so.	0.67601335
And the way to treat this is that you sit the patient upright on a chair, then you take his head with your hands from both sides and move it until you see the 'duration' move to the bottom of his eye, then it stabilizes and doesn't move, and the light is released, and the patient sees things as he used to see them.	The method of operating in this disease is to make the patient sit upright on a chair before you. Take his head on either side with your hands and shake it about till you can see the pus come down; then it will be fixed and not move; and the light will pass and the patient will see things as he was before.	0.8303168
And if it does not descend to the bottom, we know that it is water.	But if it does not come down, we know it is cataract.	0.7205457
If the descent of the 'duration' is not possible by what we mentioned, then sit the patient between your hands, then take a thin scalpel and make a small incision above the cornea at the junction of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the 'iklil' (limbus) until the substance comes out.  Once it comes out, instill in the eye hot water mixed with honey, or water in which fenugreek and honey have been boiled. Then treat with other treatments until he recovers.	But if the pus is not ready to be brought down by this method, then seat the patient in front of you; then take a fine scalpel and cut a little above the corneal tunic near the coronal junction of conjunctiva and cornea, till the pus comes out. When it comes out, instil warm water mixed with honey, or water boiled with fenugreek and honey. Then treat as usual till healed.	0.76085716
