Oh, my children, as you have completed this book, the last of medical science, by the completion of which its end is achieved, and through its explanations, expositions, and declarations, it seems to me that you have fully grasped this treatise, which is a part of the most important operations, namely, surgery.
For surgery, considered the most important operation in our region and time, is shrouded in great secrecy, as knowledge of it has declined; and there remain only a few small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which have led to much confusion and error regarding its principles and practice.
And it appears to me that you have revitalized the order of this treatise through a second method of exposition and declaration and abridgment; and so that the forms of cautery tools and other instruments for the work may be added as an explanation, and to prepare for it, which is a necessary cause.
The cause for which our skilled physician lacks mastery in this our time is because the art of medicine is complex, and he has not been trained in the science of anatomy, which reveals the youthfulness of the members, their forms, their conjunction and separation; the knowledge of bones, nerves, and ligaments, their names, and their extraction; the pulsation of the veins, the places of their emission.
And for this reason Hippocrates says that the name is fitting, for in practice it is small, but most importantly in the art of healing.
We have already discussed this at the beginning of this book; for those who are not knowledgeable about what we have said about anatomy, it is not to be wondered that they fall into errors that lead to the death of men, as you have seen many such individuals, some formed in this science and believing themselves experts through their experiences.
You see a foolish doctor who has incurred a serious infection in the thigh of a woman by cutting into her flesh and incising some of the thigh's arteries, allowing great pus to flow until the woman died from it.
And you see another doctor who quickly took a stone from a man who had passed it in his state, and the stone was large, and he brought it out and extracted that stone with a part of the bladder, so that the man died on the third day.
And you have already called for haste to extract it, and you see that because of the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, he will die.
And you see another doctor who was paid handsomely by a duke from our land for surgery, and he took on a black crusty wound that was severely infected in the patient's thigh; because of his ignorance, the doctor extracted the fracture, over the infection, using plasters and strips with strong stretching, and did not allow the infection to breathe.
And then free the patient according to their wishes, apply relaxation, rest, and bandages for some days, and order that the incision be closed; and so too, as soon as the wound in the foot has healed, prevent further harm.
And you will have called upon him, and he will free the bandage, and thus achieve peace and permanently alleviate their pains.
However, if the corruption is already confirmed in the member, then it cannot be restrained, and the corruption will continue to spread throughout the member until the patient perishes from the illness.
And see another doctor who perforates a cancerous abscess, and it becomes ulcerated after some days, until the fire of his malice intensifies in him under his lordship.
Which causes is because the sharp pain is purely from melancholic humor; then it does not cover that it will reach him entirely with a ferrule, but rather that it should be in the member where it suffers most and is most vulnerable.
And therefore, my sons, it is necessary for you that the operation be divided into two parts: one is an operation associated with health, and the other is a work that poses danger to the most vital dispositions.
And you have already encountered this throughout all parts of this book where operations are discussed that contain error and fear; therefore, it is necessary for you to take heed of these things and set them aside, so that people do not take advantage and shame you.
And therefore, take up your arms with diligence and the protection of God, and your patients with ease and firmness.
And use the best means by the grace of God to attain salvation and glorious success, set aside the terrible illnesses that are difficult to cure, and abandon your weapons of fear, so that your faith and name do not desert you; for more remains to your glory, both now in this world and later behind your sanctity.
Crack open some of their secret parts: Do not treat bad ailments with bad medicines, so that bad doctors are not blamed.
And you have already divided this book into three chapters.
Begin the division of the book, starting with the first section. The first chapter is ordered on the feet, in the forms of instruments and in the tools of cautery, and anything that is necessary for the operation.
Division of the second section. The second chapter deals with incisions and punctures, and the use of vents, plagues (possibly referring to pustules or sores), and the extraction of arrows and similar foreign bodies. It is entirely structured around the forms and uses of medical instruments.
The third chapter, on restoration and realignment, and the treatment of twists and similar conditions; a structured chapter on foot inner structures and the forms of instruments.
Understand what I have said about the quality of the fire of that cautery and the documents of it, and in what conditions cautery is prohibited.
Therefore, it is said that the discourse on the quality of cautery fire and the documents of it is long and prolix, subtle for knowledge, and secrets hidden; and much has been spoken about it by many wise men, and there are disagreements among them, and I will content myself with a brief part of their discourses, for fear of prolongation.
And therefore it is said that cautery will relieve every kind of pain universally, whether it be physical or spiritual, except for two conditions, which are pains caused by their own nature.
In the condition where pain is caused by a lack of matter (or dryness), some say that cautery is beneficial for it, while others claim the opposite, stating that cautery is not suitable for ailments caused by quality and dryness, as fire itself embodies quality and dryness, and it would be inappropriate to treat an ailment lacking moisture with heat and dryness.
And those who claim the opposite state that cautery is beneficial for any dry and painful condition in the human body, as when you compare the human body and its humidity to the nature of fire, you find the body dry.
And he says through the arguments of those who claim this, that he has personally experimented with it numerous times to discover.
However, it is not advisable for this to be handled by someone who has no experience in the practice of cautery and who is unfamiliar with the diversity of physical conditions in people, their causes, the circumstances under which they occur, or the passage of time regarding them.
In other conditions, there is no cause for fear, especially in cases of pain and swelling, as all doctors are agreed on these, and they do not disagree about the use of cautery to treat them.
And know, my children, that the secret of healing by cautery with fire and the goodness of it, lie in cautery as a medicinal flame; for fire is simple, whose action only reaches the member being cauterized, without affecting other members with its heat, except to a slight degree.
The action of the medicinal flame reaches those members from which it withdraws, and strongly causes pain in a member affected by a difficult-to-heal illness, aiding greatly in its healing.
Kindle the fire, due to its subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not cause harm, and it is already known to us from experience and from the long study of the art on the truth of the causes; for this reason, I excuse you from the length of my speech. And if it were not that this secret fire, which I hide in this brief pause, cannot be read at my free will, the quality of its operation in the body and its expulsion through which we eliminate illnesses, demonstrated by philosophical discourse, would be sharpened in your minds.
And know, my children, that the time of discord is when cauterization and bandaging should be performed, and it is best to do so in the springtime.
And you say that cauterization is convenient at all times, so that the damage caused by accidental time may be overcome by the youthfulness of what is removed through cauterization, and most especially when cauterization is for pains or necessary pains, severe and acute, which do not suffer delay, since it is feared those that come with malice, that it is better to minimize damage entering through time.
And so you must not fear in your hearts, o sons, for this condition is not esteemed by the common people or foolish doctors; it is that with such illness treated by cautery, it is not always completely cured, and they leave behind a consequence.
And the cause is not understood thus by those who care for it, for cautery is but a place of medicine that alters the composition and dries up moisture, which is the cause why pain comes.
Yet, they may use cautery superfluously over medicine because of the will to assert its validity and the virtue of its operation and the power of its lord.
And it is possible that their illness may return at some time in the future, according to the composition of the illness and the location of their malady, and the strength of it, and what is prepared within them from the addition of excesses and humors, and what is acquired by them through food and similar causes; but the illness in which cautery is administered is a subtle illness in a few members with slight excesses and humidities, so with a tooth cautery for pain and similar to that, it is possible that that pain may not return in them, but this is done in small doses.
And it is a common saying that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, and it is a true saying, not to those who understand it, for they believe that there is no cure that profits from medicine or any other cause by cautery.
And the reason is to the contrary; and the understanding that cautery is the last remedy of medicine is not but when one administers the methods of healing in certain ailments, and those medicines confer no benefit, and then at the end of the cause, one applies cautery, and profits from it. And from this it follows that cautery is the last remedy of medicine, not according to the understanding of the common people and too many foolish doctors.
And they said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this but for the equality of gold and the subtlety of its substance.
And they say that the place of cautery does not burn unless it is absolutely true, for you have already seen and experienced that it only burns in certain bodies, and cauterizing with fire from gold is good and better than what they said; however, when you make a cautery with fire, it is not declared to you, because the gold is consumed according to the quantity you want due to the heat of the fire, and if you place it over the fire, some sheets will fall into the fire for the artisan to catch due to the occupation.
And for this, cauterizing with iron must be done more lightly and precisely to ensure the correctness of the operation.
You have already organized this chapter on cauterization according to chapters, and you have organized those from the beginning within the feet, so now I am asking him what he wants from it.
The first chapter.
This cautery confers warmth and heat to the affected area, which is a remedy for two causes: it is effective against sudden cold and numerous rheumatic fluxes, called coryza, from the head to the parts of the nose and ears, frequent sleep, toothache and throat pain, and generally all ailments that arise from coldness, as well as paralyses, soddenness and apoplexy, and similar conditions in those diseases.
The method of this cautery is as follows: first, you must command the disease to be evacuated using a laxative medicine, for three or four nights, depending on the severity of the illness, the age of the patient, and their usual condition.
And then command them to shave their head, and place that sharp object between your legs on a heated bench, and place your hands on the affected foot.
And then place your palm's pressure on the bridge of their nose between their eyes. However, if the pain in the middle of the foot has been alleviated, mark that spot with a try, and then heat the olive cautery whose shape is as follows:
And then place that over the unmarked spot with pressure, in a descending manner, so that your hand is constrained little by little, and you lift it up.
Then gently lift your hand and examine the spot, and if you see that some bone is exposed along with any quantity of fat, raise your hand again, and if it doesn't return to that position, or if it's chilled, as long as you can see the bone, do as I have told you.
And then take a little salt, dissolve it over the spot, and leave it for three days.
And then place your hand over the burnt area at the border, leaving that one inside to destroy the wall of fire. And then treat the area with the four-part medicine until it is healed.
And it is said that when the Roman plague opens, the arm gets better and more youthful, so it is better and more restorative.
They also say that the bone should be cauterized within the bone, and the cautery should be held until some part of the specific nature of the bone is hardened.
And then remove what is adjusted to the bone, and then cure it.
And they say others that with the cautery you should reach the rear, while always strengthening the bone inward, until the bone hardens, and this is the form of creating small incisions: And they believe that from that place, vapors from the head escape.
And if the wound remains open for a long time, it should be treated until it is healed and strengthened.
I do not recommend these two types of cautery to everyone, but only in certain cases out of fear; and that one, for me, is better for health when it is appropriate, because the head has been deprived of continuity through solution as we have witnessed in other members, and especially when the nature of the disease is feverish.
And the specific type of cautery that comes first is more safe and better for me; and from this and through this work to health.
Second chapter.
On cautery of the head.
When chronic and prolonged pain occurs throughout the head and this is a result of illness, it is customary to use various remedies such as poultices, plasters, extracts, ointments, hot compresses, cold applications, and cataplasms, especially if a cautery has been previously applied that does not heal or benefit from any of those causes. Consider that if the nature of the malady is strong, and there is no significant external injury, then use another cautery instead of this one, a little bit. And then cauterize that part of the patient's head where the hair is thin using an inner cautery, as long as the skin is intact. Cut the skin and expose the amount of bone that has been affected, and cauterize it with a cautery at the rear part of the head in the area known as the 'socket', which is the place where the windpipe is stopped. Then hold your hand over it and do not expose the bone, because this illness causes great pain that is different from the pain of all other cauteries on the head.
And you should apply this cautery in its proper place, for this cautery which is used to burn the horns of the head and the occiput is a more subtle cautery than that which is used to cauterize the middle part of the head; this is its form.
It appears that your message might have been cut off or there was a typo. "Capitol ters" does not form a complete or recognizable term in any language I'm familiar with, including those similar to Latin, Italian, Spanish, or French. Could you please provide more context or check the spelling? I'd be happy to help translate or interpret if given more details.
Regarding the treatment of non-ancient migraines.
When a severe headache occurs at the temple or there is pain within the skull, it is appropriate to use medications that clear the head, and also administer other treatments as mentioned regarding the deviations of illnesses; but if this does not prove effective, cauterization on the affected area should be performed in two ways: either with acute medicinal fire or with iron.
One may use cauterizing medicines or burning remedies such that you take a hot iron, and scorch it and cut off the ends of them from both heads. And then you cut the place of pain in the temple with a lance, until it is felt in the right place and left hidden.
And then you tighten it with a bandage for a descent constriction and leave it for three hours; and afterwards you remove the dressing, and leave the pain for two or three days, and place a cold compress on the affected area until the pain goes away.
And then apply that as a poultice until it heals.
And if you wish, do this with certain burning medicines which I have written about in the two tracts on burning medicines.
Prepare the cautery iron according to this manner: ignite the cautery whose shape is as follows:
It is called a clave (or key) because its head has the shape of a claw with some curvature, and in the middle part there is a small prominence.
Then apply pressure on the painful area, holding your hand—to prevent the wound from becoming infected—and slowly turn the iron at a controlled speed.
And if the amount of blood stuck due to the nature of the wound is such that it equals or exceeds the capacity of the artery, raise your hand so that the artery is not affected, preventing the flow of pus.
Then cover it with salt water and place a bandage over it, leaving it for three days. Apply plenty of ointment until it heals.
And if you see, cauterize the end of the knife with a cautery according to cauteries, and be careful not to incise an artery in this fresh wound improperly.
Capital quarter.
On the cauterization of old wounds.
When you treat an old wound as we have discussed in the previous treatment and you do not benefit from it, and the pain returns due to a malady that does not allow access to what we said about the first cautery with medicine or fire, then know that you must ignite the cuticular cautery until it is albified (whitened), indicating its effectiveness on the area of pain along the length of the line where the greatest intensity occurs. Rest your hand for a moment and strengthen it as you make an incision in the artery and penetrate into the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful about the continuation of the jaw, which is damaged and affects chewing, and that the wound is not infected and the nerves affected by it are not damaged, and that there is no muscle spasm.
And if it is about the care and caution of blood flow from an arterial injury that is acute, as in the acute phase of it there is fear, especially for those who ignore what they are doing and lack study and patience; and let the operation on them begin at a later stage.
And come to the remembrance of the regulation of blood flow in cases of arterial accidents according to their method, in their place within this book.
And if you see that this illness does not allow for these cautery treatments and the patient's condition is tolerable, perform a cautery on the middle part of the head as we have mentioned, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, apply the cautery as we have mentioned in the chapter on the tightening of archery arrows, for this cautery with two blades is the better and more effective application.
It appears that the text is structured as if it were organized into chapters or sections, with each line referencing a previous discussion or topic. Without additional context or surrounding text, it's challenging to provide an accurate translation of "Capitol v." However, given the context of medical treatise, it could refer to:
On the treatment of ear pain.
When there is pain in the ear caused by cold and it is treated with purgative remedies and other cures as mentioned in the previous section, and the pain persists, then apply heat with a cautery. This is known as a "puncta," and this is its form:
Then apply the cautery close to the fire, and it should be moved around the entire ear, or in a circular motion if the pain is in any particular part. Apply the cautery to the affected area of the ear little by little, until you have treated the entire place without causing further harm.
And if the cautery with pointed points is done on the entire ear and it becomes sore, then take care of the affected areas until they heal.
**Capital VI.**
**On the cauterization of tortuous (or twisted) parts.**
A tortuous part that is cured and treated with cauterization is due to the species (or conditions) that arise from phlegm, as we have discussed in the divisions of ailments.
Avoiding cauterization of the species that should be treated with drying or spasm of the nerve.
When treating that species of tortuousness with jerks and contractions and gargling, and you do not confirm your cure, then know that you cauterize the ailment in three places: first, you burn the auricle, second, you make a small cut below their jaw, and third, you treat the junction of two lips.
And hold the hot cautery against the opposite side of the injured part, for the softening effect is seen only in the area that appears healed.
And the method of cauterization is that you apply a hot cautery to the base of the auricle, slightly above the ear canal, and on the temporal bone, its length corresponding to the length of the finger, and hold your hand as a cautery until the quantity of the substance of the skin is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is especially the shape of a knife, whose form is presented flatly. However, it may be even more subtle, as you can see with your eyes, and take care to avoid excessive roughness on its surface.
And then take care of the area that is exposed during the procedure until it is healed.
Chapter .VII.
On the cauterization of ancient apoplexy.
When apoplexy is ancient and its cure does not respond to the remedies we have mentioned and the patient does not have a fever, then cauterize it with four cauteries: above all the corners of their head; and also cauterize the middle part of the head, as we have said; and cauterize the base of the skull. And the manner of the cautery is done according to what has been mentioned above.
And it is cauterized over the mouth of the stomach; and this is more delayed; and then it is carefully cared for as you have processed.
Chapter .VIII.
Of the cauterization of oblivion made by flame.
You should give the patient hot drinks and pills in the beginning, the servant will then clarify them.
Then remove the entire head of the patient and place it on the couch, applying the plaster as described in the treatise on plasters.
And repeat this several times, as it is the manner of cauterization. And do this according to the order of those methods I have already mentioned.
And thus, if for those remedies is good for him; otherwise, make him three cauterizations in the last part of his head, descending from the higher part of the head to the lower part of the neck. And between each cautery, hold the thickness of the finger, and then carefully prepare the cautery for what follows.
If you have additional help and the patient can tolerate it, then make the cautery in the middle position; and if you need even more assistance, then cauterize both on either side of the spine.
Carefully prepare the inside so that it heals; and make the cauteries olive-shaped according to the form previously given.
Chapter IX.
On cauterization and mollification of the whole body.
Understand that you must proceed in the mollification of the head according to what we have said; then gently remove the patient's head covering, and cauterize it at the middle position on the head with an olive-shaped cautery, and cauterize all around the spine of the head, and cauterize over the last joint of the head, and make three cauteries over the cervical spinal bones.
And if it is necessary in the case of softening the body from too much effort and the pain is tolerable but intense, then apply four cauteries on the spinal column of the back, later apply a cautery inside until the severe pain of the patient is alleviated, and raise your hand. Then take care that it heals properly, and this cautery should be olive oil.
Chapter X.
On the treatment of epilepsy.
The epileptic is not cauterized, but if the epilepsy is due to phlegm.
And thus, it is necessary to purify the patient's brain at the beginning when they have had fever and other treatments as mentioned in the previous division, when the disease is severe and the patient can tolerate no more medication.
And if it is a child who does not endure medicines, then administer warm and chewing foods to them, for several days, to improve their appetite.
Then shave the patient's head, and apply a cautery to that area with a hot iron at the middle of the head as per the previous method, and apply another cautery on the back of the head, and over each of the shaved parts of the head. And if the patient is strong and tolerant, then apply cauteries as mentioned above, having a paralytic and relaxing effect on the body over the spinal columns of the neck and the back.
And apply the olive cautery as mentioned above.
If the patient is a child, then apply subtle cauteries according to this method.
Chapter .xi.
**On the Cauterization of Melancholy**
When the causes of melancholy are corrupt corrupted humors and excessive fluid, then cauterize those parts with the cauterizes that we have mentioned in their having paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholy is excessive fluid declining into melancholy, and the body of the patient is humid, then he should drink something that purifies his mind according to what has preceded in the division.
Then shave the head of the patient, then make a decent cut from the side on the circle, and then rest it in the middle part of the head.
And the patient should feel calm, and be held from every side.
And apply the liniment; it is now more worthy of being used before sheep. And heat that above the fire by a measured temperature, which causes it to suffer when placed in water. Then take that in the middle of the patient's head in the circle and clean it until it is cooled.
And do this to the patient once a week for an entire week, following his good diet until he is healed; or, if you prefer, make small points with a cautery according to what is most convenient for him, holding your hand over it as ordered: this is a type of cautery that moistens the brain equally.
Then place that cloth soaked in vinegar or grape juice around the edge.
Chapter XII
Regarding the draining of water from the wound.
When the onset of water in the wound is declared by the signs that I have mentioned in the previous section, then it begins and provides to the patient something that purifies his head, and pay attention to all humidity.
And do that soaking in a bath with certain herbs for several days.
And then command the patient to shave his head, and cauterize that spot with a hot iron in the middle of the head; and cauterize two spots with two irons on both temples if the onset of water is in two wounds, or in one side if the onset is in one wound.
Cut with hot irons all the veins and arteries that are left in the chains, and the cauterizations should be on that length at the width of the temples.
And be careful of bleeding when cauterizing; and if you see any bleeding from it, do not stop the process with any medicine, as much as you can.
And now, here is the translation of the sentence: "And you come to possess knowledge derived from animal bones and the removal of those, as well as the care of pus flows.
And sometimes, two bones are cauterized at the joints using two pointed cauterizers, thereby producing a certain effect.
**Chapter XIII**
On the cauterization of ancient tears.
When the tears of the eyes are ancient and repeatedly present in the veins and arteries at the site of manifestation on the head outside, and it is observed that this causes excessive weakness of the connective tissues, then cauterize that place with a cautery as described in the beginning chapter about warming the eyes with hot water, and cauterize the middle part of the head, and two cauterizes at the joints between two bones in the temples, and two cauterizes at the joints between two bones below the eyes. And if you require additional treatment, cauterize that part of the leg from the thigh to the top of the foot with a small cautery.
**Chapter XIII**
**On the Cauterization of Nose Abscesses**
When treating the condition we discussed in the previous section and your medication is not effective, prepare a mixture for the patient to drink for three nights; then shave their head and cauterize the affected area with a hot iron. And cauterize that area with a clamp, using two cauteries on both sides of the eyebrows, leaving just a small amount of hair.
And be careful not to burn that area.
And this is the form of the cautery clamp.
**Chapter XV.**
On the use of cautery for softening the eyelids of the eyes.
When the eyelid of the eye is softened by illness or moisture, apply a cautery to that eyelid with this lunar cautery; and this is the form of it:
And if you, apply this cautery over the two eyebrows with a small amount of cautery at each end, and they will be elongated from the temporals. And the length of each cautery should be according to the quantity of the eyebrow.
And do not press too hard with the cautery, but according to how much the third part of the eyelid is adhered.
**Chapter XVI**
On the cautery of the eyelid, when the hairs turn into parts within and press on the eye.
When the hairs of the eyelid turn into parts within and press on the eye, cautery is performed in two manners: either by making incisions or by using a medicinal fire.
If you use fire for cautery, instruct the patient to comb their hairs in the opposite direction of how they normally grow, so that they are prolonged and intertwined; and if you must apply it again, tighten the eye of the eyelid with a bandage so that the hairs do not become matted.
Therefore, when they are clean and washed, place the patient's head on the pillow, and then examine the socket of their eye with your hand, signaling according to the shape of a dead leaf, and indicating the beginning of the signal near the hairs.
And then apply a cold compress or a moist cloth over the eye.
And then apply the heat with the instrument shaped like this.
And then cauterize along the marked figure, slowly and in several passes, until the surface of the wound is completely sealed, just as if it were with a leaf of myrtle, clearly visible.
The sign of healing of the eye is that you see the eyelid of the eye already contracted and the hairs raised at the site of the eye's puncture.
And so raise your hand and place it there for three days, then apply a hot compress to the affected area until the swelling subsides. And then apply that remedy until it is cured.
If it returns through the skin for any reason, and the eyelid becomes softened, then do the cautery on that part again as you had done originally.
If the hairs are in the eyelid, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural position and healed, so that the hairs do not remain odorous.
But the cautery with burning medicines is what you command the patient to do with the hairs until they are prolonged and healed, and then a piece of cloth shaped like a fir leaf should be made from it.
And then take some known soap and a living flame, or what is suitable for this purpose, and mix those causes well, making it into a paste so that it does not freeze; and spread it from there onto the cloth formed like a myrtle leaf, and place it on one or both wounds; and leave the fragrant edge soaked in white wax, and keep the patient's head in a cool place.
And then stop talking about the medicine and apply a small amount, not too much, so that the patient feels the bite of the medicine, for its bite is like fire.
And so, as it continues to feel the medicine's bite, stop the treatment and apply it again according to its original location; then, when the biting ceases, clean the wound with water; and consider whether the eyelid has been lifted as if washed by fire or incision, for that is the desired state. And if it does not return to the application of the medicine at the site where it was first applied without disfigurations, then your operation will be in vain and the wound will contract.
And then apply pressure to the area until the pain of the adhesion is eradicated, and take care with a definite ointment or other until it heals.
And it is necessary for you, in your operation, to maintain careful vigilance that no part of the medicine falls away, and if after several days the eyelid becomes softened due to some cause from the hair in the socket, then repeat your medicine on that place where the eyelid is softened, and indeed just as you did at the beginning, and surround it until it is healed.
And this is the way of making an eye-drop.
And you know that the eyes of men differ in size and shape, and therefore your treatment must be adjusted accordingly.
And let not the method of treatment be hidden from him who studies this art.
Chapter .xvii.
On the cauterization of a fistula in the lacrimal duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula with the method we have described for the division of illnesses and your treatment does not work, be aware that when cauterizing it in this way: command the patient to rest their head on their side, and hold their head with some minister between their thighs in such a manner that it is neither damaged nor agitated by their own head.
Then apply some warm compress or a paste of honey and grain meal to the eye of the patient.
And shape the cautery as follows:
which should be concave, shaped like a cane or a quill, from one end where the cautery is made.
And if you look, they penetrate into the other extremity. And if you wish to get out, do so with caution.
Yet he who is calm is better for the task at hand.
And press the fistula if it is open, and try to clean and dry that area. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the pus from that area.
Then place over it a hot cautery, and with your hand protect the area from the heat of the cautery at the root of the nose, so that your hand or the patient's pain is not aggravated, and apply the cautery to the gray parts of the nose and burn that.
And therefore, if at the beginning of applying the cautery it penetrates into the bone, that is good; otherwise, repeat the cautery once or twice, as necessary, and leave it in place for three days, then apply a compress with a drying ointment until it heals.
If after passing ten days it is not healed, then return to using the sharp corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and clean, as you have been taught in your chapter.
And there is another way of applying the cautery for a fistula: they first enter the place of the fistula and make it, then apply pressure to that small fissure from which it arises: and pour into it the amount of melted lead; hold your hand with good restraint so as not to harm the patient by reason that the melted lead does not reach the wound; cover what you have applied over the wound of the illness with white cloth or water, so that the lead adheres to the place of the fistula and heals it in a wonderful manner.
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said about cautery and treatment, it is good; otherwise, it will be necessary to administer medicine from the nose and return the fistula to its place in the nose as it should be.
**Chapter XVIII**
**On the Cauterization of the Hernia (Fistula)**
You may encounter various accidents that cause fistulas in the lips, especially in children's lips.
Therefore, if you treat those fistulas as we have said in the previous sections and do not take advantage of your treatment, then use a heated knife to make a small incision according to this form that I will show:
and the cavity of it according to the thinness of the knife.
Place your hand carefully over those cracks so that the cautery reaches the depth of the cracks.
And then carefully remove that cold compress until the area is healed.
**Chapter XIX**
**On the Cauterization of Fistulas in the Mouth**
When in the case of uvula or palate fistulas, or those between the teeth, a breakdown occurs and an opening forms, and the proper treatment is not applied, you must ignite a cautery according to the extent of the fistula. Insert the burning instrument into the opening of the fistula, and with your hand, guide it until the hot tip reaches the depth of the wound; do this once or twice. Then apply the cold compress as previously described for healing.
And thus, if the wound is clean and healed, it is good; otherwise, it becomes necessary to expose the location and remove the corrupted bone as will be discussed in its chapter.
**Capitol XX:**
On the cauterization of teeth and the softening of arteries.
When the arteries are softened by moisture and the teeth are decayed, and these conditions do not improve with medication, then place the patient's chin on their thigh, and shape the cautery so that when you place the flame over the tooth, it enters slightly, allowing the patient to feel the heat of the fire at the root of the tooth, which has been reached.
And then lift your hand, and repeat the application of the cautery several times as desired.
Then make the patient gargle with salt water and hold it for an hour, after which stop it, because the decayed tooth is secured, the softened gums are tightened, and the corrupted moisture is dried out.
Chapter .xxi.
On the treatment of tooth pain.
When tooth pain is due to cold, or there is a sore or abscess, and the treatment with medicine does not help, then cauterize it in two ways: either with cow dung cautery or with fire cautery.
Cautery with cow dung is to take cow dung and smash it into powder, then wrap the mixture over the base of the tooth with a cloth, immerse it in hot water, and place that on the aching tooth until it becomes numb.
And repeat this several times until the heat from the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you see, dip a cloth or linen in the wound on that side, place it over the aching tooth, and place the heated iron on it until the iron reaches the depth of the tooth's cavity.
However, the use of fire for cauterization is to address the wound of iron or flame, and it should not be too harsh on the patient's body, nor should the intensity of the fire reach the mouth of the wound.
Then shape the cautery as needed, place it over the tooth, and rest your hand on it until the cautery cools down; do this several times because the pain may return either that day or the next.
And ensure that the patient opens their mouth wide and holds the cautery for about an hour, then spit it out; this is the shape of the cautery.
And apply the cautery as you have seen fit according to what is possible for you.
And this is the shape of the cannula:
Chapter XXII.
On the cauterization of extrophules.
When extrophules are filled with flecma and bad humors that are resistant to digestion due to medicines, and you wish to drain them slightly, apply the cautery according to their shape, having two wide extremities so that the smoke of the cautery reaches the other end. You should place the burning cautery on one spot, then another if further drainage is needed, until it reaches the point of the extrophule.
And if the extrophule is small, apply the cautery according to its size, then leave it for three days and place a compress over it, close to the edge, until it has healed completely from what the fire has burned.
And then apply that ointment and bandages until it heals.
**Chapter XXIII**
On the cauterization of veins and the constriction of arteries.
When humidity appears on the pleura of the lung, especially when it is chilled by a gathering of fluid, then one must evacuate that ill-health at once with laxative medicines, and apply cautery to that place where the pleura is affected.
And be careful not to harm the pleura with the cautery or to inflame the patient's chest too much.
And cauterize that or another cautery on the joint of the neck at the last vertebra of the patient. The cautery of it is nailed in the manner previously described.
And then take care of that as described above until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
On cauterization for lung disease and cough.
When cough and lung disease are caused by humidity, and the patient has no fever or phlegm, and it is an old illness, then cauterize as follows: make two points with cautery on the furcula at places where the lungs tremble and rise; and another point in the middle part of the foot between two mammary glands; and both cauteries are nailed as described above.
And if you wish, your cauterization with pointed instruments should be the cautery called a point, whose shape precedes in the puncturing of the pain of ears.
And there should be points within these; and then carefully tend to that as it is mentioned before for its cure.
And already the cautery has three prongs for cauterization to that extent: at one time, you can make three cauteries according to this form:
Chapter 25.
On cauterization of the throat, which is the chief duty of the assistant.
When the head of the assistant is dislocated due to slippery humidity and it does not stick in its return time, you should reduce its dislocation until it returns to normal, and then place the patient on their back or side; and raise the knee that was initially affected, inside the fold of the thigh towards the left, if the joint is dislocated inward.
And then apply the cautery, which has two tips; this is its form:
And then apply the cautery to the vein while it penetrates into another part; and the figure of the cauterization will appear when using a cautery with four tips.
And in some cases, it is adjusted according to this rule and for these cauterizations. VIII.
And then place the entire cautery on the affected part, and make the patient lie in tranquility, and do not move the limb for any duration until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and it persists, then cauterization is done on the muscle using a hot cautery or pointed cold cautery, as the joint is stabilized, the humidity is released, and the pain is healed.
Chapter .xxvi.
About the cauterization of the stomach.
When stomach pain occurs with humidity within that extents from its structure and multiplies the space, and if you continue with treatment methods without considering, then know that the illness will rest on his back, spreading to his limbs and organs, and cauterize those areas with three cautery marks: one leaving a mark on the foot about the size of a finger, and two others on each side of the cautery, forming a triangular figure; extend between those not properly aligned, which will cause putrefaction.
And if the depth of the cautery is equal to two-thirds of the thickness of the skin.
And the shape of the cautery should be according to this form. And if you wish, cauterize with a larger cautery in the middle area of the stomach, also in the form shown; and this should be a circular cautery as well, according to the form depicted.
And the stomach should be cauterized by puncturing it in such a way that this cautery does not frighten the patient: and you apply the cautery to the stomach according to the amount you wish to remove, and then cauterize those points; and then tend to the cure that was previously indicated until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
On the cauterization of the varicose vein.
When pain in the vein ends due to cold, or moisture, or excessive wind, and it deviates from its normal course by overflowing, the disease is treated as we have said, not with compression, but by raising the affected part over the patient's head, and applying three cauterizations of this form and quantity to the vein below the hipbone, which promotes the decubitus position in men.
And the space between each cautery should be according to their thickness, and the cauteries should be according to the length of the body on the right side.
And do not be afraid of the pointed cauteries.
And if the amount of moisture absorbed by the cloth is equal to half the specific type of the wound, and it is not too tight; and if the patient's illness is concentrated on their feet; or if not, they should sit down, who has already extended their limbs and raised their arms.
And with your skill and caution in the art, you can cauterize these cauteries with a cutting cautery.
And be careful not to overly burn in the cauterization, and focus the sight of all the doctors so that the whole body is cauterized and enters the intestines, for here the cautery is subtle; and know this.
Chapter 28.
On the incision of an abscess in the leg with cautery.
When an abscess forms in the leg and you wish to know if it is within the flesh or on the outer tunic of the leg, if it is within the flesh, the disease takes on great gravity and the pain becomes acute.
And if it is on the outer tunic of the leg, the pain is acute and often exhausts the doctors in treating it.
Therefore, turn the patient over so that their back is facing you; then identify the location of the hernia; and apply the pointed cautery that resembles a rag, whose shape was previously described on the previous page. And cauterize with those cauteries until all the wound is closed, so that it reaches the deep tissue, and yet does not cause further damage.
And likewise, take care of that one for the healing of the other hernias until they are all cured.
And it should be known that this form of cautery should only be used with the one described in the study of medicine, and of all those mentioned, which have proven to cause harm; however, on some occasions, it can be daringly applied to this operation, but we must follow the rules laid down here, and it is better.
Chapter 29.
On the cauterization of pleurisy.
They say that the ancient cauterization of pleurisy, according to this method, is done by taking a long, thin piece of steel from an old blade and making a point on one end, of appropriate thickness.
Then immerse those in oil and heat them over the fire, and cauterize with a hot iron at the site between the continuation of the furcula and the collarbone; place two small cauterizers below, slightly declining from the part where the beard is, and two cauterizers declining between the fifth rib and the breastbone, slightly declining towards the back parts; another cautery in the middle part of the foot; and another over the stomach, and three cauterizers at the back parts; and one cautery at the site between the two shoulders, and two cauterizers on each side of the foot, leaving the cautery between the two shoulders.
And do not cover your hand with the cautery, but hold it over the affected area in action.
And they also speak of other ancient practices where certain men use iron cauteries in the form of a ray and ignite it to burn that area, placing it in the space between the ribs, so as to reach that condition and create a healthy opening, as we have said regarding the hernia of the foot.
One should not fear using cautery in this perforation, as it often happens in the fistulous location where healing does not occur.

# **On Cauterization**
When treating the malady of the foot with what we have mentioned about treatment in division and you do not apply your care, use cautery on it according to three methods, all of which are correct; one is that you make three or four incisions along the length of the foot according to the shape of the cauterization patterns on the leg.
And between each cautery, the thickness of a finger or a bit less, and the manner of the cautery is the same manner we mentioned in the cauterization patterns on the leg completely.
And do not apply your hand with the cautery; the malady is in its worst state on both feet.
There is another way to cauterize, which is that you ignite the cautery having two points, which causes us to speak in the chapter about the dislocation of the muscle, and lifts the chain which is on the right side of the foot where the pain lies on the left side.
And let your elevation, by which you raise the spine according to the length of the body, be such that cauterizations are made according to the extent of the affected area.
Then carefully insert two wooden splints, heated with fire, into the space where the spine penetrates from the other side.
Then remove the cauterizations; and thus, four cauterizations are made.
And if you see, cauterize with a cautery having three wooden splints.
Then carefully remove the cauterizations after they have stopped bleeding, as it is more effective than other treatments in the healing process.
Chapter XXXI.
On cauterization of hydrops.
Cauterization should not be applied to hydrops but directly to the affected area.
When treating hydrops, if the methods mentioned in the previous division do not help, you should apply four cauterizations around the affected area, and one cautery on the stomach, another on the thigh, another on the groin, two cauterizations between the spinal bones, a cautery on the right side of the foot, and another cautery on the stomach. And the depth of the cauterization should be tailored to the severity of the condition.
And apply the cautery gently, so as not to cause prolonged pain.
And do not evacuate the hernia from treatment until the cautery is applied over it so that two intentions are added to it, and it will be celebrated with aid of healing.
The form of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be according to the shape of that one which is used for the chest, and it is that which is called an olive in accordance with its previous form.
Chapter XXXII.
On cauterization of the feet and other parts.
When the feet are immersed in cold water and become filled with water, cauterize the feet on the top of the foot between the big toe and the little finger, and do not touch that spot; then lift your hand with the cautery and do not twist it, and lift your hand again, and do not return to that place until all the cold water has drained.
It is the cautery in this form: Then make two cuts on both thighs and make a hot cautery at the end of each cutting tool. And the cautery should be according to the length of the thigh: one should leave it on the outside and the other at the middle of the thigh; and over each thigh, make two cauteries.
And leave the wound open for a long time so that no water remains in it.
Then take care of those causes that we have mentioned.
Chapter .xxxiii. (Note: "xxxiii" indicates the chapter number, and there is no text following it in your prompt, so I cannot provide a translation without further context.)
Regarding the cauterization of abdominal parts.
When abdominal pain is due to heat and humidity, it dissolves the valves, which are the digestive and retentive virtues located in the stomach and intestines, and this is treated by various methods of cure, sometimes suffering from malignant heats, exposing them through cauterization; then cauterize with a large cautery on their stomach as previously mentioned in the cauterization of the stomach, with circular cauteries and four cauteries around the subtle embrocation, with a fine nail cautery; or with cauteries over a large alcatin on alozis, or with two cauteries.
And if the excessive humidity and the illness endure, then cauterize over the penis and intestines, strongly applying two cauteries near the stomach and around the groins, for this is a perfect cure for the young condition from which one does not stray.
Chapter XXXIV.
On the Cauterization of Old Hemorrhoids.
When it is in the nature of old hemorrhoids or a thick humor or corrupted moisture, and they are cured by what we have said in the division, but the natural cure does not follow, cauterize with three cauteries on the pus left between the spinal bones, small and triangular, and with a cautery on the navel below two times.
And if you observe that the stomach of the patient is chilled and their food is not digested, and their face appears pale, cauterize over the stomach with a large cautery as previously mentioned; also apply a cautery to the vein, and another cautery to the patient's chest with a cautery claw, leave the cauteries open for some time, and then treat them until they are healed.
Chapter XXXV.
Regarding cauterization, remove the affected parts.
When you make an incision, you use the cautery that resembles a ray. Then insert that flame into the incision and complete the procedure so that the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows.
And do this once or twice, for if the ulcers are too numerous, cauterize each one of them as we have described, and then apply ointment to those areas until they heal.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on something, it is better to do so more gently.
Chapter .xxxvi. (Note: "xxxvi" likely refers to the Roman numeral for 36)
On the cauterization of fistulas that occur naturally in the patient's limbs.
When nature does not oppose the work that we have just described in its place, and the patient is afraid of it, then medicine should be applied with cautery.
Therefore, when a fistula is present in nature, and it is old, it corrupts cleanliness and humidity, so the most worthy thing to do is to try to heal it gently, and then carefully consider the amount of pressure applied according to the depth of the fistula with the finger as just mentioned.
Then apply the cautery that resembles a ray. And place that ignited cautery on this fistula, according to the amount in which it intercepts the attempt.
And repeat that cautery until these corrupted bodies are burned once or twice or three times, according to the amount of your need.
And be careful of nerve and vein combustion; if a fistula goes to the body of the bladder or to the body of the hernia, then pay attention to all those places; and do not intervene unless the fistula is in fleshy locations and you think it will not penetrate.
And then take care of the area until it heals.
And if the area is sealed and all foreign matters are removed from it, and they remain in that state for a long time, then know that it is completely cured.
And if the foreign matters are not from his body, then know that it is penetrating or corrupting his organs, and falls victim to those causes of which there will be remembrance in its place.
Chapter .xxxvii. (Note: The number xxxvii indicates the chapter number, not a translation.)
On the cauterization of ulcers.
When ulcers cause pain due to cold or excessive wind, and the patient's condition worsens, you should cauterize them by applying a hot iron to each ulcer, especially focusing on those that require memory relief.
And for the first cauterization, we should make a small incision, so that three lines of cautery will result, and thus they will heal more quickly.
Chapter .xxxviii.
On the cauterization of the bladder.
When the bladder becomes debilitated and soft due to friction and humidity such that it does not retain urine, you should cauterize it at the pus-secreting point above the bladder, starting with the hairline of the penis, and cauterize with an iron on the right side, and another on the left side of it.
And the length of each cautery should be according to the depth of the pain; cauterize with a single cautery at the lower part of the back, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And the cautery should be made according to how it is needed.
**Chapter .XXXIX.**
**On the Cauterization of the Eye.**
When inflammation and moisture occur in the eye, which prevents impregnation, corrupts the menstruation, delays conception, and causes pain during sexual intercourse, then know that the place should be cauterized with three cauteries around the navel, as we have said regarding the cauterization of the bladder; or with two cauteries, and they should be well-made.
Chapter .XL.
On the cauterization of dislocated ankle bones.
When moist mucous membranes are infiltrated at the joint of the ankle, and they cause the displacement of its parts, and a sign of it is that the affected area is prolonged over the other when compared between them. And the place of the dislocation is squeezed in it, causing pain.
Then you should cauterize the patient over the dislocated ankle joint with a circular cautery, since you will have tried to loosen the joint circle around it, and thus the joint falls back into its proper place in the circle.
And the cautery mentioned above has its form in the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three large olive cauteries.
And make the cautery according to the amount of inflammation in all the veins; and be careful with that which is healed.
Chapter XLII
On the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain appears in the area of the ankle, caused by cold and moisture, the illness is treated with the method we have mentioned and should not be ignored, as it is an ancient practice to remove the illness from the body using thick humors or foul pills or artificial ones similar to them; and then cauterize that area.
And the method of the cautery on that area follows two ways: either with cauteries using burning medicines or with fire.
Turn according to two knowledgeable methods, of which one is to cauterize that over the opening of the anus with three triangular cautery instruments in this manner; and do it with good depth. And the space between each cautery should be according to the thickness of the said part, and if the cautery is olive-sized or large.
In some cases, the cautery can be placed on the middle part over the anus' opening so that there are four cauterizations.
And if you wish, cauterize the circle from which the shape is taken in the cauterization of the anus' dislocation, one that is circular and burns away all the moisture.
And this is the method of cauterization in which pain is adhering to the anus and not extended into the thigh.
If it is extended within the space, then cauterize that place with two cauteries over the thigh at the point where you direct the pain; and make a cautery on the shin four times, slightly on the outer side.
And if the cautery is cuttle, then the depth of the cautery should be according to the intensity of the pain.
And if the pain shifts to the point where it is intense in both feet, then cauterize that place with a cautery at three, four, or more points as needed.
And if the patient experiences intense pain when lying on their back with the thigh affected, then cauterize that place with a cuttle cautery.
And be careful in all cauterizations so that you do not harm nerves or cause great pain, and thereby aggravate the patient's condition or constrict them.
And you have already seen one of those which will be cauterized over the bone and finished in the cauterization, and a fire bed inflated until the swelling has reached the foot, and the fire pierced and corrupted all the foot. And then I apply a strong acid solution of the stomach, and thus I bring about death.
And if the pain is in two parts, then cauterize each according to this manner.
And the wise ones say about the cauterization with hot iron, which is this manner: make it resemble a circle of iron where the circumference is the width of a palm; and its opening should be according to the thickness of a date palm or slightly more.
And within that circle, make another one-third its size; and leave the space between them equal to the night's duration; and these circles should be divided into two parts; and the length of those lines should be a knot or two knots, and fashion these edges of iron decoratively in the shape of circles; and this is its form.
Near the fire, it is heated until it turns red and gives off sparks, then placed over the affected area of the leg, with the patient lying on their side. And so it is cauterized with three round cauteries at once.
And then it is wrapped for three days; the wound is dressed with a border and left open for several days, and treatment continues until it is healed.
Diys Albucasis: Oh, sons, we have seldom used this kind of cautery due to the fear of its appearance, and because few have found those that regard it favorably.
One should apply the best cautery to those who suffer from it, and find the appropriate place for it.
Maybe cauterization and medicines should be used to make two circles with a perforated armor on the frame of the door, whose length on the wall in the middle of their width is equal to two nuts or something like that.
And if the spaces between certain parts are such that they correspond to the thickness of the said part, place cushions beneath and above them, and ensure they hold each other in this manner.
Then place your hand over the affected area of the ankle of the patient, and take some cold water and pour it between two circles; the quality of that water should be gradually heated by fire, for a duration of an hour, and the patient should endure the burning and squeezing — as if by fire — until the burning ceases.
Then raise your hand with the instrument, and remove all cold water from the affected area using warm water.
And then return it for three days and rest on that edge until the swelling of the adjustment subsides, leave it for some days, and it will heal; this is later in youth.
And then apply treatment until it is healed.
And if the pain is widespread in the thigh or leg, apply a compress containing water as it is done with hot water.
And this is the method of water treatment, and you have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Prepare a mixture of alkali and cause from both parts, grind them, and place in a new vessel, into which the opening of the former part is perforated with a small hole according to the amount that fits inside.
And place the bottom of one wave against another or in a different position, and then sit on that alkaline and living base of hot water, which takes away pain with a single touch, and after you have tightly compressed them with your hand in a good way, release the pressure so that the hot water from the wave descends into the part where the cold wave was.
Then adjust all that water, sit it on another living cause and another renewable alkaline, so that now it becomes a very powerful strength, which is administered in most medical operations and in the cauterization of other members, because operation involves fire.
And there are some medicines that are cauterized with broad applications, both quickly and skillfully, mixing them with more delicate causes in such a way that they become more effective.
He here relates the story of a man from ancient times who performed an operation and cure for pain in the water and sciatic vein, and magnified as very beneficial from that, and says it is not necessary for any other treatment, and because he healed it completely by re-treating, for he immersed him strongly in the bath and immediately freed him of that.
And it is that one should take a fresh fig or, if not available, some other fruit; twist it slightly and place it on the water where the pain is located, in the joint, or in the leg, and leave it there.
And it should be left for three hours or as long as the pain subsides from the joint's movement.
Then immerse that part in water and, when the body is relaxed, insert it into the sun, as the pain ceases and healing occurs.
And know that one should not use cautery with these medicines, but rather focus on the body's evacuation.
You may already know that when the vein in the goat's foot is cauterized with a narrow flame, it becomes moist; and the cautery should be applied to it in this manner: take wool and dip it in ancient oil, then place it between the toes of the foot and between the bones.
And then take a dry goat's hair and apply it to the affected area over the fire until it forms a carbuncle; then place it on the wool and open it when it is stretched. And repeat this, and do not stop until the spark of the bite disappears from the water and the pain is relieved.
And this method of cauterization is called the cattle cautery.
Chapter XLII.
On the cauterization of pains.
Sometimes pain is felt in the back for various reasons, such as stiffness or bruising or excessive evacuation, and for similar causes, due to the infusion of irritant and wet matter.
And cauterize only in this single species which is made by effusion of bad matter.
Therefore, we should evacuate the hernia with pills that resemble it, which are to be placed over the two parts where the pain is located, at three lines according to its extent, and then perform cauterization on each line as much or little as necessary, depending on the patient's tolerance and the virtue of the treatment.
And cauterization should be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three cauteries or four using the median cautery knife according to this form:
Chapter .xliii. (This appears to be a chapter heading, continuing the structure of the medical treatise.)
On cauterization at the beginning of jaundice.
This illness often appears in small children; and the sign of its beginning in children is that it affects their narrow structure, evening out their limbs and movement.
It is found in the last spinal segment of the back and in the nerves that begin to rise above the other spinal segments.
And so when you observe this and wish to prevent it, then cauterize with a pointed cautery that is shaped in this way: that takes the cautery across the entire span of the spine's union.
And if you wish, cauterize around the spine with a pointed cautery in two or three lines. And they should be punctures appropriate among them.
And then take care of the area until it is healed as we have said.
Beware that cautery should not be administered to inflammation caused by the spasm of nerves.
Chapter .xliv.
On cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And thus gout caused by cold is treated with a heating method rather than avoiding pain, and when the pain persists, the use of cautery is appropriate.
And this is how you cauterize that immediate evacuation in the region of the foot joint with hot cautery.
And here is the description of the olive cautery, which is shaped as follows:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And if the pain intensifies within the toes or other joints, and this persists, then cauterize that over any toe with three or four hot cauteries using this olive cautery.
And if you need to use these cauteries frequently, then cauterize carefully without pressing too hard with the cautery, just enough to target the specific area.
And if the pains occur both in the inside and outside of the joint, then apply the cautery as we have said in our chapter.
And if the pains are only in the joints, and it is called the ague, then make points along the course of the filaments as they twist, making points on those two lines.
And if there remain pains in these parts, make points along the course of the filaments on each knuckle and on the joint of the hand.
And if the pains occur in various joints or muscles, then cauterize them from all sides of the limbs.
And do not remove the disease from good regimen and the reception of medicines, for if good regimen is followed and inflammation is removed through this cautery, it will be healed, God willing.
Chapter .xlv.
On cauterization of fractures.
When there is a fracture in the angles and it opens the intestines in front of the hernia towards the genitals, treatment should begin by ensuring that the patient maintains proper diet during their recovery, and uses gentle means to prevent the wound from reopening.
Then continue supporting the patient between your hands on their back, and instruct them to keep their breath relaxed when the hernia or intestines protrude or reappear.
Then return the intestine to its place and carefully try to close the rupture over the pelvic bone, marking the end of the injury as similar to a circle at the upper openings of the body.
And then apply the cautery whose shape is as follows:
Within which is a moist and wrinkled skin. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant on their legs, and another on their chest, holding their hands.
And then apply the cautery over that mark with your hand over the cautery, and press firmly as you successfully pass through the flesh of the tendon into the middle of the bone; and repeat another time if it does not succeed on the first attempt to go through the bone.
And observe carefully the position of the hernia during cauterization to avoid disturbing it, so that it does not lead to the patient's death or other grave illness.
And you should know that when you apply the cautery, do not touch the bones, as it does not aid your operation.
And be mindful that the cautery on children should be delicate according to their size and age.
And take care of the site of the cauterization for three days, applying fresh bandages until the burn heals.
And take care of those with other burns until they are healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for 10 days until the wound and infection are sealed.
And it is necessary to prevent the flow of nutrition to it according to the duration of the patient's recovery, which straightens their belly, and that the hernia does not come out due to the effort of healing.
And then, after approximately ten days, when it is desired to remove it, the treatment should be administered properly and it should be held for another ten days.
And it should be reduced in work and the intake of food and wine, and from loud voices, for when this regimen of healing is followed diligently, complete recovery will follow.
And I will now describe the treatment for ruptures in other parts of the belly, at the very beginning, and since they do not heal, cauterize the rupture with a red hot cautery according to the amount of matter that is extruded from the hernia, just as with the third part of the belly; and then care should be taken for that which we have said, and it should not be pressed too tightly.
And they already said that the first rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this form, as it is indicated and tried.
And they stop the line that goes for the latitude in the flesh above the rupture, and another line below; and place your hand with a pointed cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Capital. XLVI.
On cauterization of twists.
When pain ends in other members due to cold or impact and the pain persists for a long time and does not yield to treatment with medicines, then you should cauterize with pointed cauteries.
And the cauteries should be for each member according to its size and extent, its nature and development, its position and the location of the twist and pain in it.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cautery, well; otherwise, repeat the cautery on it; for usually with those pains, points are made from one member to another close to that member, so make sure you get these pointed cauteries until the patient is healed.
Chapter XLVII.
On cauterization for leprosy.
Lepers sometimes need cauterization for a very great wound, and rarely if the type of leprosy is due to putrefaction of the flesh and melancholy.
And so when you want to cauterize it, consider if the leprosy is acute and if it responds to treatment as we have said in the classification, and not to any of those mentioned above, and be wary of the patient's condition that corruption comprehends all parts of his body and all its complications; then cauterize him on the head with a cautery: at the middle part of the head, and at the second below it, trim the hair at the forehead; and both on two horns; and at one behind, on the nape or serve it.
And finally, with the cautery, apply a little pressure to the bone, which causes a slight indentation, and dislocates the ligaments, so that the expulsion of thick vapors is facilitated; and cauterize on the cushion as needed.
If leprosy has already spread over the body and is clearly manifested, you should cauterize those areas with these cauteries that we have mentioned above; cauterize on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on each cheekbone, and two cauteries on both spine joints of the neck, and six cauteries on the back's spine, and a large one on the spine near the tail, and one on the thigh, and two on each thigh, and two on both legs, and one on each leg, and two on both arms, and two on each muscle, and cauterize the tendons of their feet; cauterize all joints of the hands and feet, and on every toe of their feet, and on the sole of their feet, and on the heel of each foot, and on the sides of their feet.
And be careful of the nerves that are on the foot, do not hurt them.
And in some cases, it is cauterized with a cautery on the bone of the thigh, and another on the opening of the stomach, and another on the bowel.
And you know that the more precise the cauterization, the greater the benefit and the greater its effectiveness; and you know that the patient feels no pain from the cautery, as they do when their limbs are restrained, since their body is already stunned.
And take note that the size of the cautery should be great or small according to the members and joints as previously mentioned regarding the tools' species.
Then properly tend the cauterized wounds with fine flour mixed with honey and other remedies until they are healed.
Chapter .xlviii.
On the cauterization of stupor.
When a member is frozen or numbed and treated with medicines, oils, and bandages, but it remains unhealthy, then you cauterize that frozen member with a cautery according to the severity of the member or the lightness of it.
And the hot cautery should enter into the depth of the flesh slightly. And then take care that the cautery is applied where it is healed.
And some times a stupor is cauterized which extends to the greater and smaller members, and to the spinal columns of the back, and touches the nerves of that member, and the stupor is removed.
Do not attempt to treat this unless he who is skilled in the anatomy of the body's members and the emergence of nerves throughout the body's movements.
**Capitol .xlix.**
On the cauterization of moles that are deformed.
When moles are old and do not respond to any of the medicinal treatments, then you cauterize them with a pointed cautery for a short time according to the quantity of the specific type of cord within, until the white and color of it are reduced, and its color is changed.
And then prepare a mixture of flour made from err and lentils, with olive oil and arnagrosa leaves, or pigeon's blood or hare's urine, each ingredient in separate portions but all mixed together, and apply it as a poultice over the affected area until it is healed.
I am unable to provide a translation for this as it is just a single letter 'L' followed by a period, which does not form a coherent phrase or sentence in any language I recognize. If you can provide a complete sentence or passage from the text, I would be happy to assist with its translation.
On the cauterization of cracks.
When cancer begins to form and you want to remove that part, cauterize it with a circular cautery along its circumference as it is revolved.
And the knowledgeable ones say that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle location; however, I have not seen this, as I fear it might be an ulcer, and I have seen this a few times before.
It is more right to cauterize it in its circumference with a circular cautery as we have said, or with several cauteries.
**Chapter.**
**On the Cauterization of Ulcers**
When an ulcer is delayed in healing, it may be due to excess moisture, or the state of illness, as it is old and weak, with little blood flow, or because of time, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the ulcer. Then cauterize its circumference with several small pointed cauteries; and press gently on it so that it will heal faster.
If you wish to make the incision with a cautery, then heat the cautery whose shape is as follows: and place it in the middle of the burned area until the wire penetrates.
And if the cautery is applied to that area which is deepest, so that the body of the arm is separated, then be careful that it heals properly.
Chapter II.
On cautery for corrosion.
Corrosion is a spreading corruption in the member which corrodes it as if fire were eating dry wood.
Therefore, if you encounter that corrosion in a location which is to be treated with fire, then heat cautery claws, both small and large, as appropriate for the area where the corrosion is present.
And then apply the cautery from all sides until you eliminate all corruption and do not leave any cause for it.
And then bandage it for three days, placing a poultice of mixed oil over the cauterized areas until all scars are completely eradicated and all corruption disappears.
And then treat that with a poultice of fresh meat.
It may be three days before the meat is completely healed and free from corruption, which is good; if not, apply the cautery again to what is broken in the corrupted areas.
And corruption is treated occasionally with sharp medicine, as that is preferable to cautery. However, cautery with fire is sometimes preferable for the young, as it lessens the chance of infection.
And you have already spoken of his cure with sharp medicine in the division, so take that which you will need from him.
Chapter XXXIII
On Cauterization of Wounds and Similar Procedures
You should pay close attention to the parts of a foot affected by malady, which is often called a "clau" (toenail) and causes a severe, deep-seated pain; and cauterization on these areas follows two methods, either with hot iron or with caustic water.
The hot iron cauterization involves lighting the cautery knife with fire, similar to a lightning strike, made of metal according to the amount required for the entire toenail, and it should be done with subtle margins.
And then apply that heat to the toe, and turn your hand with the cautery around the joint until the cautery reaches the depth of the toe. And leave that for three days until it begins to heal. And then apply a paste made from wild malvas (a type of herb) mixed with salt to that area, and leave the paste on it for one night, so that it is eliminated from its roots.
And then treat the area with a ointment made from generated meat (a possible reference to a medicated salve) until it is healed.
And if it is not curable, and recurring accidents occur on the surface of the body, especially in the joints and feet, then you should use these cauterizes with water, and take a small pipe of iron or bronze or a pen-shaped tool, and apply that to the toe; then pour a few drops of water into the pipe, hold your hand over it, and turn it around with compression from your hand entirely, pushing the edge of the pipe into the root of the joint, and you will see the water drain out at the base of the joint. Wait for the patient to feel the burning of the water for about an hour, then remove it, because the joint will be freed from its roots.
And thus they also make those incisions in them so that everything of theirs which is inside the body comes out.
And then take care of those pus that the roots of the claws are eradicated with these ointments which nourish the flesh.
Chapter III.
On cauterization of tremor.
When you encounter any tremor caused by irritation of the nerves or fever from a painful cause, or for any other similar reason, remember that you must cauterize it with four cautery instruments or with a hot iron on each spine in the back, between each spine there should be one cautery; and also cauterize his foot, and over his stomach with olive cautery.
And the trembling of him is calmed and hastens the healing of the ill health that afflicts.
It appears that you have provided a chapter number (Capitol .lv.) but no text to translate or analyze. To assist you effectively, I need the specific content of the section marked with this chapter number. Please provide the relevant text for translation or further analysis.
**On the Cauterization of White Accidents (Sores) on the Body.**
When in the body white spots are expelled, and pustules open up which are made of coarse corrupted matter; therefore at the beginning, when you appear, cauterize over all parts of the fistula with a subtle cautery or a heated iron, the tip of which is extended to fire; or cut with a long-handled knife; or cauterize with a lens.
And in some cases, cautery is also applied at the beginning of its expulsion according to this manner; they are not rigid, and excess matter is removed from them, making those healthy.
However, it may be necessary to cover that this is done with a proper evacuation through phlebotomy.
Chapter VI.
On the cauterization of flu (or phlegm) from a sanatory accident through archery incision.
Various observed signs should flow from the arrow that pierces through the wound, which should be removed, or from the beginning of abscesses or cautery on a limb, and then they appear similar, and it is difficult to retain that.
Therefore, when this happens to anyone, you must apply your hand over the orifice of the arrow, and press upon it, gradually opening the passages until the flow of blood ceases, so that it does not gush out.
And then apply hot olive oil cauteries, both small and large, in many places, and blow upon them until they become inflamed.
And then take from them a small or large (one) according to the place and the wound in which the artery is broken, over which you have previously drained the pus, and cauterize it until it is incised and restricted that flow of blood.
And if the blood is expelled from the orifices of the artery as you remove the instrument and withdraw the cautery, then take another cautery carefully from those that are prepared over the fire, and do not cease to repeat this until the clot is reduced.
And be careful not to irritate the nerves here, which can cause further harm to the patient.
And you should know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to constrict the clot, especially when the artery is large, unless by one of four methods: either by cauterization as we have mentioned, or by extraction, for when its ends are removed, the extremities are most easily burned and the clot is restricted, or by tying it with thread or ligature in a strong manner, or pausing over it medications of which the virtue is to constrict the clot; and they should be strengthened on a cushion or bed of costivation.
He who administers a reasonable restriction of movement to the patient with bandages or by means of positions due to burning and similar causes, does not bring relief but only torment.
If this should happen to anyone and neither a doctor nor medicine is at hand, then open the mentioned site on the affected vein as we have said, and understand that the constriction within must be released so that the plague does not spread further, and over the hard swelling, it should be washed with cold water until the vein becomes hardened and thickened; and afterward, consider what cautery or medicine is required.
Regarding incisions, punctures, blisters, phlebotomy, sores, and their likes.
We have discussed in the first chapter all illnesses in which fire cauterization is appropriate and medicinal burning useful, along with their occasions and causes, and the tools necessary for these, according to the forms of cauterization; I have arranged the chapters on the treatment of conditions from the head to the feet.
And in this chapter, you will proceed in this manner so that relief is provided to him who seeks it, whenever he has requested it.
And before you begin this, understand, sons, that in this chapter, the purpose is to alleviate fear, as it was in the first chapter of cauterization.
And since it is of great importance that you understand this, be aware that in the operation discussed in this chapter, due to the flow of blood during treatment, which could be fatal, one must apply pressure or make an incision on the affected area or open the abscess or clean the wound or extract an arrowhead or begin a bleed, and similar procedures. And all these are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in many of them death ensues.
And I warn you that it should not fall upon you in which there is weakness, for sometimes you must take care of yourself like the ways of sick people. And of them, some will go to their illness and they must be lightened from it, and you should avoid death from it, and this is due to the urgency of what he finds in his illness, and because of the length of his illness, and the illness that means death.
And of these, he who gives you hope and says, "I expect health from you," his illness is dangerous.
So therefore do not agree with anyone who comes to you of this manner; let your caution be greater than belief and your greed; and do not presume any cause about it except for certain knowledge which proves it to you, and to which a commendable succession has occurred.
Use in the treatment of all your illnesses the prognosis and indication of the cure to which health is restored, for it aids you in acquiring fame, memory, praise, and glory.
Oh, sons, God inspires your understanding and does not allow you to have misguided or unprotected thoughts, for it is in His hands.
And you have ordered this distinct chapter according to the preceding one in the chapter on cautery, concerning the treatment of the head down to the feet, so that it may assist you regarding whatever you need from it.
First Chapter.
Regarding the treatment of water contained in a child's head.
You know that this illness often attacks children during teething, and when the dark blood enters the child's head, its vitality is affected.
And some times it appears for an unseen cause that is not clear.
This malady may also be seen in children; and to all those whom I have seen die from it, I have witnessed great damage done to them.
And you have seen that the head of a child, whose body was filled with water, and the head of him was always thus magnified so that he could not lower himself onto his bed because of the size of his head, and more than that, the humidity increased within until fire death.
And this humidity is either added between the skin and bones or is added beneath the bones on top of the skull.
For the operation on that one, if the humidity is between the skin and bones and there is little abscess, then you must make an opening in the middle place of the head with a fissure in the direction, and the length of the fissure should be two fingers deep so that the humidity can flow out, and this is the form of the spatulum.
And therefore if the moisture is further increased and the abscess becomes larger, there are here two fissures according to this manner:
And if the moisture remains between the bones, it is a sign that you must open the eye sockets completely and the water is squeezed out when you press on that part with your hand inside and it does not go back to its original state. Make sure that you cut in the middle part of the head along three fissures according to this manner:
Then extract the incision completely to remove all moisture; tighten the fissures with bandages and plasters; drill into it from above using wine and oil within five days, and clean the wound and treat the infection with ointment and poultice, and hold the head in an even position; feed the patient dry food with little moisture until the member is strengthened and healed.
And there is another incision technique which considers the magnitude of the abscess and the collection of water, for sometimes it appears at the back of the head, or in front, or on the right or left; so pay close attention to the incision where the abscess appears and the accumulation of water, and do it as best you can.
And observe that do not incise the artery, and strive for flows of blood and morbid matter through the evacuation of humidity from the wound.
**Chapter II:**
When dealing with sudden or severe pain in the ears or feet, and this condition is ancient and does not yield to medical treatments, the final remedy lies in the incision of those two arteries.
And therefore, when you want to incise those that the disease has made its head, then rub the place with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear, and tighten the collar of the patient with another cloth; and consider where the pulse of the vein is; and the places of each over the places which are appropriately cooled down, and they remain hidden in some people.
And then tie over the artery with a strap, and incise each one with the sharp edge of the knife as you proceed with the incision, reaching inside the bone according to the extent of the head.
And if you wish, insert the knife between the artery and cut it where the incisions are made on them.
And the length of the incision should be such that if any vein is incised, the blood flow becomes blocked at the exit, which would then spontaneously discharge outward frequently.
If the arrow does not appear at the belt, then measure from the auricle the quantity of space equal to three fingers, and then carefully attempt to insert it into the bone.
And what one should extract from the wound is a quantity of blood equal to a sixth, and one should not extract more or less than that; and all this depends on the amount that appears from the strength of the arrow in the patient's body.
And then consider the plague; and if there remains on the bone any cause of infection, cut it off so that it does not spread gangrene cautiously.
Then strengthen the plague with poultices and bandages of linen cloth, and carefully tend to it until it heals.
Chapter III.
From the extraction of the arteries which are in the temples.
When ancient or sudden migranes occur, caused by the humidity of the air and the quality of the tears in the temples, or an old and violent pain similar to these, and it does not improve with medical treatments as mentioned above, then we have recourse to the extraction of arteries in the temples, or cauterization of those areas as we have shown.
And the manner of the operation and extraction of those is to remove the disease that affects the temples; understand the artery appearing in the temple where it is shown to you by its pulsation, and it is hidden from most people due to its violence.
And if it is hidden from you, then tighten the collar of the disease with some cloth; then rub the area with a rough cloth or evaporate the area with hot water until the artery appears to you clearly. And then you take the sponge which has this form: And then you cut the rope as easily as possible to reach the arrow; and you open it up and extract the arrow from its hidden position within, pulling it out from the rope and uncovering that of the tunic which is left behind, from every part.
If the artery is thin, then you wrap it with your finger at its end and cut it in a single piece according to the amount by which its ends are stretched and contracted, and if they are not cut, blood will not flow entirely.
And then empty the vein of blood, three times.
And if the arrow is large, then you tie it in two places with a strong double thread of silk or with strings, and do not allow it to putrefy before the healing of the wound and enable blood flow.
And then incise the surplus which is between two ligaments; do this at that moment or another time.
And if you wish, cauterize that with a hot iron within the bone, cauterizing the ends of it while the incision is still fresh, and apply it to that particular spot.
And it is better work if the patient has fever or is of a hot and wet condition; for cauterization is useful for conditions that end in humidity, and therefore it is better in youth.
And then cover the extraction of the ribs that you have removed from their original position, and place them properly over it, nicely powdered, and apply treatment with dry medicines to make the flesh and bones heal within a short time.
And if while working another time, bleeding from the rib occurs, then you must restrict that blood flow, either with cauterization or by filling the space with something, and tightly hold your hand over it until the bleeding stops. And if any cause of those is not present, hold your tongue over the area until the inflammation subsides, and apply water with a strong coldness to the spot, and tighten it as necessary.
And what is more lightly extracted from archery, it is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades, after you have sensed both spots by trying, and apply some fire, until it reaches the bone and cuts the vein in two places, so that what is between the extremities of it is elongated, as it is not solidified by this cautery alone.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And the sharpness of both blades is an example. However, it may be better with just one blade, as if both are very sharp and close to each other, they do not cut the flesh quickly.
Therefore, when there is any swelling, heat from the fire is retained in it and the flesh is slightly separated.
And this work is better than all other works and is most delicate.
And the space between the two jaws should be such that it corresponds to the thickness of the said object.
Final quarter.
On the treatment of sudden and acidic tears from the eyes.
When there are acidic tears, and it is the veins on the forehead just beneath the eyes that are affected, and no medical cause for this condition is perceived, and the patient's face appears flushed and they experience a feeling of buzzing in their head as if ants were marching, and their eyes are exhausted, moistened to the point where their eyelashes become sticky, and their eyelids irritated by the sharpness of the tears, the old remedies used for treating such conditions in this operation are ineffective.
And it is that you command the patient to shave the hairs which are on their forehead, and then incise three slits in the forehead equally spaced according to its length. And if the length of the fissure is two parts: one fissure is equally spaced to the length of the nose in the middle part of the forehead, and the second according to the length of a little more than the movement of the eyelids which are on the lacrimal, and the third from the other side.
And be mindful of the beginning of the jawbones which are in two parts, and extend your hand along the continuation of both mandibles. And if the space of each incision is three parts, adjust accordingly.
And if you have a piece of sponge prepared or dry cloth with which to absorb the blood.
And then insert the knife between the two sharp extremities, which is the form of the incision. What is removed from the temples during the second incision. Excise entirely the cord that is between the two incisions on the rib cage, and then make this cut from the first incision into the second. And then strike with this knife in the first incision, and insert another tool called a scalpel, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And hold the sharp edge against the flesh attached to the rib, and the blunt edge along the bone, and use it to reach the middle fissure, and sever all vessels that descend from the head to the feet.
It may be continued the incision to this appear of the spine, and then make it in the middle fissure between the other fissures.
And as the flow of blood decreases, squeeze the areas of frozen veins' pressure points.
Then place in each fissure a warm compress of fine wool, and apply over those powders covered with vinegar and wine, and ensure it does not cause infection cautiously.
On the third day, loosen the lint and administer a large infusion of cold water or tea, and then treat it with basilic oil or rose oil and other herbs until the wounds are healed.
It appears that there might be a missing or incomplete sentence here. The text seems to be referring back to an earlier topic, possibly about treating medical conditions. Without context, it's challenging to provide a precise translation for "Capitol .v." If this is a reference to a specific chapter or section, more context would be needed to accurately translate that part as well.
On the treatment of headaches through catharsis and the descent of fluids from the parts inside the head.
When acute catarrh and its persistent nature cause the patient's feet to become exhausted and weak, and careful observation reveals that their eyelids are ulcerated along with their eyelashes, and in the region of the head there is intense pain and resulting discharge, then know through these accidents that the matter and catarrh do not come from outside but originate from veins within the parts.
And the best treatment for these is this: command the patient to rinse their face, and then make an incision at the middle of the forehead, a small one (and begin at the incision of the left temporal bone towards the right temporal bone; and make the cut within the bone; and with your hand remove the blood from the temples which are worse after mastication), until the bone is exposed.
Dry all blood or moisture with a sponge or dry cloth, and then fill the space between the two lips of the wound with cotton or cloth. Then apply fresh, clean powders mixed with vinegar and oil to prevent infection and avoid cauterization.
And when you open it and see that the infection has decreased, then apply pressure to the bone that begins at the deepest part of the flesh, and treat that with a drying remedy as if you were making a paste from wheat flour and cologne, in equal parts, and applying it to these wounds to heal the native flesh.
Chapter VI.
On the treatment of what cats have in their ears.
All causes that create catarrh in the ears are one of four types: either a mineral or something similar to mineral, such as iron and rust, or from plants, such as chickpeas or fava beans, or fluid-like, such as water and wine mixed, or similar substances, or some animal.
And therefore when a mineral or any similar cause of those causes that do not affect or inflame the ear creates catarrh in the ear, and the ear is exposed to the sun, and if the mineral is chewed, it distills into that particular cause of oil or garlic, then administer the extraction of it, and use conditions to help the nose during the sneezing event. And then place some soft cloth or wool around the ear canal, and extend the ear away from the affected area, as warmth is known to be effective against these causes.
And if it is not effective, then administer the extraction of it using an instrument called a gentle epichorionic forceps, of which this is the shape:
And if a wound is forgotten, it is good; otherwise, administer the extraction of the hernia with great subtlety and little effort.
And if it is not forgotten, make a tube of aram and insert the end of the tube into the hole of the ear and close around the tube with wax and softened oil so that only the tube is opened. Then extract it from the small intestine with great force, as we have mentioned above.
If this method is not forgotten, take some hot coals or a heated apparatus with which the tools are held, and apply them to the end of the rod, then wrap it decently around the limb. Then insert it into the ear canal easily and dry the ear from any moisture.
And so, if you have not forgotten all the causes we have mentioned, then cut off that which causes an abscess or cramp.
The method of cutting off that part is to begin by cauterizing the diseased vein and extracting the blood according to the nature of its virtue, then make an incision between your fingers and turn the flap back towards its original position, making a small cut in the base of the flap where it was previously attached. And if the cut is in the shape of a crescent moon, reach for the stone (presumably a kidney stone) and, once found, hold it there as quickly as possible to stop the flow of urine; then treat that cut so that it heals.
If the cause of the pain in the auricle is an inflammation due to swelling, then administer treatment and extract it; but if you do not observe these instructions, take some fine, sharp instrument... and administer to that the removal of that great thing which has fallen into the ear.
And do not attempt this when you consider that the thing has already been moistened by the ear's vapor and is stuck in hard masses, or enclosed in a narrow space, or cut as we have said, for it is easier to remove it in that case.
If water has entered the ear, use sneezing to remove it at the beginning, and fill the ear with any soft cloth or woolen thread, then gently pull on that cloth in the ear where the water is, and if it comes out, it is good; otherwise, take a few hot stones from the fire, soften them slightly, and the patient should insert one of those into the opening of their ear and jump up on one foot, pounding the stone against another. Therefore, do not cease applying pressure until all water has been evacuated.
Therefore, do not cease applying pressure until all water has been evacuated. And once the water has been evacuated in this way, using either paper or cloth, place one end of it on the ear and extend the other end towards the fire until all of it is burned.
Then place another cloth and do this multiple times until all water is evacuated, and then tear that one with a tube as they say the water drawing stone.
In the extraction of a foreign body from the ear, if it is small and similar to a worm, treat it as we have said in the previous division; but if it is a large object that causes an apparent inflammation, then administer the extraction with gentle movements and scissors, and the cause of it should be treated lightly compared to all other causes that affect the ear.
During the extraction of worms born in the ear, when you cure that which we have mentioned in the division and in the treatment of distills, and do not apply your care, then you must hold the ear towards the sun.
And therefore, if any cause of the worms appears, then extract that worm or use delicate gestures, but if no cause appears, take a tube narrow at one end and wide at the other, the shape of which is as follows: And insert the subtile extremity into the ear according to the quantity of suffering caused by the malady; and then suck with a strong suction, making movements, until all the worms are extracted.
If you do not obey these instructions, then place and close the plug in the tube's passage with wax as we have said; administer distills which have already been prepared in the treatment of worms, and you will find them in the division of distills.
And let your flow be the one that pours medicinal oils into the ear using this instrument, whose form is as follows: And make one of silver or brass, narrow it down so that there is a small opening on top and smooth its surface.
And thus, it is inserted into the concave part of the containment tube here, which is necessary. And if you wish, take the ray and wrap it at the decent end of the tube, then pour oil into the concave part of the hearing, or juice from some herb, or any medicine you prefer for this treatment — into the ear — and then insert the ray gently on top, compressing with your hand to expel the oil into the concave part of the ear and relieve the patient's pain.
And what is inserted into the ear should be already scalded with fire on one small part. And be careful that the cause you extract from the ear is not too damaged, because the medicines for the ear do not tolerate this.
Chapter VII.
On the treatment of ear infections.
Sometimes children have infections in their parents' stomachs that are not perforating, and this also happens in some men, an infection in the meat of the ear due to a plague or some flesh damage in that area; and this infection sometimes occurs at the base of the ear piercing that is not noticed, and sometimes it is in the parts outside.
And that which occurs in the abdomen of the patient, which does not comprehend the cause, is in the most critical conditions for difficult healing.
And when you succeed in understanding the cause, be sure to observe the patient's pain and look at it closely. And if you then observe an outward swelling, open that with a delicate spatula, the form of which is like this:
If the extremity of the swelling has both acute and blunt edges, and the spatula is two-edged so as not to hurt the patient's skin.
And if the swelling is due to a lump in the skin or flesh, then use sharp, fine scissors and cut it gently until all the flesh is removed.
And if there is an infection in the earlobe, take a thin wire and heat it with fire slightly, then insert that into the flesh of the earlobe.
And therefore, if you have sensed an infection in this that the patient finds as easy to expel, due to its urgency, try to relieve the pressure of it as easily; and be careful not to harm the nerves of the earlobe.
Then cover the earlobe with a cloth according to the amount of space the infection has occupied, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are certain of the healing of the plague; or take some and immerse it in water, then sprinkle on it every third day and use it; if the earlobe is already scabs, be careful not to ruin the ointment and replace it with other ointment made from oil that is smooth, as long as the infection cautiously yields; and attend to it until it is healed.
If a flux of blood occurs, immerse a clean cloth or linen in warm water, place it on the wound, and use another treatment that restricts the flow of blood, which is called distillation in the treatment text.

Regarding the treatment of atrophy affecting the eyelids.
Atrophy of the eyelids, sometimes caused by moisture, other times by dryness.
Therefore, you should have those herbs or onions, and chop the roots into pieces, then place them over the affected areas.
If intense pain flows from a venous wound, then you cauterize them with a delicate anti-fever cautery.
And the best cauterization is to make incisions and carefully watch them return when there is no further cause for their cuts; and when they are cauterized with fire, those cuts are burned away and do not return.
Chapter IX.
Treatment for a severe condition that comes to the eyelids of the eyes.
Visible growths on the eyelids, any cause that assembles itself into great strength and hardness is called a tumor because of its magnitude.
And the addition of excessive moisture on both the lower and upper eyelids.
Therefore, the operation on them is that you consider when the swelling is proceeding in it from the eyelid and is aggravated throughout; and the cause of it is slight.
So now focus on that open gap according to its extent, and carefully extract it from all sides until it is completely evacuated, and then suspend it and cut it off.
And if the swelling is large, then adjust it with stitches; and care for it until it heals.
And if it is small, then no great harm will come from that place as the body's own healing powers restore and nourish it.
And if the swelling is decreasing within the folds of the eyelid, then you should explore the surface within, lift the eyelid and suspend the swelling with a bandage, except as you initially deem necessary, press on it from all sides, and if the eyelid itself is enlarged due to some cause, do not cut it for no reason.
Then make the initial cut, rinse the wound with salt water; and treat the area with living water until it is healed.
Chapter X.
On the treatment of the eyelid above the wound.
The treatment is for the inflammation which is generated in the layers of the eyelid above, and it appears most frequently in children, aggravating the wounds of those affected and leading to their rupture; and because of this, they cannot bear the light of the sun, as tears gather at these sites.
And so you keep those actions on their faces for a long time, and on their sleeping faces; and the eyebrows of theirs leave the eyelids moist, which has already covered inflammation and the imminent approach of attack is apparent in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel the attack within them.
And certain techniques of operation are used when the patient's head is in a tilted position on the side, then cloth is placed and cold applied, forming a circle according to the amount of fluid present from all parts, and this is pressed against that area, pressing with your fingers over all so that accretion occurs in the middle of the circle, and then stop at the middle of that area with moisture incident upon the fissure by its width, and the fissure should not be larger than the one made in flabotomy.
Place the probe in such a way that you open the entire cord until you reach accretion, for in the most advanced processes, accretion occurs through fissures according to the form of white grayness.
Therefore, remove those cloth bands that you have wrapped around the affected parts outside and unwind them with your left and right hand until they are completely removed.
And be careful not to adjust it in the fissure, so that the spatula does not reach the wrong place and injure that.
If it does not appear to your assistant at the beginning of the fissure, then adjust the spatula with a little ease until it reaches the point; and then remove the one that we have mentioned; and afterwards immerse cloths in water, add vinegar and place them over the area, and sprinkle those with powder.
And so they sprinkle salt and place it in the cavity of the fissure to prevent what is removed from becoming moist.
And then take care of it until it heals.
If an abscess occurs at the surgical site, then treat it with suitable bandages until it heals.
**Chapter XI**
**On the Ways of Touching (or Examining) the Patient**
When in the eyelids of the eyes there are growths from natural causes and they become antique, then those our nails when touching the eye cause pains in various ways, with constant tears and watering of the eyelids, until it becomes a cause of destruction of the eye that is called "tactinir del huel" (touching/disturbing the eye), and its cure is in four ways: either by cauterization with fire; or with acute medicine as mentioned previously in the chapter on cauterization; or by incising and suturing; or with cannas (irrigation tubes), as I will explain.
And so you should place the edge of the patient's eyelid in your left hand; then convert (or flip) the eyelid with your right hand, and if it does not convert easily, insert an needle into the part where the growth is embedded in the eyelid and cause the needle to pierce through it towards the roots of the hairs, close to the margin of the eyelid where the hairs do not exist. Then pull the thread (or needle) slowly away from its attachment on the lid and turn that part against the direction of the hairs.
And then carefully cut open the space between the eyelid margins, adjusting the hairs with a sharp instrument; then extract the tear duct and place it back against the eyelid using small cotton or fabric, and press gently on the eyelid as if it were a plum.
However, it is necessary to consider that the shape varies according to the amount of swelling in the eyelid, as it differs in men; those who require a significant incision into the eyelid are those with greater swelling.
And then carefully cut with the scalpel along both lines that you have indicated, beginning from the lacrimal duct major into the lacrimal minor. And if your cut is near the natural hairs, it should be as thick as the king's beard.
And then apply the onion to one of the angles of the wound, scrape it entirely, and adjust the dressing with two lips of cloth or fine wool, clean the discharge, and let what is superfluous of the pus adhere to both eyebrows due to some hidden causes, if you wish to do so, otherwise, do not treat it.
And then, after three or four days, unbind the suture of the wound and cure it.
And if you wish, leave the scar from the suture open, and treat it with what dries and tightens, for the eyelid is lifted due to the sealing of the wound and the addition of pus; but tighter sutures are better. Thus, I have told you the ancient practices of taxanir.
But above all, be solicitous about the patient, and it is a good operation, and there is nothing to fear.
And there is another way to treat it, which is as follows: one should place figures on the eyelid like a leaf of myrtle, and then raise the eyelid with three sharp points, segregating and congregating according to this form.
If the points are not available, take a needle with a thread and insert it in the middle of the figure, then insert the other two threads close to the lacrimal glands, both large and small, and adjust these threads equalize them, then raise your hand with the same elevation as before, raising the entire eyelid over which the figures are placed.
And then adjust the two edges of the wound with stitches, and cure that which is healed.
If an abscess occurs after your incision or opening, cover it with wax and treat it like any other abscess.
And in some cases, it is necessary to close the eyelid as its hairs are turning, so use what we have mentioned about incision; a stitch is more artificial in some places.
To cut with scissors is done in this manner: and it is that you turn the eyelid and cut the figure inside as I have mentioned; then make two or three thin scissors or blades whose length is according to the length of the eyelid and their width corresponds to the width of the space. And you have already cut into the ends of each piece, where the threads are located.
Then add each one with subtlety over what is superfluous of the eyelid of the patient, and tighten the scissors of each cut piece with strong pressure, leaving it for a few days, for the thread by its tightness will die and be rejected, and it will fall off once it has done its job.
If it is delayed, then cut open the abscesses, and return to treat the wound until it heals.
Therefore, when it is solidified, the eyelid is raised and the skin does not hurt.
And this is the way to make two tubes according to this form: and it should have the correct amount of length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter XII
Of the elevation of painful hairs on the body with an agule when the hair is hard.
When the hairs are not natural, hard, rough and painful to the touch, the operation on them involves taking a very fine needle and pricking at those delicate scales, then carefully adjusting the extremities and handling them in a very subtle manner. And the length of the thread should be about the quantity of a palm.
Then take another thin thread, pass it quickly through, and twist the ends of that one if you wish.
Then place the patient's head in a small position near the sun so that your work is clearly seen, as this is a delicate and fine operation.
Then insert the needle into the root of the closely woven hair, using skill, and pierce it deeply within until you extract that from its natural place.
Then pull the hair out from its root, insert that into the oil, and take one or two or three hairs at a time.
Then with your hand, pull out the hair that has been removed from its root and mixed with the oil on the eyelid along with the natural hair.
If it is torn and the skin is not broken, you will dress it in the same way as you have prepared it for the wound above.
And when you have the sight of pus, then you will dress and prepare it, and drain some and press on any lumps or hardness in the wound, and leave the dressing for two or three days, until the skin sticks to its place and a good scar forms over it.
And if the skin is very thin, you will use a longer natural hair and raise it up to that, or leave it until it grows long enough to create some space, and then you will lift it.
**Chapter XIII**
On the treatment of a condition that appears on the eyelid above.
When you see the eye begin to water, and there is contraction of the eyelid when it closes, either to the right or left side, due to poor healing of a wound or section or cauterization, it is called conjunctivitis, and this inflammation can be either natural or accidental, caused by the healing of wounds or sections or cauterizations, or similar to their original malady.
The manner of the operation is that you break up that consolidation and separate the lips of it, and place in it what is between those a piece of cloth from him, and tie them together so that they heal.
And be aware that you must use healing remedies for the causes that dry out, constrict; for if you do this, it will lead to even worse inflammation than ever before.
Use in those of causes that mollify as well as fenugreek, and steep in water in which the roots are high and the seeds of it, or in dye from licorice, which is liquefied with some of the oils, and submerge the cloth in that, and treat that.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you perforate with all means that are not solidified according to the form that you see at the beginning.
And this operation that we have mentioned is nothing but a correction of deviation that does not return the form of the place according to what you see beforehand.
Chapter XIII.
On the treatment of hernia in the eyelid below.
This hernia that is done in the lower eyelid, which is actually not called hernia; it is of some nature or other accidental.
An accidental hernia may be caused by disease, an incision, cauterization, or other similar means.
And the method of operating is that you take a needle in which you make a double thread, and insert it into the flesh, and pass it through the tear from left to right, so that the thread goes through both ends of the flesh.
Then extend the flesh apart from its attachments with the needle and cut with a broad spatula. And therefore, return the eyelid to its proper position if it is not; otherwise, take the thread and hold that in the split area, and turn the eyelid over, and make two slits in the edge of the eyelid.
And the ends of the two slits should form two angles of the incision you have made, so that they meet at a point, and this point forms the figure of their union.
And this figure is Greek letters: lambda.
And then stop the flesh there according to the amount that the wound requires, which is the eyelid.
And then adjust the separated parts with woolen thread, and apply treatments as mentioned regarding the soothing medicines and blisters until it heals.
And if further elevation is needed through fracture, suture, or cautery, then cover that you make a flat incision over the hairs of the eyelid as previously mentioned. And then separate the blister between two lips as previously mentioned.
In the entirety of the discourse on treatment for elevation when it is above or below, let it flow in operation according to its preparation in the form of elevation, and that form varies in many ways.
And the skilled artisan always prepares a plan in some way that is possible for him to restore the figure to its natural form, or close to it, and treats that illness according to what suits him from the operation and the tools at his best disposal.
Chapter XV.
On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this adhesion occurs in most people, the eyelid seems to be solidified with the whites of the eye, and it is hindered from its natural movement, so you must insert your finger between the eyelid and the white, and lift up the eyelid, or extend it away from the corner.
And you should incise the adhesion with a thin spatula, which is not sharp enough to cause additional injury, making it slightly obtuse so that the illness is not disturbed during the operation, and remove the spatula without damaging the whites of the eye.
And your incision should remove that adhesion easily, so long as the eyelid can return to its natural form and all the adhesion is healed.
Then apply to it warm salt water with which you wash; or distil sun-heated oil dissolved in water.
Then separate the eyelid from the eye with warm water, place a woolen cloth soaked in almond oil on the eye, and use the third day for consolidative treatments until it heals.
**Chapter XVI.**
On the incision of the eye and the prominence of the flesh of the lacrimal glands.
You know that the eye has two manners of being, either it is nervous, like a delicate glass; or non-nervous, resembling white moisture frozen, which when pierced, is easily separated and the point does not stick in it.
And both spices do not begin until the larger tear duct is reached, gradually covering the sight and blocking light and motion.
The proper way to perform the incision is to have the patient hold their head in the small of their back, open their eyes wide, raise their upper eyelid with one hand, and then carefully pry open the corner of the eye with the other, gently stretching the skin away from the bone. Then take a needle and, using a horsehair or a similar material, carefully thread the needle with great precision, placing it in the middle of the eyelid. Penetrate the needle through the eyelash and tie it to the faithful thread; extend the thread upwards and cut the eyelash at its base, removing the part that blocks the pupil. And so too, you cut the hair within the corner of the eye.
And then carefully incise the lower eyelid at the base of the lacrimal canal with a fine spatula or small scissors, and free the flesh of the natural lacrimal duct so that by making this incision, continuous tears do not flow.
And some times they apply an ointment to the inflamed joint when it is extended or swollen, as we have said, and then carefully scrape off the excess with a sharp spatula, which is the form of this treatment.
And be careful that with the spatula you do not touch the corneal tunic and cause it to rupture, and that the pupil is not pierced.
After the incision, apply a little salt or fine silk thread to it and leave it for another day; then take care of it until it is healed.
If the inflammation is not nerve-related and you cannot insert the needle, or it is not fixed in that joint, then you should pay attention to this type of inflammation being cured with medicines, and so it is healed both ways as it is recommended in the division.
And if you wish to dissect it, open the wound of the malady and take fine, sharp spatulas according to this form: with precision. And if it becomes hardened and contracted and is entangled in that wound, then distil from your time into the main part of the sore with a sharp tool, or a hot iron or a salt bath, and close the wound within the next day.
Then repeat the operation on that part until everything that is infected is removed, otherwise a bad fistula will form in the wound, so when you leave it, take care at the beginning of the infection until it heals.
Then repeat your operation on that part until it heals.
The outflow of lachrymal tissue, if it is noticed in the nose causing great distress, should be stopped at once; incise from one side to another, but do not close off the incision so as to prevent the flow of tears.
And then distill the lachrymal secretions from the main tear duct, making sure to clean it until it is healed.
**Chapter XVII**
On the incision of abscesses and on what is born from attached flesh in the nose.
Sometimes in the eyes of certain people, there is born sick flesh, which is so swollen that it covers the pupil, or moves very close to or against the eyelids, and strongly pulls them from side to side, until they are assembled together like a battlement.
The surgical procedure is such that the patient holds their breath; then open the wound on that part and gather all the flesh with pincers or forceps; then cut the flesh starting from the edge until everything is finished with the knife, and be careful not to damage the wound during your operation.
And your incision should be such that you incise those or remove the debris we have extracted in the incision of the thumb, or use small forceps to gather them carefully according to the shape they take as described in this chapter.
So when your incision is complete and all that flesh is removed, fill the wound with finely chopped salt or sprinkle it with powder made from a corrosive medicine, and cover the wound with clean cloth until it is assuredly free of infection.
And if any cause of infection or severe pain occurs and you suspect a serious infection, leave the wound open and treat that infection with what works for that particular infection, and then repeat the operation until it is healed, making adjustments to the flesh around the wound as necessary from this specific case.
However, you should be aware that any cure for this acute pain, whether by natural or accidental means, must be performed with caution, and you should not place your hand on either of these operations until you see that the affected member is sufficiently healed from that operation.
**Chapter XVIII**
**On the Collection of Knowledge in Illness.**
Knowledge comes in various forms, some of which are stubborn and resistant to treatment, preventing any immediate action against them. The patient must endure the illness for many days until it becomes manageable.
Therefore, it is essential at the outset to consider whether the illness in which knowledge resides is severe and lacks any other accompanying ailments that indicate knowledge. In such a case, you should gather that knowledge.
And tell the patient to hold their head in their hands, and suspend those veins with a pin or two according to your discretion; and let that pin have a delicate double prong in this manner:
or two pins gradually in the body according to this form:
And then gently squeeze those veins with subtle force, allowing the blood to flow out slowly, until you see those veins empty of blood and well-turned.
And be careful not to hurt the patient at the edges of the incision; and if your operation is in the morning facing the sun, hold your hand firmly on the operation so that you only pierce those veins.
And when you have finished, pour pure vinegar or rosemary water over the wound to aid in healing and to prevent any corrosion from the blood.
If it is not possible to collect everything in that time, then apply a plaster to it which eases the pain, and leave it for a few days until the pain subsides and the risk of infection has passed.
And then repeat the process according to the specific symptoms, until complete healing is achieved.
And this is the method of the forceps:
Chapter XIX.
On the reduction of swelling in the nose.
When treating swelling with cautery or sharp medicine, as described in the previous narrative, and it persists and is not healed, do not apply any treatment to it, but rather make incisions over the abscess until its mature, and drain all the pus inside until the bone is exposed.
And so when the bone is exposed and shows signs of corruption or blackening, you cut it off with an instrument that has this shape.
It is called a sharp cap, and it should be made of iron, and the head should be rounded so that it can be pierced with a needle or with a subtle incision (just as in the following form).
And place that over the corrupt part of the bone, and then turn it between your fingers, and press your small hand little by little until you know that corruption is gone.
This should be done several times, and then restore the area with drying and astringent agents.
So if the area is consolidated and there is good flesh and the body has been separated from the sanity and romance for 40 days, and it is not renewed or infected and no accident occurs to it, then you know that it is healed.
And if it is not possible to reduce the fracture to its natural shape, you must do so according to this manner: and this is that you expose the bone according to the sharp tool or acute medicine, and once the bone is exposed, you take hold of it in this form.
The tip of the tool should be triangular, and the shaft of the tool should be first extended into the extremity in the same way as it curves.
Then place your hand over it, and that should be the lacrimal bone; extend your hand a little further, and turn your hand over so that it touches the entire bone, and you will feel the pain as it comes out from within when you apply your hand.
Therefore, you will restore the area with astringent medicines as it has been shown.
Therefore, when flesh and the area are hardened, the material that exuded to the outside returns to the site, thus it is considered lighter on the patient.
**Chapter XX**
**On the Reduction of Swelling**
When the swelling is at its peak and does not yield to external pressure or decrease, it is necessary to drain the patient, and then continue to apply heat and sucking for good drainage; then apply a liniment made of aloe, fennel, and mint over the swelling, and firmly compress it with a poultice.
And the method of the powders is that you take sheets of lion's fur, and each sheet is folded in four parts; make powder from these fur parts.
And then place them one on top of the other according to the amount of pressure required. Then apply strong pressure to these with a firm, tightly stretched cloth; repeat the suction with scarification; and remove the ventoses, leaving the pressure tightly applied for both day and night.
If, meanwhile, the ligament becomes softened, then ensure it remains very tight.
And then hold the ligament tightly, as we have said, both during the day and at night.
And if the hernia has already been reduced, that is well, otherwise, repeat the application of poultices with powder, compression, and ventoses until it heals.
Chapter XXI.
Regarding the incision of the prominence of the vaginal tunic.
When an incision is made in the vaginal tunic, and it becomes prominent and needs to be processed, the surgeon should approach it as follows: take a sharp scalpel and make an incision starting from the edge of the tunic towards the opening, forming a shape resembling a man. If you want to incise this, the operation on it is as we have explained, that you insert the needle at the root of the tunic from the inside out, and then place another needle through the double fold of the lacrimal part, causing the first needle to penetrate according to its position; then cut the location of the double fold and lift the portion of the tunic attached to the needle, rotating it.
Then remove the needle, placing it over the humid wool soaked in an alum solution and wait until the thread falls from the tunic.
Then treat the wound with something that will comfort it until the plague is healed.
And in some cases, from all parts, a circular cloth is wrapped around the entire wound, and then pierced with a thin spatula that reaches the base of the wound, allowing the albumin moisture to drain and the wound to descend and heal within a short time.
And then tighten it so that it heals properly.
**Chapter XXII.**
**On the Cure of Alconati.**
This illness, called alconati, is nothing but a healthy condition that occurs in the wound, resembling water flowing out and it is not that (illness).
The manner of working in this case is to cease the illness on the affected part and turn it to the right, then take hold of its head with both hands from two different sides and press there, until you see the health returning to the parts left behind, and make it not descend, and stop the flow of moisture, and the illness will thus be cured when he sees these causes.
And if it doesn't come down on its own, know that it is water.
If the descent is not prepared as we have said, then do as follows: close the wound between your hands and take a thin spatula and apply it to that part of the panniculus covering a small distance from the continuation of the conjunctiva with the tunica cornea in the crown (in the place desired), until the liquid is expelled.
Once the liquid is expelled, you then distill the warm water that you have mixed with honey or water in which fennel and honey have been boiled.
And then it is treated for the other causes as well, until it is healed.
Chapter XXII.
Regarding the treatment of water retention in the legs.
Having discussed the types of water retention and the appropriate treatment to be administered, according to the patient's condition.
Now, you must squeeze the patient's thighs together on a cushion, and bind their legs tightly.
And then place your left hand near the patient's left eye, if the eye with water retention is the left one; or your right hand near their right eye, if it's the right eye.
And with your right hand, take hold of the eyelid if it's the left one; or with your left hand, if it's the right one.
Then, grip the edge of the eyelid close to the inner corner, for the thickness of the eyelid at the tear duct, and with your thumb and forefinger, pull the eyelid towards you and then away in a circular motion.
And then penetrate into the wound's albumen and feel that the maggots have already been driven out by sight.
And it should be measured the distance from the maggots' path to the pupil's center as the space between the pupil and the edge of the blackness, which is the cornea's tunic; for you will see that pupil through the clarity of the corneal tunic.
Then place the maggots within the area where there is water, and throw them down once, then another time upwards, and thus, when the water descends, you will see the patient's condition over which their sight was lost, and maggots in their wound.
Then rest for a moment; so if the water has descended, you will pause again before maggots are thrown out.
And when it is squeezed and does not descend, you extract the magnet with ease, turn your hand little by little, and dissolve a small amount of clear salt from gemstones in water and wash the swelling inside; then remove the swollen area or stop or wool soaked in rose oil and egg albumin and apply this to the swelling.
But it is not those of our time who now use such treatment with egg albumin.
And if you do not follow your magnet in the treatment of the swelling due to its hardness – which is one of the reasons why the swelling occurs in some men –, then understand that you must take the sponge, named alberid, whose form is as follows:
And so pierce that joint, and do not stop your hand in the track, and do not stop until you have made a subtle space for the magnet.
And then I insert the maggots as we have said.
And you must prepare the patient's sleeping area comfortably so that they sleep on their back in a dark room, and all movements are prohibited.
And consider the nature of this condition so that its nature is calm, and do not aggravate their head towards the right or left at all.
And dress the wound according to its disposition within three days.
Then return to that place in that dark manner and cast away the fearful sight, and consider some causes, and then return the dressing within the seventh day.
And do not cover this during the hour of treatments or sometimes soon after the infusion. Having observed that you suffer from this because the water can easily be absorbed through great and violent inflammation.
If an abscess forms suddenly and deeply, you should know that it opens up after about seven days, and at this point, you must apply a poultice to the affected area.
Then you should observe it closely and place your finger on the oral cavity through which it is exhaled for several days; this exists in the darkest months.
And gradually, you should be aware of that month's gradual increase and discuss its causes.
And know that in ancient times the student of vision is not exempt from making certain observations, and you should be decisive about the operation.
And we have already reached some of those who are in the art, and one says to make fire in the air with a perforated magic stone through which water is sucked out.
Although it may seem strange to us in our land, nor is it mentioned perfectly in any of the ancient books, and it is possible that this is a novelty.
And these are the forms of the spices of magic for those who know nothing about them:
They are made of iron or steel specifically, and their ends have this triangular subtlety, the sharp end thus being similar in shape.
Chapter XXIV.
Regarding the healing of flesh, nothing in the nose.
When there are diverse tissues in the nose, some caused by a growth of hair or polyps on the feet, this illness is called polyps because it resembles those feet represented. And it is flesh cancerous, pale, of thin color; and it is this flesh that is leon-colored, not of thin color.
Therefore, in the case of this lion-colored flesh that is neither fraudulent nor cancerous, you must do the following: stop the illness between your fingers, place it in the sun, and cut off the nose of the tumor in those meats. Then, remove that from the external parts, and carefully separate what you have understood from the subtle process carried out in one part, while knowing that all the flesh has been held together; if there is any cause remaining from which the abscission is possible, then use a delicate instrument to facilitate this at will, without any difficulty. If the swelling is hot and painful, treat it with caution, apply heat to what covers it; or if it is a malignant abscess, cut and cauterize the entry that has become infected and empty all cavities.
Then, with your fingers, open the nose properly; insert the incision tool carefully and use either water or salt. If the nose is blocked and you feel moisture in the palate, then know that it has already healed.
If the moisture does not penetrate deeply as it should, then know that inside there is flesh filled with pus, surrounding bones in the nose to which an incision has not yet been made.
So, you must insert the tool deeply into it where there is any stiffness, and move it gently in and out, and between each nostril, use as much force as necessary or as little as possible, and direct the patient's pain and insert one end of the instrument into the nose because of a cut or other cause that allows it.
And once this is done, it should be applied so that its scent reaches the nasal canals and settles on the forehead, for the sights of children in schools, which are considered pleasant to those who wish to do so, are a light cause for this action.
Then grasp both ends of the bandage, one end emerging from the nose and the other wrapping around it, and apply pressure to the flesh with the fingers that are on the bandage, and do this until you know that the flesh is pressed against the bandage.
Then remove the bandage, place a clean compress over the nose, and apply this for three days or more until the salve has corroded all that is broken in the flesh.
Finally, at the end of the treatment, insert a platinum tube in the nose for several days until it is healed.
If there is an ending of cure that exhausts, use it.
And this is the form of the purging instrument that distills oils and medicines from plants:
And make it of silver or brass, which is similar to a small lamp with a small opening, and the inside appears like a cavity.
And if you wish, make a small, closed tube like a cane, and the tip of the instrument for purging is flat, open; it has a handle at the rear end, which you hold when you suck in oil or water from the juices and suction causes.
Chapter 25.
They grow from the ends of the nose.
Sometimes veins are seen at the ends of the nose, and they become enlarged and prominent over some days, which is a sign to be observed regarding them.
And for this, you should pay attention to the beginning of the appearance of it, and eradicate all of that. Then apply over the area a cautery or medicine that is appropriate for its location.
If its inspection takes time and it becomes enlarged, consider if it is tender, hard, of a dark color, and has little sensation; then do not touch it with a sharp instrument, for veins that are thus cut often bring great evil to him on whom they fall.
And if the abscess is of a severe nature and not of a dark color, sometimes incision is possible in all parts, then drain the pus and cut through that with caution, treating the area with something that will dry it out until it heals.
Chapter XXVI.
On the suture of the nose, lips, and earlobe when the continuity is broken due to disease or something similar.
You should know that when there is an accident causing continuity to break in one of these cartilages, it rarely requires surgery except for certain people.
Therefore, in the case that any of these causes presents itself, judge if it is a fresh wound with pus, and then adjust both sides of the wound with sutures, and take care of it until it heals.
And if the openings of the solution for continuity are already separated and each one is made healthy, then you must extract each part from its wound until it heals. Then adjust both openings with sutures and strengthen them; sprinkle dragon's blood and trissat on them, and place a piece of fine plaster or some other consolidative dressing over the powder, leave it for two or three days, then remove that and replace the plaster and leave it until the tissues are completely healed.
The technique for the suture is to add the solution for continuity either with needles as we have recommended in the suture of the abdomen, or add the solution of continuity with thread as you know how to do.
Chapter XXVII.
To extract those causes that come in both cheeks within the parts inside.
You often see these growths in many people within the parts inside their cheeks; some are hard like errant grass roots, and others are smaller and some are larger.
Therefore, he removes the cheeks and openings of those hard growths from every part, and then fills the space with a clean cloth while the wound is still fresh, and washes it with vinegar and treats the area with water that has been distilled, until it heals.
**Chapter XXVIII.**
On the removal of the flesh adhering to the gums.
For the growths that are seen over the adhering gum tissue, which the ancients called albus, he suspends them with hooks or holds them with forceps and cuts off what is necessary, allowing the healthy blood to flow and heal.
And then apply over the area a sage or other astringent and drying powder.
And if that flesh returns, incise it secondly, and cauterize it, for the cautery will not return.
**Chapter XXIX.**
On the reason for toothache.
When, on the surface of the teeth within and without, as well as between the gums, there are hard, rough, sharp edges, some broken off and stained black, and these cause pain or itching in the gums, the teeth become loose.
And therefore, you should open up the space between your teeth, hold the head in a certain position, and extract the teeth with rough edges, which cause similar pain and discomfort as long as they are not properly cleaned. And this causes blackness, acidity, and other issues until they are cleansed.
Therefore, if there remains something in the beginning of the reasoning, well and good; otherwise, you will repeat the reasoning about those things on the other days and the second and third until it comes to the last statement in what you want.
And you know that teeth require various types and shapes of cutting tools according to how they are prepared for your operation. And for this reason, the knife with which the tooth is removed from within is different from the knife used to shave between teeth according to other forms, and these shapes of knives should be prepared as you will see shortly:
Chapter XXX.
Eradication of teeth.
Understand that you cure the tooth from its pain with all care and take your time in the complete eradication of it, because there is no reason to replace it after its extraction, as it is a sublime substance whose excuse lies in the eradication of it.
When the disease is compelled to extract a tooth that causes pain, you must be certain which tooth is painful, as the pain may mislead you to believe it comes from a healthy tooth, and you extract the sick one; but the pain does not cease until the diseased and painful tooth has been extracted, for we have seen this through the operations of barbers.
Therefore, when you must be certain which tooth is painful, and you know it well, you will see that you sacrifice in the shape of the tooth with a spatula in which there is some virtue; until it is completely dissolved from the gums, and then use your fingers or fine pliers to extract it little by little until it comes out.
Then use a strong tool with large teeth for good cutting or extraction; hold the patient's head between your hands that they do not move, and treat the tooth straight to avoid breaking it or causing greater pain to the patient.
And therefore, if it is not forgotten, take one of those instruments, place it here in every part with ease and effort remove it as it was done at the beginning.
If the tooth is broken or decayed, you should gather a piece of cloth from that trauma and stretch it tightly at the end of a thin wire so that it does not break in the hour of your constriction over those areas where you hold them.
And be sure to perform the scarification carefully in all parts of the gums and watch closely so that you do not break or tear it further, then return to the patient to assess the malice that is greater than the first pain of it.
And be careful not to do what some ignorant barbers do in their hasty and reckless attempts at removal; for they do not administer what we have recommended; because many times, they cause great pain in men, which is much more difficult than breaking a tooth or extracting certain bones from the jaw, as we have witnessed on numerous occasions.
And then proceed with the eradication of it, wash your mouth with vinegar or mix it with salt.
If there are frequent discharge of pus from the wound, and as it oozes, you should scrape off some amount of crust and wash over the wound, and if that crust does not come off, cauterize.
The shape of the forceps should be delicate, as they are used to extract teeth, with a long and thin tip, a short handle, and a thick base, so that they do not bend when performing such tasks.
And similarly, when using pliers with thick handles, they should be straight when you first open them, so that their short ends are not bent.
These are pliers made of Indian steel with right-angled ends, and on the ends of those pliers are teeth that interlock with each other and open by a strong downward pressure, and sometimes the ends of those pliers have the shape of the beak of a bird known as a woodlark, which is smooth, and they are of great strength.
Chapter .xxxi.
On the eradication of teeth and the extraction of broken bones from the jaw.
When you need to eradicate a tooth that is impacted due to any cause, you should place your hand over the area with a border for one or two days until the location is softened; then insert pliers or tongs whose ends are assembled in the shape of a hawk's beak, called a ciconia or guanta.
The ends of them should be done inside with a file or chisel.
And if you do not obey these instructions with the pliers or tongs, then you should cave in on the root and uncover all the flesh and insert the instrument called a small lever, whose shape is this:
And take a thin but strong thread, small in diameter, so that it is not easily broken.
So if the treatment is forgotten, it is useless; otherwise, help me with these other instruments, of which these are the shapes: the shape of the first instrument has a triangular end with some thickness.
The shape of the second instrument is triangular with a very fine tip.
And now, with this instrument, having two ramps, the shape should be as follows: and other instruments used for dental extraction; promptly is done with this instrument resembling a large claw, and the shape is:
with a triangular tip either bent or straight, of some thickness, not so smooth as to be easily broken.
And you should know that the instruments for moving teeth are similar to other instruments.
The skilled and subtle artisan, through their own experience and understanding of the art, discovers what works best for each patient, according to the nature of the operation and the various ailments; for there are ailments that the ancients neither treated nor ceased with their specific instruments, due to their diverse forms.
If it is about the mandible bone or any other bones in the mouth that are broken, then apply weight to their healing in their proper place using the instruments and forceps we have mentioned for the removal of teeth, and aid you with the handling of which this part has the shape.
And in any case, slowly and carefully, tighten or hold it with the mouth so that nothing leaks out until all the bones are fully healed; then restore the area with suitable medicines.
If there is a small hole in the bone, clean it thoroughly of any debris and treat it until it heals.
**Capitol XXXII**
On the care of teeth that are prominent among others.
When teeth are prominent in a way that deviates from their natural shape, especially in women and particularly the most delicate ones; then consider: if it is not possible to extract or clean the tooth, you must extract it; rather than attaching it to another tooth, you should incise it with this instrument, which resembles a pig's tusk, made of sharp Indian steel.
And your incision should be made over the tooth in several days due to the hardness of the tooth, and it should not touch any other teeth.
And if the prominent tooth is exposed to erosion, then file it with a steel file from India, which has this shape:
And it should be all of Indian steel and the edge precisely; and it should have small points as with needles, with which the tooth is filed little by little over several days easily, so that no other teeth are touched or damaged. And then cut along its length, and carefully remove it with some scissors.
If it is a tooth that is causing the pain and affecting the tongue, you must carefully file the edge of the affected portion to smooth it out, preventing the tongue from lacerating or the speech from becoming distorted.
Chapter XXXIII.
For the restoration of lost teeth, use gold or silver wire.
When teeth are affected by concusion and removal due to impact or breakage, and the patient cannot chew effectively, having tried strict medical treatments without success, then consider using gold rather than silver wire for binding them, as silver becomes brittle over time, while gold remains unchanged forever.
And the thread should be of such fineness and thickness according to the amount that can fit between the teeth; the form of the filling is to take the thread and wrap it twice around two healthy teeth, and then increase the winding of the thread in a spiral pattern between two damaged teeth, or if one or several, until the material reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. Then repeat the stitching within the opening from which you began, and tighten your hand with ease and wisdom, so as not to cause damage.
And the tightness that you apply, with which you wind the thread, should be such that it does not pull away from the teeth.
Then cut off the excess thread with forceps or scissors, and add it in places as needed with gestures, and wrap them around the healthy tooth and the damaged tooth, so that it does not cause injury to the tongue. And then carefully tie it up tightly with a rope as in Rome.
If it becomes loose or ruptures, tightly tie it or those parts with another thread in such a way at all times.
And this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the correction of two healthy teeth and two defective ones, just as you tie these together:
And when it is done so that a tooth or two returns to its place in each of their locations, they are grown back as we have recollected, and these remain intact.
And only good craftsmen and wise ones do this.
And sometimes certain causes are derived from the bones of cows, and they are made in the shape of teeth, placed at the location where the tooth is missing, tied as we have said, and remain and serve for a long time.
Chapter .xxxiv.
On the incision of the ligament which is found on the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament which sometimes prevents the tongue from moving, is either natural and inherent to man, or accidental and occurs due to a disease which has already become chronic.
And the operation on him is to open the mouth of the patient, making his jaw completely mobile; and then raise his tongue, and make an incision in that nerve ligament according to its extent so that the tongue can be freed from its restriction.
If there is any hardness or tension there, and this is due to the consolidation of disease, then you apply oil and cut it according to its extent so that you can incise the ligament and dissolve the knot.
And be careful not to cause a wound in the flesh, and do not tear the arterioles, causing pus to flow.
Then clean the wound with water or wine or washed water; and let the tongue rest; it is best for the patient to keep the tongue on one side each night, so that it does not adhere again.
If pus flows, apply a poultice of vinegar to the place; if the pain is sharp, cauterize the place with a hot iron, which is suitable for this. And then apply the cure for other causes, as long as they are healed.
Chapter XXXV.
On extraction of the ranula, remove the tongue.
Sometimes, certain events occur that cause the tongue to swell, resembling a small, tight ball, preventing it from performing its natural functions; indeed, its great swelling fills the mouth.
And the operation on it is to open the patient's mouth, facing them towards the light, and assessing the swelling.
And if you notice a hard, dark, or black lump that the patient cannot feel, do not touch it as it may be brittle.
And if it turns white and is moist, insert your finger into it, and scrape away the thin layer; entirely cut it off during your operation; and if a strong wind comes at that time, hold a cloth over it tightly, as it may burst.
Then return to your work after you have tried thoroughly and washed it with vinegar and salt; and tend to the other treatment for this until it is healed.
**Capitol .xxxvi.**
On the extraction of abscesses from two auricles and those that occur in the throat, as well as other abscesses.
When there is an inflammation in the throat, there are glands that become swollen, which protrude outside and are called "two auricles". If you treat them according to what has been said in the previous sections and they do not heal, consider whether the abscess is hard, of a dark color, with little sensation, and if it is not painful, then do not attempt to drain it with a knife.
And if it is of a dark color and the root is thick, do not attempt to drain it with a knife due to the risk of infection; instead, wait until it has matured, and either it will rupture on its own or you can carefully extract it.
And if it is of a white color, soft, and the root is thin, then that one must be carefully incised.
And the procedure for it is that you consider, in front of your operation, if the inflammation of the hernia has been calmed completely by rest or if it has decreased at all; then stop the pain from the sun, and keep his head low, open his mouth, and the servant takes between his fingers the tongue of the patient with a delicate instrument whose shape is as follows:
And it should be made of silver or bronze, and be subtle with a blade.
So when you press against the tongue and show the hernia to him, and you see its true state, then take pliers and hold it in place, and pull it outside as much as possible. Another thing that pulls some cause from the tunics, then cut with an instrument whose shape is as follows:
Another thing that pulls some cause from the tunics, then cut with an instrument whose shape is as follows: And it is similar to a pair of forceps, however, its extremities are curved, so the points of each of those are on the other side, very sharp, which is made of iron covered in leather.
If this instrument is not available to you, then take a sharp spatula whose shape is like this: and it should be sharp on one side, blunt on the other side.
And having cut one wound, cut the other according to this same manner of incision, and then close the incision with hot water.
If there is a flow of blood, apply water from the decoction of myrtle or mint leaves and similar to that of the causes of stricture while the flow of blood is restricted, and then treat it until it heals.
And in some cases, if other treatments fail or these two auricles, as they are called, become infected, you should incise them according to what you have observed and described in the incision of two wounds equally.
You have already treated a woman for a wound (apostema) located in her thigh, which tended to a dark color, with little sensation, had closed the opening in her thigh, and the woman was breathing heavily, had forbidden herself from eating and drinking water, and was on the brink of death if more time passed, even one or two days.
And the wound (apostema) had already pus so much that it had created two openings through which they (the pus) were draining.
So I should listen to the patient first and then place them in a comfortable position, remove the offending object, drain the pus from the wound, and then apply pressure to it. I should also clean the area around the wound, understand the source of the other injury, close the mouth, grasp the tongue, and keep the leg in that wound.
And then you remove a large part of it, and there would be little or no bleeding from it. Thus, the treatment for that woman is as follows: she begins to drink water immediately, and soon after consumes food. Therefore, you should not continually insert moist bandages into that ulcer for a long time, but rather succeed with another in its place, which will help it heal faster.
Therefore, you should apply heat and cauterize the ulcer, which will help in addition; and then walk around and do not touch it, for God will heal it from above.
This appears to be a heading or a reference to a specific section within the medical treatise, indicating "Chapter XXXVII." Without additional context or content following this heading, I cannot provide a translation for the rest of the text.
On incision of the huve, when it becomes ulcerated.
When catarrh affects the tonsils, and they are swollen and long, then it is called perpendicular; and if it is in the throat, thick and round, then it is named bubo.
If treatment is as described in the previous section, and your cure does not agree with the patient, and indeed, the inflammation has already subsided, then you must understand that you need to incise the added round mass; and if it is of considerable length, and is bloody, of dark color or not to the touch, then you must be wary of the incision, for there is fear of worsening the condition in such cases.
And when you observe that according to the manner I have described regarding its whiteness and length, the disease is dissipated and you press the tongue with an instrument that shapes it, and then place a new one, and pull it down and make an incision with either of two instruments called "two-melon cutters.
And be careful not to insert anything that is contrary to the natural order of its addition, for if you insert more of it, you will harm its function.
Then make the incision, using what we have recommended for the incision of two wounds, and treat it until it is healed.
If the patient was frightened by the incision, use cunning in the cauterization of it to calm their fears, and the manner of applying the cautery is with sharp water (i.e., using a hot iron or similar tool) and you should place the head of the patient on the table, then press the tongue with the instrument we have mentioned, take water as we said in the chapter on cauterization, make it boil until it becomes lively, and do not make it too thick or too thin, and fill the cavity of the instrument whose shape is like this.
The extremity of the cavity where the medicine is placed should be curved like a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the wound, then have the patient lie on their side so that saliva or mucus from their mouth does not fall due to the intrinsic nature of the medicine, preventing any harm to their throat.
And now apply your hand to the medicine, extract it from the uvula for the space of a moment until it becomes darkened and soothed by the bite of the medicine.
And if you wish, take hold and wrap that around the end of the finger, immerse the cloth in the medicine, insert the finger into the cloth in a tube until the cloth adheres to the finger, and do this as many times as necessary so that you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the wound, then let it dry so that it falls off after three or four days.
And if you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it, and then, after cauterization with cloth soaked in the medicine around the wound, rinse it with water mixed with the medicine, clean it externally with embrocation, and apply healing poultices until it is cured.
This specific method of treatment is much safer than incision and free from fear.
Some times the uvula is cured with something that is finer than cautery and incision, because it is treated by sublimation in this manner: take calament, hyssop, origan, rue, scigated arabic, chamomile, bruis and similar herbs, and combine all those causes, or some of them, into a single mixture, and submerge them in wine; let them bubble; and the wave should be properly struck with a hammer, and there should be a trap at the middle part of the wave on which an instrument made of iron or copper is placed according to this manner; it should be done with silver or copper.
And then insert the extremity into the patient's mouth so that the steam rises to the uvula and over it, until the uvula is completely obscured.
Then repeat this process on the affected areas until they are dry, and be careful not to perform this treatment during the acute phase of an abscess, as it could exacerbate the abscess, and you should only consider this method if the doctor has diagnosed an abscess.
If you do not have this instrument at hand, take a cane and make a point at the end of it with a hot stone, so that the mouth of the hernia is sealed, because the point of the hot stone prevents the vapour from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter XXXVIII.
On the removal of thorns and other substances adhering to the skin, and from other causes.
You may observe substances adhering to the skin, or thorns in the flesh, or any other cause.
Then you should extract what is apparent from these [substances], which the eye can see, after pressing the tongue against the instrument in front of the light, so that you can clearly see what is in the mouth.
And for what is hidden from your sight in the gullet, be careful to make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, because the strong cause annexed to the gullet will be forgotten through vomiting; or let them swallow a piece of nap or chopped lettuce or a bite of dry bread; or take a piece of dried seaweed lion's tooth, bind it tightly with wool, and make the patient swallow it, for when it reaches the place where there are thorns and is extracted, it will be forgotten. And you can take an eel and bind it with wool, place it on the table and extract it carefully; or take a leek and carefully peel it and extract its inside.
If these causes are not forgotten, then use a lead instrument in the following way:
And it should be sharp and pointed, with a small diameter, and at the end of it, there is a concave part that you will insert into his mouth easily.
And raise the patient's head, and be careful to touch their neck bone, so that he understands what causes him pain, whether it is from the bone or the spine, or whatever the doctor places his hand on.
However, if the patient has more severe illness that infiltrates deeply, along with its cause, and pushes down below, then he places his hand on the instrument onto it, according to the amount prepared for him until it is forgotten.
Chapter .xxxix. (Note: The number xxxix represents the chapter number, not a translation.)
On extraction of the sanguisuga (leech) attached to the neck.
When treating with leeches as described above, regarding the neck of the patient under the sun, consider that you have removed their tongue from them with the instrument we recommended.
Therefore, if you examine the blood flow, extract that small or subtly moving clot appropriately.
If it is not possible to extract the clot, then take a concave needle and insert it into the wound of the patient, and then place a heated wire in the concavity of the needle, and do this several times (as long as the blood flow stops and the clot is removed from the wound), and then apply pressure on the wound throughout the day to stop bleeding.
Then take a vessel filled with clean water, and use its mouth to wash the wound, and do not spill any of it; later, when the patient's condition improves, they can drink some water from it, as blood tends to absorb water quickly.
If what we have recommended is forgotten, then fumigate the patient with camphor or a similar substance using the instruments we have described for the suffocation of the uvula.
Do this, so it falls in place.
And another way of operating in suffocation of that is that you take a flame on which are ignited coals and the flame is covered with a cloth in the middle of which is an opening, and the instrument's tip is placed in that opening; then apply the suffocation from above; and have the patient hold their breath at the end of the tube, and close their mouth so that the suffocation is not escaped until you know that the suffocation has reached the blood, for the blood will fall.
And if he does not eat, you repeat the suffocation with motes again, prevent the patient from drinking, and make them eat salty and bitter foods, and do not let them drink water, and so it is necessary that this regimen be forgotten.
And this is the form of the instrument used to extract blood from the gullet when seen; it is similar to forceps as well, except that it has no curvature. which is placed in the throat, and its end resembles a falcon's beak, which is curved, for this reason, when we encounter any cause, it does not cease.
Chapter XL.
In which the entire discussion is about the perception of apostles and the division of their powers.
The apostles are special marks, of various kinds, according to the way they are remembered, each one in this book having its own distinctive mark.
And they differ in perforation and division from each other in two ways: one is for the specific kind of apostles themselves; and also for what we understand about their humidity.
And the second way is in the places where bodily events occur, for the apostle event occurring on the head is different from the apostle event occurring on the heel; and the apostle in the fleshy place is different from the apostle in the joint; and each one of them has its own operation.
And some spots appear which cover that they are not perforated but rather a maturation of the health in those or the completion of their purpose.
Other spots appear which reveal that they should be opened when crossed, and are not matured according to their purpose; also are there spots that are inclined towards the joints, where a spot appears near a joint, its nature is prolonged as long as you can perceive what is in the flow of its circuit, and strongly corrupt the ligaments or nerves of that joint, causing contraction of that member; or it's a spot near the principal member, and if you delay the perforation of it while it's matured, it will affect the principal member; or it's located near the anus, so perforate one that is not mature; and don't pierce it cruely, without completing its digestion, but rather the one close to the anus, so as not to allow its preon to escape and be elongated inside the parts of the anus, and create a fistula, or something done at the end of its term that isn't healed. But it's not known when the right time for perforating the spot (apostema) is, and thus it's when it's matured.
And you will know that healing has occurred when the pain ceases and fever abates, and there is a decrease in rigidity and pulse, and the acute aspect of the abscess, and other signs.
And know that you should recognize the formation of a cavity at the site of the abscess, and also from the healing of the prominence.
The cavity often occurs due to the hardness of the flesh or body, if the abscesses are in the thighs or feet, and at the sites of stitches, of the nerves' cords, of the arteries; and, finally, in any similar places where there is no reflection; for in those that are reflected, use the perforation according to the member.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy place, then it is better to delay perforating it until the digestion of the matter within is confirmed as complete, as we have said; for if you perforate before that, it prolongs the course of the pus from the wound and increases both the pain and the swelling around it, and deepens its extent.
Some incisions may be made through the thickness of the flesh or body part as needed, or according to what the affected member requires.
And be aware that you should make small incisions, and in large incisions, make a deep and wide cut or sections according to the diversity of the size of the incisions.
And there are other incisions in which it is necessary for the wound to be concave and incised, when made thusly as if bread were being cut, so that it resembles those that occur in cases of abscesses and buboes.
And of those that are incised in sections with three angles; and of those where it is cut as if with the shape of a myrtle leaf, so too with the incisions of the ankle joints.
And of their kind where circular and lunar incisions are administered, resembling those mentioned above.
He who has no such issue with surface lesions, be aware that you must make a perforation, a shallow one, or as flat as possible.
And if the lesion is large and has already collected a lot of pus, you must make an incision and do not think to drain all the pus at once; after withdrawing a portion, return the massaged lesion within a day, and then withdraw a larger amount, and repeat this process in stages according to its severity until it is completely drained.
Especially if the patient is very young, a woman in labor, or an elderly person with weak spirits, for the animal spirit moves quickly to the exit of the pus, and these people often die from the disease, so you must operate on them.
Take great care with this chapter: when making incisions for these lesions, be sure to clean the infections and consider whether the lesion of the apostema is slight or if it is a deep section; then administer the appropriate remedies from either this or that school of medicine; and if the apostema is large, and the fissures of the incision are extensive, you must apply pressure on each part until healing occurs.
If, in the abscess, a portion of the tendon or its curve is separated, you should close it with a thin piece of cloth or thread from linen, just as when you sew on bandages or razors; keep it moist; and tighten that area after three days; then treat and cure it with ointments until it heals.
If a flow of blood occurs during your operation, you should administer clean water and vinegar, mix them in a cloth, and apply that to the area where the bleeding is occurring, holding it there as the blood flows.
If the bleeding persists, you should administer remedies and treatments as recommended in various parts of this book and at different sections.
If it is during winter, and the area of the abscess is full of nerves, you should wrap it in a cloth soaked in warm oil and apply that to the affected areas.
And if it is summer and the parts are fleshy, then cover that you place poultices soaked in water and oil or wine and oil, and all of this be changed every other day, as we have said, and then make sure you loosen the crust and clean that part and apply what suits it for its cure until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary for the knowledge of the cure of hernias universally, more according to the way of distinction that I have already said about every hernia in which manner it is a way of its cure by chapters individually.
Chapter .xl.
Of the section of hernias which come in the neck of the head.
In the neck of the head there are small hernias, which are of the nature of nodules containing layers that are formed in such a way; and they have their own names.
And from them come drops, and those contain moisture resembling lemon. And those that contain moisture resembling sweat, and resemble them; and those that are stone-like, hard.
And in the section of all, and in the extraction of those, there is no fear, when you make the extraction of those, it does not cause resistant pain.
And the operation in the section of those is that you expect those with instruments in the form of which you return them, which is called entromes, as long as you know that they contain.
For if what it contains is moisture, then you cut those as section according to length by cutting through the surface in this form:
And it begins in the section of the line B within the line G. Thus, as the moisture is evacuated, you scrape that through which that moisture passed, and do not leave from that any cause at all, for new troops seen return if there is no other cause.
Then immerse the affected area in hot Egyptian ointments, if present, or otherwise in water and salt; fill it with that remedy and leave it for another day, as it corrodes all that is broken off from that crust.
Then repeat the application of that area with Egyptian ointments according to need, as long as you trust that there is no other cause behind that crust; cure the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if an abscess forms with fatty knots, then you insert into it according to this form: I have a section without the shape of a cross, and cut between the two lips of the section and remove that from all its parts, and use your virtue to extract the tunic which contains it.
If your bowstring causes resistance, then do what I have first told you.
And similarly, perform the procedure for the abscessed section and cure it as I have told you; and if the section over the abscessed part is lighter, then it is because it has less pain and less moisture.
And sometimes there are these abscesses which are in the head on some men and women old ones, and you may discover the abscess thus with a hard, sour, white stone, which cannot be touched, and if anyone were to strike it, they would be afflicted by it.
In other instances of accidental apopless in the head, except for those that affect the children's crowns and require the removal of their auricles, the treatment for all these cases should be superficial sectioning.
And stop the incision of those in the lower part of their bodies to prevent the spread of disease to lower parts.
Then attend to those affected by it as appropriate for the cure.
Chapter .xlii. (This appears to be a chapter title, indicating the start of a new section in the medical treatise.)
On the sectioning of scrofula that occurs in the collar region. (Scrofula is a historical term for a form of tuberculosis affecting the lymph nodes, especially in the neck.)
Various instances of these apoplesses occur in the collar, armpits, and angles (likely referring to joints or areas prone to inflammation), and sometimes in other parts of the body.
And those that occur in the colon, and the motes that are generated between them, all scrofula of those proceeds from their own tunic, and likewise with the nodes and apoptyms of the head, as we have recollected.
And the types of these scrofula are motes; some are mineral deposits, and others contain humidity, and those that are malicious do not obey treatment.
Therefore, in that case where you perceive good disposition upon touching, of which the color is peculiar to that of the cord, and it is inferior at every part, not attached to the colon's nerves or veins, nor to any tendrils, and is thin, be sure to incise it along the dry superficial surface from its initial point in the body to the region beyond, remove it entirely from the body, extending the edges of the cord on both sides, or incise them if necessary; just as we have said regarding the nodes on the head, and extract that little by little.
And it requires greater caution that the vein or nerve not be incised.
And if the knife is not sharp enough to fit your hand for incising, or if it troubles the patient, and you make an incision where it is not necessary, then you prevent the flow of venom or infection with potash or other powders that stop the pus from accumulating and cause inflammation, leaving only the affected area until the swelling subsides and the plague becomes mollified and begins to heal. When the pus is drained.
Therefore, return to your operation until the task is completed.
And then examine the aforementioned small abscesses, inquiring if there is any connection to the others; if so, make incisions and clean them.
And if it concerns a large vein in the scrofula region, you must be careful not to puncture that scrofula from its root. Be careful not to break that thin, tightly curled thread, as you might accidentally pull it out by its root.
Then fill the wound with fresh, young wool that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment, and treat it accordingly.
If you puncture the scrofula completely, be careful to close both edges of the wound and quickly apply a poultice to prevent any excess pus from forming.
If you find that there is excessive pus due to the size of the scrofula, be sure to understand where to puncture its root, drain it, and then stitch it up and apply the treatment as described.
And for those scrofulas containing humidity, make an opening with a surface puncture at the place where the maturation of humors appears to you, and stop the puncture from which pus flows from below the body, as we have said.
And then make another puncture, using substances that you find and resemble those mentioned, so that it corrodes what is broken due to corruption. And when you see the plague already cleansed, then you apply a cure made from generative flesh substances within that it be healed.
Chapter .xliii. (This indicates the chapter number, not a translation.)
Regarding the section of the pilot (or membrane) of the abscess, consider the symptoms of the gulley (possibly referring to the stomach or intestinal area).
The ancient people described this section as the epilot, and they have never seen anyone in our land who can perform such a procedure.
And this is the inscription of the speech of those people.
One should have caution in men, knowing that the extraction of the epilot must be avoided, for by doing so, all the veins and the major parts of the malady are here.
In those who have aphthas in the mouth or throat or two ears, when the malady is not in the gut, one must avoid the section of the epilot to escape destruction which is caused by piercing.
Therefore, when we want to do this, incise the epilot below three circles of the epilhot circles, or four with a small section through the latitude in that which is between two circles for quantity, making the incision in the bone, not the cartilage, and this location is suitable for incision because it is devoid of flesh and the blood vessels of the organ are open.
And if the doctor is cautious, you must ensure that he extends the cord of the ligature to an inch, and then cut the cord until it reaches the channel, but avoid the vessels of blood if, for any reason, they are exposed.
And then, insert the scalpel as we have recommended; it signifies regarding the section of the channel for the flux that is of that nature, to that which is broken and for the removal of the voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
So when the hour is reached at which it is feared that perforation will occur, add two layers of the ligature to the wound, and with that one single action, it is the cartilage that is cut.
And then administer medications that promote the healing of the flesh until it is healed.
And Albucasis states that the essence of this discourse, which we have compiled, is to observe that some of these ulcers have already eaten into the flesh of the patient, and the malady has spread throughout the body, and the breath of life is cut off from the affected area through some respiration, so that the patient may be saved from death.
And for this reason, the ulcer should be left open until the evil of the malady is consumed; and the evil lasts for three days; and therefore you should command the ulcer to heal, and treat it until it is cured.
And what I have seen for myself is that a servant used a knife and sliced into the patient's chest, and incised a part of the lung, and I was called to cure it, and I saw the breath coming from the dead, and discovered the wound, and found the pus that had come from the ulcer.
Therefore, you must confess that you did not cut either a vein or a nerve, and the pain still persists from the illness, and treat it until the wound is healed by fire.
And do not hurry the servant, unless it is necessary in your voice, and after some days return to the improvement of their dispositions.
And now I say that in the section of the epiglot there is no fear.
Chapter .xliv.
Of the section regarding the aperture that occurs in the throat outside, which is called hernia of the throat.
This aperture, called hernia of the throat, is a great aperture according to the color of the body, and it occurs more in women.
And it has two manners, either natural or accidental.
And in the natural, it is not subject to healing.
And the accidental has two manners: one is similar to gouty nodes, and the other manner is akin to apoplexy caused by arterial compression, which should be feared. And one should not make assumptions about it with force, but only in those who ask for it. And you should examine it and investigate it as it is said, and if it appears similar to gouty nodes, and it is not suspended by any of the veins, then you cut it off as you would with a node, and extract that which causes it from the flesh and bursa; otherwise, you should scrutinize its entire being, and properly tend to the place in need of cure until it is healed.
Chapter .xlv.
On the section of nodal spices.
These nodes have many spices, and I have already described all the species of these in their division.
And it is important that I describe the difference between node and exitura with such care as to avoid doubt.
Therefore, it is said that an exitura (excretion) is heat and fever and violent pains within, but when the excess (superfluity) ceases, so does the fever, pain, and heat.
A node, however, is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it holds a specific function like a lion in the hunt.
And according to the color of the body, its beginning is like a cease and is made thus with vacuum, either greater or lesser, and they are according to two species, either fat or lean and contain humidity, and the colors of the humidity are spots, as I said in the division.
Therefore, when you come to the treatment of a hernia, you must expel that and inquire about the beginning of the stirment which is called an 'intrusion', according to how it comes into its form in the chapter which is proper to this.
This is also a method of inquiry for abscesses and all types of hernias; you take this stirment and intrude it into the place which is most humid that you find in the abscess, and you will turn your fingers there little by little until you know that this stirment has already penetrated the membrane.
And then you close your hand according to the measure of the greatness of the abscess, and you extract the intrusion and consider what has remained in the track of it.
And if the current humidity is forgotten, of any color it may be, then you incise it with a shallow cut as I have said in the other chapters.
And if there is no humidity present in the wound, then know that it is foul.
And dry it with a cut having the shape of a cross according to this form: As thus taught, raise the cut and extract all debris, with ease, from every part, and inspect the skin or sac, if possible, over it and draw out that pus from the nodule.
If it ruptures during the operation, extraction of that sac is not possible, and you repeat these actions as needed, and extract it by force only if it does not rupture for any reason.
If from any cause, whether little or much, the hernia returns, it should be treated according to custom.
And if you notice that any part of the hernia is protruding, complete the repair with a mixture of sharp, corrosive powders and tighten the hernia, placing a hot compress over the affected area and treating the other symptoms with appropriate remedies until it heals.
And if it is not large, you should cut the two lips of the hernia and treat it with something that incarnates (presumably a medicinal substance).
If the vein is pulsating against it, or not pulsating, cut and remove the area of skin that has become hardened (or "triangular" as interpreted from the text), applying a hot compress to stop the pain for two days or three until the swelling goes down, and then re-open what is left of the hernia.
Chapter .xlvi.
On the forms of tools necessary for incision and perforation.
Of those are the forms of the instruments, and there are three kinds: one is larger, another is medium, and another is smaller.
The form of the large instrument is this:
The form of the small instrument is this:
They should be made of iron, aluminum, and have smooth extremities, skillfully crafted to fit the apertures.
And these are the methods of experienced ones, and they are named as 'albered', and one of those is called 'berid'.
And it is of three kinds: one that is great, another that is middling, and a third that is slight.
The form of the experienced one, great:
The form of the experienced one, middling:
The form of the experienced one, slight:
So, these are intended for those with abscesses, ruptures, fistulas, and bumps, so that they are between the bones and from other causes.
And thus, they are made round, thick, and strong, with large needles sewn to them, and they are of ermine fur, or of iron, or of silver, and the best are when they are made of ermine fur.
And they prepare the experienced crows' feathers, which are used to open the fistulas in their concave cavities, reflecting light off those reflections.
And they are of three kinds, some being long, others middle-length, and others short, according to the width of the fistula and the tightness of the opening.
Shape of the experienced crow's feather:
Shape of the experienced middle-length crow's feather:
Shape of the experienced short crow's feather:
The shapes of the feathers are varied and special, consisting of simple curves, and they come in three types: large, few, and middle-length.
And of their body's humors, there are three kinds.
And of those humors, some have two curves, and there are three kinds.
And of their three curves, there are also three kinds.
And all these are necessary in their place.
Shape of a single curve very little, shape of it:
The shape of a large half-moon has two curves. The shape of a half-moon has two curves. The shape of a small half-moon has two curves.
The shape of a large half-moon has three curves.
The shape of a half-moon has three curves.
And these are the forms of the scalpels that are sharpened and cut through the nodules and abscesses, and they are of three kinds, namely large, medium, and small.
Large scalpel form:
Medium scalpel form:
Small scalpel form:
The ends of these have sharp blades, while the other ends are not sharp and are designed to make smooth cuts during the excision of nodules, avoiding damage to veins or nerves, and ensuring that the patient's illness improves and any pain associated with the excorination of the abscesses is minimal due to the careful adjustment required for such operations.
And these are the forms of knives, which are also of three kinds: large, medium, and small, as you can see.
They are made of glass and look like the rays of the sun, which also produce alcohol.
And on the opposite side, there is a hidden spot with a pointed instrument, which runs inside and outside the parts, as you wish, so too sometimes.
The forms of the instruments, which are hidden among these times for the piercing of the apertures and not perceived by the patients, are of three kinds: great, middle, and small. And these are the forms of those:
The forms of wounds through which the flow of blood is interrupted, and there are three kinds; great, middle, and small; the forms of them:
They are made of citrus skin, round or of some length, and they are thin.
And it is necessary that these forms of wounds be great, middle, and small, so that they interrupt the flow of blood quickly when needed, and are used when other remedies fail.
I do not advise using them to interrupt blood flow everywhere in the body, but only in fleshy parts, such as the scales on the legs and thighs, and the scales on the arms, and the nipples, and the abdomen, and the groins, and similar places like fleshy scales.
And sometimes those small instruments are made like scissors according to this form; through which the blood is interrupted when it is done by phlebotomy, or incision of a vein or artery.
And some times are made round according to this form:
Chapter XLVII.
On the care of the breasts of men which are assembled from women.
Some times the breasts of certain men are swollen due to the lack of sleep at the beginning, and when the breasts become swollen, they are assembled (or bound) by women, and then hung down.
And for those who desire this, remember to make an incision in the section mentioned below, between the lines of B and G, then carefully remove all grossness, fill the wound with a suitable medicinal ointment, adjust both lips of the wound with stitching, and cure it until it is healed.
If the nipple recedes from the lesions and becomes softened by its magnitude, as is customary for women, then it should be cut in two parts above its pus, forming two similar sections like a lunar figure, each containing the end of the other, so that the main line contains the smaller one according to this shape of the line .B. and .G. And then excise the cord that is between the two lips of the wound, stop the discharge, and apply what has been said about stitching and powders, what is necessary for treatment until it heals.
And if you do not fulfill the incision of what needs to be incised due to the restlessness of the illness and the flow of pus, then you should fill the wound with a corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes what is weak from the scar, and then treat it until it heals.
**Chapter .xlviii.** (Forty-eighth Chapter)
From the incision of abscesses that come from beneath the skin.
These abscesses that come from beneath the skin are due to the conditions of scrofula, hard swellings, which contain a pus that needs to be drained.
And as for those (abscesses) that contain humidity, these should be incised during the lunar cycle, according to this figure: from the line of G to the line of B. And after all the contents of the abscess have been drained, you should seal it with a bandage and examine it again the next day.
And keep the bandage intact and clean with a suitable ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of lymphatic nodules or scrofula, you should incise it in the same way as we have said regarding the incision of scrofula above.
If the plague spreads so as to cause putrefaction, then apply cauterization to it as we have previously mentioned.
**Capitol .xlix.** (Capitol 49)
On the incision of abscesses that occur through arrows or veins.
When an arrow breaks and the string (or cord) is tightened against it, abscesses can form at the site of impact. These abscesses are either due to direct damage from the arrow or through inflammation caused by the arrow's path, which can be recognized by a hissing sound felt in the affected area.
And the one that is due to veins will cause symptoms visible throughout the body.
And cutting into this abscess is risky, especially in areas like the armpits, joints, and neck, or other parts of the body; as it is often large, so its treatment requires great care, and that in extremities, or on the head, should be avoided.
Place a cloth soaked in lukewarm water on that which is affected by inflammation of the arches of the feet, cut it into a long strip; then soak the section with wine and apply the arch, and loosen the garments until it is exposed.
Then take the needle and make it penetrate between the two parts, and tighten the arch with a double thread at two points, which causes the patient to draw their legs due to the two arches being on the thighs.
Then apply the place between the two ligaments with a spatula until the pain disappears completely, and the abscess is dissolved.
Then apply treatment to the place where pus has formed until the ligaments fall, and cure it with a suitable poultice until it heals.
And if it is an abscess from a vein cut, then you must hold with your hand over the abscess as much as possible at the place where your finger has been, and insert the needle there, and make it penetrate; and be in that thread double until you draw out the other part, and tie the abscess with good ligature according to what I have said about the grape ligature of both parts at both extremities of the thread.
If you fear that the thread might break, insert the needle again at a different point along the entire aperture after making the first incision, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then dry the aperture in the middle part of it; wait until this is done, and then make an incision through the excess of the cord, and leave what is attached to it.
Then place the poultice you have soaked in vinegar and oil on it, and administer the treatment that is necessary to heal it.
Complete the treatment for the aperture that occurs due to nerve damage.
This is how apertures (apostemas) occur in the rear and veins, and they seem to be similar to those that occur in nerves when they are struck or due to excessive work, and by a similar process.
And the greatest part of it is applied to the parts of the assistants or the leg, or in any place where the joints are affected.
It is a severe apoplexy, resembling the color of another body, and it occurs in its most vital parts; when it is constricted by violence, a sensation of stupor seems to pervade the patient.
It is not an apoplexy that affects the front or back parts of the body; it leaves the patient paralyzed, affected throughout, and unable to move towards either side.
Therefore, regarding those who have it in their joints, it is not appropriate to use a sword, because their great strength will cause contraction.
One should make the tie with a spatula for those who have it in their head or forehead. If it is a minor abscess, cut it open with scissors and excise that part.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a weight, excise the infected part, and then close it with a stitch; dress the wound and care for it until it heals.
Chapter.
On the section of the abscess that occurs from the chill that affects the belly.
Even in some people, tumors appear in the bellies of these individuals and in other parts of their bodies, which are called funguals because they resemble fungi; their roots are subtle and the heads of those tumors are large; moreover, the edges of these tumors are convoluted and it is from these that growth is sought, and it is from these that a great magnitude is observed.
And you have already seen one, and in their belly there were two parts that functioned similarly, and there was no difference between those whites, of small size.
And the lips of those [parts] were turned inside out and split open, and moisture flowed from them constantly.
Therefore, you should cut them off and narrow the opening in the foot where 18 parts (or fingers) can fit, and for the other, 6 parts (or toes).
And the operation in cutting them involves considering whether the patient is humid, and the color of the flesh is white, moist, of fine texture; then you cut them with a broad knife, and apply a hot cautery over them while they are present, as you have to expel the section cut off with force; and if blood comes out, cauterize that place.
And if the patient is very afraid and uneasy, beware of incising with a sharp instrument; then take a fresh piece of lead and strengthen that bandage, in the manner we have said, and leave it for two days.
Then adjust the tightness of the lead string; so do not cease to tighten the large lead after its incision, until it is completely severed and falls off by itself.
If that part is of thick consistency, then there is no cause for fear or worry in its incision, especially when it is in the abdomen.
It is possible that you incise the mass of it, and then cauterize that so it does not return.
And then take care so that the disease is healed.
And be careful not to presume to incise that which is of a dark color, with little sensation, and carefully guarded by the leg, for that is absolute cancer.
And now let us recall certain things regarding this matter.
Chapter .lii.
On the cure of hernia (or 'eminence' as referred to in this text).
The hernia (eminence) of the navel is caused by various factors: either through fissures in the abdominal wall, from which protrudes the intestine or hernia, as is the case with other ruptures; or through a vein or arterial canal that flows from it, as is sometimes the case; or due to excessive pressure within it.
If it is due to abdominal wall fissures and the protrusion of the intestine or hernia, then the appearance of the hernia is similar to that of the body; and it causes intense pain, and often presents itself in various positions. And if it is for the discharge of the intestine, you observe the position of that mass we have described, with greater diversity, and as soon as you press on those ties, return; it is strongly attached to its place, and a great deal of force is required to introduce water and violent work.
If it is due to moisture, you will see a mass and it is not occult when you press with your hand, nor is it compressed or ruptured.
And if it is due to gangrene, then these symptoms will appear: the blackness of the ulcer declining.
If it is not due to flesh, then the ulcer is severe, thick and hard, and its size depends on the quantity.
If it is due to windiness, then the touch of that part will be hot.
And the operation on it is that you consider when the prominence of the navel is due to a hernia, or a vein, or because of gas; then you must be prohibited from treating it, for there is fear and danger as it is taught in the chapter where I have spoken about hernias by arteria and vena.
And if the prominence of the navel is due to an intestine or a hernia, you must then command the patient to take a deep breath and lie on their back; then make several attempts around the entire navel, and command them to keep it towards your hands over their chest, and then extend the extent of the hernia upwards beyond its original position using fingers with great care; and then tie it tightly around with a strong thread or catgut in a proper manner.
Then you should open the hernia's edge over the ligament and insert your finger into that indiction to feel the intestine; and if it is tight or held by the ligament, then extract it carefully and push the intestine back inside the abdomen.
And if you have found the affected area, take some oil and cut away the excess.
If it is contrary to your practice or vein, then go around that area and return to your operation; take two needles and insert them into those two strong threads, and through the circuit you have made around the abscess in a crosswise manner, insert two needles, which will penetrate; then tighten the abscess in four parts over the needles.
And if you prefer, leave the needles and let the location heal until the flesh has extended and fallen on its own; or cut away that part when it has subsided and is curable, and treat it with something that covers the wound until it heals.
And if the bulge of the navel is nothing but flesh or due to moisture, then cover as you have done with the abscess and remove the wound or moisture that you find there, and treat it with something that covers and strengthens the area.
Chapter .liii.
On the cure for cracks.
We have discussed, in the previous section, the types of cracks and how to treat them with medicine, which is inappropriate in cases where there is a risk of ulceration. We also spoke about cracks that arise from excessive strain and the caution required when treating them.
And the ancients said that sometimes cracks occur in places where it is possible to completely remove them, such as cracks in the breasts or in the groin and similar areas of the body, especially when they are just beginning to form.
However, if it is old and severe, it may not respond to treatment, as I have neither seen nor heard of anything that has been successful in such cases.
And the operation on it is as we have said, you must precede and remove the illness and purge of black choleteric several times, and then bleed it if a manifest repletion is found.
Then prepare the patient for the preparation in which the operation will take place, and make incisions on the sides which lead to it; and carefully examine from all parts with a good look to see that no cause of complication from the roots of the illness is left. And stop the bleeding, do not tear it off, press the places, and clean the abundant blood with your hand or an instrument suitable for that purpose from among the instruments available to you.
If it seems contrary to you to make a large incision of a vein or an artery, cauterize it until the flow of blood is stopped, and then take care of it with the other remedies as long as it heals.
Chapter .liv.
On the treatment of hydrops.
We have already discussed, in the previous section, the types of hydrops in water and the characteristics of each type, as well as their treatment with medicines.
And the one that is cured with iron is nothing but the species of inflammation alone, and it is not approached with iron to the species of tympanitis or the species of hydrops, because it is deadly.
And when you have already treated this species of tympanitis hydrops with medicines and do not confirm your treatment, consider this: if the disease has already been weakened in the patient or it is another malady other than hydrops, just as it is in those suffering from ailments in the lungs or abdomen and similar to these, then be careful not to treat them with iron, for fear of making things worse.
If you observe the patient's malady with abundant virtue, and it is nothing but hydropic only, neither old nor young, then the manner of operating on it is that you raise the malady between your hands, and apply yours to press the patient's belly, expel the water from the opening left by the foreskin, and then take a sharp sponge according to this form:
both parts should be sharp and long, with a pointed extremity as well as the sponge; however, make them of suitable length, one by one, so that in operating on that malady they do not enter the cavity, and you can handle it.
And consider whether the generation of hydropics is from the intestines, since you will find that by cutting away from the navel along the openings left by the foreskin in the right side of the patient, you remove a considerable amount of fluid.
If the generation of hydropics is due to a malady of the intestines, then make your incision on the left side of the navel for three days.
And if the generation of it is through impurities, then your section should be on the right side.
And be sure that your section is on the side where the malady wants to go, so that no excess fluid goes to that place.
Then thoroughly pierce the entire cord with the instrument, and insert your hand into that section, lifting it up between the cord and the sinew, and extract it; and if it is the size of a thumb or smaller.
And then pierce the sinew until the space reaches the desired location, which is filled with water. Then extract that, and insert an instrument whose form is as follows: It resembles a thin silver tube; it is made of silver or bronze or iron, and on the lower part of it there is a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes: two from one side and one from the other; and its end is inscribed according to the shape of the pen, thus:
And at the end of it, there is a ring, for when the instrument reaches the water, this will immediately lift itself over the instrument, thus evacuating a large amount of water at once; for if you evacuate less than required in that moment, the patient's condition may worsen due to the resolution of their animal spirit, or they might suffer from a heart attack as death draws near.
You should evacuate according to the capacity of the tube and according to your understanding of the patient's condition, based on the strength of their pulse and the goodness of the flow.
And after withdrawing the instrument, you should retain the water that is caused to be retained by the cord through which the hole on the top of the organ is reached; I advise you to perforate it according to that manner.
And then repeat the procedure on another day if the patient tolerates it, extract a small amount of water and do this for several days with caution, and beware of errors so as not to remove too much water.
If you are concerned about the disease and remove a large amount of water, then apply a poultice of sand and mud, lie in a bath, and expose yourself to the sun for a long time; treat it with drying medicines as long as it is cured.
And apply a cautery to the stomach, and the bowels, and withdraw the water as previously described in what has been said above.
Capital. V.
On the treatment of children who have not yet developed the ability to urinate through their own means.
Sometimes, some of the children are born with a hole in their mother's abdomen and the top of their mixture (amniotic sac) is not pierced (or it is too narrow or not in the right place).
Therefore, one should pay attention to the perforation of the sac as soon as the child is born with a delicate and moist discharge according to this form.
And then, in the opening, insert a subtle lead pin and tie it off, and do this for three days or four.
And as for urination, it should be done frequently and the urine should be returned (or retained).
And if the lead is not retained, it is possible that the urine which has overflowed onto the site will not heal this closure.
If that of which the pain is tight should be treated with a lead clavicle, as we have said, for too many days before it is amplified.
For those in whom the pain is not in its proper place, it is said, which causes those who are born with it to have difficulty urinating within, until they raise the testicle with their hand above the parts; and it is not due to generation, so that the sperm cannot reach the mother correctly, and it becomes a motley illness.
And the manner of the operation on him is that the illness is shifted onto his back, and then extend the head of the testicle with your left hand using vigorous extraction, and cut the head of the testicle from the place of the foreskin with a sharp knife, or whatever you do not make any incision, so that the middle part of him comes out resembling the head of the testicle and the pain falls into its proper place as it should.
And be careful in your operation to remove the flow of pus, for it may cause further complications; stop it from escaping and treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter LVI.
Of the albiter that occurs in the prepuce at the tip of the penis due to decay, corruption, and blackness, and the adhesion of the prepuce to the tip of the penis.
Various complications occur with this albiter on the penis, and it is characterized by the appearance of raw, exposed flesh.
And some are malignant, while others are not.
For the non-malignant ones, suspend them with a delicate operation and extract it entirely; then place your hand over that part, applying Egyptian pitch; and after that, cure it with a fine ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is malignant, of a dark color, you must cover it with cautery near its incision and the drain of it.
If the abscess is on the prepuce of an uncircumcised penis, and one part of the abscess is inside the prepuce while the other part is outside, then you must treat the abscess that is inside first until it heals; at the same time, you should also cure the external part, for if you only cure the internal part, the prepuce may still be torn.
And similarly, accidents occur in the genitals and prepuce, blackening and damaging them; therefore, you must remove everything that is already discolored and corrupt or about to become corrupt; and then apply over it a mixture made of flour from millet and crushed nuts and seeds.
And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
If it is necessary for blood to flow, then apply cauterization monthly according to this form:
A young cauterization is beneficial for two purposes: it aids in the flow of blood and in cleaning the wound when it becomes corrupted.
And if the head of the foreskin is corrupted and completely destroyed in an instant, then insert a platinum tube into the inner part of the foreskin so that the illness urinates through that passage.
In the adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis (and this adhesion occurs only in those whose foreskin is its own, and circumcision is not required on them; and when adhesion occurs due to an illness or a sore), then remove it with an obtuse spatula until the glue-like substance is dissolved and the head of the penis is completely freed.
And if it is difficult to discern them precisely, remember that you extract some cause from the head of the foreskin and the prepuce, and thus it is because the prepuce, when thin, is strongly perforated by its thinness slightly.
Then separate the prepuce from the head of the penis with a delicate knife, which has already been soaked in water to prevent it from adhering again.
And then it is carefully cured with a sting stop to ensure that it is consolidated.
Chapter VII.
On the purification of children and the treatment of what happens to those who are circumcised.
Circumcision is not a solution for continuity among other diseases; however, when it is of our own doing and done by our own will, and performed on children, it is necessary that we assign to this better operation and way a lighter loss for health.
Therefore, it is said that the ancients did not perform circumcision on any of their free parts, as they do not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired knowledge through experience, which is why I have made most of the artisans and barbers use circumcision and purification with a new knife and fire; they use glue for binding and a fingernail for incision.
And you have already tried all these methods and do not find a better way of purification than using scissors, glue, or a fingernail, because cutting the cord above leads to more pain and danger, as the two layers of the foreskin are separated, leaving the tonic layer below, requiring another incision and ensuring certain pain. And the purification performed by cauterization, which is digital, and is used by barbers, does not ensure a safe incision of the end of the male member, as it easily enters the wound.
In the operation, a strange uncleanness often disobeys and corrupts your work. And the bowels of a child are short in nature, and often move in such a way that it requires no treatment, and I have seen this myself.
Regarding the treatment that is performed using forks and ties made of silk, my experience has shown me that the procedure is flawless because the forks are of a suitable size, thus preserving the sensitivity both above and below; and therefore when you apply your hand with forks that are appropriately sized, you make an incision according to a measurement in one moment; and compression of the silk tie contains the bowels from all directions, which dispels any error at all.
And the first method of operation is that you must keep the child as calm as possible, especially if it is a small one; do not do anything but tie the silk around the hernia, and leave it for another day.
And then apply that relief in every possible way that your skill allows, according to what it understands. And then prepare everything in advance, ensuring you are not hesitant; hide the scissors in your hand or leave your foot uncovered so that neither the child nor anyone else sees those or any other tools.
Then insert your hand into the instrument and blow into the canal, pulling it until the head of the instrument is in place, and clean that which has been added to it from impurity.
The form of the forceps for delivery, this is the form:
Some ends should not be sharp and others should be, so that it is not the root of the thumb, and both points have the same length as two handles.
But the error in delivery is when they so forcefully escape the inherent tension that they break either entirely or partially, and this requires incision.
So consider that you should extend the one from your hand towards the affected area in front of the place of incision and inscribe it according to equality.
And if you cannot hold it with your hand, then extract it with forceps and incise that.
If three days have passed and it appears that the swelling from the inflamed incision is subsiding, then leave it until the incision heals cauterized, gently extract the foreign body and incise it according to what you are prepared for.
And observe the head of the hernia, for it will not allow itself to be treated.
And therefore cure that part which the plague has solidified with powders, which we have discussed in the treatment of powders.
And if it is cut from the cord within measure and obeys to the parts of its function, it will not notice itself.
And apply cure to that part which we have said should be healed.
Chapter .lviii.
On the cure of urine retention in the bladder.
Urine retention in the bladder is caused by swelling due to stone or sand, or impaction or congestion, and resembles those mentioned in the previous sections of treatment in terms of method.
And if it is not dissolved as we have said, then the cause of the illness should be addressed with extraction using a tool called a syringe, which has this form: It should be made of silver and very thin, like a lion's claw, with a fine needle-like canal similar to a quill and half as long, over which is a thin cane at the tip.
And the method of urination is as follows: take the urethra folded and tied at the end with a thread or string for good sealing; insert the tip of the urethra into the meatus, beyond the foreskin, and cut it if any cause from the string is superfluous; then insert it forcibly into the catheter and immediately stretch the foreskin back and apply alum to it.
And apply cesarean surgery on the patient, and incise the bladder of the patient and the hernia with oil mixed with herbs, olive oil and water.
Then insert the catheter with ease until it reaches the root of the hernia; and fold the hernia upwards at the opening of the incision; and push the catheter from within; and push it until it reaches the bladder, and when the hernia is brought to its origin, let the patient be relieved from the pain, and do not perform this operation according to this order, but rather enter into the part where there is tortuosity.
And then slowly extend the urethra at the tip, little by little, as the urine dries out the passageway.
Then extract that one for the treatment of urine, and use a catheter, do not stop doing this until the bladder is emptied and the patient's discomfort relieved.
Chapter LIX.
On the quality of bladder cleansing with clysters and similar instruments that are suitable for this purpose.
When a ulceration, abscess, or congestion occurs in the bladder, and you wish to drain waters and medicines from it, then use an instrument called a clyster, and this is how it is done:
But if its origin is at the end of it, it is blocked and closed. And there are three actions: two from one side, thus as often.
In the beginning, there is a congestion, which is what is being pushed, and according to the quantity that presses on it, it adds up, as long as some cause throws off the humors, it is expelled, and when they are expelled, they are thrown back, and when they come out long, according to what causes them to be blocked, a clamp is used, similar to what happens with naphtha in naval battles.
So, to prevent humors in the bladder, insert the end of the clamp into the humor and throw it away from the body, for the humor is thrown into the cavity of the clamp.
And then insert the end of the clamp into the vein as we have recommended in the surgery; and push the humor away from what you are pushing, for that humor goes to the bladder soon enough, and the illness centers around that.
The shape of the delicate crystal through which the bladder is crystallized, and that shape is as follows:
Whether it is made of silver or lead, which the head resembles a small feather, and leave the cane inside the dressing.
Then take a bladder of motion, and place it in the humidity that you want to crystallize in the bladder, and then tie it between two with strong double ligature using a thread, and heat that humidity over fire.
And then insert the tip of the crystal into the urethra.
And then place your hand over the bladder with the humidity and stretch gently until the patient feels that humidity has fully entered the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder at hand, take a piece of cloth and make a circle from it; then perforate that circle throughout its roundness; and insert the thread firmly into those channels, turning them as needed; and add to the circle some material that will absorb humidity, so that you stop on whatever you want regarding humidity, odor, or water.
And then you place it in the instrument and make it thus as you have made the bladder, and express with your hand so that the moisture reaches the bladder.
Chapter LXX (60)
On the removal of stone.
We have already discussed the classification of kidney stones and their treatment with medications, as well as the distinction between stones formed in the kidneys and those formed in the bladder, and the signs of each.
And we have spoken of the stone that requires surgical intervention by hand, or sectioning.
And the stone formed in the bladder proper is the one that remains in the bladder.
And they recount that manifestation of disease and its concise explanation.
So it is said that the disease born in the bladder most often affects children; and among its signs, the urine expelled from the bladder resembles water in its clarity, appearing on the sand; the pain rubs against its organ, and sometimes it becomes swollen; and this is how it hurts their behind in spots due to these.
And the healing of children from that disease is easier for those who have reached 13 years old; and it is a difficult cure for the elderly. Among the young, it is more common due to what exists between them.
And of him whose stone is larger and whose cure is more difficult; and if it is small, it is the opposite of that one.
Therefore, to achieve the cure for this condition, we must begin by purifying the malady with herbs that extract all the opening in their intestines; for sometimes this opening prevents the entry of urine after its inspection.
Then, with the patient lying on their back, position them in a way that encourages the urine to flow down into the bladder, or sometimes it may leap from its place.
Then make use of the compresses you have prepared, and leave the patient's legs in those positions, so that the bladder is completely emptied into the parts below.
Then, remove the patient entirely from those things and extract all foreign objects.
Therefore, if you feel the urine in the space, then cut yourself into it with a knife.
And if you cannot grasp the entire condition with one hand, then cover it with oil, applying the tip of your left thumb, whether the patient is a child or an adult, and insert that into their rectum. And once the stone is located, insert your tip into it. And slowly convert that pressure into the neck of the bladder.
Then press on that part with your thumb, expelling the stone out of the area from which you removed it.
And command the assistant to press the bladder with their hand; and command another assistant to extend the legs with their right hand above the stones, and with their other hand to hold the tail of the bladder that is left below, in the area where the incision is made.
And then insert a spatula incidentally which is the shape of it: It divides into what is between the buttocks and the genitals, not in the middle place, but first on the side of the left thigh; and the incision is made above that bone, and it is said to be in the buttock, and a transverse cut is made, so that the outer cut is wide and inner narrow according to the quantity that can be extracted from the stone without making it too large, for strongly holding to the saying that the stone is in the buttock, one should make the incision, and this oversight negates its effectiveness.
And know that there is a stone with sharp angles and edges, making its extraction difficult because of this.
And from that, it is like a nut, round, and made of the hardest material.
Therefore, if it is that which has angles and edges, adjust it in the fissure.
And if it is not thus easily removed, cover your fingers over it or tighten your grip on it appropriately, the tip of which should be like a lime that you press onto the stone, and do not slip from it; or insert something delicate between them with a curved end.
If you cannot do that, then amplify the cut a little, and if you see a flow of blood, cut strongly with cauterized iron.
But if the stone is larger than one, at the beginning, push your finger into the bladder's opening and cut into it; then gently press a little inside; and similarly, make them seem as if they are more than two.
And if the stone is very large, then ignorance is that you cut it with a great section, because it causes two problems to the patient: either it stops (the flow of urine) or it promotes the discharge of continuous urine distillation, so that the area is not completely solidified.
May you administer an expulsion of it while it is still inside, or use a forceps in the fracture of it to extract that which is in pieces.
So when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe and dragon's blood, and bind it tightly. And place over that cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and water, to prevent the wound from closing too quickly.
Then return the patient to their bed, and do not loosen the bandages for three days.
And when you have loosened it, wash the area with water and oil, and then treat it with a mixture of honey and wormwood until it heals.
If, in the case of an abscess, cauterization and drainage are performed, and it resembles a frozen bladder, with urination prohibited (known as the ejection of urine), then insert the pointed instrument into the abscess and drain it, for if left untreated, it can cause corruption and putrefaction of the bladder and its contents.
And then wash the wound with wine, vinegar, and salt, and against all kinds of things that are beneficial for its healing until it is completely cured.
And during the entire healing process, ensure that you bind and adjust both the parts and apply the medicines that are placed on the affected area.
And if the stone is small and located in the middle of the urinary tract, causing urine flow to be blocked, treat it with what I recommended earlier to prevent obstruction, for numerous attempts at treatment through this method have been accused of causing injury; and once you have extracted it, take a sharp, curved instrument, which is the shape of this one:
of the triangular end, sharp, inserted into wood.
And then take a knife, and tie it to the stone, leaving the peg so that it does not return to the bladder.
And then insert the iron into the stone, piercing with ease until the drill reaches that stone. And twist the drill with your hand on that stone, slowly and carefully, piercing until you reach the other side, as urine will soon flow through.
And then press your hand over what is broken off from the stone of the starting point outside of the stone, as it is squeezed, and it is opened up with urine, and the illness is cured.
If this cure is not suitable for you for any reason, then leave a peg by the stone and another peg on top of the stone. And then you close over the wound on that flesh between two ligatures. And then you extract that one. And then you loosen the ligature, clean and dry the infected wound, which is made in the sore.
And it is not necessary to use a strong ligature on the wound, only to prevent its recurrence, and the other ligature above, for when the strong ligature is removed from the wound, the hernia returns to its place and the pain reappears.
And this is what you need to do when you remove the strong ligature above, that you lift up the hernia from below, or return it to its proper place, and the pain appears as we have said.
Chapter .lxi.
On the extraction of stones from women's kidneys.
Stones in women's kidneys are rarely formed.
If one does see a stone in any of those (parts), then the cure is difficult and is forbidden by many methods.
One of their weaknesses is that women who are strong in spirit often become weak in body.
And the second reason is that one does not find a woman who is so wise that she knows when to consult a physician, whether she is betrothed or married.
The third reason is that one does not find women who know this art well, especially when it comes to surgery.
And the fourth is that the place of the cut on the leg in women is more distant from the place of the leg, so a deep cut is required there, and it is a place of fear.
If it is necessary to do this, then make sure you get a skilled female midwife, and they are not easily found.
If you are lacking those, then seek out a skilled midwife with a sharp knife or present a well-experienced female matron in the ways of women's bodies, or a woman who has made a name for herself in this art.
So do as presented, and command her to do everything you direct, from inquiry about the leg to its beginning; this is because it observes if the woman is a virgin, so make sure she swears on it in the presence of you and desires to undergo the procedure.
Therefore, if you find it, cut it and leave its tip, then command him to insert it into that.
If it is not sharp, then command the midwife to insert her finger into the patient's urethra and feel around the bladder, as she places her left hand on the vesica, and squeeze it gently.
Therefore, if you find it, carefully extract it from the orifice of the bladder to the sides, using your fingers with gentle strength so as not to cause further harm.
And then insert your finger at the correct position of the bladder's orifice, from the side where the pain is located, and press on that area, ensuring your finger does not push against the urinary flow.
And the amount of traction should be slight at first; then insert your finger into that section and if you feel the urinary flow, adjust the position according to how much urine is passing through it.
And you should know that the properties of pepper are varied: for some are small and sharp, others large and bitter, some long and round, and they have spikes.
Therefore, you should know how many kinds of spices there are according to what you mean when you speak about this, so that you can understand it fully.
And if you wish to stop bleeding from a wound, apply vinegar mixed with salt three times and let it work for an hour until the blood stops, then return to your operation to remove the pepper.
Prepare also for yourself the tools mentioned in the extraction of pepper from men, so that you are aided by them in your operation.
And if you wish to stop bleeding from a wound and know that the expulsion of the pepper is from the hole that is carved, then place powder over the area and immediately apply a poultice and binding, and do not repeat this; leave the pepper and do not extract it, for the strong root of the disease will die. And then apply the remedy.
Therefore, when the acute phase of the inflammation has passed, after several days, the location may be cleaned, and you return to your operation until the stone is removed.
Chapter LXII.
On the section about hernia removal.
A hernia inguinal is nothing but the accumulation of moisture in the white chest cavity, which leaves the opening of the genitalia containing the testicle, and it is called the chest.
And in some cases, it is within the natural sheath that prepares itself for the departure of the testicle, as if it were another testicle; and it is the opening of the genitalia between the white chest cavity that we have mentioned, which is not a hernia but a tortuosity.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness that occurs in the bones, for these are where this material is discharged, and sometimes it occurs due to a blow struck upon the bones.
And this humidity does not have any distinct color; its color either declines to citron or bloody red, or it is yellow or dark, fetid, or white and watery, and this is the most dangerous.
And the signs by which it is known that this water has accumulated are as follows: if it is in the white of the eye that we have spoken about, then the iris becomes red, declining a bit in length, and the pupil appears, because the humidity extends from every part.
And if the humidity is in the own eye, then the iris becomes red and leaves from the pupil, and thus one estimates that it is another eye.
And if moisture is between the joints of the fingers and the white cipha (tooth), then scratch from below.
And to determine the colour of the humidity, you should observe the colour of the humidity in the aperture where you have encountered a crusty deposit from which the form is preceded; and according to what you find in the trace of the deposit, judge what is within it.
Therefore, when we come to the treatment of it with iron, you should know that you command the patient to be flebotomized if it is possible for you, and empty the contents of it.
Then gently raise him on his back for any reason a little bit, and place a moist cloth beneath him.
Then place yourself on the left side of the patient, and command the attendant to follow the right side of him, extending his finger from one to two fingers' width at the joints of the fingers and at the opening of the anus, and to the beginning of the miracle of the belly.
And then carefully take a wide slice and cut through the cord of the testicles at the middle point between the scrotum and penis.
And make the second cut according to the same measurement from the line where you have divided the skin of the testicles, reaching the white bone completely.
And extract it, observe, and be careful so as not to pierce it; your incision should be as wide as necessary, and carefully examine the incision according to the amount you can do.
Then carefully pierce the white bone with a wide puncture and extract all the water.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with scissors, and extend the white bone to its parts; do not touch the cord of the testicles, and incise the white bone in that manner as best as you can. And incise it completely through or into the flesh, especially its thin surface, for if you do not carefully scrutinize the incision of him, there is a sure risk that the water will return.
But if, during the process of removing that from its natural place in your operation, you have completed the section of the circumcision, then return inside it and properly adjust both lips of the opening of the genitalia with sutures, and treat it just as you do with other wounds, so long as it heals.
And if you find that the intestine is corrupted by another illness, then know that you must tie the vessels that are above the suspenders, extract the intestinal mass, and treat it as we have said.
But if water is added in two instances, then know that both are hernias; therefore, incise that part as you have done with the other in a similar manner; and if it appears to be an operation to you, then perform it.
And then, you clean the wound and enter the sections with wool soaked in oil or olive oil; place another piece of wool that you have submerged in wine and oil, expanding it over both legs and the miracle of the belly; place it on folded drapes and powders, and bind them with a linen according to this form:
Then, take two sheets of linen and fill them with wool lint according to this form; bind the extremities where they are held by a towel or wool dampened with a liquid, and add them to the structure in the crotch of the trousers, one extremity taking up the entire back between the two, and the second extremity starting from the crotch to the opening of the buttocks, and two other extremities on each side leaving two others over the knees, and all the tightness is adjusted in the crotch of the trousers.
And in some cases, this hernia is treated artificially with cauterization instead of cutting; so you take a fine cut-wound cautery and incise at the root of the legs, and ignite it according to what we have recommended between which is discovered the white skin containing the water, and then you take cautery according to this form: It resembles Greek writing.
And then perforate that wound, and ignite it until all the moisture is expelled.
Then extend the wound with scissors, cut it with scissors, and burn it with a carefully ignited cautery; incise as best you can until you eliminate all of it; and be careful that the fire does not touch you.
And you should know that this operation is much safer and more distant from the flow of pus, and better than an operation with a section.
If it causes you difficulty to use cautery in the time of section or at the time of heat application, or if there is a flow of pus, then understand that you should cure what contradicts you by applying the treatment which is appropriate for it as said.
If the disease is severe and does not expect a second operation due to its horror, then perform an incision as recommended; and it is at this point that you must, through the signs we have mentioned about hernias, determine whether that hernia is watery.
Now you understand that you must sever the disease on a raised spot, then perforate the abscess at the lowest part of it with a spatula, and pause the incision according to the length of the body.
And it should be a wide opening so that all the water flows out.
Then place your hand over the area, press and release it, to let the water drain out. Then dress the wound until the plague is healed.
If there is any opposition to the discharge of water at that moment, you perforate it: this is not done unless the white pannus in the orifice of the wound causes opposition and prevents the discharge of water, so be sure to insert a needle or instrument with which the water from the cysts can be extracted, whose form is preceded; or adjust a small one according to the size of the wound.
And you know that water returns, and it is reabsorbed after a few months or around those times; and when it is added, it is perforated in the same manner as before, for the disease will also pass its days.
**Chapter LXIII**
**On the Section Regarding Carnous Hernia and Its Treatment.**
You know that in the section regarding this hernia, there is great fear of loss to perdition in one's major dispositions; so it seems to me that its dismissal and being saved by some better means is the best course.
And they should remember the operation for those and the specifications of the abscesses.
Therefore, it is said that the abscesses appear in the bodies where the veins are composed and this happens for various reasons: either by a sudden severe overflow which is discharged into the veins, or by impact.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and it does not cause pain in itself, but it is a serious abscess.
And very rare is the abscess that is hardened, of which the color is dark, and it does not hurt.
And sometimes it is caused by the pressure of the arteries, or by the inflation of those areas where the memory of the abscess is already perceived, or by the inflammation of veins.
It is known that what is caused by the inflammation of arteries is called the dispersion of the abscess when you feel it in your joints, and it should not be touched.
What is caused by the inflammation of veins should not be dispersed due to any cause; compression in those areas is advised.
And it is possible that on this particular case, a section is made and on the other meats as well; and you inscribe the seal of the geniuses, then place the foot over their openings, extract the one from the white of the egg, dilate the suspensory of the vessels, tie them, and inscribe the suspensory that you dilate, that is, from every part of the parts of the foot.
Therefore, if the foot is already consolidated with those meats, then you should extract the foot and inscribe it.
And if there is an adhesion due to any cause within the body or between the intestines, you must dissolve that entire adhesion and cut it with a round incision.
If the adhesion is caused by a growth of flesh at the site of the adhesion, behind it, you must then cut into everything that belongs to it, and extract it as we have said.
So when your operation is complete, fill the wound with warm oil and lint; and take care of it with other remedies as necessary until it heals.
Chapter LXIV
On the treatment of hernias that affect the viscera.
It is a hernia wrapped up by some kind of swelling, similar to a growth, which softens the testes, making it difficult to move and walk for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, one must be cautious regarding what precedes its recollection.
However, I note that they mention operation in that second which I have done first.
And he says that you must sever the illness on a high ridge; then, stretch the suspender of the testicles towards the sides; and take hold of the chain of the genitals with your fingers placed at the roots, which are proven to be painful when touched; and have those other assistants, and extend them with great force.
Then, cut with a sharp blade, using a transverse section, along the right of the vessels, while ensuring the vessels remain uncovered.
And extract from every part as we have said regarding the removal of arrows, which are in the temples.
And then insert a needle with a double thread, fasten it in the first place where the pain occurs, and do the same again at the end of their course. Then make incisions in the middle part at a slight angle according to the body's length, and extract what is added due to putrid and corrupt humors.
Then treat the disease with remedies for other diseases in which you wish to be free from pus, so that the vessels that carry it do not become clogged, as it is bad for that.
If it occurs in all veins, then remove the testicles or tie them off with the veins, so that they are deprived of all nourishment through the incision of the veins and become atrophied, or tie them off so that there is no swelling due to these.
Chapter .lxv.
On the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a tear in the abdominal wall extending over the belly from the openings of the abdominal cavity, allowing the intestines to protrude through that rupture.
And this rupture can be of the abdominal wall or an outgrowth of it, and these two types occur due to various causes: a blow, sudden movement, loud noise, the lifting of a heavy object, or similar factors.
The indication of this, when it is due to extension of the abdominal wall, is that it occurs gradually over a long period, and not suddenly, and it forms an angle as if the abdomen pushes back the intestine.
And the sign of the illness is when it is due to a stone in the kidney, as at the beginning it causes intense pain suddenly; and it appears as an apostema, different from the common kidney stones, and this is due to the hernia, and the nature of the kidney is pushed outside of the body.
And sometimes the hernia is overlooked as a skin defect, and this is called intestinal hernia.
And sometimes it is felt as a ventositat (fullness), and sometimes it moves in the hernia gap, and here it gets stuck, which greatly impairs the patient's condition, and sometimes it causes severe and intense pain especially when pressed.
In the treatment of this illness with herbs, care must be taken so that the wrong ingredients are not mixed, as it is important to avoid any harmful effects.
And the manner of the operation for that is to command the patient to reduce the hernia with their hand into its cavity if they obey its return, and then press your hands against their chest between your own, and raise their legs.
Then tighten the cord that is the cord of the testicles, away from them, and cut the cord of the testicles completely through; then fix in two folds of the incised section according to what you need to open the section with these.
And if the section is according to the quantity that it is possible for you to do, then it should be carefully closed up.
Then carefully remove those chips which are left where the cord of the testicles is, as long as the white hard chip in each part is exposed.
Now insert your finger into the space where the testicle is located, between the white rim and the scrotum, and free it from any adhesions behind the testicle.
Then take your hand and move the testicles back to their normal position outside of the scrotum, extend the white rim with your left hand, lift the testicle up towards the base of the penis; and instruct the assistant to spread the testicle apart, while you dissolve the adhesion behind it with a complete solution.
And if there is no cause for the intestine being wrapped in the white rim, hard. If you find no cause, then press on the abdomen below.
And then cut into the scrotum, where you will find a blood vessel from which the flow of blood and health, as we have discussed above, takes place.
And then apply oil-soaked lint to the wound; place a bandage over it and leave it in place; also, in some cases, the white cautery (which we have mentioned should be applied with care regarding blood flow) may be used for incision, as this has been seen to prevent complications. And leave the bandage until it falls off on its own.
If the case of the patient is delayed, then water should be poured over it and applied to that area as we have said.
And then cure the plague with other remedies for the plague until it is healed.
Chapter LXV:
On Ventose Hernia.
In this hernia, nothing has been seen that indicates a successful cure for it other than ferrying.
And the first course of action is as we have recommended for hernia: apply the instruments close to the section with ease; and then dry the middle area around the aperture with water to promote healing.
And treat the plague as we have said until it is healed.
**Capitol LXVII**
On the misalignment that is done in the joints.
Sometimes, when the joints are severely misaligned, as we have said, they may tear and the area becomes prominent.
And do not attribute any cause of hernias to the natural constitution; and if they do, it is rare; and return to it at all times.
If it is prolonged for a long time, a fissure may be made in the wall within so that the hernia protrudes into the wall; and this happens due to the extension of the wall in the joints as we have said, which causes the wall to become stretched, and then softens and the area becomes prominent.
And the treatment for it is with cautery, as we have described above.
And in some cases, it is cured by cutting according to this manner: the hernia lies between your thighs, and then the rupture site of the aponeuroses is sliced along its length according to the quantity of three parts.
And then tighten the white cord that is beneath the skin, until it is completely exposed.
And then take the needle and place it over the prominent part of the cord, and press it against the abdomen's point.
And then locate the two prominent points on the end of the cord's needle, and align them with one another when closing the wound.
And then extract the end of the needle, and do not press or stretch the cord completely, nor cause any damage, as you should be well-informed about the treatment of intestinal hernias.
And then attend to the cure of the plague, and when you have incised the abscesses, cleanse that area and restore the plague until it is consolidated; for the contraction of the disease does not allow the protrusion of rupture to be corrected.
And cauterization is better in this place, for it is closer to health.
Chapter LXVIII.
On the softening of the cord of the testes.
In some men, the cord of the testes is softened due to the softening of the tissues between them, and it is important to pay attention to its care.
Therefore, it is necessary for the one who is tasked with the treatment of this condition to have the patient lie on their back and incise all the cord that has softened beyond the natural cord, and then carefully stitch two lips together in the suture.
And if you wish, in the beginning, due to the excess of softened tissue, perform three or four incisions and a secure suture.
Then make incisions between the stitches; and carefully tend to the other wounds inside until they are healed and the discharge falls off.
Chapter LXIX.
On castration.
You know that castration is condemned by our law, but I will mention it in this book for two reasons: the first is so that doctors understand it when they are asked about its cure; and the second reason is that we sometimes need to castrate other animals for our youth, just as with horses, dogs, pigs, and similar animals.
And therefore it is said that castration is performed in two ways: either by constriction or by cutting a fracture.
In the case of castration by constriction, the surgical method involves cutting off the testicles while they are still soft and hanging down. Then take those with your hand while they are resolved and do not appear to have been touched from before.
For castration by cutting a fracture, hold the animal and with your left hand press the cord of the testicles.
Then fasten the suspenders, and cut across each with a sectioning tool between two pieces.
And cut away that pus which has been excoriated. And do not leave any cause on those of the head, but the subtle head which is over the vessels.
And this method of castration is better which is done by constriction, for strong constriction leaves no cause for the testicles, so the animal does not desire copulation.
And then tend to the wound until it is healed.
Chapter LXX (70)
On the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men occurs in two ways: one where there is an absence of the space between the testicles, resembling a female condition where hair grows.
And in some cases, the flow of that urine which is in the scrotum of the testicles.
In females, there is a difference: the womb of a woman over the penile region is like two testes of a man, slightly smaller in size and located towards the external opening just like the penis and two testes of a man.
And the treatment is of three kinds: two for males and one for females. And it is necessary that you insert those tight clothes between which the emission of that (secretion) escapes, and then cure them with the treatment for other ailments.
And in the second kind of males from whom urine flows from the scrotum of the testicles, there is neither cure nor operation for them.
Chapter .xxi.
Of springtime and flesh swelling due to causes related to women.
The swelling of the lymph glands is closely related to natural causes, as it is stressed, and its observation should be done carefully; in some cases, it is magnified in certain women just as it occurs in men and can even occur during coitus.
So then, you should have the superfluity of lymph nodes in your hand or between your fingers and dig into them.
And finally, do not stop in incision, especially at the point of resistance, so as not to cause bleeding.
And then take care of that which is under treatment for healing as it is healed.
The flesh that is born hidden in the folds of the mother's body, until it appears and becomes inflamed outside according to the appearance of a wound (and for this reason they also called it "chubby disease"), so it is necessary that we cut it as we cut the flesh, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter LXXII.
**On the Cure for Alticity** (or **High Fever**)
Alticity is when the woman's womb is not pierced or there is a small hole in it. And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to sickness that has come before, and it is caused by flesh not properly adjusted or by a subtle and dense accumulation.
And it is made in the pit of the stomach, or in the ribs, or in the bowels above, or in the bowels below, and you must forbid all eating and drinking and conceiving, and strongly forbid menstruation.
And the knowledge of that is gained by observing the mother, if the labor is apparent, then it is advised; but if it is not apparent, then you should seek it out through your fingers or through the light.
If the labor is subtle and it is felt on both sides, then it is advised to cut and break it.
And it should be placed over both soft lips, and then your fingers indicate the most painful spots on both sides.
And the woman should be on her back, her limbs extended, and then force both lips apart until that subtle contraction is broken and labor is opened.
And then take wool and dip it in oil, place it on the area, and apply heat to the spot daily so that the incision does not harden.
If the lump is large and thick, then cut it with a sharp knife or a chisel made of myrtle.
If the swelling is due to excess flesh, then suspend it with a hook and cut it away.
And these are the medicines that stop the flow of blood from bites, as well as pain and dragon's blood, and herbs, adjusted to the patient's age.
And then administer a wide metal needle to prevent the wound from closing prematurely.
Hold it for several days and administer cold compresses from the source.
And then it is treated as another cure of consolidation until it is healed.
And sometimes it happens in the natural birth of others meats, and then you must incise according to this manner. This is also for gangrene, for the gangrene which is in the flesh of the body must not be opposed with force in any manner.
Chapter LXXIII
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, and pain in the tail and red botch that happens in the rectum of women.
Hemorrhoids occur from the openings of veins, rather than from those that are inside and continuously swollen; and when hemorrhoids are old and become hardened.
And now that we have discussed the divisions of those species and the signs of those species, I will also say which receive treatment and which do not receive treatment.
Therefore, it says that hemorrhoids and piles are when they are in the lower part of the body and do not appear in sensation, then in those cases, treatment with iron is not effective.
Those which are in the upper part of the body where sensation occurs, those are the ones that are cured.
And be aware that you should not place the woman on a hard surface, but rather extend her legs with pillows or stretch them out with a smooth cloth, and cut those with sharp razors.
And then sprinkle over those parts the flow of sanctum from one of the powdery substances used for biting, thus as with cassia and similar ones.
And then immerse their feet in hot water for an hour, and place them on a cold compress.
If the flow of pus persists, then make a incision for draining and remove the accumulation and debris of pimples, pustules, and similar ailments.
Then take flour of wheat and stir it with honey, wine, and make a paste from this and apply it to the patient's back.
If the abscess has burst, it is good; otherwise, make two incisions on either side of the abscess and perform lancing at the nipples.
Then take wool and immerse it in vinegar or garlic juice or hawthorn juice, mix with wine and apply to the area; and prepare the place with a poultice until it heals.
And cure that which is inside so it becomes healthy.
It appears you've provided a reference to "Capitol .lxxiv" (Chapter 74) without the actual text. Without context or content, I can't offer a translation or interpretation. If this is from a historical document, a medical textbook, or another type of text, please provide the surrounding sentences or the full passage for accurate assistance.
On the perforation of the eye's cavity in emergencies.
There are various specific instances of abscesses occurring in the eye, such as with inflammation, abscesses, ulcers, swelling, herpetic eruptions, fistulas, haemorrhages, and other types of abscesses. And you have already described these ailments, their types, the signs of those conditions, and the treatment for them in detail.
And be aware that I shall describe in this treatise about the treatment of gangrene, which you see most often when it is a putrid wound, and if you want to know how the operation for removing it should be performed.
Then consider that you recognize if the pain of gangrene at its beginning is sharp, accompanied by percussion and flem, and fever, and sometimes that swelling, and if it causes a certain sensation, do not immediately resort to perforation, but cure it with something that aids in the maturation until the acuteness of the accidents ceases.
And now know that you should stop the flow of blood by applying a compress on a vein that has two openings; and have the patient lie on their back and position their feet below the abdomen, expanding their thighs, holding their arms below their shoulders, and binding them with something appropriate.
Then the midwife should stand at the patient's head and administer the instrument with which the opening of the wound is widened, the form of which will be appropriate for those conditions that are to be treated.
And when you want to use this instrument, hold the woman's womb in your hand, and let nothing enter the womb from the instrument other than the womb's point and cure the illness. If the instrument is larger than the womb's point, then you must place poultices on the texture of the womb's point so that no other instrument can enter the womb's point.
And you must hold the instrument's edge above the incision and have the assistant hold the instrument, then turn the edge within until the woman's orifice is open.
And when the excitation appears and it is hot and moist, then you must quickly cut off that part with a sharp knife.
And after the discharge is evacuated, you must place over the wound a pad soaked in warm oil or olive oil with some coagulant; and apply pressure to the section in the womb's point.
And place outside the wound a clean cloth soaked in water with mallows.
And then the cure is completed in two days, finding what convenes for it until it is healed.
And sometimes the wound and the plague are washed with water and honey, and then it is dressed with water in which nettle or long-stemmed herb has been boiled, and then returned to the ointment.
If the plague is deep within the enclosed wound, then know that you are prohibited from treating it with iron, instead using the remedies we have mentioned in the previous section.
Chapter .lxxv. (This appears to be a heading or title, indicating the beginning of a new section in the medical treatise.)
To teach midwives in what manner the living embryos must be treated when they present in an unnatural form.
A midwife must recognize the beginnings of labor when the woman experiences contractions and has an intense desire for air, and she is drawn in these ways due to the pressure of the child within her, and she quickly prepares for childbirth, then you will know that this labor is according to a natural figure; the child's head descends first, followed by the second stage where the baby is either suspended or hanging from the umbilical cord.
Therefore, when you observe these signs, you will know that her belly is compressed due to the child's descent, and as it shifts onto its head, it signals the onset of the second stage, and it is cleansed of those superfluities with good purification.
Anyone who claims otherwise about this labor is mistaken, for when the child is positioned on its feet and the mother's body is placed behind the child's head and her legs are either above or below the child's feet, or the child's head and mother's hand are positioned in front of her, or she is in strong contractions over her pelvis—all of these signs point to an unfavourable figure that is not commendable.
For a midwife to be skilled and subtle in all those matters, and to avoid errors and disappointments.
And you are showing all the details of those, and what is the purpose in those so that it be understood for what it is and its use upon it.
When the condition is situated on a woman's head due to natural causes, and it is intense over her body, and is made difficult for her, and her virtue is already weakened, then she should stop, what women have that, and evaporate the heat of her skin with fennel and mint oils.
Then the midwife should insert herself between their split and gaping lips, and with her second finger, or perhaps her own fingernail, she should gently pry open what is within them, so as to remove the moisture that is inside. And press the woman's belly until the child descends.
If it does not descend, then cover the woman with a poultice of chickpea flour and fenugreek ground into a paste.
Then command them, apply the heat, which should be changed and make him sneeze with the condition; and close his mouth and nose for an hour, so that the child is not forgotten soon.
And if both of the child's feet are forgotten at the beginning, then cover them with ease, gradually reducing the pressure. If you do not follow the procedure, then place the woman on a bed and raise her legs up, and carefully position the bed over the ground; and have someone hold the woman so she does not fall due to the shock.
And if the hands are not immediately withdrawn and the fetus dies, then incise them and extract the remains of the fetus or tie the body to the hand with cloth and extract it carefully, so as not to be forgotten.
When the fetus moves onto its feet, you should gently press those below, and gradually turn the fetus, and then draw one of its legs, and slowly extend them one by one.
If it is situated within the bones, then command the patient to stretch and make him cough, so that it expels itself in good condition, for if God wills, it will be forgotten.
And if this is not forgotten about what we have recommended, then return the fetus little by little until it takes its natural form, for that will be the time when it is forgotten about through forgetfulness of the earlier position.
And if it is prohibited to use all that we have mentioned, take a mixture of alder and dissolved gum, and pound it well in a mortar, then apply it to the hernia opening in the woman's groin, and the purulent discharge from her lower abdomen. And then apply that compress in hot water, as long as it achieves the desired effect on the pains.
And when the wounds have healed sufficiently, apply smoke from myrrh and hold it over him. And after the smoke treatment for an hour, then make a stop over a hot compress, and cause him to sneeze and expel the air from his mouth, and remove that, and press the lower part of his abdomen with a light compression, as the effect will be quickly forgotten.
The effect of the treatment should be observed longitudinally along one of the patient's limbs. He has ingeniously reduced the patient's hand, but if he cannot do that, then lift the woman and make her move.
If moving her is not possible, then make the woman lie down, and with forceful strikes, dislocate the parts of her body, and then apply medications that you have prepared and recommended for such cases.
When childbirth occurs, then perform the operation on the womb, and promptly study the reduction of the hand, force it back into its natural position, and make the woman sneeze, ordering her to squeeze herself until it is fully inserted.
The expansion of the fetus stretches its hands and the fascia over them is towards the mother's side. Understand that the midwife holds the fetus's hand and slowly revolves it, to facilitate its delivery.
And when it is as warm and as much as it needs to be, then place a poultice on the area we have treated with oil and lint.
Then gradually command the patient to swallow small amounts, and when you have done this, make them lie down on their side, and then command them to turn over, and again have them change position; and cause them to sneeze in this condition. Prepare the exit of the fetus on the side.
When you observe the signs of labor from the mother according to this manner, consider it and then insert your second finger into your own palm within the space where it will be evacuated of humidity.
And if the fetus is suspended over the face and neck of the mother, then insert your finger into the opening of the womb, so that it is not retained and suffers.
And then gently pull the hernia out until it stops at the right place, and order the woman to compress it periodically, and if God wills, it will be removed easily.
The outcome of twins or multiple fetuses. You know that twin pregnancies often occur, and sometimes even three or four, which is strange and rare; however, these may be due to natural causes, not living.
And for those cases, whether they are multiples, a second one, and they are separated by the number (or measure), distinguish them by cutting through the ligament in the navel of each; some pregnancies are lost this way as if it were a lighter natural element, but some pregnancies are lost due to an unstoppable process.
And if some of them are difficult to deliver, and you come across what we have said about non-natural positions, then treat them thus as we have recounted.
And if the midwife is skilled and does what makes it easy and subtle, delays it, and uses ingenuity according to every form as it prepares the body for the bringing of health.
Remembrance that it is formed in the womb from embryos and aborted.
Sometimes they are formed in the womb one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and even more, and it is necessary to verify that a woman who has had an abortion does not get pregnant again, or otherwise, all formations cause great pain due to the measurement of the wise sages.
And all of this is in the science of midwifery, that she knows well what is happening to that young woman, and therefore she must be very careful about it.
Chapter .LXXVI.
On removal of the dead fetus.
When treating the dead fetus as we have discussed in the section on treatment methods, and it is necessary to use surgery with your hand, then you must consider if the woman is of healthy constitution and not prone to any conditions that could lead to loss of her health.
Now you must understand that the woman should be placed face up on her back, and her head inclined downwards, while her legs are raised.
And the midwife must hold both parts or be placed on the bed to prevent her body from extending during the extraction of the fetus.
Then moisten the mother's mouth with an oil infused with extracts of fennel, mint, and fenugreek seeds.
And the midwife then places her hand upon these oils and lint, enters her hand with ease into the mother's womb, and seeks the exact location where the cuts are made on the child.
Consider then the appropriate places: so you should assess whether the child is ready to be born headfirst, and once you have positioned the cuts in its heels, or on its neck, or in its mouth, or on its palate, or if you shave the beard, or on the fork of its spine, or at the places close to the ribs, or release the hypochondria.
If the birth is footling, then in the vaginal canal, or at the opening of the ribs.
And be sure to make the cut with your right hand, positioning the child's curve at that place between the fingers of your left hand, enter easily and fix the cut at one of those locations we have mentioned, striving towards the desired outcome.
And then place and secure another bandage or third if necessary, in the proper position, so that it attracts equally, and does not extend according to its natural form too much.
And consider it at every step, so that the emergence of the hernia is alleviated as it is done in dental surgery for the eradication of a tooth.
And pay attention to what is between them so that the extension is softened; and if any part of it is retained, then the midwife should apply some of her special ointment to those places and insert her fingers skillfully and turn over what is retained.
So if the baby's part is expelled, then the cuts will be changed to another place where there is pus or better; and do this until all the baby is expelled.
If the hand is frozen against the other and it cannot be reduced due to its stiffness, then a cloth should be wrapped around it; then extract that part until everything is removed, and cut it either at the joint of the hand or at the elbow.
And the same applies to the other hand and both feet.
If the head of the hernia is large, or it becomes constricted during its emergence, or is at the top of an enclosed water sac, then you should insert between the sharp spines and split the head and extract the water, or find that instrument called an "alundat," which resembles the shape of the other instruments in the chapter related to this.
And it should be done similarly if the hernia has a naturally large head: then you should incise that with a knife, or use an alundat as we have said; and extract the bones using forceps.
And if the head is fixed and compressed, then the fork should be cut so that the moisture in the foot can be drained.
If it is not complicated and does not contradict the sight, then you should cut the head as soon as possible according to your ability.
And if the abdominal pain is caused by an appendix or a hernia, then you should pierce that part so that the moisture inside it can drain.
If the pain is in their feet, then the attraction of it should be gentle and the direction towards the mother (womb) should also be gentle.
If it is compressed around the belly and the foot, then you should extract that cloth which you have wrapped around your hand, and pierce the belly and the foot until the water inside them flows out.
If other members are restrained and the head is turned, then the left hand should be inserted; if the opening of the mother (womb) is blocked, then insert your hand between the legs of the mother, seek to grab the head, pull it towards you, and pour a drop or two into it.
And if the opening of the mother (womb) is blocked by an abscess that occurs in the ovary, then be careful not to tear it; instead, you should first administer a flow of wet, greasy causes. And apply poultices; also, monitor the patient with waters that soften and moisten.
And if the issue is on their side, then if possible, it should be punctured; and whatever we have said about the living issue should be administered.
And if that is not possible, then it should be incised in the legs, and extracted.
And be sure not to leave any cause within the second one.
And when you have completed all your operation, then administer what we have said about the treatment for the hernias by applying heat to the places where they occur due to the main cause.
And if there is a flow of blood, then use strict waters and administer the other treatment.
And you have already seen a woman in whom the fetus was dead, and then once again over that fire she became pregnant, and another dead heat led to the other being born. It happened to him that he had a long-standing hernia in his belly; it opened up like fire, and then he began to feel heat.
And you have been called to treat them, and medicated for a long time, but the illness is not healed.
Then consider the patient from various causes and apply strong compresses, and reduce it to a bone, and after some days another bone; and you will be too amazed when there is no bone in the belly.
And then you will realize that they are bones from the dead fetus.
Therefore, you will investigate the illness, and extract from them many bones, the female existing in their various dispositions, and already lived in such a manner for a long time, correcting it with a small branch.
And you should not be amazed, but rather know that it is science and assistance to it that the doctor applies with their hand for healing arts.
Regarding the forms of instruments necessary to extract the foreign body.
The form of the turn that opens the main valve.
This is the form of the straining instrument in which the limbs are locked, with two valves at the two ends of both feet. However, this valve should be made to be more subtle than the constrictor, and it can be made of ebony or birch wood.
And the thickness of each wood should be such that two fingers can fit between them, and the margin on either side of each wood should be one finger wide; the length of each should be one palm and a half; in the middle area of the two woods, there are two ajustments, already fastened, of the same type of wood, whose length is one palm and a little less, and the width across each is two fingers or slightly less.
And these two additions should be placed in the opening of the mother to keep it open for you as you turn the prescribed virtues.
Another form, similar to that subtle and light pus:
It should be made of reed or bamboo according to the appearance of forceps. You can still use the two additions at the same time, and the length of these additions is about one palm, and their width is approximately two fingers.
And when you want to open the mother, you should lay the woman on her side over the feet hanging, opening what is between her thighs. Then open your hand over the instrument using the forceps as you wish, according to the amount you want from the opening of the mother while the meter indicates what you desire.
The way of Vertigo as described by the ancients:
The method of pushing that which is pushed:
The method of healing as contained in the great head:
And it is constructed like a pair of pincers with teeth at the end, also when you need to cut something long, and sometimes other tools are made according to this form, which have sharp teeth as if they were a saw, used to cut and contain. Method of healing sparingly:
Method of unwinding without a thorn:
Method of unwinding without two thorns:
A spatula with two ends, used to cut off the head.
A form of two spatulas wide.
All those instruments, when used in combination and with an abundance of the aforementioned spices, prepared as directed by the artisan, become lighter for use in their operation and more useful to people due to their quantity.
And for those instruments that are already prepared, it is not acceptable to neglect their maintenance, as the need for them cannot be excused.
From the extraction of the second one (presumably referring to a surgical procedure or removal of a second object).
When the second stage of childbirth begins, you must command the patient to hold their breath and make them sneeze in that position, and place your hand over their mouth and nose, for if they exhale, it is dangerous.
And if that happens, take a hot cloth and make an opening in the covering, placing it over the mother's mouth with herbs such as calamine, rhubarb, and cassia wood, and also chamomile and licorice root. All these herbs or some of them should be submerged in water in the cloth, and then placed over the fire.
And then place a canvas tube in the mother's mouth, keeping it open so that the vapor goes into the mother's cavity.
And make the patient sneeze as we have said before, and the second stage will pass quickly.
If this medical treatment is performed correctly and without complication, then instruct the midwife to submerge her left hand in warm oil or an infusion of aloe vera, and gently insert that into the wound, searching and seeking until she finds the second one. Once found, slowly pull it out little by little according to the established method so that the mother does not experience a violent attraction. It is also necessary to change the positions of the patient's right and left sides at regular intervals.
And if the mother's mouth is constricted, we have already recommended treatment with sneezing and herbal medicine.
If all the causes we have mentioned are not forgotten, be careful not to do anything in a hasty manner of abstraction, but consider that what has been thrown out from him into the mother's womb lies in the matter of the woman; and treat it with a mixture of herbs and tetracyclone; for this will cause it to rot within a few days and be dissolved and expelled.
If you hear a high, bad sound in the head and stomach, this causes the disease; and therefore consider that inhalations of smoke and other appropriate remedies should be administered.
Some of the ancients already used inhalations of nasturtium and dried figs.
The form of the instrument used to fumigate a woman for the retention of menstruation and postpartum:
It is necessary to make an incision or an extraction.
And the delicate end should be paused in the cone and the broader end over the fire, and the smoke extraction should be paused over the arms of the fire.
And hold that until the smoke extraction is consumed, then repeat another.
On the treatment of the unperforated anus of a child.
Many children have this problem, as well as the anuses of young animals, which are delicate and tightly closed. Then instruct the midwife to perforate it as she has said; otherwise, use a sharp spatula and ensure it does not touch the wound.
And then apply pressure over that cloth soaked in wine and oil; and carefully prepare that ointment until it is warm.
If there is a risk of obstruction, insert a catheter into the tract for several days, and continue it until the child's condition improves.
And it also happens that constipation of the colon occurs due to a wound or abscess; then, once that consolidation is incised, it should be treated with water and lead, as we have said regarding treatment and plaster.
On the treatment of fistulas that have resulted.
Fistulas that develop in the perineal region, filled with purulent fluid, are often painful and swollen, appearing either near the anus externally or in the space between the cracks of the buttocks.
And it is a fistula or a mass.
And when that swelling is old and affected by moist, white pus or subtle decay, sometimes these fistulas penetrate from them.
And those that penetrate are guided by what is left from them for the exit and due to inflammation; and sometimes the patient uses the difficulty of exit, and very strong it is left from those worms.
And from those fistulas, some are seen in the space penetrating into the bladder, and into the flesh of the penis; and some penetrate into the joint of the thigh and into the notch of the knee.
And where the fistula is guided and does not penetrate, you should insert a thin, sharp object into the anus and try to erode or cut the fistula when it is not inflamed.
If there is stiffness in that place, then insert a thin probe of lead or horsehair until you feel the tension or hair in the exact spot.
And if you do not feel any tension at all and see no cause for evacuation, such as worms or flatulence, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and you should limit yourself to treatment.
And when the fistula is penetrating into the bladder or into the flesh of the penis, then the meaning of it is the emission of urine from that place and the prohibition of it so that the affected area can heal through medicine.
If it is penetrating into the joint of the thigh or into the bone and causes pain in the circulation, then its sign is that tension penetrates here if there is no stiffness within the bone, and pain in the flow of blood; and it will cause rusting forever; and it responds to no medicine, nor is it healed by ointment.
And in all those penetrating fistulas, there is no complete cure, and the cure for them is the work and patience of skilled doctors over whom they are held firm.
But for those that are not penetrating or recent, healing with iron is hoped for according to what you have been recommended and what has already been proven effective.
And indeed, the disease often moves between the patient's thighs over their insides, raising their legs within them, and the parts are inclined towards the patient's belly; then try to insert a lead or iron probe, or an erad (if it is in a tortuously curved fistula), at the place where you know the probe will enter.
And if that place where the disease is felt is around the heart, then you must insert the pointed instrument directly into the chest.
And if you feel the probe already penetrate itself into the chest, or if you feel something between the ribcage and that flesh, then you will certainly know that it is penetrating; so do not work on that, for there is no cure in that place, as we have said.
However, some say that it heals certain men's tart.
And for the treatment by which one hopes for healing in them, make subtle cauterizations according to the extent of the fistula, as previously mentioned, and insert that heated instrument into the fistula until it reaches around the collar; then repeat this process two or three times until you know that all the tissues surrounding the fistula, which are similar to a quill of goose down, have been adequately adjusted.
And then care for those wounds wrapped in bandages until all the tissues that are adjusted are healed, and treat those wounds with medicines that promote growth and strengthen, and if it heals well; otherwise, it will not heal at all with any other treatment.
And if the attempt enters, but does not penetrate into the deep tissue, and between that and the attempt, there is only a slight gap of flesh or bone, and the fistula reaches the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and watch as the attempt dries as well; when the drying reaches the point where the tip of the attempt enters, it is freed and removed.
And then cleanse those fistulated meats that are assembled like a tube of quill pen and not ruptured from any cause.
If a flow of pus appears between you and your operation when you inspect those meats, then the best thing to do is to use a clean instrument to cauterize it with fire or sharp medicine, for cauterization with fire adjusts both the opening and the excision of the pus by removing moisture.
And then pay attention to those wrapped in bandages or affected by a wound within the brachial area, and carefully treat the infection, applying hot compresses to soft, infected flesh, to promote healing.
And such medicines should include hemostasis and excision; when the healing is complete, there will be no fear of recurrence.
If the fistula has already penetrated into the perineum and is extended from the surface of the body, then insert the finger into the anus and inquire about it carefully.
And therefore, if the tumor is hard and between you and it there is clearly a distinction between bone and flesh, and it is prone to penetration, then surgery on it is not indicated but rather through a different path of trust and hope.
The treatment for this condition is administered in three ways: first, by cauterization, as we have mentioned; second, by securing it so that you can access the cavity and provide the necessary cure; do not perform any incision to avoid damaging the lacert (a structure related to the anus), and let the patient's own will guide the process; and take care of it as we have said, for it is a strong treatment. Or, second, lengthen that membrane and drain the pus from within, as we have mentioned, or through trial or another instrument of extreme sharpness, and then clean those fistulated meats that are in the cut, where you can apply cauterization; and finally, make an effort to restore the whole wound by cutting, and if the orifice above does not heal and the fistula remains open at the anus, it will be less severe for the patient. And in some cases, the fistula is finished in this manner: when you insert the probe into the fistula, it is at the side of the anus around the surface of the body with the cord and on the margin of the anus, then take the probe of the perforated extremity, which is thus with a needle prepared for the wounds according to this form:
and insert into that wound wrapped with fillets or around those; then insert the probe into the fistula until you reach its cavity.
If it is deeply inserted into the margin of the anus precisely, then extract the wound from there, thus inserting the tip inside the anus; remove the extreme part of the wound and align both ends, then open each one, leaving it for a day or two, and when you more deeply insert the wound into the flesh, open it until those parts of the flesh are opened that lie between the two extremities of the wound and fit.
And then treat the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
If the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate in some way as you are prepared, either with heat or cold, since it is not for you to judge this so as not to cause a tear; and then treat it until it is healed.
The shape of the spindle with which the fistula is opened: its curvature is acute in one direction and the other part is not acute, so as not to cause damage when you do this, thus carefully.
On the stitching of hemorrhoids where pus runs from the incision of those.
Hemorrhoids are of two kinds, for they either appear in the anus resembling stones, or those are swollen with sharp pain. And they are small and large, the pain flowing from them at those times is one, it is intense, it comes out of nowhere, and affects the extremities.
However, those that are solely external (as if the buttocks were moist), sometimes release clear water or a slight pungent odor continuously, and they are according to the color of the body.
And the treatment for that which is deep within the buttocks is to order the patient to lie down, and press until the heat subsides and the hemorrhoids appear before you. Then you should cut or tear open whatever you have between your fingers, and return the intestines to their proper place, cutting them where necessary.
If the cuts are not held in place by the moisture and softness of the tissue, take a coarse cloth or glove or a piece of woolen thread, pull out the intestines through your fingers, and then cut them just below the opening, and sprinkle some powdered substances over them after the incision, so that they adhere to those places instead of cauterization; or cauterize them as mentioned in the chapter on cauterization. And then attend to those and other treatments until they are healed.
If the hernia does not yield to treatment, then fasten the malady with lacing in the place where there is a small bite, and wash with water that is on the skin and helps to expel it more easily when the hernia is squeezed.
But if the hemorrhoids are external, their cause is usually trivial, and it is because you take those with your finger, or take those with wax, and cut them, then treat them with water as we have said until they are healed.
And he who performs the incision should administer a suture according to this method: take a thread wrapped around and pass it through with an needle, then remove the hemorrhoids from their positions above, and make the needle penetrate in the root of the other part, and wrap both ends of the thread on the side below without leaving the needle, and stretch it laterally; tighten the hemorrhoid with a strong pull, and tie the thread, and remove the needle.
And do it thoroughly, leaving none untouched, so that the excess of blood flows from that part.
Then place your hand on the clean cloth soaked in hot oil or wax; press it onto the affected area and instruct the patient to rest. Then remove that from the wound; and when it is healed, treat those with poultices or other remedies until they are cured.
And when these become old and no longer respond to that medicine, you will need to open them with a pointed instrument or with your finger, making sure they remain moist and free from any crusty pus that might prevent their healing; and then treat them until they are healed.
Now hold those with a strong reason, more violent than the first that enters, and make sure they are cleaned; and then take care of those so they heal.
You know that hernia is crucial, and it appears as a bulge in the body resembling a peg, and it occurs throughout the body but especially in the legs and sides, and through these pains you should treat it.
And then cut what is in the circumference of the hernia, and hold it with forceps or pincers, and eradicate it from its origin; and then tend to that.
And if you wish, cauterize according to what is mentioned above in its chapter.
A small, raised, rough, round ulcer on the surface of the body, often seen in children.
The treatment for it is to extend and incise the area, or open it up with a sharp object within the wound. And if you choose, cauterize it with fire or acute medicine, as we have said.
A mushroom is a small, fleshy, round eminence or ulcer on the skin that itches like a mosquito bite and occurs anywhere on the body.
The treatment for it is to take a sharp needle from an oak or a maple tree, make it strong, and insert it over the mushroom within the circle of the needle; then, with your hand, turn the needle inside out until you have incised what is in the path of the mushroom, and stop the needle at the point of the flesh, and eradicate the mushroom from its root.
And if you wish, make this as a tube of iron or bronze in this manner:
The beginning of the tube should be delicate, soft (not perforating), wrapped around itself so that the appearance of it is smoothed and the revolution of that is prevented.
And if you wish to cauterize the fistula as described above in the cauterization of a wound in the chapter on cautery.
In the form of instruments that are administered to give heat.
Sometimes heat is applied using silver or bronze instruments that have been melted or shaped; and sometimes it is applied with small or large instruments according to those used, for the heat administered to small children should be small, and for those whose backs are bent or painful, the heat from such instruments should be small.
The form of crystal healing is great and rare:
The top of the bladder of the patient, in which the bag is attached, should be wide according to this manner; and it is distinguished where the bag is attached also with times (or intervals).
And the lower end of it (the bladder), which is inserted into the anus, should be smooth (not rough), made of leather, and attached with subtlety; and on one side of its length there are two channels, and on the other side one channel, and the width of the channel should be according to the thickness of the rays, and as thick as a small one.
And the bag in which the animal bladder or sheepskin medicines are paused should be of a size, and its handle (or opening) should be one palm.
And it should be pierced through many channels, as it is revolved; and the space between the channels should be as thick as the mentioned one.
And then I insert into those channels a strong cord of raw silk, either of these; adjust that to the sac; and when the sac is paused in it, tighten it at the top of the channel between two distinctive points at a firm constriction, and I cauterize that part: The quality of cauterizing that part is that you fill the sac with medicine, heated according to the amount of the patient's tolerance; be careful not to make it too loose or too tight.
Then place the patient on their stomach, raising their legs and placing a cushion underneath them, upon which they rest their head, or use a lance; and apply the end of the cautery with oil or egg albumen or mucilage of fenugreek or similar; and insert that into the anus with ease, and have the assistant press the sac and squeeze vigorously until everything in the channel is evacuated into the intestine; then remove the sac and the patient lifts their legs to the wall.
And if the medicine forces that to be ejected, have as much as you can; and if you sleep with that for the whole night, it is more beneficial for healing.
May you sterilize those in the solutions of intestinal troubles and the extraction of their pain, then apply the cautery until it is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or fistulas in the anus that cause pain, then use a delicate and gentle cauterization, as the cautery tools of which children are taught.
**On the Cure for Plagues**
You have already spoken about the division of the cure for plagues according to disposition, and you have thus indicated the cure for some by means of diet, and for others by the use of medicines according to their strength.
Therefore, it is said that plagues are diverse according to the cause of the plague and according to the place where the plague strikes.
And the causes for which you become ill are due to plagues thus with the weight of stone, or incision of space or of bone, or percussion with lance, or with club, or with arrow, or similar to those causes that bring on motion sickness.
The plagues that are in the parts of the body may be such as a plague that sits on the head, or the neck, or the foot, or the belly, or the back, and similar to those of the members.
And it is often recommended for the treatment of certain plagues, to stop that reasoning and regulate concerning other plagues.
And one should begin with the simple plagues of the head, since the remembrance of the composite ones will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore, it is said that when a simple plague occurs in the head and it is not a fracture, consider: if it is due to the weight of stone or similar, and you have already bitten the tongue deeply and it is a great plague and you fear the patient will fall into apostema (a state of extreme physical or mental deterioration), then you should immediately perform a trepanation (drilling a hole in the skull) and do not delay; and extract the foreign body from the sinus according to the quantity of strength it exerts, if no other cause prohibits trepanation, especially if the sinus affected by the plague is small.
And this is the surgical procedure, opposite to the affected part; and care must be taken against repletion and heavy foods and drinks.
If due to weakness or any other reason, reducing food intake is necessary, then avoid meat and wine.
And in the case of an infected ulcer, if it is deep, apply a small piece of roasted olive oil or wine that has been strained.
If it is certain that the ulcer is infected, then apply a poultice to it, if it is fresh with its own pus and the air has not changed the powder recommended, gently press it.
And if the air has changed it, then apply different poultices until it is healed.
If the wound is large or due to an incision of space and similar, and the lips of the hernia are not properly adjusted for closure, adjust them with sutures as I have recommended in their suture.
If the hernia has already been discovered and is not retained by any structure but instead is a small suspender, then incise it and, as soon as possible, treat the hernia with medicines and restore the flesh appropriately in that area, and direct the patient to abstain from foods that are harsh: fruits and vegetables of a similar kind, until it heals.
And if you find in the hernia putrefaction that does not adhere to the bone, then you should incise and remove all of it, and then treat it.
If these hernias are due to an artery or vein from which pus flows and they do not subside with medicines, then inquire about the artery; if you find one that is not incised, incise it, or tie it off; and if, in the process, the pus does not drain, then cauterize it.
And if these plagues are simple and small, their cause is easily identifiable; so much so that you sprinkle this powder over them, as the powder hardens before the air changes them.
The method of the powder is this: take olive oil from broken sesame seeds, dragon's blood divided into two parts, and frankincense divided into three parts; mix them all together finely and fill the plague with it, then tightly constrict it so that it adheres well to the affected area, and coagulate it with the dragon's blood.
Then tighten it from above with poultices and leave it, without stirring it, as long as it is not infected; for the medicine will not be absorbed into it until it is healed.
Sometimes it is done alone with this remedy, when you do not have access to sesame seeds and dragon's blood.
And now performs this surgical procedure on the large abscesses when it is appropriate to stop them and tighten them, and they are fresh with their pus, which the air has not altered.
If the air has altered them, especially in summer, one cannot understand the position of this powder, so apply what we have said, either by placing on the affected parts a paste made from ingredients such as egg yolks or by applying to the inflamed joints flour mixed with honey and water until they are healed.
If it happens that the abscess breaks in a bone and is small, then extract it with your fingers.
And tell the treatment for fractures of the skull in cases that are dangerous.
Of the abscesses of the collarbone.
If the plague occurs in the colon, it is not different in treatment, nor between the plague of the head when it is simple.
If the nerves of the colon are incised or an artery, then if it is nerves, there is no need for complex treatment but rather to avoid cure by something that causes violent spasms, likewise using herbs and similar things to relax them and prevent contraction. And it does not matter what the cause of the pain is, for the substance of the nerves is compressed and their continuity is to the brain, which is the source of all members.
And if it is treated with lighter medicines, also with washing using two types of water, sometimes with oil or without oil, and drying when washed with hot water and other remedies afterwards according to this method, and then moisture is added.
If the plague is severe, then administer a stitch, or tie the edges together, and soon after treat it with poultices until it heals.
If the plague is deep or causes pus to form in a low and closed part of the body, then perforate it in the most vulnerable spot.
If the plague has already cut into an artery and blood flow results, then separate or dry it, tie it off, or cauterize it if that is required to stop it.
If the spine in the throat or completely cut, but the veins in the neck are saved, then secure the edges of the wound with stitches over the throat's cane and do not touch that part; later equalize that and return it to its natural shape, and appropriately tighten it with decent stretch, and leave it for several days; and treat it with ointment in places where there is stiffness and excitation until it heals.
If the plague has already taken hold in the bone, then you should probe it and, if it contains pieces of bone, extract as many as possible; leave what is not attached so that the plague can disperse and its removal from the body be facilitated.
And if the plague is recent, then sprinkle that powder which has been recommended over it. If the plague has caused a fistula, then treat it with water from the source of its origin, which will be discussed in its respective chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or a cut, and the depth of it can be seen, then consider more carefully the plague's symptoms as the illness progresses; you should know that the plague is deadly.
And if there is no depth in it and the wound is recent, then you should apply dust to it from the first hour, and do not press on it so that the wound is not retained in depth and returns to the heart and causes harm to the malady, but rather apply a soothing ointment to it twice a day.
And if you do not have a suitable ointment, then apply clean cloth to the wound's surface so that it absorbs what comes from moisture; and make the malady rest on the wound so that whatever is appropriate runs into it.
If after three days or more the wound has healed without causing spasms or tremors in the heart and no constriction of the blood vessels, and other good dispositions appear, then you will know that the wound is cured; and thereafter treat it with cold compresses and other remedies until it is completely healed.
If the healing of the wound is delayed, and it remains open for a long time, then you will know that a fistula has formed; therefore, treat it according to its nature.
And if the wound is due to incision of space or bone, and it is simple on the surface of the foot or back, treat it with the method previously described for stitching, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
But if the treatment has not worked on the bone, and you have already incised and extracted pieces, then turn to the wound, and try to extract those pieces if they are separated. If they are not separated, then leave them inside, as the extraction of them delays healing of the wound.
And for other wounds that occur in the other parts of the body, the young (or quick) healing in treatment is what we have mentioned.
Of abdominal wounds.
The disorder that occurs in the belly can be great, or small, or intermediate.
And a small disruption is difficult to achieve in another way, and I know that the reduction of them is more difficult if one does not address their intrusion into their place as soon as possible, because it opens up and thickens so that the insertion of them becomes difficult.
Therefore the best disruption is intermediate, because in that case the reduction of the hernia is neither difficult, as it is in the two aforementioned types.
And you know that the suture of the belly is according to four ways, but two sutures are common that suit in the sutures of other ailments of the body.
And two other wounds communicate with the others, yet they are more specific to the wound of the abdomen.
And I recommend to each of you exposition and declaration.
Therefore, it says when the wound is small and there is no apparent cause in the abdomen for it, and it becomes difficult to reduce, then this is in one of two ways: either due to the narrowness of the disruption as we have said, or when the hernia has swelled up due to the coldness of the air.
And therefore when it is so, then know that you should bind it thus, immersing a sponge or cloth in warm water, or taking watercress, fennel, and spices, and wrapping them around the hernia until the swelling is resolved.
And in some cases, it has been observed that vinegar is more effective than water alone in resolving inflammation.
And once you have resolved the inflammation, moisten the hernia with water in which herbs like althae and mulleins are steeped, for they help to relax its contents slightly.
However, if the contents of the hernia cannot be reduced by this treatment, then you may need to cut the disruption using a small instrument with which hemorrhoids are incised.
And the initial treatment is better when it involves no cutting, and there is no need to dry it abruptly, but only a gradual supply of nutrition.
Regarding the instrument, see its form:
In one part of the acute pain, and in another part not acute, and at the delicate extremity, let there be no subtlety of space; first make it slightly obtuse.
And therefore, when the hernia is enlarged and it has protruded, you must return it to its natural form and position, in its proper place, if possible; for this is better.
If the hernia is extensive and located in the lower part of the abdomen, you must make the patient lie on their back, and raise their legs higher than their head; but if it is located in the upper part of the abdomen, then you must elevate the patient's head and feet higher than the hernial openings.
And similarly, if the hernia is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, you must always direct your intention and consideration towards making the affected part higher than the other.
And also ensure that you administer this in large and small pains.
And in the smaller pains, apply what you have prepared, and then make the medicine flow between your fingers, hold it with your hand, and adjust the edges of the wound, and then gradually uncover from one part to another, searching for any cause that might be hidden, other than the suture.
And this is the common method of suturing: take the needle, or count one needle according to the amount of the width of the wound; then lay it at the edge of the disruption on the little finger, and tighten the needle once; avoid putting any pressure on both ends of the thread, except for the two ends that remain within the wound, as you make the needle penetrate from one side to the other; and when you have added both ends of the thread and both ends of the needle, they form four orders.
And then tightly wrap the thread double around the needle, sometimes from two sides together, and add both lips and the wound by a decent addition; and leave the thickness of the thread and tie another needle to it, just as if it were the first needle; and do not cease doing this for the needles until you have fully resolved the contraction of the wound.
And the needles should be of varying thicknesses, between coarse and fine, for the thin needles pierce the flesh slightly; the thick ones are difficult to insert into the wound, therefore they should be of a moderate thickness in both respects.
And it is important that the needle be inserted into both ends of the hernia at once, so that the flesh is not pierced too deeply and the hernia opens up before its hardening.
And the stitches should not be too long, so that the hernia is not hindered from healing.
And then carefully insert the ends of the needles so as not to cause further harm to the patient during their sleep; rest upon the wound pulvils spread out from all sides, which have the ends of the needles; and leave them there until you know that the illness is consolidated.
And these types of sutures with needles are most convenient in small wounds, as they can be applied to the suture using just one needle, or two, or even more around them.
The second suture is fundamental: it consists of administering a suture to the four ends, from the cord and two ends of the limb, at once, using an needle with thread meticulously and carefully wrapped around it in terms of fineness and thickness.
And when the needle has penetrated these four ends, return the needle to its original path from which it began, so that the thread retracts and pulls the wound closed, thus securing the suture like a drape with which the drapes are tightly bound.
And between each stitch, hold the amount of the thickness of your finger.
And this stitch prevents men from urinating.
And with this stitch, I have closed the wound that had occurred in a man's belly, which was infected by a knife, and it was a rupture of a major plague, about two palms wide around the intestines near the middle of the wound in the member; and then I have reduced that after the wound had been open for twenty-four hours.
And the wound was healed in about fifteen days or so, and I treated it, and he recovered fully; and after that, I have observed him for most years, and he has been in good health.
And other doctors had judged that he would not recover; but by a miracle, because you did not cure him with ointment, for the place where the wound was was not reached by any ointment or medicine, yet you applied your hand to the wound twice a day and washed it daily with honey water until it was healed.
There are two kinds of suture according to the account of the word.
And so you begin to suture the wound, and insert the needle from outside towards inside.
And so, as the needle penetrates the wound and reaches its center according to the rule, leaving the end of the thread you inserted into the wound; also, insert the other end of the thread from inside towards outside in the other extremity of the member.
And when you have succeeded in making it penetrate, make it penetrate again in that same extremity of the member from inside towards outside; then leave the end of the thread on this side, and insert the needle into the other extremity of the opening from outside towards inside.
And make a penetration there with your penetration, which causes that to penetrate into the body at the end of the eye, which is in the opening of it so that all that penetrates.
Then begin with this procedure on the side of the body and with that end which is from the eye on the other side, extract the needle from the thread it penetrates, reduce it into that thread and with the end of the eye that is on the opposite side to this end, extract the thread that is attached to it.
Do this once and then again, and do it again and again until you have eliminated everything that is outside according to this example.
The sum of this method of stitching is that you stitch with a skin stitch, by which you sew the flesh, in such a way that you stitch the eye once from the side of the thread's end, and then turn it again until it is completely closed.
But the second specific type of suture that is entirely worthy of note, which certain healers call "Galia," involves stitching with a second thread, one that some doctors use, adding to the initial wound according to what nature requires; and they apply the tip of one part to the other and the tip of the opposite part to the remaining end, and this is done as you direct.
Ensure that you hold the needle at the tip of the mirror in your dominant hand, and make it penetrate the wound from outside towards the inside, passing through both ends of the limb; then, turn the needle around and make it penetrate from inside out, going through both ends of the limb again.
Then, turn those threads around and make some of them penetrate from inside out towards the outside in both ends of the limb other than the opposite side.
And this method of suture is better than the common loose suture, and it is a suture of which one should have memory.
This is the speech of Gaul.
They may also say that the suture of the abdomen is corrected with two needles; then you enter some thread into each, and begin to introduce the needle from this one into the other on the opposite side according to the suture of those which join the flesh together.
And you should know that when there is a rupture in the middle part of the abdomen, the suture there is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen.
The treatment of plague can be compared to other plagues.
Which is because when you perceive the recent plague in its initial stage where air alters it, you reduce the swelling, cook it, and stitch it properly, then place a poultice on that flesh-colored powder.
And if the air has already altered the wound, then apply hot compresses to that place until the pain intensifies and the fluids discharge, and they are healed and become firm; and then treat that wound as is done with other wounds until it heals.
If you do not have access to medications, then focus on this treatment, as it begins to improve after three or four days, just as it was taught to you, until it heals, so that you do not need other complex remedies for simple ailments.
If you fear that the wound might communicate with other vital parts, then cover it with a cloth dipped in pure oil or perfumed oil and place it around the affected area between the joints, and leave it there.
And if pain or putrefaction is felt in the intestines, as it occurs a few times, then apply a cold compress with black stippling clay, especially when the inflammation has spread to the hernia and there is an exit penetrating the cavity of the organ.
And you should know that a hernia involving larger intestines has a lighter recovery than one involving smaller intestines.
And the hernia called "inguinal" is difficult to heal because it does not receive healing from any plague; and this is due to the great number of veins in it, and the magnitude of those veins, and the subtlety of the body part where it occurs, and the proximity of that area to the nature of nerves.
If what you process from the plague is the tissue, and you manage to obtain it fresh, reduce it according to your established method to ensure the hernias are fully contained.
If it has been left in the space and has turned red or black, then tighten the bandage over the affected area to promote blood flow, as there are veins and arteries within the tissue.
And then cut into this other matter, hold the two ends of the thread pendant from the wound, so that by removing the bandage and draining the pus from the wound, you can alleviate the attraction of it.
A recollection of hernias when they occur in the abdomen.
When a rupture occurs in the abdomen and is small, it is possible for some people to have it restored, so you may see someone who was previously plagued by a hernia in their stomach after being pierced by a lance, and the hernia had an old fistula and experienced issues with management and air flow.
Then you should pursue the cure for it as if it was not sealed in the healing of it, but rather focus on that which brings about health and the place becomes consolidated.
And having observed the location already consolidated, beware of taking on additional burden over the illness that has affected them in their abdomen; and do not further aggravate this ill accident by eating or drinking, and soon immerse yourself in a bath and exercise according to your said conditions.
And some experienced ones say that when a hernia in the abdomen is small, it should be treated as follows: you take scissors from large heads; then adjust the two edges of the hernia and place a scissor from those that keep the mouth open over both edges of the hernia; so when you grasp them and tighten your mouth, cut off the head, for it sticks and is not dissolved.
And then place another scissor near the first, and do not stop doing this with scissors one after another according to the quantity of the entire hernia.
Then return it and contract the hernia; and cut off those attached caps within the abdomen until the hernia is healed; and do not cause any harm to the patient.
And it is possible that the hernia is a thin thread taken from the hernia of an animal, finer than a needle, so you take the end of these herniary threads, bare and smooth, and bring the end of them to the thread, wrapped, and then insert that thread through needles and sew with that, and reduce it in the rupture.
And this method of stitching with catgut is nothing but a second way of trust and hope.
If the plague is great and widespread, especially if it is in one of the subtle hernias, then at times there is only subtilization, and not a complete healing of it.
On the healing of wounds and fistulas.
You know that every wound and ulcer, as it ages and becomes old, turns into a fistula, not healing and remaining open for a long time, then in any part of the body, it is generally called a fistula, and we call that our ulcer.
And a fistula, according to truth, is a wound that is hard, white and without pain, and has a hollow cavity just as there is a hollow cavity in the pain of use; and for this reason it is called acute pain, i.e., the injury.
And it is in some people's bodies that this humidity becomes hot, and often the humidity is absorbed in a few hours. And sometimes this humidity is increased, and sometimes it is decreased, and sometimes it is thin, and sometimes it is thick.
It has already shown all those causes and the signs of those, as well as their cure through medicines in detail.
And it covers that you should know the cure for a fistula caused by surgical operation with the hand.
And you should know that fistulas occur in all parts of the body; some fistulas affect large veins and arteries, or nerves, or the skin, or the abdomen, or the bladder, or any of the ribs, or any of the spinal joints, or any joint composed thusly from hand and foot; and those are ones that result in proximity to the main member and similarly.
And therefore, of these fistulas that are according to this manner, is among the illnesses of difficult healing, and does not receive treatment, and occupation with those is work and ignorance.
And if the depth of the fistula does not reach these places, which are mentioned, wait and trust in its healing, and desire to gain knowledge about it, then take a probe or a scalpel, and if the fistula is according to rectitude, you investigate it with care.
If the fistula is twisted, then investigate it with a delicate probe, for the weight of their body's fluid can displace and curve the twisted nature of the fistula.
And if the fistula exhibits extreme horror, it is not appropriate to attempt any treatment on it.
Therefore, sanitize the orifices for their horror, because the moisture by which you clean that one should also affect the other orifices and cure them.
And you should carefully inquire, according to what manner it is possible for you to know if here there are bones or nerves, and whether the concavity of the fistula is distant or close, or if it is a fistula that only exhibits extreme horror, and this lies entirely within the scope of your strength, with your questioning, with which you question the malady, and the discovery of the pain due to your compression with your hand over the place, and similar signs of accidents at the abscess.
And when you have carefully considered all those causes and come to a clear conclusion, you will then proceed to treatment according to your judgment: for you consider whether the fistula appears near or far from a joint, or of a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or in one of the places that are characteristic of it, and speak about it.
Now you examine the fistula according to what has been said about its description, remove whatever is in that flow and corrupt flesh, and what has formed in the hole of the flesh, or of the wound and similar things, and treat it until it is healed.
If the fistula is of great depth and according to the rule, then you must incise it in the place where it is most pronounced as far as possible, and thoroughly clean it of all corrupt flesh; and then apply certain wrapped hot compresses, and insert them into the hollow of the fistula that you have comprehended with your hand.
And for this, they use some cautery instruments to open the space, as it is often necessary to do when the acute medicine corrodes everything that is solid in the cavity of the fistula of corruption.
And then, they restore what was damaged with ointments that promote the growth of healthy flesh until it is healed.
If it is not healed with this, then you should cauterize it according to what we have recommended.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you need to confirm this, then examine and dry it according to what we have recommended; however, do not neglect any cause related to veins or nerves or important limbs, as we have said.
If the bone is exposed and there is no infection or discoloration, then clean it until the corruption is entirely eliminated; and then care for it with ointments until it is healed.
And if the wound is not clean and flows as it should, you will know that you have not achieved the complete eradication of corruption; then uncover it again and carefully perform the reason for its treatment and purification with the last strengthening force, and then restore it.
And therefore if it is clean, then it is good; but if not, you will know that this corruption is in the deep, distant parts of the body, which has not been reached, and thus your effort in that place is only to wash it.
And if the corrupt bone is small, or it is within your power to throw it away, then throw it with subtle forceps that are suitable for this.
And if there are many bones, carefully perform the extraction of all of them, and from none of them leave any cause for your strength.
If any cause of discomfort arises from moisture, and upon examining it there is no fear or mistake, then incise those inflamed or fleshly parts, and dislocate the bones.
If you do not have the skill to extract bones from your patient, then focus on the affected area where the problem originated, and leave it until you can safely remove the infection; ensure that the wound remains open while you wait for the infection to heal, and be careful not to constrict the section you incised during your operation.
Previously, if you are hesitant, apply a hot compress or one soaked in olive oil, or with Egyptian bitter water, or any of the green oils, for when these inflammations subside, and the bones can be separated from their adhesion, and this attraction is alleviated.
If it is a large bone such as a thigh or leg bone or similar, and the corruption affects only its outer part, then carefully cut away this corrupted portion, but do not remove the whole limb; restore the wound by repairing its blackened and corrupted state.
If the part that is corrupt is great, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it becomes necessary to close and completely cut out that part in the place where the corruption has occurred, and once it is healed, treat it.
And I recommend to you that you enter into the patient's thigh to hold that in place, serving as an example and assistant to your operation.
A young man around XXX years old experiences pain in his thigh, and the pain arises from within due to an infection of the deep tissues of the body until it reaches the thigh, it is a matter of apoplexy or a great apoplexy, and not caused by an external factor.
And therefore, the duration of his suffering increases due to the error of the doctors, as the apoplexy expands, and pus-filled matter accumulates, and his treatment is prolonged until the leg becomes fistulated, causing terrible wounds that can penetrate and affect the body's moisture.
And thus many doctors have treated it for about two years, not focusing on the knowledge but on the art, since that is how you are called.
And I saw the hernia and the substances that were flowing from it through these terrible pains; and already the condition of that man was entirely stabilized, and the color of him was citron-like.
And thus you insert the probe into one of these hernias and conquer the probe with the bone.
Then you carefully examine all the hernias and find those that are causing trouble from every part of the hernia.
And thus you carefully cut and incise over one of these hernias until you discover a part of the bone, and you find that it is corrupted, hard, and degenerated; and already a part of the hernia was rotten, corrupted, and destroyed within as the material had penetrated into the mesenteries.
And then you secure what I have discovered and prepared from the exposed bone.
And I believed that it was not in the bone but that corruption which I had removed and secured, and I had already washed it away.
Then I will pause the restoration of the disease with curative medicines for a long time, and it is not consolidated.
Then I will repeat and uncover over the bone according to the first discovery, and seek any continuing corruption in the bone.
And I will secure what appears to me as that corruption, and then I will make holes in it to effect the cure and restoration, but it is not restored.
And then I will uncover it again, and I will not cease to carefully cut the bone little by little and perforate the restoration of it, but it is not restored until I cut around a palm of it, and extract that from its marrow, and then restore it with medicines, and it is slightly strengthened and healed.
And further surgery of it and its removal is not necessary unless for the arrangement of its fragility and the scarcity of its tolerance, and fear of death, because it becomes weak at all times due to excessive evacuation leading to fainting.
And thus health is achieved through complete healing, and nothing is in place of the hard bone; its arrangement in the body is good and returns its virtue; it is adjusted to its dispositions, and causes no opposition in walking or harm from any cause.
If indeed the bone protrudes from the body, then you should act as follows: take lint and tightly wrap that around the end of the protruding bone, and ask someone to extend it; then wrap a thicker lint over the first one; next, place this lint on the flesh left by the bone, and extend the tip so that you can pull the flesh away from the joints below, and uncover the flesh where you want to make the cut, so that the saw does not harm the flesh.
And place a knife or table beneath the bone, for when you do this, the saw is not hindered from cutting through the corrupt flesh.
And be careful with the sawing over the corrupt place little by little, for if the corruption is in the concave of the bone and does not appear in its sensation, you must force the saw another time.
If the bone is corrupt and not prominent, it is sometimes a continuous separation from one side to the other, and the corruption is in the middle or in part of it, then you must expose the flesh from all parts; and place a knife beneath, and saw first the one that has the corruption while continuing the sawing of the other part.
And the sawing should be according to the location of the corruption, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, cut through that corrupt joint, and bind the bone where it continues from the other side.
And if the corruption is in the connection of two joints, then it is not in their ratio but requires skill.
And if the corruption is in the chest of the hand or foot, it is very difficult; nevertheless, you must investigate where the corruption appears to you, and open it up, and remove it according to any possible disposition that is at your command, and with skill correct any deformity that does not cause you pain or affect nerves.
And you should know which saws and chisels are suitable for cutting these bones, as they depend very much on the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their subtlety, and size, and smallness, and hardness, and rarity; so that it is necessary to prepare all kinds of instruments suitable for any operation.
And you will know that this operation signifies to you regarding the nature of the instrument of which you stand in need; since you possess great learning and experience in the methods of this art, and are a witness to the ways of various ailments, at this time you will have understood what is appropriate for it among instruments for any ailment.
And in the end of this chapter, you will learn the number of instruments which you will use with examples as you proceed with your training, the very same tools that you will employ according to your experience gained from others. Form of saw:
Another form of saw:
Form of another large saw:
Form of treatment: The head of this treatment should be in the shape of a starred key, and its points are shaped like the points of a sawtooth.
And it is not appropriate to apply this treatment unless the joints' heads are rubbed when they are corrupted or the mouth is widely open.
Shape of the minor razor:
Shape of the broad razor:
Shape of another saw appropriately made: it should be curved more and its edge sharper, and the boy's hand cut cautiously with a descending motion. Form of it:
The shape of the scalpel with its concave edge:
Shape of another very thin scalpel:
Shape of another scalpel with an extremely curved end:
Shape of a small scalpel resembling a hook:
Shape of another smaller chisel:
Shape of another chisel; this one resembling a ray, with its end as sharp as a saw, and used in various places for cutting bones:
Form of cutting that is suitable for reason of one who is pierced by bones:
And the end of it is triangular and of sharp point.
And it is made of Indian steel, and in appearance it covers all the causes that we have mentioned of razors and scissors and saws.
Of the incision of the extreme points and of the locking of bones.
The extremities may be affected either intrinsically or extrinsically, or if, after treating that corruption with those remedies, the cure does not follow, or if the corruption continues to spread to other parts that do not suffer from any cause, then you must know that you should cut off that member within which this evil spreads, so that it may escape death or great harm to that part.
And the sign of that which happens is that the member becomes black where it has been cut, since fire had consumed it, or if you see the darkness increasing until it affects that part of the body which was once healthy and now consumes the entire body; therefore, make an incision on that.
And it seems to be caused by the corruption and impact of certain poisonous sources, such as from a scorpion's sting or a viper or nettle, and similar things.
And if the corruption or impact is on the end of the finger, you make an incision into the finger and do not give space to the corruption so that it does not spread to the hand.
And if it seems to affect the hand, then you make an incision at the root of the finger, and do not give space to the corruption until it takes over the entire finger of the arm.
And if you change your mind, then incise the arm inside the elbow at the joint.
And if another corruption or change surrounds the elbow, then that is the death of the patient; and to treat another cause related to it in healing requires a great deal of virtue.
And similarly, if there is corruption in the foot, then do as you would with an elbow, incising it inside one of the joints.
And if you take hold of the foot's edge, then incise the entire foot. If it is possible to enter within the toe, then incise the leg inside the joint of the toe.
And if the corruption has already spread to the toe, then it offers no cure but dismissal, leaving the patient to die.
And the method of incising or cutting off a member is that you tighten the ligament at the part which you wish to cut, and tighten another ligament over it; then extend the instrument a ligament between the parts left, and extend the minister another ligament on them; and separate the flesh which is between two ligaments without any space until all the flesh is discovered; and then it is incised or cut off.
And cover it with cloth from all sides to prevent any contact with the area, and ensure the patient's injury is aligned and healed carefully.
If bleeding occurs during the operation, you cauterize the area carefully, or apply some powders to constrict the blood flow; and then return to your treatment until it is complete.
And then attach the affected member with ligaments appropriately, and treat it until it is healed.
And I advise you to take a man in his foot, this accident which you and I have recommended, which is caused by the heat turning black on his foot resembling the burn of fire.
And that corruption is first caused in the inside of the foot, which tends to spread throughout the entire foot.
And then that man prepares himself for this treatment, as he sees the cure going to the member with the violence of his pain and heat, and he cuts into the foot at the joint, and fire heals.
Long ago, that treatment of this corruption in the foot's arch became indicated.
And then it overcomes me, and so I perforate the accumulation to reflect that superfluity with water that stops the flow of medicine, appropriating the purification of the body; and the superfluity is not reflected, and we begin to go to the other arch within that we began in the foot.
And the surgeon insists on incising the patient's hand, and I do not want to do it fearing the consequences of that superfluity, for if you do not hold back, the incision in the patient's hand will be mortal, as the virtue of the malady was about to cease.
And since he departed from me, he returned to his land and forced me to prepare and incision in the man's hand entirely, and he healed.
And I have not related this story merely to assist those who suffer from this malady, but also to explain its cause and how it should be treated.
On the treatment of fever and the quality of enemas with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in some fleshy part of the body and the space of the abscess is prolonged so as to form a collection of pus, then it is cut open and discharged, and the place remains hollow as if it were a vessel, and the skin above it is relaxed, and no further corruption penetrates, and does not affect the bone or nerves or ligaments, it is called a fever, and is not named a fistula.
However, if the space is prolonged such that the corruption encompasses an entire member, it is then called a fistula and not incurable.
And the cure for it is to incise that entire cord as it is twisted, especially when it has become subtle and is made with a thread, and ensure that it does not adhere to the area due to its corruption.
If you hope that the cord does not adhere and that that corruption does not continue due to its last consequences, and if the cord has passed through the wall, then cure it with a cloth enema.
And it is that you consider the sinuses, and if they are large, and the arm that has them emits a foul odor, then enema with Egyptian medicine made of oil, wine, and spices, adjusted in a vessel, and heated over fire until the medicine becomes hot and reaches the desired strength.
And then take from him what is necessary and dissolve it in water and honey; cleanse the affected sinus with it, tighten the orifices of the foot, and leave the medicine on it for two hours.
And then extract that precious substance; do this for as many days until the sinus is cleansed and the pain is alleviated.
In some cases, the sinus is cleansed with water from ashes, when this medicine is not available to you; take ash from a fireplace, mix it with water, and use that to cleanse the sinus until you feel that it has been cleared.
If the patient is intolerant to Egyptian medicine or ash water, then cleanse the sinus with water and honey, mixed with a third part of cinnamon; or with wine and honey, for the honey cleanses and washes, while the wine helps adhere to the sinus, especially when there is an excess of stiffness and dryness from previous treatments.
And after you have done this several times and feel that the swelling has gone down, then cleanse that area with water that helps bring forth the flesh's humors.
And indeed, you should take a mixture of dyaphinic (a medicinal substance) and dissolve that oily crust and apply it firmly; or cleanse that area with some medicines in enguent (a paste-like preparation) and others that have the properties which I have already described in the treatise on enguents.
And if the orifices of the swelling are tight through which the catheter of the cleister cannot pass, then gradually enlarge them with a small iron, and apply heat wrapped in Egyptian or basilicon enguent until they are enlarged.
And if the orifices seem to be wide enough, then you should suture the edges of them and leave as much quantity of them open as is needed for the cleister to pass through.
And if the orifice through which the arm passes is elevated above its attachment, then dry it in the lowest place on the patient, where the arm runs between, for when the arm is compressed in the depth of the shoulder, flesh is generated within it.
And if it is not possible to dry the shoulder socket within the environment of the bone at a lower place as you wish, then pierce and prepare the member so that the arm can run from it lightly according to what you have prepared and without any cause for the arm to be retained.
He who is above the opening of the sinus, which purges at all times so as to draw out what is retained in it from the arm. And so that you may know if what flows from the arm is much or little, or digested or undigested.
And thus consider the location of that sinus, whether or not the patient feels pain in it, and if there is an abscess in it.
And when your treatment is prolonged in this manner, and you see that the matter discharged from the sinus opening has become adhered, or a strong adhesion has formed, then pull it gently on the third day, and when you remove the pain, change the bandage for another one and renew the ointment.
If from the sinus a subtle, thin space is opened, do not be alarmed by the adhesion of it, for healing itself takes place, for sometimes it generates new flesh in the patient's wounds, and others experience the opposite.
And if a brash indigestion persists for several days, you will know that the intestines do not adhere; and if the adhesion of the intestines is prolonged, then adjust the treatment with drying medicines, for if the medicines are moist in their substance and virtue, they should be dried as with an astringent when there is too much superfluity added to them.
And the last part of the treatment is to take a drying agent and dissolve it in rose oil, and then apply it to the affected area, and wrap it tightly, and use it as directed.
And it seems to work even when there is no pain: take a drying agent, honey, if it is thin, use it; or take myrrh and aloe vera, mix them together and grind them into powder over fire, wrap this in cloth and apply it tightly to the intestines; and also wrap that with the honey you have noticed as thickening, and sprinkle that on the cloth and press it.
And some times they administer to him long extracts and roots of celestial lilies (celestial lilies), and flour of nettle and centaury, and use these simples either pure or mixed, triturate them and sieve and sprinkle over honey which has been recomposed; and apply it.
And if the pain persists and is not alleviated by this treatment, you will know that the corruption is in the innards of the patient, and it has affected the bones or other hard members or their connections; then you treat it with a fistular remedy, as is said above.
On the treatment of nail infections, calluses, and the addition of cuts to the finger, and its amputation.
Panarici (calluses) is an apostema (infection) that arises from the nail of the finger or toe, and it strongly affects other digits as well. When prolonged without treatment, it becomes more serious, either through cauterization or corruption. It emits a brash within that corrodes the root of the nail, and it can corrupt the entire nail, reaching the bone inside, causing a foul odor. The extremity of the finger is affected, and its color turns dark.
And therefore when you have attended to what we have mentioned in the previous section and do not confirm your treatment, remember that you must incise with a sharp instrument all the superfluity that is collected in the joint and then cauterize the wound nearby, for cautery brings relief to such things.
If the bone is strong and the joint is healthy, but the additional fluid in the joint causes the flesh to be squeezed from within, and you begin to puncture and hurt it, remember that you should make a slight cut at the angle of the joint that punctures the flesh, and push it aside, cutting the flesh easily, and apply something over it containing medicinal, corrosive substances until everything is completely removed; then treat it with ointment until it heals.
If the corruption has already penetrated into the bone, remember that you must cut into the bone and extract it, for never is a bone healed when it is corrupted within.
If rust and corruption are present in the said part, then you incise it into one of the nuts according to memory, and subsequently treat it so that it heals.
If there is an urgent need for percussion or scraping and the pain is intense, then begin by applying fleebotomes to the affected area, and carefully dry the nail with a sharp, transverse section just above it, ensuring that the cut does not penetrate the surrounding flesh, as this could cause severe pain and lead to the growth of excess tissue at the site; subsequently, treat the area to alleviate the pain.
However, this adjustment, which is natural in the bodies of many people, is characterized by a high proportion of flesh, or conversely, a predominance of bones, or yet again, a thick nail bed.
Some of them are born in the joints, or it is their nature to be present in certain nuts of the body. He who is born into certain ignorance of this knowledge will not suffer, but he who is born with weak joints is easily afflicted.
And of those who are born fleshy, the incision is slight, and you must insert your blade into their flesh at a shallow angle.
He who is born with the disease of the joint, treatment is difficult; therefore, guard against the excision of it.
In the case of those born with such ignorance, take care to make an incision at the beginning in their flesh around the bone with a round blade, and then use a suitable saw to close it, and be sure that it heals properly.
In the consolidation that occurs between the joints due to various occasions or by nature in a person who does not have them, or due to hernia or fire burn, or similar, then take care to remove that consolidation so that the joints return to their natural form.
And then place between their sheets some warmed oil so that the joints do not harden too quickly, and separate them with a thin lead sheet until they are consolidated as required.
And if similar consolidation occurs on the palm, then dry that consolidation according to what is prepared and suitable for the shape of the member.
Regarding the incision of veins, there are varicose veins.
Veins, when they become varicose, are thick, twisted veins filled with excessive melancholic fluid, which occur most commonly in the legs, especially in the calves of those who walk, work, or carry heavy loads.
So then, you will understand that you must administer a purge to the body from black choler at certain times with a strong expulsion, and also draw blood from the patient's basil vein.
The treatment of their pain is according to two methods: one is to incise and drain that black blood, and the other method is to raise the vein and extract all of it.
The incision is made according to this method: first, the leg is soaked in hot water until the thick blood clot is dissolved, which is foul-smelling from the leg, then firmly hold the patient's thigh at the superior part of the wound with a bandage, and make an incision in one, two, or three places along the vein, and raise the black blood clot using the upper part of the leg above the wound, until all the quantity desired is extracted, as much as necessary, and which the patient can endure.
And then bind it tightly, and order the patient to abstain from cold foods that generate black bile.
And repeat the treatment through phlebotomy when the veins are filled and this causes pain to the patient.
May the elevation of their legs be done in this manner: you who raise the leg of the patient, if there is much hair on it, then immerse it in water and soak the leg with warm water until the swelling goes down and the veins are relaxed; or if it has been exercised by a strong exertion, then bathe it as soon as possible while the member is still warm.
Then open the vein at the right place, either along its length or at the very end, or at the lowest part of it, and remove the blood.
Then cut the vein with scissors and remove it from all parts until it disappears, and you must observe the color of it; if it declines to blackness, that is a sign of grave illness.
And therefore, after you have removed the vein and the blood, examine that white part to see if there is any hardness.
And then you insert your fingers into the space so that it is raised and freed from the tie, and suspend those with hot clay or lion's dung.
Then make another incision, perpendicular to the first, and carefully cut the tie away from the vein until it appears.
Then raise that one and incise it in the rear section, after the leg, extract it and raise it until it comes out through the second incision, and extract it from the section above that one.
And do this until you extract the one from the highest or most superior section of all the incisions, ensuring that all are drained, and then incise it.
And if you fail to extract and raise it, then insert a strong, double-threaded needle into the space and draw it out, or insert your fingers into the space and turn your hand over until it is freed. And be careful not to cut; for if it is broken, it is difficult to raise that part and it comes back to the patient through that damage.
And once everything has been removed, apply to the affected area a mixture of vinegar and rose oil and unmixed oil, and treat that until it is healed.
And if the vein is contracted without twisting in which it is wrapped, and not straight according to what we have said, then you must cut into that part of its entire tortuosity and at the places where it wraps itself, and with a stitch raise that whole thing.
And be careful not to cut the vein and do not damage it, for it will be difficult to raise that; and use your discretion in that.
The form of the injury which is dried out:
It is not as sharp as with wounds, nor does it have an acute extremity so as not to damage the vein; and it has a thick flexibility, because if it were too thin, it would pierce the vein due to its thinness; it has a superfluous thickness as we have said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the thigh.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot regions, as well as in the hernia on Arabic land and in the hot, dry lands of India with little greenery or openness.
And very few are generated in other parts of the body, other than the legs.
And the process of putrefaction occurs when cold humors infiltrate the body, bringing serpents and worms and parasites that are born between the feces and flesh.
And the sign of the impending arrival of gout is this: what happens in the leg is a violent inflammation; then the place becomes sore; and soon the vein begins to leave the area of that soreness, which seems torn from the plant itself.
And when the gouty inflammation appears, you will see that it envelops a part of the leg like a piece of lead from which a dragon's weight would hang. Within this dragon, there is a space, and you should notice and leave the lead suspended from the leg.
And on many occasions, when you encounter some unknown cause of this pain outside the body, you should envelop it in lead and note that. And if the movement persists, you cut a part of it and wrap the wound; do not incise the deep one until it is completely detached, for if you do, it will contract and penetrate into the flesh, causing abscesses, gangrene in the area, and bad ulcers.
As the treatment progresses and it is extracted little by little, make sure that it completely comes out from behind (the affected area) and do not leave any cause of it remaining in the body.
And from this vein, some men are affected in its length reaching up to their wrists and even beyond; it has also been observed that I have seen one case where it extended for 10 palms.
And if it is incised during treatment, insert the ray into the channel of the vein and pierce that long channel in the flesh, so that all that is in the matter is evacuated, and apply putrefaction to the place for some days with medicines; then take care of it for the cure of abscesses.
And this vein is sometimes seen with great swelling, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or on the foot, and it causes much painful sensation, and is derived from every painful point.
And therefore, treat that as we have said in the division and refer to what is mentioned above.
From the section about worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine itching.
This malady is called bovine itching in many lands, because it causes great distress to the animal; it is caused by a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh, and it affects all over the body, pushing and weakening (the muscles and tissue), and its manifestation appears first in the withdrawal of the limbs until it ruptures the skin and lets out the worm.
And the generation of these worms is due to the corruption of certain humors, which cause worms and snakes and roundworms and tapeworms in the belly.
And it is feared by the evil of it, for when it enters the body and rises to the head, it reaches the eyes, severely affecting them and even destroying them, which should be prevented.
And therefore when you want to cure it and extract it, you must not do so unless you understand its movement and appearance in the body, and then grasp what is above it and what remains below it with strong compression, and afterwards dry it and extract that which is inside it.
And if it is embedded in the flesh and does not disturb you, then place a hot cautery over the place where it resides, and the main cause that is feared is the corruption of it which also corrupts the place as we have said.
If it affects the eyes or their vicinity, then tighten the upper eyelid with strong pressure, dry it and extract that which is inside; and know that this malady uses purification of the body through medicines that evacuate corrupt, bad humors, and beware of foods causing putrefaction.
On cutting away from the disease.
This disease is called "nafir" in our land, and it is pain that appears in some members, and then it changes from one member to another.
And you have already seen that second one that I recommended. You were called to attend a female patient in a village, and upon examining her arm, you discovered a small inflammation in the vein at the wrist, which had been broken for an hour. As it was healing, you noticed that the inflammation moved from one place to another, appearing almost like living silver as it spread from one location to another.
And then he removed the pain from that place and applied pressure to the muscle, holding it for an hour.
And then correct in the other body until you reach the other arm.
And then I found myself turning over the body, examining it entirely as I had seen; and I was too amazed by the permutation of the illness and by the speed with which it moved from one member to another. And I had already seen this in my own feet according to that manner, however, I have seen many which cause severe pain to be changed from one member to another. You do not see this in the feet of women as well.
And I do not think that this is for any other reason than because the woman was old, with dry skin and exposed veins, and in this condition, the sensation of that changed wind appears.
And it is necessary that this retrospective cure not be apparent in those who are weak and have a moist body with veins close to the surface.
And if you wish to cure the patient and they feel that pain, then it is not apparent as we have said, but you should strengthen over that area and gently pull it, and let it rest, and apply heat to that place until that airiness is reduced, and cauterize the location.
If you do not find them in your heels, then cure that by relieving the body and what expels airiness, and bind those with foul-smelling pills and pills of serpent and similar things.
From the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diverse according to their species and the parts of the body they pierce, for their diversity lies in that some have large tips, and small ones, and concave, and dull points, all of which are solid; and others have three angles, and others tongues, and still others barbs.
And among the signs of the disease, it is when the arrow strikes in it and penetrates the bone, and a puff emerges from the cyphac (the part above the brain), due to the violent heat, causing scotoma (darkness in the field of vision), vertigo, pain in the legs, inflammation and pain in the tongue, spasms, confusion of speech, and vomiting of bile. When this is severe, word is cut off and voice is destroyed. From the affected area, a white humid discharge resembling powder emerges, and it feels like flesh.
And if these signs appear to you, then abstain from treatment and extraction of the arrow, unless it is protruding.
If the arrow enters the heart, so that it is close to the left nipple, and you feel a hard cause of pain, not visible; if the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of the pulse, and the flow of black plague blood, and there is coldness in the extremities, and shortness of breath, and fainting; then know that death is at hand.
And the signs when the arrow has wounded the lung, appear as pus from the plague, and the vessels near the collarbone are inflamed, and there is a change in the patient's complexion, and they breathe heavily, and ask for fresh air.
And if the arrow strikes the tendon in the leg, and the pain is close to the small ribs, it causes great pain with violent sobs, and all the muscle members are not completely relaxed.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, then strong vomiting occurs from the undigested food.
And if the arrow pierces the abdomen and becomes lodged there, it causes a tear in the organs, or tissue, or hernia, and there is no hope for its cure unless the arrow is removed.
And if the arrow strikes the bladder and urine leaks out, it causes pain from some internal cause, and intense pain is felt by the patient; then you will know that it is fatal.
The other parts of the body, such as the face, neck, head, shoulders, elbows, back bones, hip joint, and legs, can also be saved according to proper disposition when the arrow does not strike a vein or artery and is not a poisonous arrow.
And now I will relate to you what I have observed about these arrows, so that you may understand their use in treatment.
The cause is that when an arrow strikes the lacrimal gland of a man in the root of his nose and it is extracted from him in another place, leaving the bones of his eyebrow intact, he recovers and there is no further damage to his nose.
And another arrow was extracted from a Jew, which had struck him in the bones of his nose, leaving the eyelid intact, and the arrow was concealed and could only be retrieved with a small extremity to which it adhered, and it was a large arrow among the sharp arrows of the Turks, capable of penetrating a lion without leaving an auricle.
And the Jew recovered, without any further damage to his nose.
And then extract another arrow from a Christian man who had been hit in the groin, which was an Arab arrow, and it is that one with feathers; and then I incise it between two guides, and it was already submerged in the patient's groin; and then I gently remove it, and thus the Christian is healed.
And I also extracted another arrow from a man who had been hit in his belly, and I thought he would die from it; so, after we had passed thirty days and nothing changed about his conditions, I incise the arrow and carefully removed it, and thus he was healed, without any further harm.
And I saw a man in whom an arrow had struck his back and the wound was deeply embedded; after applying fire nearby for some time, I pulled out the arrow at the base of the wound.
And I saw a woman in whom an arrow had struck her belly, and the wound was deeply embedded within, and it did not change in appearance for a long time, and the woman did not suffer much in any of her natural functions.
And he sees another man with an arrow in his face, the wound is deep and the arrow breaks, causing little pain but much similarity to these.
And they removed the arrow from the man of the king's princes who was wounded in the middle part of his nose and had already inclined to the right side a little, and the entire arrow was hidden.
And you were called upon for the cure, so close the wound of the arrow within three days.
Then you should examine the wound of the arrow very closely; then you should inquire about that attempt subtly, and not feel it; but he felt a sharp pain leaving the right ear, and then hoped that this pain was due to the end of the arrow.
And you applied the place with a plaster that is attractive and digestive, trusting that it would heal the location where the arrow was wounded, so that it would dry up over that.
And do not make any incision at the site of the accident that the arrow has reached; continue to apply poultice over it for several days and no accidents occur; as the wound consolidates, break up the pain from the extraction of the arrow in intervals of several days until one day you feel the arrow within its base and I reconnect it there.
And then you should pause over the wound with acute corrosive medicine for several days until a fire opens up, and you should gently try to remove it, and cut back the tip of the arrow, which adheres to the wood.
Then you should adjust the opening of the wound with that acute medicine until I visually see the tip of the arrow, and I spend time on it for intervals of time over four months.
Then you should press that the wound becomes enlarged, and I attempt to insert scissors into it, and hold them, and do not be concerned about appearance. You will no longer need to subtilize and ingeniously devise methods on that account until one day through these ingenious methods, you manage to pull it out using forceps meticulously crafted, as the form of those will come at the end of this chapter, until I extract it; and then you should restore that wound.
And some physicians judged that the nasal cartilage would not be restored, and they have restored it so that the disease is consolidated, and health is achieved throughout the body, and there will be no relapse in it for any reason.
And I recommend to you the quality of extraction of some arrows so that it maintains this rule and meaning regarding what I have not mentioned, for the parts of this art and the definitions of those others are not understood from the narrative nor do those comprehend the book.
And the skilled artisans speak little about what is present and much about what is absent; and from what is presented, they infer what is absent; and they discover new operations and new instruments for the descent of foreign causes in the art when accidents occur.
Therefore, you say that arrows are not expelled from the members in which they are inserted but according to two manners: either by attraction of the place where they enter; or on the contrary of the other part.
And that which is discharged from the place where it enters, or is a dart proceeding in fleshy places, and is thrown out and voided.
And if you do not adhere to the timing of when cats are eaten, then know that you leave it for a few days so that the flesh around it decays and the attraction of it and its exit are alleviated.
And similarly, if it becomes stuck in the bones and you do not adhere to its prescribed eating timing, leave it for a few days, and on another day, repeat the process of discharge, and it will be voided out.
And if you do not adhere to your prescribed eating every few days, then know that you must pierce the path of the dart in that bone, gradually widening the area where the dart is located, and then extract it.
If the arrow is already lodged in the body and is affecting a vital area, then examine that attempt, and if you feel any pain, use some suitable tools to attract and remove it.
And if you cannot reach it due to the constriction of the plague and the length of the arrow, here there are neither nerves nor veins, then you must work on the plague until it is enlarged and it is possible to extract the arrow.
And if there are ears attached that are stuck, then you must carefully cut away the flesh in which they are embedded from all sides using every possible tool; and devise a plan to remove the meat from the fracture of the ears and their twisting until it becomes easier.
And when you perform the extraction of the arrow in any place, then use your hand with forceps at all times to make it give way; and act with great subtlety so that the arrow is not broken and can be easily removed along with it.
And if you cannot reach that of your own accord, then wait for a few days until the parts that are in the path of the arrow can be moved, and then repeat the attempt when the pain has subsided. If a cold or fever disrupts your flow of blood, then administer what we have said about treatment in its chapter.
And observe your skill in cutting veins or nerves, or strings, and use all means at your disposal to facilitate the escape of the arrow; do this with ease and calmness and delay and firmness as much as you can and as recommended by your physician.
And therefore, contract the arrow so that the malady aligns with the figure according to which you must aim the tip of the arrow, for it is more beneficial. If this is not within your ability, then administer what you can do according to the figures.
Also, the arrows that are shot in opposition to another party, or which have already pierced any part of the exterior parties, or make the end of the arrow thin by virtue of the force applied beyond the designated cord, then you must focus on it; and cut it according to the quantity in which the pincers grasp it; and then shoot it, for it is made light with regard to penetration.
If it is held in the bone, then you cut with a knife according to the direction of the arrow that penetrates into the bone, amplifying the cut and then extract it.
And if that does not heal within a few days, then repeat the procedure as often as necessary.
And if the point of the arrow is in that place, then push it towards the opening.
If the point has fallen and you want to give impulsion, then insert a fine instrument and, if it is blunt, strike it firmly into the cavity of the bone at the base of the arrow and push it towards the opening.
If the arrow is concave, then push it strongly towards the instrument, as the arrow is displaced by that.
If the arrow is embedded deeply, you must press into all the flesh in which it is lodged, as much as you can, and then treat the wound as best suits the case.
If the arrow strikes the foot, or the abdomen, or the bladder, or the side, and it is close to a sensitive area that you can touch, and it is possible for you to remove it without causing damage to blood vessels or nerves, then remove it and treat the wound as needed, and bind it if the injury is deep, and care for it until it heals.
Design of forceps used for extracting arrows:
Their ends should be shaped like a bird's beak, made with a serrated edge to grasp the arrow firmly so that it does not slip loose.
And they are made in various shapes and sizes, coarse and fine, according to the thickness of the arrow and its fragility, and the extent of the wound, and the tightness of the area affected.
thus with pressure, so that the intrusion of it into the concave arrow is alleviated and it is driven away from that place.
On phlebotomy of the veins.
The veins of phlebotomy from which it is customary to draw blood, are two pulsating veins located near the ears, called the temporal arteries; two veins appearing on both temples; and two veins in the lower eyelid of each eye, called the lacrimal veins; a vein located in the middle part of the forehead, and one in the tip of the nose; two veins at the nape of the neck; and two veins on the lower lip; and two veins on the upper lip; these are called the jugular veins. And there are also two veins beneath the tongue. When the veins that are flebotomized in the arms, of which one is cephalic and requires wild lettuce; and the people call it "the vein of the head," and also "the sordid vein," and it is the middle vein, composed of a branch of the basilica and another from the cephalic; and the people name that the "vein of the whole body," the basilica is the vein which is located in the axilla and is called "citular"; and the common people call them "the abdominal vein"; and the funis of the arm, which is situated over the fossa, is the one where flebotomy is performed, and it is the one that appears on the skin through manifest indication; and salvatella, this is the vein located between the aforementioned auricular and the smaller one below, and it is double.
And on the foot and leg there are three veins; one of them is left at the curvature of the inner side of the wild lettuce; the second is superficial, and its location is left of the domestic leg bandage; and the sciatic vein, whose location is left of the wild lettuce bandage; and in the bandage there are other veins similar to those.
The treatment of veins that are close to the auricles is ancient therapy for inflammation, migration, and healing of old sores and ulcers on the head.
And the method of bleeding should be as follows: it is best to cut the scalp of the patient directly above the veins, and rub the scalp of the patient on both sides at the location where the veins are close to the skin, using ample friction; tighten the bandage around the patient's head so that both locations appear to have the auricles in two distinct parts from the rest of the head; if you wish to follow this method, and if you feel the pulse of the blood flow as described above, then proceed.
Next, take the sharp scalpel and insert it into the vein in the neck until the flailotomy (a procedure to stop bleeding by severing a blood vessel) reaches the bone. Then, raise your hand over the vein and neck, and make an incision in the vein with the sharp wound. And the length of the incision should be about two fingers around it, and make the cut as deep as desired.
Then apply strong poultices and leave them until the wound is healed.
And as for the beginning of this book, it describes the incision of those parts and their cauterization.
However, of the two veins and arteries that are located near the temples, the jugular vein is an ancient and severe evil, causing frequent headaches and acute overflowing of fluids in the eyes.
And the quality of performing a fleubotomy on those parts depends on what you have been taught: compress the patient's neck until the two veins appear by direct observation and are clearly demonstrated, and then carefully proceed.
And then, raise the chain over the vein at the indicated point above, insert the sharp phlebotomy instrument beneath it, and elevate the vein; cut it likewise as you have done with the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to your need's quantity.
And then, apply pressure to the patient's compression, rest the indicated point on the vein for an hour, and apply warmth and strength to that area until it is healed.
And now follows the recall of their memories, and from those, incision, and attraction at the commencement of relief.
And thus, the application of phlebotomy to the vein of the forehead is appropriate phlebotomy of the cephalic vein for ancient ailments of the face and to migraines, fevers, and foul ulcers.
And the quality of the flebotomy on the patient depends on what you have learned; so, the disease tightens its collar with a bandage until the vein appears; then take the instrument called a "sower" whose shape it is.
Stop the puncture at the prominent point of the sower over that vein and strike it with a lean or other tool in the manner of its use, and let the blood flow according to the amount you wish; then remove the perforation from the patient's illness and tighten it until it is healed.
And in some cases, the vein is opened with a wide flebotomy, but it is not appropriate for acute flebotomies as with other flebotomies, but rather from a distant extremity, and the vein is flebotomized according to its transversality, because the bone is very close and strong, and it would break in a delicate flebotomy.
However, the youth of the two veins that are the tears of both eyes due to irritation of the eye by sand and sebaceous matter in the eyes, and to illnesses of the face.
And the quality of the flebotomy is that the disease tightens the collar around it, then you make a flebotomy on those parts, and you stand over the head of him.
And the flebotomy is made according to the transverse direction along a little flebotomy, for in the place there is no flesh; and if the flebotomy is subtle, then only a little of its end is cut off.
Then make the incision of the hernia as much as necessary, and apply pressure on that side, and tighten it for a night, then release it.
The flebotomy of the nasal vein is effective for high fever and violent thirst, and for facial ailments, migraines, and redness that occur on the face, especially when it is long-standing.
And the quality of this flebotomy is that the disease tightens its collar, and you take hold of its nose with your left hand, take a long subtle flebotomy, placing it in the middle part of the nose according to straightness; for the vein does not appear sensitive here, and soon the hernia begins to flow.
Ensure that you complete the fistula operation slowly with your hand and let the blood flow according to need; then close it up gradually for a night, as it is restored more easily.
The healing of the fistula from both operations should be facilitated by restricting alcohol and beginning leprosy treatment, as well as addressing other maladies, acute or chronic, and corrosive ulcerations with potent remedies.
And the quality of the fistula in those cases is that the disease tightens them all in their place with adhesion; and the surgeon should be on top of the patient's head, and the patient should lie on their side.
Then make a small fistula in the vein of the thigh with a wide fistula; and then drain the blood slowly according to the season or as much as necessary for that purpose; and then make it similar to the other vein.
And then apply a bandage, tighten the two veins with moderate compression to prevent the disease from spreading, and leave it within the bandage until the plague is healed.
And also regarding the jugular vein phlebotomy, it is useful for small apths and pustules in the mouth, and the corruption of the gums and bad ulcers and fissures, as well as bad ulcers in the nose and around the anus.
And the quality of the phlebotomy for these is that it stops the disease in front of you, tightens the neck with a bandage, and then turns back the lips and looks at both veins, of which one is on the right side of the lip and the second on the left; and the indication for each is due to the darkness of both, and this is because there are small veins in their vicinity; and therefore you cut each one with a sharp knife.
If there is doubt left, and you do not know which one it is, then enter into incision of the greatest among them, and from the most manifest pus of those.
And make it seem like the two veins that are on their lips.
If both veins that are on the tongue are left, then perform phlebotomy of the cephalic vein at its proximities that are in the throat, to the malady of the uvula, and to maladies of the mouth.
And the quality of phlebotomy for those is to follow the disease among your fingers before the sun, and elevate the tongue, and observe beneath the tongue, from one side of the vein and the other, and the color of each is declining towards blackness.
And then make incisions on each one; and be careful not to cut off the arteries with your knife, as they are still pulsating.
And your veins that are fleubotomized in the thigh are those through which blood usually flows in all men. The fleubotomy of them is made in two ways: either by applying a heated instrument or gently declining; or by using a cutaneous fleubotomy, and this is called arteriotomy, and this is the form of it.
both the thickness of it should be such as to open the concave veins that are full, proceeding apparently thickly, and towards those that contain thick clots.
And this flébotomy is of lesser extent and more delicate extremity, and it is suitable for the flébotomy of fine veins that contain subtle citrus blood.
However, the young of the flébotomy of the basil vein, which is one of three veins: here you extract the blood from the malady that remains in the gullet and colon, and from this, the leg and belly are drained.
And it is necessary for the flébotomist, when performing that flébotomy, to guard well over that area and be very careful in that area, because if he leaves an artery there or makes a mistake in the puncture of the flébotomy, he will incise that artery and cause a flow of blood, so it is important that he does not perform that flébotomy with a sharp tool, but rather with a secant.
And if the stone does not appear through a clear indication, you must leave that one and move to another, or seek some help; or cut into the flesh in place of the stone at the end of the arm, since it is manifest; and then cut out the stone as we have said.
If you wish to perform a flebotomy on the patient, first identify the tightness in the arm and locate the spot between the wrists, then apply pressure over it; bend the arm and cut the vein with a concave incision as we have said; be careful not to touch the area of the artery.
And when you feel, with pressure, an inflation in the spot that you have marked with your hand, then that inflation is inflammation of the artery, and therefore avoid it.
And if you feel the blood flow in the flebotomy as with an ear of corn, and the flow is delicate, then know that it is from the artery's flow; then tie and stop the thread over a long space; and close the thread, and if the clot is severed, since the veins are severed, tighten the arm and leave it.
And watch over the patient from the moisture of their body, be extremely careful with them and do not harm them for a few days until they are healed.
If the gangrenes do not separate and you are not immediately present with medicine for it, then you will need to incise the artery if it appears to you; because the end of the limb is contracted and the gangrene is separated; or you take a piece of cloth, make a tie from it, tighten it around the location of the vein with stricture, and apply pressure within the next day.
And if the gangrene is separated, then it is good; and if not, treat that with the water as mentioned before in the recall of the location of the powdered gangrene's flow.
And the removal of the gangrene from them is difficult due to their disposition and the location of the plague, as well as the possibility of ligament in the arm.
From the dark vein, phlebotomy is useful for extracting blood from the upper part of the head and leaving it from the lower parts of the body; for this reason, it is composed of branches of the basilic vein and branches of the cephalica, as we have said.
And be wary of the phlebotomist who is overzealous in performing phlebotomy, for there is a nerve involved; and then, upon finding the nerve, the phlebotomist will experience stupor, making healing difficult, and strong individuals may not recover fully. This nerve causes sensations; if it is hidden in some men and is subtle and not evident, you must pause and consider the phlebotomy with which you are about to cut and avoid the nerve with all your strength.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then cut the vein along its length.
The advantage of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and provides relief from ailments of the feet.
And in this case, if you want to perform a phlebotomy using a olive or myrrh phlebotomizer, it is because the blood is safe from all veins, as there are no arteries or nerves left.
However, in some cases, if the inflammation does not subside even after the first phlebotomy, do not pay attention to that sign of inflammation.
The first sentence translates to: "The first [point] is that you must know that amputation of a limb is not carried out except in the interest of health and with the hope of saving a patient, and it is performed on one of the veins located in the thigh, namely: the cephalic, femoral, or basilic; it is carried out at the beginning of spring, after breakfast in spring and autumn, and during winter, when signs of repletion appear.
And amputation should be performed on the third day or the first poust (after midnight) following the onset of pain.
Amputation may be performed at any time of day or night, whenever it is convenient and necessary, whether during the day or in the evening.
And note that children should not undergo amputation until they are at least 13 years old, women who are pregnant should not be amputated unless it is necessary after the fourth month of pregnancy, and the elderly, those who have already passed 60 years, should not undergo amputation.
And when someone wishes to be flebotomized in any way, it is advisable that he purify his veins with a lion's clister, if there is a wide fissure retained, so that the veins do not throw off the superfluity during the flebotomy of the veins, which are pure, and do not affect the main members.
And patients should not be flebotomized if they are naive, ignorant, or excessive in eating and drinking, nor should they avoid illness or madness until this is remedied, nor ill health from hydrops, and it is better to delay flebotomy unless there is a passing colic, vomiting, pain in the abdomen, multiplied thigh, leg, or body work, or exercise during meals or vigils, or any cause that weakens strength, either in the human or animal body.
And it is advisable to consider the subtlety of humors in this regard if the swelling is due to heavy food and drink, or medicines if it is possible for them to contribute to it.
And then immerse yourself in a bath if some cause does not prohibit it, or if exercised for some activity so that the inflammation is reduced.
And stop the phlebotomy on the patient's leg at about the third hour of the day, as we have said.
And pierce that foot, which should be watched on that day from all animal misfortunes, as when there is anger, fear, or any physical misfortune, and when there is excessive work and pain, similar to them.
And at his bedside, let the causes be present of which the usual corroding and destructive habits of men are composed, odorous and balmy, and similar to those according to the amount of possibility.
And follow the phlebotomist over another cushion that is pus, rather than the one of the patient who was to be bled.
And then extract the arm, and rub it with your hand using the flebotomator two or three times; and tighten the ligament with a belt and wrap it two times.
And whether the constriction is temperate, where the constriction is not equal, or the constriction is excessive, then prohibit the flow of the blood; or it is for softening, and then prohibit the movement of the blood entirely.
And then apply the constriction, ensuring that whoever has been flebotomized rubs their hands together between each other until the veins are inflated and visible to the touch.
And then the flebotomist should apply a small amount of ancient oil to their flebotomy, place their left hand's finger on the vein, slightly moving it away from where the flebotomy is desired, so that the vein bulges slightly and the percussion is lessened; for veins are often found to be full of air when the flebotomy is performed on them, and they contract when the flebotomy is applied, and the flebotomist should withdraw their finger; if the flebotomy breaches the vein, it will become constricted.
And therefore, it is necessary that the fleubotomator (bloodletter) be prepared and ready for all these causes.
And then, after the fleubotomi (bloodletting), if the vein is swollen at once, it is good; but if not, repeat this another time, moving to a different spot, or apply pressure with a compress, if the location is not tender.
If the location is tender or the illness worsens, then leave it for a day or two, and do not strain the limbs, as this will cause severe tenderness, nor should you immerse it in water.
And then repeat the fleubotomi if necessary.
And if you observe a small and subtle opening, and fear that the amount (of blood) will not increase as desired, then repeat the fleubotomi at that spot according to rectitude, and adjust the compression slightly, applying pressure before the location becomes tender, because in many people, slight compression is sufficient.
It may be that the already-formed appendage does not interest you, as it is not due to any cause, and apply some oil from any part of the fissure, as it soothes the body's pain. And it is better at this place than oil and other oils.
And it seems that the application of oil in all fleubotomy, by which venesectioners remove veins to prevent body pain, is a very ancient and wise practice when one of those is placed over the location, because the pain withdraws and rotates when it is thick.
And if a great abscess is formed in the location of fleubotomy, as it often happens, especially to those who have not bled much but only bleeding has occurred, or at the sight of a few veins, then you cut, and place a sponge soaked in water and salt on the spot, slightly heated, and tighten it for an hour, as it dissolves.
And then he should close this by filling it with the blood from that vein or another vein.
And if after some days a blackness or greenish color appears, do not notice it; and if you wish, apply to that place some mixture of aloe and myrrh, or some kind of mint juice or warming agent similar to it.
And sometimes accidents happen, requiring the removal of abscesses and prominences through phlebotomy in the basilic.
And so place your hand over it, and if you feel hardness, your compression should be on that part, for then the prominence is a sign of ill health; and therefore be careful to apply yourself to any cause of this that we have mentioned, for strong blood flow will come from the sanatory artery.
And make an embrocation on the place where there is stiffness, so that the part will be enduring, and take care of the other remedies as they are being applied until it is healed.
And take care to extract the pus from everyone entirely according to the quantity of its virtue and according to the dominant color appearing on the wound.
If the wound is black, leave it to drain until it becomes pus; similarly, if it appears thick, leave it to drain until it becomes thin; and if it is acute, until its sharpness subsides.
And be mindful of one who is full and strong, and needs immediate extraction of pus from a wound: amplify the incision of the vein and make the flebotomies wide.
And for one who is weak, do the opposite: extract the pus in multiple stages, and make the incision tight.
The best approach for venipuncture is the transverse section, not the puncture.
And in this manner of phlebotomy, it is free from the flow of blood and the incision of nerves, and it is more laudable and more safe than phlebotomy according to latitude and length.
And to which it is accustomed for syncope to occur after phlebotomy, and know that you should cure that before phlebotomy with a little wine infused in milky or plain oxymel, and draw out the blood from him in three or four draws.
And if it is a cold of congestion, then take before phlebotomy wine infused in myrrh or in honey-water aromated with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger and the like, or in aromatic water highly perfumed.
And if syncope occurs after phlebotomy and it is caused by the sudden loss of much blood, then know that you should take in small sips of water with some fragrant wine; and use aromatics such as galangal, and apply a cold compress to their feet or to the affected area.
And use other causes that we have mentioned in the division in the chapter of fainting for evacuation.
And here he will extend his arm and dissolve the gangrened part a second time, choosing from it the place for flebotomy as the main evacuation, and its virtue is cold, which evacuates the small gangrene little by little, according to the quantity of virtue in the continuous days.
If one wishes to extend their arm and remove the gangrene a second time, and their body is strong, then do this approximately seven or eight hours after the first flebotomy.
One who wishes to throw the gangrene from their body in the opposite direction of the decline it has taken, should do so on the second or third day after it was first extended.
As for the body in which there is much gangrene that has already formed a crust and is acute and causes fever, it should be evacuated all at once, and a large amount of pus should be removed, and the sight of the wound should be enlarged, so that syncope does not occur, because you will have preserved all the conditions for flebotomy; and you should place your hand on the gangrene's pulse to prevent death from syncope, as frequent repetitions are necessary when the flebotomist is ignorant or negligent.
And when you wish to loosen the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, after the orifices of the vein have already been closed and it has become difficult to draw out the blood, press down on that part with great force and gently bend it outwardly, for this is too painful.
Habitize the layssa (wound) as it is a flebotomism secondarily; or remove this with the acute-ness of the flebotomy that coagulates the blood in the orifice of the vein; or place your hand over that of tyriaca alfarach, or of sage, and make light compression until the blood has completely drained out.
And if the vein is infected, wound it (the area) and do not touch it until the infection has subsided.
And if it is necessary to evacuate the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then you may bleed him at that place or on the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "funnel of the arm" is punctured in place of the brachial or basilic, when they are not found or are obscured, as it is composed of those.
And the quality of the phlebotomy is that the patient inserts their hand into the water, causing the wound to clot and the vein to appear clearly.
Then apply pressure to that stricture with a tight bandage; and perform the phlebotomy by making a small transversal cut, not longitudinally or laterally.
And the incision should be wide, and your phlebotomy should be such that you perform it on the joint of the hand with a small cut.
And if the flow of blood is stopped, then insert your hand into the water again and let the blood run in the water until you achieve your need.
If you were in the summer days, then you are excused from the journey of the hand in cold water, and in winter, the body of the sun is most relaxed in cold water at that time.
And the flap of this vein is much safer than that of all other veins, because it has neither pulsating nor nervous elements.
And the phlebotomy of the saphenous vein of the right hand is indicated for liver diseases.
And the quality of this phlebotomy is that you should tighten your hand strongly or hold it firmly, as you have placed it in cold water, so that the vein becomes inflated and clearly visible to the eye; then perform a transverse incision on that vein; and if you make an incision completely, it will not bleed again.
And remember not to cut off your hand during the phlebotomy, because it contains the nerves of the digit naked of flesh.
And then repeat the hand in the warm water and let the san (blood) flow through that, for if you do not repeat that in the warm water, the blood will clot in the orifice of the vein, and it is forbidden to flow.
And after the blood is extracted according to the amount needed, you should place your hand on the vein gently and use oil and salt, so that it is not hardened excessively; and be careful that you do this in a narrow space.
But the care after the flebotomy of this with the left hand, is applicable to the diseases of the chest.
And do the same in the flebotomy of the other, as you have done in this one.
And the care after the vena saphena flebotomy is for diseases that are at the edges of the body, as well as for diseases of the mother, and to retain menstruation, and for maladies of the veins and ulcers of limbs and old bands, and similar to the diseases.
And the quality of the foot surgery is that the patient immerses their foot in water and friction until the veins appear; it is tied over the joint of the foot with a strap; the location of the vein becomes visible after this, and from there it branches out across the surface of the foot in numerous directions.
And therefore, make the incision wide enough to remove the hernia through the opening in the thigh, as this is better and more effective.
And if you perform a foot surgery on the surface of the foot, be careful to avoid the nerves that are left there over the surface of the foot, and position your incision carefully so as not to cut into them while performing the surgery across.
And the surgery should be successful.
If it is forbidden to elevate the foot, then immerse it in water and let the blood flow out until it is evacuated.
And if the flebotomist misses on the first attempt, he should repeat the phlebotomy on another part, since the place is clean; and do not fear any ill effects, but be careful with the nerves as we have said.
And it seems to do the same thing on the other foot equally.
And for sciatic vein, the place as we have said is the sole, where the calf muscle joins the tibia, a point known as the 'wild departure'.
And the incision of phlebotomy on him is at hip pain when it is for a severe condition.
And the quality of the phlebotomy on him is that it lets the patient's illness enter a bath, quickly and intensely relaxing his body from the wide surface of his foot down to four sides with a thin, long band, so that only this appears.
And therefore when it appears, you perform a bloodletting on that part according to each method that is within your ability and according to the direction, which is best; either puncture it with an incision or cut it off through secction, since the location of it is accessible.
It is in most people quite painful; and if you find it, not showing any sensation at all, perform a bloodletting on some of its branches, and this is the one that appears on the back of the foot instead of the big toe or the little finger.
And be mindful of the nerves, and allow the blood to flow from the wound as much as you wish.
Then release the pressure and place your hand over the site of the bloodletting gently, as rest is essential for healing.
Of ventilation and the qualities of use of those things.
Vents are of corns, or of iron, or of glass.
Ventilation is performed in two ways: one involves lancing and draining the pus, and the other is through ventilating the wound by lancing it.
And this ventilation, which is through lancing, is performed in two ways: either with fire or without fire.
And the ventilations that are performed by lancing and draining pus are in twelve places of the body, of which one is the place where ventilations are paused, and it is the last opening at the top of the head; another opening on each side of the neck; ventilations under the jaw, leaving the mandible below the mouth; ventilations in two places on the shoulder blades; ventilations in the loins, over the end of the coccyx; ventilations in two hollows, at a distance of two arms' length; ventilations through two pins; and ventilations through two cushions.
And the extraction of the wind should not be from small veins scattered in the flesh, and thus does not catch the virtue through them, as it is done in phlebotomy; nor should one cover that a wind is done with fire or use fire in any illness caused by congestion until the body is completely evacuated.
If it is necessary to provoke wind for an illness or continuously, we should begin at the onset of the month and its end, in the middle part of the day and at any time.
And therefore when pain appears for any cause among those, and especially if it is in the third or middle of the month, then ventilation should be performed immediately rather than waiting two or three hours past the day.
And the immediate relief from ventilation of the neck is that when it relieves pressure on the head and what sinks into the pits, it is more effective than anything else for clearing out all parts of the body.
And this ventilation is at the site of phlebotomy in the head.
And it is not advisable to use that which is of bad quality or has catarrh, as it causes great harm to the patient.
And for that reason, one should not use those instruments, and on the heads of which severe illnesses are present.
May he who is lying on his back feel no pain; and for this reason, you must command the nurse to place her hand slightly on the suction cups at the points left open, lest there be generation of forgetfulness.
The use of cupping (ventozacio) from alkahol is in place of phlebotomy of the deep vein and basilic: and thereby it confers relief from asthma, constriction of the alveoli and the cutting of the air tool, coughing, and congestion.
And it is necessary that the alkahol cupping be slightly pressed, for if it is left paused, it generates weakness in the body and stomach.
And the cupping from alhagdahan confers relief from accidental pain in the head and eye, migraine, and pre-focal pain, and pain in the roots of the teeth; and it is in place of phlebotomy of the basilic.
And beware that you command the fan to not press his hand during the incision so as not to pierce the artery and cause bleeding.
The ventilation of the mind is facilitated by alcohol in the mouth, and it helps to heal gingival corruption and resembles the conditions of oral diseases that occur in both lips, serving as an alternative to phlebotomy.
However, the ventilation that is performed on both palm spaces provides relief through repleting warmth.
And the ventilation of the two spaces within the fossae provides immediate relief from phlebotomy of three veins, namely the basilic, femoral, and cephalic, as those attract the blood from all the smaller veins in the flesh, as well as the thinner veins of the other larger veins, to achieve attraction to the three veins.
And command the bellows to not blow too forcefully during incision, for the place is already devoid of flesh, leaving only nerves and arteries.
And it is a bellows that is blown over others and applies wind to hemorrhoids in the buttocks and to pus ulcers.
And you should command the bellows to be a strong one, and of iron, for the place needs deep incision; and its strong blows cut through subtle incisions made with the scalpel.
The bellows from the legs should be reduced in size gradually, for they draw blood from throughout the body, alleviating old pain in the joints and kidneys, and the bladder; they provoke menstruation and relieve breathlessness and coughing; and they serve as a substitute for laminectomy, and for hangman's noose, and two nails.
However, these humors weaken the entire body and cause fainting in many men.
And from the armpits to the groin, the rejuvenation is also proper for the armpit vents of both legs.
And the quality of the position of the vents is that it stops the ventilation at the beginning of the view and sucks by a timely suction, and does not prolong the position of the vents, but rather lightly, and tightly those considered necessary, and allows the humors to come to the location by chance. And do not cease to repeat this and continue until you see the location turn red and swell, and the pain of the sore appears.
And then you cut and repeat the suction little by little, and consider the condition of the body.
For that man who has tender skin, be careful to scarify him once and not too deeply, so the place is not ulcerated.
And command the fan to amplify the scarification and make it slightly deeper, and then apply suction with ease.
And if the swelling in the vein is great, be careful to scarify twice, for the first scar opens the way for subtilization of the vein and its liquidity. In the second, apply the scrutiny acquired from the extraction of the thick vein.
And if the vein is very foul-smelling, make a third scarification to achieve its final result.
Lastly, when we want to extract the vein little by little or in small pieces, a single scarification is enough for us.
And if we want to extract a hard stone, we perform a thorough incision; and if we know that the stone is large, then we must make an incision deep enough.
And the term "scarification" refers solely to the depth of the cut.
And if the cut is deep, hard, and narrow, and its edges are rough, then the areas for the suction cups should be moistened, opened, and smoothed; if it is in summer, use olive oil, or violet oil, or oil of crushed almonds, or oil of mullein; and if it is in winter, use horse oil, or lily oil, or chamomile oil, or saint john's wort oil, similar substances.
And if the excess is thick, dense, then use amber oil, or balsam oil, or olive oil, or anise oil, and similar substances.
If the leech is of ample size and has tender flesh, then it should be prohibited from oil, and to these places where leeches are applied, the leeching should be done with watery solutions or with water heated by solar energy, or with water from a couch (a type of bath), or with Bordeaux wine, and similar substances.
And that one whose leech has a lot of humidity, washes its leeches in wine or in water mixed with myrtle and sumac berries, and similar substances.
And for those whose excesses are thick, wash their leeches in old wine or water infused with fennel, which is greater (maybe referring to strength), or from anise seed decoction, or chamomile, and similar preparations.
And be careful that the leeching is not done in a bath; it should be administered immediately after the bath for about an hour or two, and the leech should rest near the affected area.
What is it that must be done to regulate the flow of blood after phlebotomy before ventilation?
When beginning the treatment, if the phlebotomist or the one who has undergone phlebotomy is irritable and their blood is hot and inflamed, then you must take into account causes of coldness, such as with milky pus, swelling, vinegar, salt water, and similar things.
And restrict their diet with foods like chicken, lean meats, spices, and similar things.
And for those whose condition is fierce, they must take in drinking warm almond milk, or milk made from the seeds of cannabis, sumac, and a mixture of fragrant herbs between wine and honey; and it is recommended that they limit their intake of alcohol and food, abstain from foods like chicken, lamb, fish, small birds, and pigeons.
And it is necessary that on days of vomiting and incision, drinking should be greater than eating.
And it is also necessary to give some men, in certain hours, a small amount of tyriac, or muscle medicine, which is muscated, or alcelite before vomiting or incision, or nearby, so that the main members are comforted and the pain is relieved; and they should not take that burning.
However, the vents that are a form of lancing should be vents that are paused over the liver, and on the stomach, and gout, and on the navel, in the places of the joints, and the opening of the anus, since these members do not suffer lancing over themselves.
And it is not desired by those who treat only the pain of a member, but rather attract the pus of a wound from the flux of the disease of the nose; and they use that for the ventosa to be paused over the breast in the malautia (malady) of the flow of pus from the member, as well as over the stomach and navel; because it rarifies the member, rubs it, and removes the pain as it resolves the ventosa.
And it is placed on the hemorrhoids when they occur in their sitting or lying position, for by virtue of strong attraction, their hemorrhoidal position and pox are eradicated from their place.
And it seems to be placed on the liver and gallbladder, requiring ventilation in those enclosed areas.
And these ventilations are administered using suction, sometimes only, and other times they are administered over fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of heated water in the patient's gallbladder ailments.
And this is so that the ventilation is filled and a great pus forms, it is water alone or water in which suitable herbs are steeped.
Form of an ampoule administered by fire: the diameter of the opening should be two fingers, according to how we have formed it; and the quantity of the liquid, the size of a palm; and in its length, in the place that is on the circumference, half of it, the hole should be small according to the quantity that can enter it with an needle.
Use ery or citrus, with thick margins, lion, eagle, and turtle shells to prevent them from damaging the member in its position on it.
And at the middle of it, a transverse strip of ery or iron, where the candle is held over the fire.
And this ampoule is much larger than the one we have previously used, and its quantity is less depending on the illness and the state of the patient using it.
And the strength of the suction cups on children and the weak is different from the suction cups on young people and robust bodies.
And the method of stopping this suction cup is to apply a small amount of hot wax from a fire over it, and place another one in the middle of the transverse tongue at the exact spot of the suction cup, so that the flame is lit around the edge without burning the patient's body.
Once the suction cup is removed from the patient's member, place a cloth over the mentioned area, and while we have the cups, do not remove them immediately but let the heat from the flame on that cloth gradually dissolve the suction cup.
And keep applying the heat according to your preference, repeating as needed.
It is also possible to use a suction cup on patients with pleurisy, filled with water instead of air, without a transverse tongue or a tract, and it should only be placed over the member.
And this is the form of it: And this windbag, the larger it is, the better, because it can receive a great quantity of water.
**Chapter LXXVII**
Bloodletting is not administered in most members but in those members where it is impossible to place ventosas due to their smallness, as well as the nose and similar parts; or in a member devoid of flesh, as mentioned for the nose and others.
And the quality of using those that you have found bloodletting instruments in the infected waters of putrid sores.
And it is better to lay them down during the day and night in putrid water until they are painless, and not cause any cause in the belly of those; and then evacuate the body at the beginning with fleubotomia and ventosas; and rub the patient's member until it turns red; and let them rest upon it.
And when they are filled and secured.
And if it is possible to remove the buildup from the affected area with a wind, it is more beneficial in youth.
If not, wash the area with vinegar and then apply plenty of hot water; it should be rubbed and pressed.
And if the fever lasts a long time and the perspiration is excessive, then you should immerse a cloth in cold water and place it on top until the sweating stops.
If the fever has spread, then sprinkle on it dried vitriol or something similar to stiptic agents, as long as the fever is drained; or apply over the area powdered roasted beans, and leave them until the beans adhere to the affected area, and the fever drains.
And if necessary, apply bloodletting, when it is possible to change those.
If bloodletting is prohibited, then the place should be rubbed with a recent wound or left with a needle in the area until it bleeds; and when they are stopped, for those who feel any pain soon afterwards, it will subside.
And when you want them to stop bleeding, sprinkle some alum, salt, or ash onto it and press immediately.
Thus begins the process of recovery from the third stage: restoration. This chapter is prompted frequently in the art of medicine; it deals with the restoration of broken and dislocated bones.
Oh, child, know that those who boast of this chapter are foolish doctors and common people, and those who at any time have not studied the books of the Ancients or read a single letter from them.
And for this reason it happens that this manner of knowledge in our land is private; and you should never forget it at any time; and I have not devoted myself to it later on, but through the length of reading books from the Ancients and studying to understand them, until I extracted their science.
And I have dedicated myself to experimentation and study throughout the length of my life.
And I have already in this chapter described everything that relates to my knowledge and on which I have gained experience; so that others may be spared the trouble of lengthy exposition; I have abridged it at the end of explanation; and I have demonstrated it in the conclusion of declaration; and I have formed in it brief forms of the tools that are administered for treatment, as is done through addition of declaration, just as I have done in the two preceding chapters.
First Chapter.
The sum and collections from the existence of bone fractures, of those which must be mentioned beforehand, before we begin the remembrance of the broken limbs and their various conditions. So, let us say in the prologue of this chapter the sums of speech; and the chapters to the understanding of which, at the beginning, the craftsmen are forced and obliged to dwell upon the truth of those; it is for you and for those who are prompt to know or learn this noble art from you.
And therefore it is said, when you encounter any fracture or dislocation or twist or misalignment, you must realize at the outset that you should begin with bloodletting or removal of that part, or in some instances, if no other cause prohibits, with the use of virtues, or it may be as it presents itself, or weak from decrepitude, or subject to violent heat, or intense friction.
And then, he should be content with his own diet of sharp herbs and lean meats and crabs; and refrain from thick meats and any foods that fill the veins with blood, as long as you are careful to avoid apoplexy, and if you do not fear the effusion of matter into the member.
And then return the patient to their original condition, according to which they were usually treated from the beginning.
And as the broken bone begins to be healed, it is necessary to abstain from foods that are too rich in nourishment, both in quantity and quality, such as foods with viscosity, prepared from wheat cooked with water, rice, beans, meat, veal, fresh fish, large quantities of wine and similar foods, and follow this regimen for the coagulization of the fracture more lightly and gently.
And you should know that the bones become brittle when they are in old age or decrepitude, it is not possible for them to continue and be consolidated according to their nature due to the dehydration of their limbs.
Nature nevertheless adjusts and amends the broken bone from any cause resembling gout in which there is swelling that adheres and strengthens that part, until it becomes solid and firm, as with fire at the beginning, whenever any cause does not prevent it from performing its works.
And for this reason, it is necessary to restrict the diet of the patient, foods that have weight and viscosity and thickness, as we have said.
And you should know that the species of fractures are diverse according to the diversity of members, for the fracture of a bone in the leg is different from the fracture of a bone in the head; and the fracture of a bone in the foot is distinct from the fracture of a bone in the arm; and similarly, all other members differ among themselves.
And now, I shall endeavor to translate your medieval medical text line by line:
A great variety of fractures requires different treatments. And there are diverse species of bone fractures in their innards; for some are curved fractures or those that occur in them as stars; and sometimes they are fractured according to the length of the bone: such as stag and rib fractures, and additions proceeding and not proceeding, as is done in surgery when it is prepared to write, and fracture by plague and disruption on the head, and small fissure fracture.
And every species has its own method or torment for restoration, according to the recollection of its distinct place.
A sign of bone fracture. And this is how bone fracture is known: the deformity of it, and that prominence and appreciation upon touch, and only from it when you compress it with your hand.
And therefore when there is no apparent deformity in the location nor is any severe pain felt when touching the bone due to its movement and the illness does not cause great suffering, then it is not a fracture.
It may be either a deformity or a small fracture, where you feel pain in your hand and compression throughout; place it under the remedies that you remember are appropriate for this location at this time; and make it very tight due to subtle tightness.
And you know that the location, when it is curved and does not split into two or anything else other than what naturally occurs in it, if the entire part of its comparison is disrupted, then you must begin with your hour to correct the curvature that has occurred in it with caution.
And if it has occurred as an apostemic cauterization, then leave it for a few days until the aposteme disappears; and use similar techniques of elevation and device that you can according to your ability.
And you should know that the restoration and sewing of the intestine is more delicate than the repair of the bone where the rupture occurred.
And then strengthen that second, as the memory of it comes.
If there are fractures in the bone that are severe, then it is necessary to extend this broken member from two sides, either with the hand or the foot; or use a cushion if the member is small; or apply two bands or one band and a pad.
And position the member as it was naturally placed, while the fractures of the broken member are extended, then pierce to cause them to return to their proper place using tools and in any way possible in those locations.
And be careful, according to your strength, not to harm the patient during your operation or cause any injury; and pierce as best you can, applying one bone to another in its most suitable way.
And be sure that at this opportune moment you apply your hand to it, and if any different cause arises, correct that one and suppress that one by the quantity of your virtue.
Avoid excessive extension and compression, as foolish doctors often cause gangrene by such cauterization due to their operations, or they cause contraction in the member, as we have seen this happen through the operations of their moted (presumedly "motas" - instruments) attempts.
And the quality of the constriction of the limb at rest is what you should observe, for you must know that the limbs can be diverse in their smallness and greatness and in the shape of these.
And of those that are small, like the arm and its elbow and similar to these, you should know that the wrapping should be of very thin cloth.
For those that are thick like the skin or the leg, you should know that their wrapping should be loose and hard, as the tightness around each part connects the large member and strengthens it from all sides, so nothing gets in between.
Then begin, and with your evacuation of the equation, place a suitable pause on it, over the location of that fracture with three or four wraps, depending on the member, and tighten your hand slightly on the wrap.
And then carefully remove that from the upper part of the fracture site, and tighten gently so as not to affect your stricture which you have strengthened at the location of the fracture. And then gradually lengthen the wrap around the fracture site, and gently loosen the tightness little by little, until you take away from the location a great part of it.
And then take another bandage and wrap it around the other side of the fractured site, over the previous wrap; and now inspect the wraps at the part farthest from the fracture; and your operation on the tightness of the wrap and its mollification as per what we have said about the first wrap.
And then place between the wraps a leather or cloth bandage which corresponds to the curvature of the fracture, if there is curvature; otherwise, do not place anything on it.
And then place your hand over the other part, and cover these neatly arranged sterile bandages over it, if there is no inflammation or abscess in the area, and apply pressure where the abscess is and where there is inflammation; leave that for a few days; and then tighten the bandages.
And the bandages should be of various types of canvas, carefully made; or of wood; or of palm fronds; and their width should be according to this form and figure.
However, take care that the bandage placed over the fracture should be thicker and wider than the others; and the length of the bandage according to how it is measured on the member in terms of size and narrowness; then tighten the bandages over the other part as per your initial structure; wrap them closely from above down, following the stricture we mentioned regarding the position of the fracture; and the stricter it should be, the longer the distance from the fracture.
And ensure that the threads are stronger in thickness and fineness, and abundant; if the threads are thick, as you have seen in the operation of some stiff sheets, the threads of their strings twist, and it is a great error when tightness is equated with equality.
Likewise, very fine threads are not convenient, for you cannot achieve the desired tightness with them, and it does not ensure that there is less than a finger width between one thread and another.
And if the hernia is located near the ends of the tendons, tighten it in those places without using iron or twisted wool thread, until it does not cause any damage.
Sometimes, the pain is so severe that it becomes a plague, causing disruptions in the spine, and one remembers it as mentioned in the second chapter, according to its peculiarities.
And you should know that a completely broken limb is not immediately tied to the splint; this is because, when the limb is large, it cannot be properly supported by the splint unless it is waited for several days, or even a week or more, depending on your confidence in preventing an abscess from forming.
And this is the manner of the splints used by the ancients to restore, which are placed over fractures and dislocations and twists.
Method of splinting as a quick means of restoring a fracture, particularly suitable for complex cases and especially for women and children, since it does not apply heat or friction: take powdered flour, which is the heart of the flour that prevents the movement of the millstone against the walls of the mill.
And if that is not possible, then use an alternative method by applying a thin and not too dense composition; and then use it accordingly.
Another method of plastering to restore fractures, dislocations, and twists: prepare a mixture of assafetida, labdanum, acacia, enula, and myrrh, all ground from dragon's blood, mirra, and aloe in dragon's tears; or mix it with licorice water or egg albumen if the patient's condition permits; and apply this plaster, as it is of good composition and slightly restores broken bones, and benefits many people.
Another plastering method that provides relief for fractures and twists: prepare a mixture of migrain and other herbs, such as white yarrow, dragon's blood, mirra, aloe, acacia, and Armenian honey, in varying quantities.
All these preparations should be crushed in a mortar to a fine consistency, mixed with water or egg albumen and administered as needed.
A method of plastering joints and bones to their locations, and as a result, pain occurs in those and cracks and fractures; take fine linen cloth, submerge it in hot vinegar and oil, and place it over the area.
This plaster, however, is not beneficial for restoration, it prevents abscesses and specifically expels pain.
Another method of plastering that restores closed bones: take leaves of the fig tree and poppy flowers; mix them all together to make a paste.
A method of a quick plaster used for the restoration of bone fractures and when you want a solution for the healing of abscesses: take bay leaves, chamomile flowers, violet flowers, rice flour, all mixed together; they are all crushed and mixed with vinegar, unless the member is scorched.
If it is scalded, then apply warm water of colander or hot water to it.
Another way to apply a poultice with stronger effect than the first one, in case of hard abscess, is to mix grated aloe and seeds of fennel, calamus, melilot, majoram, violet flowers, chamomile, any other herb in equal parts; all these are triturated and mixed with savory water or two-fold water or wine, according to the quality of the member and the rest of its color.
However, Hippocrates does not say in his book that it should be placed on the affected member before its restoration unless certain preparations of wax and oil are made; and he recommends that it should be applied with a mixture of coarse and fine materials.
A Gaul may also be used as a poultice on the broken member after its restoration, and it is effective for conditions caused by cold, just as myrrh, onions, and similar substances are useful for similar conditions.
A method of applying a plaster to an injury and relieving pain: take equal parts of moss, chamomile flowers, oak bark, and salt, mix them together, crush them, and make a paste.
The amount should be adjusted according to the extent of the sprain and its separation; if there is no pain or discomfort, and the bone is not broken, it is not worth separating it from its place. In this case, do not attempt to dislocate more than a few days. And if a painful, pruritic, or inflammatory reaction occurs at the site, immediately remove the plaster or splint and refrain from applying further treatment.
Take a piece of linen and sponge marine with moist salt, immerse them in boiled water, then apply it to the site until the pain and discomfort subside; then let the member rest for an hour. Next, place over it clean wool soaked in vinegar or rose oil, wrap it up, and secure it with a bandage, ensuring there is no risk of infection and that the inflammation of the member subsides, and the pain disappears.
And then repeat that delicate compression and apply a small plaster, not straining with your initial tightness, but gently compressing until it is healed.
And if, after all the inflammation, pain, and other symptoms have subsided, you still need a plaster and compression, then repeat the same as you initially did at the beginning of the treatment.
And if no other cause occurs in the member from those we have mentioned, then do not remove the bandage for three days or four or five or seven; and sometimes it is left for twenty days, as you judge by the relaxation of the member, as we have said, until the fracture adheres and approaches the coagulation of the flesh over that.
And then you adjust the compression more than your initial tightening and adjust in the thickness of the patient's food, according to the remission of the disease.
If you examine the site of the fracture, already dried and weakened, but it does not cover, then you know that nutrition is prohibited from reaching that place; and therefore, you should poke that with hot water several times a day for three days; slightly relieve the tightness, so that through this operation, the nutrition goes to the limb, and the healing begins.
But here is what the foolish restorers of a limb fracture do when it does not heal from the beginning, according to its covering, and is healed according to its tortuosity; it is an error according to their operation, and causes great fear, and if it were a skilled surgeon, he would enlarge the wound in their free spaces and turn them away from it.
And you have not seen any of them do this, so it is all the more reasonable that they should not do it.
**Section:** On fractures occurring in the head.
The fragments of fractures are diverse, and their shapes vary, and the causes are distinct, for some fractures are caused by the impact of a blow, which stops all the bone within the joint, leaving the bone dislocated, just as it is in a sprain, and that's why this type is called ascial; or space cuts a fragment of the bone, cuts the flesh, and the incision does not pass through the back of the bone; and this type of fracture is called absolute levation.
And the difficulty of these two fractures is either great or small, and it can be a compression or an attrition fracture; and its cause is a blow with a heavy object or sudden impact on the bone, and they resemble each other in appearance.
And this fracture is either penetrating, bringing the pancreas close to the bone, or it is on the surface of the bone; and the difficulty of these two fractures is either great or small.
And when it is a fracture that is caught in the bone, in the delicate part of the hair root, and for this reason this type of fracture is called capillary.
This is a fracture that occurs either through accident or the impact of a hard object, causing some bone lamina to break off internally, and it appears in the concave area as well as when erysipelas happens due to their impact, and it is the rupture of their entry into internal parts.
This is most commonly found in the bones of children, as well as when there are heads of infants.
And all these types of fractures behave similarly, as if they had separate stars. And you should return to the original state of all this in its place.
And I have come to know all these species of fracture by discerning them, and by testing their strength, and examining the evident corrupt flesh that lies upon them.
This capillary is known for being discovered over the bone when it is exposed, and it is cleaned, and then compressed over it, as the fracture appears black.
In the treatment of fractures, one must consider the beginning of the patient's illness and its symptoms, for if you examine these symptoms, their meaning appears to be about evil. Thus, if there is vomiting from anger or extension, loss of consciousness, absence of speech, fainting, acute fever, discharge of pus, and redness of those affected, and they resemble in their major dispositions the accidents mentioned above, then it is not a cure but a disease.
And if you perceive non-common symptoms, you expect health, then you begin the cure for them.
The cause is that if the pain strikes you at the onset as it does in winter, then be aware that you must study the bone's aspect on the 13th day according to all dispositions.
And if it is in the summer days, then be aware that you must examine the bone against the 7th day, as what remains of the bone is corrupted by the pannicul, and accidents occur that we have mentioned before.
And if the fracture has already reached the pannicul covering the brain, and it is in small pieces and inflammation, then be aware that you must incise the comminuted and inflamed part, as I have mentioned before.
For it is that you open the patient's thigh, discover the bone according to custom and method as possible according to the figure of the plague, and place it lighter over the malady.
And if you should come upon the detection of a bone fracture, pus or abscess cautiously, then stand over it as it is covered, and this is done by placing sheets soaked in wine and warmed oil on the site, and allow the infection to rest until the abscess has subsided and be certain of the flow of pus; then begin with the circular incision around the bone and its removal.
This is the second of two surgical methods.
The first method is to cut the bone with a sharp scalpel in this way: Then administer another scalpel to it, slightly wider than that one; and this is its form.
Then administer a yet wider scalpel.
And it is necessary that you should use various scalpels, some of which are wider than others; and some of them shorter, the latter having more acuity at their tips, made either of iron or steel.
And use their aid to facilitate the incision so that it does not harm the head or wound that area.
And if the bone is strong and hard, remember to pierce around the edge of it before you use the scalpels, which are called non-penetrating cuts.
And they are not called thus, but rather those that do not extend the term of the bone in the testis to it, so that when the cut is made, its round extremity or margin remains over the part that leaves the head of it, resembling a small margin or circle, which prevents it from being submerged and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take a great number of these cuts, each suited to the peculiarity of each bone, as long as it is present in all parts of the brain, the extremity of which is sharp, and its length and brevity are according to the amount of peculiarity of this test.
And this is the method for three types of treatments: The quality of perforating in the region of a broken bone is to place the treatment over the bone and turn it within your hands until you know that the bone has been penetrated; then change the location of the treatment, and pause at what lies between all of these, altering the amount of the thickness of the ray or surrounding it.
And then you cut with scissors what lies between each part of the bone, creating a thin wound over it in a levitative manner, as we have said, to eradicate the bone, or with your hand, or with any other tool due to some reason that prompts you to approach it, using such instruments as pincers and fine forceps.
And be careful that the scissors do not touch any cause of infection.
And so when you have perforated the bone and it is separated from infection if it continues there, and you have extracted it, be careful to rub and clean it in the roughness of it from what is in the bone, similar to a scissor, but nevertheless be careful that it be more gentle and subtler than the other scissors.
And if you break any part of the small or long bones, take hold of it with your hand as it is within your power, and apply treatment to the wound using liniment and bandages as we have said.
And another way of operation is to be light, far from pain, which cuts Gaul and praises for great glory; and this is the speech of it: It is necessary for you at the beginning that you begin to discover the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most violent and manifest, as long as, when you have discovered that part and have paused beneath it the extremity of this slow and gentle cutter, from which this form is.
And the lenticular fracture is gentle and inflicts no cause, while the acute fracture is in two parts ahead in length, thus as it were; that the lenticular fracture be adjusted to the shape of the face of the acute fracture in the bone.
And then carefully strike with a small mallet on the incision of a hernia until the bone is completely separated as you rotate it, ensuring that the pannus does not occur in it and causing no harm in any way, and if the medicant was the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of their affairs; certainly, he was asleep.
If a rupture occurs due to some cause attached to the pancreas in certain places of the bone, make an incision on that part of it with the tip of the scalpel, and remove it from its attachment, as it is freed from its discomfort and pain.
And if the bone fracture does not penetrate within the pancreas, and what has been detached or left attached to the bone is the fascia, containing its roughness and subtle lines, then you must scrape that roughness and remove those subtile lines with finely sharpened razors that you have prepared in various quantities so that you can apply them as appropriate in all places of the fractured bone, according to what you discover during your operation, making sure that it is correctly aligned and shaped.
And be sure to administer in your treatment the reason why you begin to remove the pus from those wounds, and then use it immediately on the subtle pus, and do not cease to do so continuously until you have administered the heavenly and subtle pus of all these.
In any of the other small cracks or delicate breaks, be sure to administer care according to what you have learned for the correction of it.
And it is because not all those who have studied this art have mastered it completely. And let us focus on what we have written regarding major fractures.
And if the pannicle (or skin) is contracted when you remove the bone, then take a cloth from it according to the size of the wound, immerse it in hot oil and place it over the wound; then take another cloth, either folded or rolled up, immerse it in vinegar and oil, and place that over the first cloth, gently pressing it so as not to harm the wound; and then apply a poultice with plenty of lard, and do not tighten it but let it be according to the size of the wound.
And leave this treatment for one or two days until you are sure of the healing process; then remove it and administer medicines that promote dryness, such as lint, flour of rhubarb, powder of herbs and aristologia, and similar ones.
And you should make these medicines into a powder that is sprinkled on the affliction when it is dry; and generally, administer to the patient all medicine of the proper kind from which he abstains and does not bite.
And be careful according to your virtue that the affliction in your treatment is clear; and do not allow any obscuration with ointments or other things; nor should you add violence to it; for when it is applied directly to the panniculus of the brain, it corrupts that and brings about a malign malady, affecting the patient severely.
And it happens in the head's cavity, as when it is cleansed of humors and more so when the treatment of them is delayed, and it becomes darker on its surface; and therefore, consider whether it happens to the patient the accidents that we have mentioned, knowing that it is harmful to all your skills.
And if the dark (or inflammation) does not subside from the medicine applied to it, but is due to that very medicine, then take a piece of honey and some finely chopped rose oil, mix them with a cloth, apply that over the affected area; and then use the appropriate remedies for healing as needed until it is cured.
**Chapter III**
On the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose is not broken in two places, but rather from two superior parts or one of those small bones, so that it has two bones in it, since the part that is displaced is cartilaginous and not actually broken, but suffers from attrition, deformity, and inflammation.
If one of the two parts of the nose is broken, then you must insert that small piece back into its place within the nose and hold it there with the index finger on both sides until it returns to its natural shape. And do this for your ease, and be careful not to cause harm with that operation on the patient's pain.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose and it does not heal towards that area, then cover it so that it is equal to the extremity of the break where there is swelling.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then do it like this.
And open the fracture for restoration on the first day of the break if possible; otherwise, keep the wound clean and rest the affected part for a week.
And insert a piece of cloth into the extremity of the nose, if the fracture is in one part, or insert two pieces, if the fracture is in two parts, making sure that the swelling fills the nasal track completely.
And so some of the ancient restoratives, the swelling is infiltrated with a border, and it is changed every day, but I have not seen this; after learning that the joint is soaked in egg albumen mixed with flour powder, then place the compress until the bone is firm and the cartilage is strengthened.
And sometimes it is found in the nose, instead of swelling, due to high fever, because it is wrapped in lion's cloth; and if you already have a fracture of the nose, the pain is intense, and the illness does not prevent inspiration.
And this cause is not necessary; and if you wish, do this, and if you wish, use compresses.
And if another situation occurs after the abscess cauterization, apply a plaster to the nose with wax or cloth soaked in hot vinegar and oil, or dust it with salt.
If you do not accidentally cause gangrene, then cover the external wound with flour of rye and powder of crushed herbs mixed in egg albumen, and place your hand over it, pressing hard, and do not let air reach it for any reason.
If you break or injure the bones of the nose with a small fracture or a cut, then you must carefully clean them and extract any debris using appropriate instruments; then, with gentle movements, close the wound, apply what is necessary for healing, and use suitable plasters.
And if an infection occurs inside the nose, then you must clean it with hot water and administer silver canules until it is completely healed.
**Chapter IV.**
**On the Restoration of the Mandible when Broken.**
When the jaw is broken and the fracture is not severe, observe if the fracture is only on the outside, and not split into two and bent inward, then its healing will be slight.
And if the fracture is on the right side, insert your left little finger into the patient's mouth; and conversely, if the fracture is on the left mandible, insert your right little finger; and with that, push the fragment of the fracture inward to facilitate its alignment outward, with your other hand from the outside of the bone's split. And do it equally well in both cases.
And if the mandible fracture is already separated into two parts, then you must administer extension to both parts according to their correct alignment, so that their position can be corrected.
And if there is damage to the teeth due to displacement, then apply those of which you expect to restore them using gold or silver or silk threads; and place a cerot over the broken mandible, and wrap it with a double cloth, and place a large sterile bandage on it decently made, or a piece equal in length to the mandible; and then secure it from above according to your equipment for binding it and the application method, as long as it is not damaged.
And instruct the patient to rest and be calm, and abstain from eating fatty foods.
And if you estimate that the shape has been altered in any way on the third day, then you should cut and loosen that which has become stuck, and correct what has been altered of it, and apply to it a powder from wheat, or egg white, or sesame flour, since you have left the bandage on it, and place over the plaster some wax.
And having thus placed and adjusted this plaster over it, and the arrangement of the bone is not altered, leave it, unless you can loosen it after it has healed and strengthened the fracture; for usually this fracture is tight within three weeks.
And if another severe abscess occurs, then apply what we have mentioned regarding the treatment of it while it is still fresh, and heal that abscess.
And if the fracture is a severe one, consider whether it's a complete separation of bone or fragments, then skillfully apply whatever is appropriate for this condition in the removal of those from the tools.
And if the wound of the plague is narrow, then widen it through flailotomy according to the amount of your need.
And once you've removed those fragments, and if they're not yet fully healed, then widen the wound of the plague with the orifice; otherwise, place a bandage over it using whatever is suitable for that condition until it heals.
It appears that the text ends abruptly with "Capitol .v." without clear context or continuation. Without further surrounding information, it's challenging to provide a precise translation for this segment. If "Capitol" refers to a specific chapter or section title, it could indicate the conclusion of a medical discussion or the start of a new topic.
On the restoration of the fork when it's broken.
When the bones of a joint are seen to be broken, the fracture is made in one of three ways.
Whether it is broken or separated or separated into two parts other than accidental strategies; it is less inclined to restoration; or it occurs in such a way that strategies occur in it, and its restoration is difficult; or the fracture is like a plague.
And for that operation, when the fracture is its most severe, you must have two assistants present, one to hold and support the broken bone, and another to stretch and open up the joint.
Then clamp the fracture with your hands, adjusting the position as necessary to form it according to its nature, and not in a prominent or concave manner.
And if you need more extension, take a piece of cloth or wool and place it beneath the patient's body, adjusting its size according to your need; then stretch and raise the joint, and with your hand, compress the fracture as you clamp it.
And if you cannot extend the end of the fork into the wound, because it is stuck in the bone, then cover the disease over its neck and place a cushion-like object on the muscle, half as large as necessary.
And the attendant should press on the muscle at the wound site while ensuring that the bone of the fork is elevated and in its proper place, then correct the fracture and bind it firmly with bandages.
If you feel any fragments of the fork and they are painful, then cut them away and extract those fragments with ease.
And if it is stuck in the bone, then make an incision from it with one of the knives you have equipped for this purpose, since you had previously placed the fork as a stabilizer; and this tool is made of wood or iron, and its shape is like this:
And it resembles a cup in which this is the concavity; and its size according to what you have needed of it, according to the size of the bone or its thinness.
Its length should be according to what is possible for the operation; it should have two extremes, thus, one extreme should be wide and the other narrow.
And if the disruption of the ulcer which you have incised when you have extracted the sagittaria (possibly a term for tissue or membrane) from the bone is wide, and it is safe from apostema (a condition characterized by the separation of tissues), then you adjust the two edges of the ulcer with sutures.
And if the disruption is slight, or you fear apostema, then you employ the ulcer with bandages and powders according to the amount of the ulcer's disruption.
And if a post-hemorrhagic apoplexy occurs, pour vinegar and rosy oil on it and press upon it.
Furthermore, it is important not to remove the knife from above the broken bone; so that, whenever you observe the disease recurring, if you notice that the ligament has softened or the knife has become dislodged, adjust it and tighten the bandage.
And then place the patient's sleep (or rest) on their collarbone, and leave a small cushion under their shoulder for the sleep of it during the night; so that at that time the supporters of the patient from the side of that joint are raised, and thus is elevated the fracture of the furcula to the elevation of the muscle; or the arm of the patient is laid on the collarbone of that joint.
And do not untie the bandage unless you happen to be near the location or there is an abscess within twelve days.
Then renew the plaster if you see that the patient's face is affected by it, adjust it to fit tightly, restore it, and leave it until the fracture of the furcula is healed and the wound is coagulated.
And it is strengthened and made comfortable according to the month in twenty-eight days, and in some cases in some people it is achieved in less than that time.
Chapter .vi.
On the restoration of a shoulder fracture.
The blade of the spatula is broken in its lateral part, but not the spine, only its edges.
And therefore, when the spine is broken — and it is broken in its middle part — it is only known by touch, then according to the shape of the fracture, you must prepare it and reduce it back to its natural shape in every way with all the skill at your disposal.
Then place a powdery mixture of alum and honey over the wound; stop it with a double layer of cloth; place on it a small piece of table, according to the thickness of the spatula or a little more.
If the blade is concave in any part of the spatula, then you should fill that concavity with a stop, and return the blade to its proper shape.
Then apply force from above, compressing the tongue of the blade with firm pressure until it is securely in place and does not move from its position.
And consider the ligament each day; whenever it becomes softened, tighten it again and properly adjust the blade if it has moved from its place.
And keep the patient on their side.
And the spatula should be restored in 10 days or 25 days.
And therefore when this period is complete, you will dissolve the ligament, and you must be certain that it is from the bones of which the commencement was not feared or their dissolution.
And if you proceed from the place of the infected bone and place a chain there, then you split it open and hold it, and treat according to what we have said about the fracture of the tailbone or aplasia cauterization if this happens here.
**Capitol VII.**
**On the Restoration of Fractured Bones**
Some bones break in the middle part of their length and healing should be allowed to proceed; however, the ends of the bone tend to fuse and heal, becoming weakened and fragmented.
And one of the complications of bone fractures is that the broken middle part inclines to dislocate and causes severe pain, difficulty in breathing, coughing, and intense vomiting; it is manifest within the cavity of the broken bone and is not hidden from sensation.
And the restoration of it is that the patient be placed supine on their back, and place a cushion between their shoulders; then press upon their muscles, and adjust their ribs to the contours of their body, with subtlety in the operation of it and in the alignment according to every possible way that suits it, so that the shape of the bone is restored.
Then apply a plaster and bandage, and place over it a thin table of salt or herbs, and similar things in layers, wrapping them around; carefully bind the broken bone without causing more harm; periodically adjust the binding according to its curve on the back, and tighten that which is too loose; constantly consider the binding, and when it softens, tighten it.
And if it becomes necessary to cause the displacement of that which is causing corrosion, or pressure, or pain, or an abscess in the area, then you should loosen and remove it, and eradicate the plaster and correct what has occurred by means of healing it; and reduce the plaster, if it became too tight for the patient; and adjust the binding until it is healed.
Chapter VIII.
On the restoration of bones when they are broken.
You know that the fracture of ribs does not occur without a great impact on the back; and in their extremities, moving away from each other, it does not cause compression to those parts, but rather because they are cartilaginous. And the knowledge of him should not be hidden from the senses, you must inquire about his condition.
And the restoration should be such that it heals the fracture in question according to its nature, as much as possible, within the limits of what is covered, and then apply a plaster and tighten the broken bone with a splint, if necessary.
If the fracture of the ribs is moving towards the extremities, it causes the patient severe pain and piercing, just as piercing occurs to one who has suffered from pleurisy, and because the bone is exposed; and it causes difficulty in breathing, coughing, and severe vomiting; and this is a difficult cure.
And ancient remedies are ingeniously crafted in this cunning art.
And regarding these, it says: "Block the patient from food that generates inflammation and gas, so that the belly is inflated and stretched, and the rupture is pushed out.
We should avoid this at all costs so that it does not cause a minor infection to turn into a serious one, if it happens; and if it already has, then immediately provide aid for it.
They also say that some remedies should be applied to the affected area to reduce inflammation and then suck out the excess fluid; it seems logical, but one must be cautious that the wind does not push the excess fluid back to the site due to weakness.
They also say: "One should cover the affected area with cloth that has been soaked in hot oil, and place pillows between the ribs until it is filled, making a tight bandage according to its shape; and then it is treated for the illness with food and medicine.
And if the illness causes violent constriction that cannot be endured, and the bone punctures deeply, fear for the illness, then cover it with a bandage, uncover the broken rib, and place over it an instrument that preserves the integrity, the memory of which is preceded, and cut the bone to facilitate its extraction.
And it is also necessary to adjust the two edges of the wound if it is large, using stitches, and dress it with bandages until it heals.
And if an abscess occurs inside, cut it open and apply poultices in rose oil and place them on the area, and treat the illness with what covers the abscess within.
And raise him on the side he sleeps on until it heals.
Chapter IX.
On the restoration of the fractured spine of the back and neck.
Sometimes, the bones of the neck can be fractured and their cartilage damaged, resembling the spine's vertebrae. And if this happens to anyone and you want to know if they will recover, consider: if their muscles are already relaxed, numbed, and dead, and they cannot move or stretch those parts nor feel pain when pricked with a needle, then you should know that they will not recover, and in such cases, the condition is fatal.
And if they feel constriction and pain in the joints and pricking, then you should know that the bone's nerve is not damaged and that the illness will heal with treatment.
And if you see the vertebrae of the neck resembling this and want to know if it will heal, consider their weight.
When you notice that the body parts have already softened, focus on those affected areas, and when they start to gain strength and mobility, their will becomes stronger; sometimes, they might even rise onto their feet and want to urinate but cannot, then you know it is a serious condition, and therefore, do not attempt any treatment for it.
If no specific cause is identified for those conditions, the cause might be milder and easier to treat.
And the treatment for it is to perforate at the relaxation of the spine with a heated cauterize or soak it in hot oil or other extracts; place this on that area several times a day until the pain subsides from the cauterization.
And then place a comfortable and firm bandage, tightening it over the affected area; instruct the patient to rest and maintain tranquility, and not sleep on the side where pain is felt until it heals.
If the dislocation occurs of a leg bone or any cause that is already separated from it, then cover it with a dry bandage and support that bone; and properly align the two edges of the wound, suturing if necessary; and carefully treat the infection to ensure healing.
If the last part of the bone is broken and it is the end of the limb, then insert your left hand's thumb into the hole on the other side of the bone, and try to fit the broken bone with your right hand as best you can; then apply a plaster and bandage over it, if necessary, and strengthen it.
And if you feel broken bones in it, then bind them tightly and support that part, and treat the wound with the treatment that precedes healing.
**Chapter X.**
On the restoration of the bowels.
The bones of the bowels are often broken, and when they break, the fracture is not uncommon in the extremities of those parts and extends inward; it causes pain to the patient at the site and a stupor in the limb when fractured.
And the restoration is that you place your hand over the area above the fracture, which is the shape of it.
If the fracture is at the extremity of the bone and only that part is affected, then you should insert it again according to your knowledge, just as it was assembled in its natural form.
If the fracture is in the long bone and extends inward already, you should lay the patient on their stomach so that you can prepare to restore the fractured area. And so when you have bound that, place the plaster on it, and then place a sheet of wood or canvas over it, and tighten strongly without fear of fracture or removal of the star.
Then bind the concavity with something that fills it evenly as it takes on the shape, and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on their side.
If an abscess should occur carefully, then cease the extension of it and its restoration until the abscess is sedated, and apply to it what was previously mentioned; then return to the restoration of it, and tighten it thus with a cover.
And if this happens in the long bones or they are broken, then you should treat them.
Chapter XI.
On the restoration of the broken assistant (or, possibly, 'helper' or 'adjunct').
The adjutori is what lies between the thigh and the head of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, its restoration is in one of two ways, of which one involves taking a rough plane of medium thickness according to this form:
And they should be seen in both extremities of the ligament, and then suspended from an elevated position.
And follow the patient on their side; then throw their broken arm over the rough plane until it reaches the middle point of its curve.
And then suspend it over some heavy cause or, as the minister extends it to the other parts, and the doctor places his hands on the fracture, until it returns to its place.
And another method is that the patient be placed on their back, and hold the head with one hand; then command two assistants: one to hold what is above the fracture with his hands, and the other to hold the pus from beneath; and each of them extend themselves according to their strength.
And if you wish to increase the extension further, tighten your hold on the fracture with the ligaments and with another ligament, and each of the two assistants extends themselves in two directions.
And so if the fracture is close to the extremity of the muscle, you must stop half of the ligament on the tendon and the other side of the fracture towards the shoulder.
And if the fracture is close to the shoulder, you must stop the ligament at that place and on that shoulder.
Immerse this in easy water and work with it, and when it is immersed according to the depth and correctly applied, tighten it if it does not cause gangrene cautiously.
If gangrene occurs cautiously, then leave the tightness within the seventh day, and place a cloth soaked in vinegar and rose oil over it until the abscess heals, and then tighten it.
And the method of tightening is to place a plaster over the fracture, then wrap new cloth around the plaster; adjust the arm on that assistant, and hold your hand open over its muscle.
And unfold the cloth and tighten over the arm assistant to keep the arm in place without any movement from the broken bone.
And then use stitches.
And it is that it rests on the fracture that steel which is placed and firm among the other steels; it rests between each steel the width of the finger, and the length of the steels according to the break with three parts from the whole.
Then tighten the steels with the tension and stricture as I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
And it is that the tension on the fracture site should be tighter. And the further the fracture is extended, the less tension should be applied.
And therefore, adjust the position of the steels and tension as we have said in the moment when you restore the member to its proper place, then do so.
And if you fear gangrene, then loosen the tightness and the stitches within on the seventh day as we have said.
And thereafter, consider the dressing on all wounds for three days to prevent any occurrence of pus or inflammation; avoid food that reaches the member due to excess tightness; and thus, correct everything as we have said.
If you are certain that no such cause will occur, then do not loosen the ligature but instead wait for three days or more.
And the patient's rest should be on their back, and their hands over their stomach.
And place over the aid a full cloth soaked in honey, and consider at every hour of night or day that the form of the broken member is not damaged or dissolved, or that the dressing becomes soft; thus, correct it with all your skill.
And hold the patient's food according to the order we have given before, so that the food is thin at the beginning and becomes thicker as it is consumed; and now you will notice that the patient's food becomes more substantial.
Another custom of the assistant and leg support is to be tight for 12 days; and now you will notice that they should become looser, and baths should be administered and ointments applied which correct it.
If the fracture is old and inflamed, you should not loosen the bandage or remove the stitches for one to two months.
Chapter XII
On the restoration of a broken arm.
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the forearm and the upper arm; of these, one is smaller, and it is this that is known as the little finger's bone, while the other is larger and is supported below by the smaller bone, extending upward.
And if the larger or smaller fragment of the bone is broken, they are often cracked at the same time.
And when the smaller fragment of bone is broken above, its restoration is easier, and its healing is faster.
And when the bone fragment below is broken in such a way that there is a fracture, it is difficult to heal and its recovery is slow.
And the worst case is when two bones break at the same time.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the smaller fragment above, it is a good sign for the doctor, as you must facilitate its restoration, which will be easily extended before it is healed.
If the larger fragment is what breaks, then it requires more extensive treatment as it needs to be held in place more firmly.
And if the two incisions are together torn, then you must hold the extraction much stronger.
And you must hold the shape of your hand for the restoration of it and the extension of it spread over a cushion, and the wrist of your hand on top of them, more than all the others, and the sick person should be placed on a bed prepared accordingly.
And place a cushion in front of him at the right height or adjust it according to his condition, so that the sick person does not have to strain.
Then the minister extends his arm from the side of the patient with his hand or instrument, and another minister extends theirs similarly.
Then the doctor should align the bone within as best as possible according to the most suitable shape.
And if in the treatment of the bone there are obstacles, you must then pierce and reduce all the swelling to its proper place with your skill.
And if there appears to be a separated fragment that will not respond to your treatment and its restoration is not hoped for, then you must sever it and stop it according to the method we have described above.
If the fracture is severe and you have already dealt with this particular case before, then take care of that.
And if an abscess occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then line a cloth with a paste made of rosy oil and white wax, applying it with care between the specific and subtle muscles, and tighten the bandage slightly so that the abscess subsides; then remove the poultice and apply a plaster prepared from powdered milk mixed with clay, and place more bands; let the bandage be the one that presses most on the fracture.
And you should know that the names of the bones in the arm are visible in their proper positions, either in a single fracture or in two fractures at the same time.
Then apply your pressure firmly and vigorously on the site of the fracture, and as the tightness increases in the parts above or below the fracture, lessen the pressure slightly according to the patient's pain sensation at the beginning of the treatment.
And the bandages that are wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist, not hard or rough, and the thread used to bind them should be neither too thin nor too thick, as we have recommended.
And consider the member and its ligament for some days. And if any cause arises that requires correction, as you observe the member's condition, and pain occurs in the member, then gently apply water to the member until the pain ceases.
And you should not constrict the member until it is at rest, then return the tightness appropriately.
And if the tightness is already relaxed and the bone has healed and appears like those, then correct everything with your virtue.
And consider more if the nutrition is blocked from reaching the member due to excessive tightness, then you must soften it a little and leave it for some days until the nutrition reaches it, and then tighten it again.
If the patient does not suffer from any of the causes we have mentioned, then it is not necessary to loosen it within about 2-3 days or so around those times.
And then the hand of the patient should be suspended by their virtue of agile movement, and they should make that person sleep on their back.
And you should know that this fracture is healed in 30 days or 33 days, or even earlier in 28 days, and all of this depends on the condition of the complications and the disposition of the virtue.
Chapter XIII
On the restoration of fractures of the hand and fingers.
You should know that the hand and fingers often suffer fractures, and these do not heal properly unless the cause of the injury is treated.
And when an injury or fracture occurs to the hand, one must ensure that the patient remains calm and places their hand on the affected area with equal pressure.
Then the physician should extend the broken bones and align them, ensuring they are correctly positioned.
And then cover with a dry dressing and stoppers, lest you suffer an apothema (fistula); and return the steplike bandage over it according to the quantity of the wound, and you have already wrapped that in linen cloth.
If the fracture is in the deeper parts within the palm and it seems like a thread of cloth, then command the patient to tighten that part of their crushed palm; then take a long strip of cloth and stretch it tightly.
And the bandage of cloth that is lifted should be applied to the palm, and tighten it as needed.
If the fracture is in the external parts, then cover it with bandages and another piece left over from the palm, so that the hand is covered and supported; and then tighten the pressure, thus as the hand is rotated to the correct position between the ligament connections.
If you experience a fracture in any of the bones of the hand, if it is the thumb, wrap it tightly according to its position and immediately place a small right splint underneath to elevate the fracture and prevent further damage.
If the fracture is in any other bones of the hand, for example, in the middle finger, or index, or little finger, it should be wrapped and tied to the finger it affects; or all fingers can be bound together in sequence, which is better; or a small splint can be placed over it, as we have said regarding the thumb.
And consider, in your restoration, the order of setting bones with care and opposition - according to your operation - concerning what is mentioned when any cause of those occurs, as described in its narrative.
Chapter XIV.
On the restoration of a broken thigh bone.
The thigh bone, having moved beyond its normal position, breaks and is felt as a result of the displacement in front and due to the accumulated pus.
And the restoration of it is done thus: the ligament is tightened over the fracture and another ligament is placed around the fracture, and the patient is positioned on their stomach and face down.
Then the physician extends the ligament to its proper position according to quality, when the fracture is in the middle part of the bone.
If it is appropriate to operate on the thigh, then the ligament should be tightened towards the opposite side at the level of the knee, so that extension occurs in it, and another ligament is placed around the fracture.
And if the fracture appears to be severe, then make the ligament strong at the affected area and extend it to the adjacent parts.
Then the doctor should align the bones with both hands, reducing them as close as possible to their natural position, and the bone is joined by a good union; then cover it with a plaster and compression, otherwise the member may become gangrened. If gangrene occurs in it, then leave it for a few days until the gangrene subsides, and then return to your treatment.
The compression should be done as follows: it is necessary to wrap around the fracture a hard bandage, and bend it two or three times, and remove the excess; then wrap the leg until it reaches the thigh and the root of the wound.
And insert a long strip of cloth between the thigh and the leg near the affected area, bringing the ends of the cloth from both sides to make it dominant over the two parts, then turn the strip over the leg and thigh, removing any excess from the bandage.
And then place your hand on the thigh at the site of that fracture as support, and place one of those splints over the bone of the leg.
And then fill the space between the leg and the thigh with soft cloth to tighten the compression.
And then begin applying a strong compression from the middle over the site of the fracture using three or four layers, and as you increase the distance from the affected area, your compression should be weaker and lighter and more flexible.
And then extend the ends of the cloth to the affected parts until they reach the toe's ankle, and tighten both ends of the splints from the other side to prevent the ligament from moving from its place.
And then carefully apply pressure to it so that no corruption, gangrene, or inflammation occurs, and it resembles these; and if any cause of those arises, then be careful to dislodge it, and correct what happens immediately, as we have said before.
If there is pain in the bone due to compression, then cover it as best as you can; otherwise, place something over it and rest on that, and treat what caused the pain before it becomes cured.
And in some cases, this fracture of the thigh is so severe that it cannot be aligned properly with the legs, as we have said before regarding the assistants and the arms.
However, in restoring it in such a manner, do not cause the patient to limp; and if it is restored on its own, then something other than what was applied to the other leg should be used, as it is necessary for him/her to walk without limping from the affected side.
And you should know that the condition is severe in 40 days or a month or a little more, and all of this depends on the variety of complications and other dispositions.
**Chapter XV**
**On the Restoration of the Broken Rib of the Right Side**
You should know that the fracture of the rib on the right side often leads to prolonged pain, and this may result in persistent inflammation and stiffness.
If the fracture occurs, it is often nothing more than a crack or break in its parts, and this is what is known as the plague or a great affliction, and everything has been at the expense of feeling.
And its restoration is such that it should be equal to what was broken from its parts, and this should be added and joined according to what can be done in a balanced and facile manner.
And then apply a plaster and place it over that round stain, if you need to; tighten the bandage around it as appropriate.
And then consider all the dispositions that we have recommended in other fractures, thus taking care and addressing anything that opposes any further accidents to what is appropriate for its healing.
Chapter XVI.
On the restoration of the broken leg.
You know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is thick and is called the femur; and the other is thin and is called the tibia.
And it happens in some cases of fracture that the two bones of the arm are affected, and for this reason restoration is made to them equally as with the arm itself, and the operation on them is one.
And if two bones are broken at the same time, the leg is completely shattered.
And if the broken bone is a subtle fracture, the leg is shattered in a different way.
And if the broken bone is a large, severe one, you will find swelling, and it is among those causes that are not easily healed.
Then apply extension, compression, and traction to the bones according to that agreement.
However, if the fracture of the leg is clean without movement, extension should be less and lighter, and it should be supported by your skill.
And in the leg there is a cause for surgery on the arm, and when you align the bones and complete all the surgical procedures, you will take wooden splints from the lower part where the causes are left behind, and they are made entirely of palm leaves; tie them gently to those that require slight tightening, and avoid using your hands, and the length of those should be according to the length of the leg, and from the outer side inward to the deepest part.
And then wrap each one with a cloth in two layers according to its length, placing one at the opening of the leg from one side and the other from the other side, ensuring they are tightly wrapped around the foot's base.
Then fasten the two strips at three points on each of the two extremities and in the middle point, so that this structure prevents the leg from bending at the right and left openings, and thus remains stable.
And now, a bracer of wood is applied according to the length of the leg; it should be secured around the leg to prevent any further movement.
Especially ensure that you do this in cases of fracture, and when the pain is truly severe.
And then, each day, consider the leg and thoroughly study it, keeping an eye out for any signs of detachment or inflammation or other similar issues; and when any such cause arises, be prepared to apply treatment until it heals.
Chapter .xvii.
On the fracture of the talus bone and other bones of the foot and toes.
The talus bone does not suffer a fracture completely; rather, it is the bones of the foot that sometimes suffer fractures; and the toes of the foot rarely suffer fractures, but they do experience atrophy due to their structure.
And if the bones of the foot do indeed fracture and those bones become displaced among themselves, then the patient should lie on their side with their foot prepared in this way as they recover.
Then place one foot over what is elevated among those bones, and press upon them, and squeeze them together until they return to their proper places.
And then apply a plaster and stop it, leaving the top of the foot on a small table with two plates beneath.
Then stretch the foot firmly with a downward pressure, as you have wrapped it with drapes and other causes from which it needs relief.
And as the condition passes three or four days later, you will loosen the ligament, as you will find the bones entangled, either fractured or dislocated, and the operation on these is just as known.
But if it is that some are fractured, then restore these, and engage those similarly as you have learned and rechecked on the said parts of the hand. And then place the said fractured finger in a splint according to its length, and slightly on one side; and return the foot to this table which you have rechecked, and stretch that part firmly downward.
If what is broken from the bones is two or three pieces or more, then you should place your hand over each one as they are wrapped in a soft cloth, and tighten the table at the bottom of the foot, and stand on one of the table's heads to make an incision in the sole of the foot so that it has good retention.
And it is important for you that you do not forget to consider all the causes of which we have spoken regarding other fractures from accidents that we have mentioned, and be prepared for any accident that may occur.
**Capitol .xviii.** (Chapter XVIII)
**On Fractures of the Hipbone, Shin Bone, and Male Genital Bone.**
When the hipbone is broken, make a clean cut at the site of the fracture, then gently incline the bone towards the center of the body slightly, and hold it behind.
And then the midwife fills the incision with wool, making it as wide as possible; and the woman is made to stretch her legs little by little, until everything is removed from within so that the wound opening is in front of the severed tendon and bone fragment.
Then place pillows on the patient's back, and when they want to urinate, help them remove the bandages, collect the urine, clean and return it according to the same method as before, and then return them to their initial position.
And do this for seven days or around that time, as it is restored.
And if you wish, take a small bladder of a sheep and place a cane tube over the wound; then insert the whole bladder into the opening in the tendon, and blow air through the tube until the bladder is inflated inside the wound, as the fracture returns.
And then it is filled with a bandage and left for some days, according to our recommendation, until it heals.
And when the bone of the thigh of a man or woman is cracked, then administer in its restoration and stitching the treatment that we have recommended for the hip bone.
And what is right should not be overlooked in these close fractures, and there is little risk, especially to those who have some knowledge and understanding of this my book; for that fracture reveals to you in the greatest dispositions for your safe restoration and tightening of it, and therefore understand well.
But in the case of a man's testicle when it is crushed, take a cold compress from above and place it on that; then wrap it with a cloth, and have it wrapped up, and leave it for three days or so, and it will heal.
Chapter .xix.
On the restoration of broken bones when they are injured.
It is convenient for him who suffers a fracture due to an injury, especially if the bone is large, such as the bone of the thigh or a similar one, that you immediately perform a flebotomy on him, provided that the circumstances of a flebotomy at your disposal or recommended by witnesses allow it, as we have said above.
And if the injury exudes pus, then know that you must cauterize it with a hot iron in such a way that you cover it with a clean bandage after three days, unless another cause requires otherwise.
Then begin to restore the fracture within a few days, and do not prolong it, unless gangrene occurs.
If you experience an apothema (abscess) carefully, leave its restoration inside for up to nine days, until the abscess has subsided, and do not touch it on the third, fourth, and fifth day of each week, lest you cause further harm.
If a bone breaks and is prominent through the exposed skin, cover it to prevent further damage, and use your hands or tools with ease and minimal extension to reduce and secure the broken part.
If the extent of the damage requires more than your hands, use a tool; and this tool should be made of metal, with a length of seven or eight digits (roughly spanning from thumb to pinky), and a width corresponding to the severity of the injury; for this reason, it is essential that a physician chooses among these three or four tools according to the amount needed for treatment in all types of fractures.
And both should be made to fit closely, so that they do not bend or shift during the operation.
And it has its most acute extremity where its margin is in its own extremities; and above it should be tightly stretched, and from its middle within the partitions.
And this is the shape of it:
And it is called "voluntary hernia" in Greek, hence the term 'paleta' (a small palate) is used.
For the purpose that the acute extremity of it is elevated above the prominent bone's extremity.
And it pulls in one swift motion as the bone returns to its place, and is wrapped with some bandage.
And thus it wraps the extremities of the fracture around each other; and if the broken extremity is thin, and does not take the instrument well for some reason, then you must insert the tip of that bone within the instrument's reach.
If you cannot return the bone to its original position, cut open that part which we have mentioned for them to insert the scissors, or saw off one of the bones in any way possible.
And then cut off the one that grows on the bone with roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is returned and the patient finds severe pain, know that the bone has not yet returned to its natural place; and thus do this so that you bring great relief to the patient.
When your restoration of the bone is complete, immerse a lint in a black astringent, and especially if it's summer, do not place any cloth or other substance on the wound, so as to prevent it from becoming infected and corrupted.
And then apply staples at the appropriate time during the complete restoration of the bone, leaving the wound exposed so that it can be cut with scissors and bandaged according to the size of the wound.
And be careful not to strain the wound against the fracture, as you have seen foolish doctors do this, causing their patients harm or even death from infection or gangrene; it is unwise. If the fracture's tension is slight, flexible, different from other fractures' tension.
If the wound is large or a bad wound, and you are concerned about further complications as we have discussed, and you feel pain at the site, do not apply pressure over that area, but rather make a wrap with a hard cloth in place of staples and tighten it around those parts.
And when the pain has begun, perhaps a day or two later, having created a bruise in that part, you remove from over it the cloth which you had placed, and then administer some treatment, those which by our custom are used to treat bruises, thus as with a tetracyclic ointment and similar things.
And it is appropriate for you to loosen the ligature and consider the wound each day and evening until it is healed and stabilized, and ensure that the member is prepared in such a way that the pus flows from it to the distant parts more easily.
If the wound has passed many days and is not healed nor does the bruise separate from the limb, then you should know that here are stages of the small plague so that in every place where the bruise tries to heal, it will be hindered. And from those stages, some are separated and removed, while others are not and put the member under pressure, causing pain. Therefore, cut into those according to what is possible for you.
And if the wound is infected with pus or ulceration, which are signs of infection and decay, then you should treat each one as appropriate for the cure, which was preceded by a description in its chapter.
And regarding what I should say and you present your case: when the bone is cracked, it protrudes over the member along with the bones of the thigh and the helper, resembling those of the larger members, and do not attempt to attract or extract it under any circumstances, as this may cause death; after cleaning that area, wait for it to heal, which can take several days; and treat the wound if you see it, and leave it if not.
**Chapter XX.**
**On the Cure for Nodosity That Occurs at the Site of a Fracture.**
Movements witnessed during the healing process of a fracture, especially near joints, are caused by the shape of the affected member, and greatly hinder its normal function.
Then consider whether the movement is recent and administer those medicines that have been effective for it, such as aloe, fennel, and others similar to these; in this way, you take some or all of them, and apply those with a stinging quality, or albumen from milk, or bitter wine, and rest the affected area with a compress, and tighten around it with good constriction.
And be aware of the constriction that does not loosen for several days; then release it and apply another, as long as the movement persists; or place a sheet of lead on top, because lead has the property of reducing any swelling in the members.
If the movement has already turned into a rigid contraction and it is caused by a necessity to prevent damage, then divide it with the most superior part of the affected area, remove excess and prominent parts, or cut them off as needed, until the movement is healed.
Chapter .xxi.
On the restoration of fractures, when the bone is restored and then it is bound with a splint, the delicate member should be handled gently according to its nature.
When a bone fracture is restored and the delicate member is bound, it should not be done for trivial reasons: among which one is the abundance of solution for the ligament and the binding of the fracture, not according to what is needed; or due to excessive tightness of the ligaments preventing nutrition from reaching the member; or due to excessive oozing; or due to improper movement at an inappropriate time; or due to lack of strength in the spine during the patient's illness, and due to debility.
And the cure for this is to restrict the patient's movement and make their heart tender while the swelling increases in them; and administer baths, and gently massage it.
And then place your hand over the member, so that the grip draws to it the most nutritious fluid, or continue rubbing it with lukewarm water until the nutrient flows and returns to its natural form.
Chapter XXII
On the healing of fractured bones when they are restored crookedly and the operation of their covering is prohibited.
When it happens to the already restored member, then the healing of its tortuosity and deviation from the bone is sought, and by doing so the shape of the member is corrected; nevertheless, the member is not prohibited from its natural operation, as long as you receive permission from someone who considers that member newly fractured.
There have indeed been many foolish doctors and healers who have done this on our earth, and this operation is highly vilified, losing great fear of the sign of which it is mortal.
If recent claudication and nodation are present, then cover them in a poultice of herbs that soften the pain, such as mullein and chamomile, and similar ones; apply a mollifying plaster to it, or use a paste of mullein root mixed with lard or olive oil, and wrap it up; or use fat figs pressed into pigeon droppings, and similar ones to those used in medicines called "amermans consolidatio.
Sometimes, it is dissolved with frequent light friction on the most humid parts, and the affected member should be moved through all its ranges several times a day.
If the deformity has progressed and become hardened and curved into a stone, causing pain and requiring treatment with iron, then you should note that pus has ceased to form and the continuity of the bone is dissolved, and it is incised where excess nodulation of that joint interferes with movement, using delicate saws, and ease is provided for that part through rest and study.
Chapter .xxiii.
On the topic of dislocation.
Dislocation is the condition when one of the body's joints becomes dislocated, rendering it immobile and causing the shape of the affected member to be distorted, leading to severe pain and injury in the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation occurs, it is usually necessary to pierce (or reduce) it as soon as possible; if this is delayed, the joint becomes stiff and rigid, making it difficult to reduce the dislocation.
And so it is important not to move or stretch the joint excessively during the period of stiffness, as this can cause muscle spasms and severe pain.
When this occurs, you must prepare for a fluortomies of the hernia, and place something that will rest on the aperture; then the member should be soaked in lukewarm water and oil, and reduced with ease.
And every member should be treated with water, the memory of which will return to its proper place.
And you have already arranged the chapters of dislocation as previously mentioned in the fracture; from the departure of the upper body into the lower part.
Chapter .XXIIIII.
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
If both jaws are dislocated without injury, the dislocation of both is caused by one of two methods: either they are pulled from their places with a slight movement and become slightly relaxed; or they are completely dislocated and swollen, so that saliva from the wound cannot exit, and he cannot open his mouth nor close it, and his tongue is wrapped in its own secretions.
When the dislocation is slight, it often returns to its proper position on its own without a significant cause.
If the dislocation is complete and severe, it is necessary to gently reduce it without delay, so that it does not remain stretched out.
And the practitioner should have the patient's head in his hands, and the doctor should insert one finger into the root of the jaw dislocation inside the mouth, if it is on one side; or he should insert both fingers together, if it is on two sides, and all other fingers should be outside to which they are opposed; and he commands the patient to cease moving his jaws and relax them so that they return to their proper place.
And if the reduction is difficult, especially when both jaws are simultaneously dislocated, then evaporative treatment with water and oil should be administered so that a gentle reduction of both can be achieved without delay, as we have said.
And therefore when we return and find them equalized, the mouth of the hernia is closed and not relaxed, then place a layer of cloth cerot over those powder-like drapes, and apply wax and rubbed oil; and afterwards, make it smooth and easy with soft bindings.
And let the patient sleep with their hernia on their back, and have their head between two pillows, so that they do not wince to the right or left; and do not force them to chew; having taken their food, wait until the pains subside and the jaws are relaxed, then let them eat what they will.
And this should be facilitated, and do not work on the opening of the mouth during eating, drinking, or speaking until the jaw is relaxed and healed.
And if it is difficult to reduce the jaws when they are dislocated at any time and do not return to their proper places, then fevers and persistent vomiting occur, and the patient's stomach is greatly disturbed, and strong vomiting of pure bile occurs.
And when you see this, you will know it is a loss; and many times the patient dies within a few days of this happening.
**Chapter 25**
**On Reducing Dislocations of the Furca (Elbow) and End of Muscle**
The furca (elbow) is not dislocated from the socket within due to the continuation of its tendon; and sometimes it is dislocated at the outer joint, and this is indicated by sensation.
And the restoration of it is that the patient lies on their back and extends their arms. And then you tighten the area with your palm using a firm compression, so it returns to its place.
And then apply pressure over that dressing and poultice and tighten it.
Apply the edge of that which has dried on the wound and is continued there, it should not be displaced for some days; then it must be cleaned and bandaged as we have said and according to your equipment.
And then apply pressure over that dressing, poultice, and compression, and instruct the patient to adhere to rest and tranquility until it heals.
In this treatment, the cure is reduced when the extremity of the muscle is separated from its place.
**Chapter XXVI** (This indicates the chapter number, not a translation.)
On the reduction of muscle dislocation.
You should know that the muscle is not dislocated but in three ways: one of which is dislocated at the attachment to the bone at its insertion.
And the second is that it is dislocated at the attachment of the muscle, and this is done with care; it is not dislocated at the back attachments through the shoulder; and it is not dislocated at the front attachments by the nerves.
And it is most commonly dislocated and comes out at the attachment of the tendon on the inside, especially in those where there is little flesh, it is slightly dislocated; but more often in those where there is much flesh, it is stuck outside with difficulty.
And many people suffer accidents through blows or falls, and the muscle of him is marked with a bruise, frozen from freezing, and it is torn by what has already been dislocated.
Then understand that your breath enters here while you are lying on it, and you will proceed with the treatment of it.
And it is known that dislocation occurs when the tendon slips from its place; so that you may distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy one, as you find great diversity among them; and you will find in the head of the muscle a concave shape and the tendon slipped from touch against the head of the muscle just like a nut, and the patient cannot return their hand to its normal position nor move it without pain.
If it is dislocated at the foot or ankle, and you find clear signs of injury, it is not hidden.
And from this dislocation, slight reduction is done when it is fresh and the patient is young.
And the reduction of it is that the hand is raised towards the affected part; then the servant places his fingers under the tendon, and raises the joint to its place with strength, and the minister raises the patient's hand and extends it; and he holds it there until it returns slightly.
It is not possible to provide a precise translation without further context and a deeper understanding of the historical language used. However, based on the given text, here is a best-guess translation line by line:
And then place the patient back on their feet, with their toes pointing downwards, awaiting that they be slightly bent between relaxation and tension, and the doctor places his hand on the expectation, lifts the head of the muscle towards verticity, pulls the patient's toe away from the joints so as not to be damaged when returning, and another assistant holds the patient's foot so it is not injured upon return.
And if you wish, reduce this second in this manner: make sure to have a stronger person than the patient, stand on their side, insert their muscle between the patient's toes and lift the toes towards the parts above until the patient is suspended in air, and another assistant pulls the patient's toes away from the abdominal parts. If the patient is lighter, then be sure to check what else may cause them to be suspended, so as to address that issue, for the dislocation may return at any moment.
And it is reduced in another manner: a long stick is placed on the ground with a rounded end like a mortar pestle, neither too thick nor too thin; then it is positioned beneath the patient; drapes are then laid over the head of the stick, and the patient's pain should be aligned with the length of the stick, and the doctor's hand is extended to the opposite side; and the patient's body part on the other side is strengthened, so that the joint returns to its place at speed.
And if the reduction is difficult due to all the causes mentioned, then use this cure: take a stick whose length is about two arms' length and its width four digits; shape it away from the handle as follows:
Then cover the rounded end with lion's fur to prevent the stick from irritating the pain.
And then pause the patient on their side, and extend your hand or arm over the chest within the gaps, and lay the chest upon the assistants, the arms, and the end of your hand.
Then pause the arm on a scale according to its length, and extend your hand over the gaps, while the other hand is suspended on the other side, so that the joint might be within reach.
And when the treatment of the patient is complete according to any method that is possible for you, and it becomes clear that you have paused the flow of blood from the veins of both legs, then prepare a plaster with fine powder from mills mixed with egg albumen over all the muscles, so that they are turned away from each other, and tighten the bandage over the area; let the ligament be turned over the plaster, and attach your hand to the patient's collarbone, and leave it for seven days.
And it is necessary to provide the patient with moderate food, until the member is relieved, for it aids in the healing of the injury.
Then the food should be increased gradually and a movement made; and if it stops and does not improve, then healing has ceased.
But if the joint is dislocated due to moisture or other cause, then it should be treated with cautery according to what is said in the chapter on cautery.
And if all this is done and after seven days the ligament and joint are not healed, and the bandages and compression are removed from him several times, and he cannot raise that arm due to pain, then know that the nerves in it, which are at the top of the muscle, are already damaged or stretched or relaxed, and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
From the dislocation of that which is caused, you must return the foot and the ankle or the joints behind, reduction is made with pressure and extension with the hands, so that it returns.
And both these strains should be treated, and care taken until they are healed.
And if the healing becomes more serious in the member and delays its movement, then the illness uses frequent baths to alleviate this gravity until it is removed and returns to its original state.
Chapter 27.
On the cure for dislocation of the hip.
You know that the joint of the hip is dislocated with difficulty and returns with difficulty; it is dislocated in all directions, most notably towards the front compared to behind, and the dislocation is not concealed when you look at it or touch it, according to some figure being dislocated, and when you adjust the dislocated hip joint, this is clearly declared to you, because the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm nor touch its muscles.
And take care to cover the cuts, and reduce the dislocation as soon as it comes to a safe point, for if it reaches a dangerous state, reduction becomes difficult, and recovery is not certain; especially when it affects the rear parts, for it is worse than all other types of dislocation, causing greater pain and often leading to death.
And the restoration of the dislocation, when it is possible to reduce it, involves extending the doctor's hand with two more fingers, spreading the patient's leg, and placing the doctor's hands on the patient's thighs and pushing the joint back into place using the pads of their fingers or the palm of their hand until it returns to its original position.
If the dislocation is in front of the body, then return the hand by bending it towards the patient's thigh, and push against the thigh with the palm of the hand until the dislocated part returns to its original position.
And if the dislocation does not obey to reduction, then administer violent extension and strong motion.
And indeed, two ministers should extend the arm, and have this observation by two ministers so that there is no doubt about the extension.
Then turn the arm over completely, as it is wrapped with a long folded cloth over their hand, or ligament.
And when the doctor touches the joint with his hand, he applies some oil to it in order that these causes which help in lubricating the joint and facilitate its return. Then he gently pushes and rubs the joint until it returns to its place.
Then the reduction should be made so that it is paused over the paste in which there is tightness and execution with white of egg, and be extracted and relaxed gently, and the arm should be suspended from the collarbone, and left for some days.
And then it is loosened; so if the joint is formed in its place, you loosen the ligament from it and leave it be.
And if you see that the joint is not too strained, you repeat the plastering and loosening of the ligament, leaving it for a few days until it is completely relaxed; then you loosen it.
But if it is a serious case where the joint is in an unstable position and in movement, then moistening with baths and subtle friction, along with compression, should be applied until it is alleviated; or rest should be provided on the affected joint during the day and night, especially if it involves a fatty motion. Then you should immobilize it and place that in a bath; and when the swelling subsides, rub the joint with warm friction, repeating this three times daily, especially if it is painful on movement. in the bathwater, until it is calm.
And if you wish, press on that moist and raw fissure of the cow with your hand and apply pressure; do this several times, as it is moist and yielding.
Chapter 28.
On the treatment of dislocation of the shoulder, which is in the joint between the arm and hand.
In certain cases, the shoulder may be dislocated, and its reduction is delicate; conversely, other joints may be more easily reduced, but it is nevertheless crucial to act swiftly in reducing a dislocated shoulder immediately after it occurs, before the area becomes numb or develops an inflammation.
And the reduction of the dislocation is that you place the joint of the patient's hand on a table and make them extend their hand, while the doctor places his hand or palm over the joint's proximity, and gently push until it returns to its place.
However, it is necessary to consider that if the palm has already been placed on the patient's belly, then the patient should position their back on a table for extension and reduction; and if the dislocation occurred before the back of the hand, then the doctor's hand must be positioned intrinsically over the table in order to press against the joint's proximity.
And therefore, if this is done quickly, it is good; otherwise, gently press the bandage over the hernia and leave it; and do not worry about it, for if you do not attempt to reduce it within a few days, it will not heal or be able to be reduced.
However, the joint of Rome must be handled according to its curvature; it does not notice any cause of pain, but the hand becomes softened and cannot hold any cause; then you will know that the nerves are torn or crushed, and there is no pain in it unless it is tightened with a cautery near its accommodation and strongly applied, it confers some cause.
When the illness returns, you must apply the poultice that we have prepared and leave it for several days; then loosen it and leave it and exercise your hand on it.
If the movement of it is stopped and some injury occurs, then apply a cold water compress and friction several times, until it is relieved.
**Chapter 29.**
**On the Treatment of Dislocated Joints**
Some times the joints are dislocated completely.
And when a joint is dislocated at the back of the hand or on the abdomen, squeeze it and push the dislocation back into place with your fingers, until it returns to its proper position.
Then support the head of the joint, suspend the affected part to prevent further displacement, and leave it in that position for two days.
Then suspend it and stretch it until it is correctly aligned on that same day.
And at night, according to this account, continue to stretch it and do not cease to move it in the day, and stretch it at night; do this for several days until it is completely straightened.
And make it look like this, if it is dislocated in the mother's womb, and join them to each other, and perform the first operation on it, as long as it heals.
And make it look like this when it is dislocated in other parts.
Chapter .XXX.
On the treatment of dislocation of the spinal vertebrae.
When any of the spinal or cervical vertebrae are completely dislocated, causing them to be out of their normal positions, this is a serious condition. If left untreated, it can lead to permanent damage and even death due to the severity of the illness.
And the sign of this is that the patient cannot control their condition, and often experiences weakness in certain parts of their body, such as legs or both legs or arms, or even a spinal vertebra is dislocated, as often times these are displaced and removal to four parts is necessary.
Therefore, that part is now cleansed at the back and is called hernias.
The treatment for hernias is that you must consider whether the hernia occurred due to childhood, because at that time it is neither curable nor will it heal completely.
In cases where you see it [the hernia] due to an accident or impact or something similar, the ancients spoke of treatment in lengthy speeches, of which the most beneficial results are obtained; but I have already briefly discussed this, from which little excuse can be made for the excessive protrusion, due to my proximity to understanding, by which I have here expounded and formed various instruments with which I will now spread and space out that same hernia.
And of those, only the one that occurs in the back specifically due to this condition can be cured.
And this disease is so widespread on the body that it affects both sides near the walls, and it extends below causing great pain so that the hands cannot be moved.
Then a straight stick is placed, fixed in the ground at the end of the foot around the patient's head, and another stick is positioned with the patient's legs on either side of the foot.
The practitioner holds the stick, and it should not be buried in a hole; another practitioner holds the other according to that form.
Then they wrap around the patient's head and below the shoulders, tighten the ties, and extend one end of the tie to the stick that is placed on their head, tying it there; similarly, they tie the other end to the stick placed under their legs, which supports their hips, and adjust all the ties, tying them to the other stick intended for the feet.
And then the surgeon should extend the casing of the splint to cover the fracture, and ensure that both legs and their ligaments in the places where they are attached are not damaged, but nevertheless not too tightly secured as we have said.
And the doctor places his palms on the spine with strength while it heals, or he places one hand on a table, and then adjusts the patient's feet on the table until they heal.
If it does not heal in this manner, then take a table whose width or length is three arm-lengths, and dig into the wall where we have said that the disease is most present. Then place the edge of the table on the spine, and the doctor places his feet on the other end, stretching until the spine is straightened and returns to its place.
And if you wish, open it again with your hand; and since you must stand on the ground, place the patient's head at the back of your two fists, their length being equal to an arm's length, and the head of the hernia in the palm of each hand exactly, so that there is a cut in each fist where the threads run through, and each finger is firmly planted on the ground so as not to slip.
And make another fist with which to turn it, and twist it in the two channels of both fists.
And at the end of it, there is a channel in which the fist is formed, its length being a palm where it is twisted; and in the other two fists, it is similar to that.
And then tighten the ligaments you have straightened around the patient's chest at the opening where their head is placed, and the ligaments you have tightened in their thighs at the turn which is meant for their feet.
And then you should take each turn and have a minister twist the turn with their hand, and the doctor applies the same treatment to the spine as we have said.
Then, when the spine is returned to its place and the area is cleaned, apply a dry, coagulant paste made from alba (a type of clay) and stop it; then place a bandage over the paste, taking care that its width is three times or so the length of the affected area, and its length covers the spot of inflammation, and around the spine's joint.
And then, using the remedy we have mentioned, nourish the patient with subtle, healing foods.
And if any signs of recurrence are observed in the area after healing, it is necessary to administer drugs that soften and soothe with long-term table administration, which we have recommended; this treatment is already being given through a lead sheet placed on that spot.
And in some cases, a severe pain occurs at the back of the spine, which is caused by that dislocation; and it is that bone which you should be aware of, as it is very likely to cause death if not treated properly with this medicine.
**Capitol .xxxi.**
On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
You know that the hip joint and the muscle joint should not be dislocated so easily, and it only happens to those who experience other joints with minor displacement and curvature.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways: either it is displaced inward, or outward, or forward, or backward.
And it is most commonly dislocated inward, and rarely forward or backward.
And the sign of a dislocated hip inward is that, when you adjust the patient's leg to their body, the opposite side becomes longer, and the affected side is more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their knee normally, and this is the place where the tendon becomes attached in a hooked shape, so that the head of the bone has already been displaced here.
And the sign of that which suffers from dislocation is when parts are separated outside, because the accidents of it are opposed to this accident.
The sign of someone who suffers from dislocation in the front parts is when they stretch their leg according to the injury, but nevertheless do not fold the joint where the pain is located, and if it perforates to the point of being unable to move it forward towards the front parts; then the urine of the patient is retained and the hernia of the patient is palpable, and you must move the patient's leg over the thigh.
The sign of someone who suffers from dislocation in the back parts is that they do not stretch the joint, nor can they bend what bends the hernia, and the leg of the patient is shorter on one side than the other, and the hernia becomes softer, and the head of the object is turned to that place.
But the reduction of the species of this dislocation is that you consider, then, if the dislocation is old and ancient, it has already been reduced by itself or properly treated according to its position, then it is not in that cure of all; and thus it does not cover that there is some provision made for it.
Place it in that case where the dislocation is recent and it is one of the four types of dislocations; then apply pressure to bring the joint back and stretch it on both internal and external parts, and turn it to the right and left, for thus it will quickly return and need no other treatment.
If it does not return in this manner, then prepare a strong support and extend the patient's leg from the joint below, or use a strap, or a tight bandage that is placed over the leg; another minister should stretch the hand of the patient in such a way that he places his fingers on the testicles of the patient; and another should tighten the bandage around the base of the thigh and have someone else hold the end of the bandage.
And extend the leg or the internal part to angle the joint from the fork's position, or from the rear part to the front of the spine.
And at the same time, all of those should be extended until the patient is raised to a sitting position and their legs hang down.
This type of extension is especially important for all four limbs.
And therefore, if the dislocation returns to what we have said, it will be good; otherwise, it will be necessary to consider all kinds of things regarding its treatment.
In the reduction of the dislocated joint, when the dislocation is internal, the patient should be placed on their side; then, the ligament should be tightened over the area where the thigh joins the pelvis, and extended from the angle to the highest point of the femur.
And then another assistant should firmly grasp the patient's thighs, press the painful area deeply, and extend it outward with strong extensions to force the joint back into place.
And this specific type is of a lighter cure which reduces this member more than others.
If it is excused from you and you do not obey the treatment for this type of cure at all, then understand that both feet of the patient must be tied together with a light, weaker ligature on both the toes and both the heels.
And the length of each part is according to four units, and the affected leg must be extended more than the other by a quantity of two units.
Then the hernia must be suspended over the top of the leg, and it should be in the lower part; and the length of it from the ground is the quantity of two arms' lengths.
Then command a strong young person to reduce the head of the hernia, and hang it from another young person, while another young person presses the hernia with force, so that the joint returns to its place at speed.
In the reduction of a dislocation that has gone outside, it is necessary to keep the patient immobile on the affected leg as we have recommended in its immobilization; and tighten the ligament specifically on the injured leg and on the chest of the patient.
Then place two sticks as supports, one on the patient's feet and the other on their head; and place a stick adjusted in the middle of the buttocks over which damp cloths are wrapped, so that the disease is not aggravated by the stick being wedged between the patient's legs, so you must prevent the extension to the parts below from being pulled.
And each assistant should extend themselves to their part, and the doctor with his hand tightens the reduction according to art (or skill).
And when the dislocation is in the front parts, you must extend the leg slightly, and according to this method, as I have described for the foot; the doctor places the palm of his right hand over the affected limb, then with his other hand he pulls it, holding that position until the dislocated part returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is in the back parts, you will not extend the patient, but rather raise him above the ground; once you have confirmed that he is resting on a hard surface, thus as we have said about his position on two surfaces; and his face and limbs are extended, as we have mentioned, without any harm.
And it is necessary to apply compression with a splint on the area where the joint is dislocated.
Therefore, once the reduction is complete according to need — and the sign of the reduction of the hernia is not hidden from you, since you extend two legs from the patient's condition, and when you see those folds and the hernia extrudes its leg and you expand that excuse, then you know that the member according to need has been returned — and now you adjust two things and apply paste and remove the bandage so that the wound is not worsened in either of the parts; and keep the herniated person at rest for three days or four.
Then remove the ligament and paste, and compare one leg to the other.
Now, if you see those folds on the surface, then you will know that the dislocation is already closed, and so you can let the patient go.
And if you see any sign of softening, then return and paste that, remove that according to your first stretch, and let it heal in three days.
And then carefully remove that, and make him walk slowly for some days, until he is healed.
**Capitol .xxxii.**
On the treatment of dislocated joints.
The joint is dislocated in three ways: when it is displaced outwardly, inwardly, or to the side, and not forward.
And the sign of the dislocation is that you command the patient to apply their leg to the affected area; then you know that the joint is dislocated.
And the restoration of all these ways is that you make the patient cease their movement, if possible, extend their leg, place their back against a wall, and rest their foot between their legs; then adhere your hands to the joint, press firmly between your fingers on the dislocated joint until it returns to its place.
And the sign of recovery for them is that their leg sticks to the thigh in a non-painful position.
Then apply a plaster to hold the leg to the thigh, and then bind those parts with a bandage for three or four days, and then remove the bandage.
And do not use the patient's mobility for some days, as long as they are healthy and comfortable.
If the reduction of the hernia is not urgent, then administer extensive treatment with medications whose use in the cure of the aforementioned hernia has been described.
Chapter .xxxiii. (Note: The number xxxiii represents the chapter number, not a part of the text itself.)
On the cure of the dislocation of the talus.
Sometimes the toe is broken by a minor removal, and sometimes it is dislocated completely, and the dislocation occurs either within the joints or outside them.
And the sign of the dislocation is that the toe appears swollen proceeding to the joint at which it is dislocated.
The treatment for the dislocation of the toe is by gentle reduction, and it should be extended at ease to the muscles and wrapped until it returns.
However, in the treatment when it is completely dislocated, you must cease the injury immediately, and have a strong and capable assistant apply pressure behind the toe at its middle joint.
Then with your right hand, gently raise the foot from the superior part, and with your left hand, hold the lower part of the foot in its joint.
And then slowly stretch the foot to the right with your left hand, and make two strokes with your right hand on the left side, and extend it; then push the foot of the patient towards the bed with your right hand while keeping the leg straight.
And do this twice as we have counted.
And then push the foot of the patient towards the bed for the third time, and you are at the ankle.
So if you return in one stroke or two according to this method, and turn the foot inside out, it is good; otherwise, continue the operation over it again.
If it is forbidden for you to reduce it in this way that we have recommended, then make the patient lie on their back on the ground, and take a firm piece of wood, and place it between the patient's thighs, and you have already wrapped cloth over them so that they do not rub against each other.
And then the surgeon should hold the patient's legs, and another minister should extend the foot according to its joints or binding that lies on the collar of the foot; and another minister should spread it against the extension of his side, and the padding or bandage between the thighs of the patient should retain it, so that the movement of the operation is not pulled away from the parts left after its extension.
Then the doctor should dislocate it with his hands, and another minister should hold the healthy thigh at the parts left, so that the dislocation returns to its place easily.
And when the dislocation returns to its place and it is declared that the reduction of the foot is healthy, then apply a plaster and reinforce that binding strongly, and tie the foot with binding to the leg.
And be careful of the nerves that are behind on the sole, so that the binding over those is not violent and damages them strongly.
And then leave it for two days or three; and if the swelling subsides, remove that.
And on the third day or the fourth, remove that, and forbid the patient from moving for ten days. If it is necessary to move that space, there is no guarantee that the dislocation will not be further aggravated and corrupted, and this may lead to a condition that does not receive treatment.
And if you experience an abscess cauterization, then apply what we mentioned earlier in the narrative regarding treatment and washing, as long as it remains undried.
Chapter .xxxiiii. (Note: "Capitol" likely refers to the beginning of a new chapter, but without further context or a complete text, I can only translate the heading.)
On the treatment of dislocation of the joints of the feet.
He understands that when a joint is dislocated, it should be gently reduced to its proper position; and for those cases where it is not difficult, it is better to leave it alone.
If the dislocation is in one of the joints of the foot, then you should know that the patient's foot should be held still by a splint either on the ground or on a table, and left in that position as if walking.
Then you should stand by the foot, place your hand over what seems to be affecting the joints, gently press the foot towards it until you feel the dislocation return, and ensure that what was previously dislocated is now reduced and does not protrude from the affected area.
Then place a board under the patient's foot that takes the entire weight of the leg, with two ends, and tighten it gently but firmly for three days; thereafter, remove it and allow the patient to walk gradually, over several days, until complete healing is assured.
Chapter .xxxv.
On the types of dislocations that occur due to illness, fracture, or any other cause.
When any of these causes occurs, and you focus on the treatment and restoration of it, sudden complications can lead to death.
And for this reason, one should not imagine that they know how to cure it, but rather he who is skilled in the art, of great experience, mercy, and compassion; tardy, not hasty or presumptuous; and who uses beginning medicines with caution, avoids extreme measures, leaves the judgment to God, unless you expect health from death, alleviation from illness, and have some hope. And therefore, one should strive as much as possible to reduce it at the beginning of the cause, before applying extreme measures.
And then, if the member returns to its proper place, administer treatment with gentle cautery and cure the affliction using dry compresses as appropriate for it.
If there is a dislocation and fracture of the bones, causing them to separate, then you should puncture their joints, as we have said regarding simple injuries of this type, which are mentioned in the places of these.
And be mindful and cautious regarding the use of medicines in the pathways of fear, as my previous instruction has guided you; for it is better for you to honor your Creator, and more enduring for your glory, and brings greater health to your true body in its proper time. Thus, end the words of Albucasim perfectly, of which God be blessed. Amen.
