Praefatio.	 Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	 After I have completed the book for you, sons, which is the last in the knowledge of medicine with its supplement, and having reached the end in it, through expositions of it, and its declarations, it seemed to me to complete it for you with this Treatise, which is a part of operation, that is, surgery, with hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	 Since operation with hand is laid low in our region, and at our time entirely deprived of it; perhaps until the knowledge of it has perished and its trace has vanished, and only small descriptions remain in ancient books which have been changed by hands, and error and hesitation occurred, so that the intentions have been closed and the will was dispersed; It seemed to me that I should revive it with this Treatise according to the way of expositions, declarations, and abbreviation, and also that I come with the forms of iron tools of Cautery and the rest of the instruments of work, with the addition of declarations and the need for it.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	 The reason why a good craftsman of this art with his hand is not found in this time is that the art of medicine is long and its author must be trained beforehand in the science of anatomy, which Galen described, until he knows the remedies for the limbs and their shapes, and their conjunction and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, nerves, muscles, their number, and their exits, and the vessels of pulsation, quiet ones, and their locations.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	 And for this reason, Hippocrates said that much is the name with its name, but little is the work, and especially in the art of hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	 We have indeed said about it at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	 Because he who is not knowing what we have said about anatomy, is not purged from already falling into error, in which men are slain: as I have seen many of those who are formed by this science, and boast themselves about it without knowledge, and without experience.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	 Because I have seen a foolish physician follow an aposteme (boil) on the neck of a woman, and cut some arteries in her neck: wherefore the woman's blood flowed until she fell dead in his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	 And I have seen another physician presume to extract a stone from an old man, which had grown, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	 Therefore he came to him, and extracted it with a piece of bladder.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	 Wherefore the man died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	 And indeed I had already been summoned to extract it; and I saw from the size of the stone, and the condition of the patient, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	 And I have seen another physician receiving a fee from some Duke of our land because of medicine; and a black eunuch was with him, who had a fracture near the heel of his leg: and the physician in his ignorance, bound up the fracture on a wound with awls and strong needles, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	 Then he cured him according to his own devices.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	 Afterwards he sent him away for some days and commanded him not to loosen the bandage; and it stood thus until there was an abscess on his leg, and his foot, and it reached its destruction.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	 I was then summoned to him; and I hastened to loosen the bandage; and there came peace, and he was delivered from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	 Nevertheless corruption had already been confirmed in the member; and I could not arrest it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	 Apply [the ointment] so that the corruption may stop spreading in the member until it perishes.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	 And I saw another physician who pierced a malignant apostema; and it became ulcerated for days, until the wickedness of it was manifested with its lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	 Because when the cancer is pure due to black bile, then it should not be approached with iron at all unless it is in a member that can endure it, so that the whole of it may be cut off.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	 And because of that which is said in O Filii, it is necessary for you to know that the operation is divided into two divisions: namely, the operation associated with safety; and the operation where danger is present in many arrangements.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	 And I have already aroused myself in every place of this book, wherever there comes an operation where there is fear and dread.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	 Therefore it is necessary for you to be cautious of that and to separate it: so that the foolish may not find a way to speak about it and shameful things.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	 Take therefore the measurement with caution and protection, and your sick ones with ease and firmness, and make use of a better way leading by the grace of God to salvation and praiseworthy succession: and leave behind terrible illnesses that are difficult to heal; and separate yourselves from what makes you fear, so that hesitation in faith and comfort may not enter upon you.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	 For it is more becoming for your glory, and higher in this world, and finally to your ranks.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	 Galen indeed said so in some of his warnings.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	 Do not treat an evil disease; lest you be called a bad physician.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	 Now, however, I have divided this Treatise into three Chapters. ¶
Capitulum primum.	 First Chapter.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	 On Cautery with fire, and Cautery with sharp medicine, is treated, and ordered from head to foot, and forms of the instruments, and tools for Cautery: and all that is necessary in the procedure.
Capitulum secundum.	 De Arte Circumcisionis, sive Preputiorum Sectionis.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	 On the Art of Circumcision, or Preputial Section.
Capitulum tertium.	 Chapter third.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	 On restoration, displacement, and treatment of twisting and similar cases: a chapter arranged from head to foot and forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	 To God alone be the glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	 The Surgery Book by Albucasis.
Pars I.	 Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	 On the benefit and harm of cautery, in what constitutions it is appropriate, at what time, and if with iron or gold.
Caput I.	 Chapter I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	 Before I remind you of the operation with it, it is necessary to say the quality of its remedies and its harms, and in what composition it should be displayed.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	 I say therefore, that the discourse on the quality of the remedy of the cautery, and its harm, is a long, subtle, knowledge, and secret hidden matter.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	 Also there was a multitude of wise men who spoke about it and disagreed on it; and for me enough is said from their discourses, fearing prolongation.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	 I say therefore, that the cautery applies universally to all compositions, which are with matter and without matter; except for two compositions, which are a hot composition without matter and a dry composition without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	 In a hot and dry composition with matter, they disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	 Some said that the cautery is beneficial in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	 And others said the opposite, that is, that the cautery is not suitable in the disease which is of heat and dryness; because the nature of fire is heat; and it is inconvenient to heal from a hot and dry disease with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	 And he who says the opposite said that the cautery is beneficial in every hot and dry disease which occurs in the bodies of humans; because when you compare the body of a man and its humidity to the composition of fire, you find the body of a man cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	 And I myself say by his speech: because I have often seen that proven to me.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	 However, it is not necessary for that to come up, unless the one who has been proven and experienced in the exercise of the final chapter on cautery, and knows the diversity of human complexions, and the disposition of diseases in themselves, and their causes and accidents, and the space of time of those diseases.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	 From the remaining compositions there is no fear for you: and particularly in diseases that are cold and moist.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	 For they all agree among themselves on these [matters]: and they do not disagree on the use of cautery with them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	 And know, my sons, that from the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and its goodness over the cautery with medicine burning, it is because fire is simple, whose action does not reach except to the member which is being cauterized: and it does not harm another member joined to it, unless by slight damage.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	 But the action of burning medicine reaches to that which extends from the members: and perhaps it causes difficulty in healing disease in the member, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	 Fire, however, on account of its subtlety and goodness of substance, does not do that unless it is excessive.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	 But now it has become clear to us by means of experiment, because of the length of service and diligence with the art, and because of its firmness in matters of truth: and for that reason I excuse myself from the length of discourse.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	 And if it were not forbidden to this book of mine, I would bring to you the secret hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies, by which it expels diseases through philosophical demonstration, which would become clear to your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	 And know, my sons, that they themselves differ in time when it is appropriate to make a cautery, and they put the better time in truth.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	 And I say that a cautery is appropriate at any time: because damage occurring due to time is submerged in the benefit, which is attracted by the cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	 And particularly if a cautery is for pains from necessary pains, strong, sharp ones which cannot tolerate delay: because it is feared that what happens will be greater evil than slight damage due to time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And let it not enter your minds, my sons, that which is not believed except by the vulgar and foolish physicians, namely that there is no return for the sickness which is cured by cauterization, and they put forth this consequence, but things are not as they think: therefore because cauterization is not, except in place of medicine, which alters complexion, and removes humidities which are the causes, why pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	 Cauterization is unnecessary over medicine on account of the swiftness of its health, and the power of its operation, and the vehemence of its dominion: and it is possible that sickness may return at some hour according to the complexion of the sick, and the location of the sickness, and the power of the sickness: and what is prepared in the body from accumulation of superfluities in it, and what reaches it in acquisition from food, and similar things from causes, unless sickness occurs, in which cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	 A subtle sickness in a member of small superfluities and humidities, as cauterization of a tooth, due to pain, and similar things, it is possible that that pain will not return in him.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	 But this happens in few cases.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	 However, the speech of the vulgar is true again, that cauterization is the last medicine, it is a correct speech, not in what they intend by it: because they believe that there is no cure which gives with medicine, nor with anything after the falling away of cauterization.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	 But things are contrary to theirs, and their intention, that cauterization is the last medicine, is not, except that when we administer modes of cure in any sickness, and they do not give those medicines: then we administer caution at the end, and it gives: then it comes about that cauterization is the last medicine, not according to the intention which the vulgar and many foolish physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	 The ancients said that a cautionery with gold is better than one with iron; and they did not say this, if not for the equality of gold, and the loftiness of its substance; and they said that it does not cause pus at the site of the cautionery.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	 That is not entirely true; for I have proven that it does not do so in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	 And a cautionery with it is good, and better than one with iron, as they said.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	 However, when you make the cautionery with fire from gold, it is not apparent to you when lit according to the amount that you wish, due to the redness of gold; and when it reaches the same, and if you add more heat to it, it liquefies in the fire and turns into sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	 Therefore, the craftsman falls into trouble from this; and because of that, we use cautionery with iron more quickly and closely in our operations, for its accuracy.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	 And I myself have organized this chapter according to the cautery, following the chapters; and I have arranged it from top to bottom, so that those seeking it may find what they want from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	 Chapter: The method of cauterizing a head at the coronary joint.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	 Here the cauterization is applied for the dominion of humidity and coldness upon the brain: these two are the causes of soda, and the flow of abundance of fluids from the head to the parts of eyes and ears, and abundance of sleep, and pain in teeth, and pain in throat: and universally all sickness, which occurs due to coldness, such as paralysis, sodae (an ailment), epilepsy, apoplexy, and similar ailments.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	 The method of cauterization is that you instruct the patient: to evacuate in the first instance with dissolved medicine purifying the head for three or four nights, according to the strength of the patient, and his age, and his custom.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	 Then instruct him (the patient) to make heat on his head with a hot stone.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	 Then make him sit between your hands in square form, so that he now places his hands upon his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	 Then place the palm of your hand on top of his nose root between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	 Wherever therefore your middle finger comes to be, mark that place with an unburned (area).
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	 Then heat the cautery iron with oil: this is its shape.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	 Then put it on the marked place without burning, while gradually pressing your hand down and you turn it (the cautery).
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	 Then lift your hand quickly, and look at the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	 If you see that a piece of bone of the skull or vegetable matter has been uncovered, then lift your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	 And if not, keep putting your hand with the iron or with another until it becomes cold; until you see the bones that I have told you about.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then take something from salt, and dissolve it in water, and immerse the cotton in it, and place it on the spot; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	 Then place on top of him a woolen cloth soaked in butter, and let it remain on the spot until the burn is destroyed by fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	 Then treat that with four-ingredient ointment until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	 It has been said that the longer an open wound remains, the more it discharges pus; therefore, it is better and more helpful.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	 And some of them said that the skin should be cauterized up to the bone; and hold the cautery until something of the bone's thickness is burned.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	 Then grind down the bone after it has been burned, then treat it.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	 Others say that when the cautery is applied to the end, it should make an impression on the bone for as long as the bone falls out, so that it becomes like a pierced hole: or an instrument that women put in place with a small amount of alphabet solution: and they think that vapors from the head are exhaled through this place; and the open wound is left for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	 Then it is treated until it hardens.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	 But these two types of cautery do not seem to me at all effective except in some people according to the way of fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	 And let it be released from there, it is better for his health with me.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	 For the head is weakened by the continuous solution of its own; as we have testified in other members; and especially when the head is naturally weak and frail; and the first type of cautery is safer and better for me, and I use it: so work with it for safety.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the head in pain throughout the entire head.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	 When a chronic pain occurs throughout the head and it persists in an unwell person, and they use honey, vinegar, cupping glasses, oil, and plasters.
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	 And particularly if the head has already been burnt with a cautery once as we have mentioned, and none of those things help him, then consider it.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	 If the head of an unwell person is strong by nature and not weak, and it finds a very intense cold, then burn it with another cautery slightly.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	 Then burn the entire horn of his own head with a cautery, so that the skin is not penetrated and the amount of bone exposed, as we have mentioned.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	 Burn the entire head with one cautery at the occiput of his own head, at a place called the "was", and it is a place where the bladder is placed; and squeeze your mother's milk into this, and do not expose the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	 For the sick person finds a very intense pain there due to that, and different from the pain of all the other cauterizations of the head.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	 And I say that this cautery should be in its place, and it must be a cautery with which the horns of the head are burnt, and the occiput more subtly with the cautery with which the middle of the head is burned.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization for hemiplegia, both with hot medicine and with iron.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter 4.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	 When pain occurs in part of the head and it swells or spreads to the eye, and the head is treated with cleansing medicines and the rest of the treatment, as I have said in the divisions of diseases, and it does not improve altogether, then cauterization in this case is according to two methods: either cauterization with a burning medicine or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	 The cautery with burning medicine is, that you receive one tooth of garlic, peel it and cut off its ends from both sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	 Then cut the painful location at the time with a broad leech, until there is a place under the skin where the tooth can be captured.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Insert it into the same under the skin until it is hidden; then bind it over it with a decent bandage and leave it for fifteen hours, then dissolve it, and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days; afterwards place a hot iron submerged in butter on it until a pus is formed; then care for it with an ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	 And if you wish to do that with certain burning medicines which I wrote about in the twelfth treatise on poisons.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	 However, cauterizing it with iron is as follows.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	 The form of the burning iron is as follows.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	 It is called a Clavilus, because the shape of its head resembles that of a nail, in which there is some sharpness, and in the middle of it there is a small protuberance.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	 Then place it on the location and hold your hand; and you rotate the iron slowly with speed; and let the quantity that is burned be of the thickness of the skin, just like half of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And lift your hand so that an artery, which is below, is not burned and there is a blood flow.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	 Then immerse the iron in brine water, and place it on the location, and leave it for three days; then immerse the iron in butter; afterwards care for it with an ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	 And if you wish, cauterize this hemicania (hemiplegia) with the second part of the Cautery cutlery.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	 caution against cutting an artery during this hemicrania (not the ancient one specifically)
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	 On the method of cauterization in the ancient hemicrania.
Caput V.	 Chapter 5.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	 When treating hemicrania as previously mentioned in treatment and as stated in the division of ailments, and treatment is not effective; and you observe from the disease that what was said about cauterization with the first cautery or cauterization with fire does not suffice for him, then it is necessary to use an iron cautery, until it becomes white after marking the place of pain with a line, whose length is half the digit, or approximately so; and place your hand instead, and press it tightly until you cut the artery, and reach the bone.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	 But it is necessary that you be careful to avoid the continuous jaw movement during chewing, so as not to burn the side or the nerve that moves it, in order to prevent a spasm.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	 And let there be caution and care regarding the flow of blood from the cut artery.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	 Indeed, fear arises in its incision, especially for those who do not know what is being done and are not attentive or experienced; and above all, they abandon the procedure first.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	 And I shall come with a reminder about the management of bleeding from the cut artery according to its own method and in its proper place within this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 If you observe from the disease that this iron cautery does not suffice for him, and if you see a weak body tolerating the cautery in the middle of the head as we have said, then treat the wound until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	 And if you wish, administer the cautery as we have said in the chapter on artery extraction with a cautery having two blades.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	 Cauterization is indeed better this way and more suitable.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	 On the method of cauterizing in ear pain.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	 When there is pain in the ear due to coldness, and it is treated with solutions, and the rest of the treatment as we said in division, and the pain does not subside, then cauterization with fire: this is what is called Punctum, whose form is as follows.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	 Then, after burning the punctum around the entire ear as it is rolled, or around both sides if pain is present on both sides.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	 And extend the cautery from the root of the ear slightly after marking the spots with wax; let the amount of cauterization be ten punctae for the entire ear, and approximately so.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	 Then, care for the areas until they heal.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in Torture.
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	 Treatment with cauterization for tortures only pertains to those types that arise from phlegm, as we discussed in the division of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	 And avoid cauterization for the type that arises from exhaustion and muscle spasm.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	 If the treatment of this type of torture with herbs, purges and gargles does not help, then it is necessary to cauterize the sick person with three cauteries: one at the base of the ear, and the second a little below its time, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	 Place your cautery on the weaker side (of the body).
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	 Since softening does not occur unless in the healthy part.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	 And the shape of cauterization is to cauterize oneself with the cautery along the extreme tip of the upper edge of the ear lobe, slightly below the skull's horn; and in another place at the time, whose length should be similar to that of a thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	 And place your hand with the cautery until the quantity of half the thickness of the skin is burnt.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	 And this is the form of the cautery and it belongs to the species of a knife, whose shape was given earlier; but it should not be too fine, as you can see; and it is necessary that the knife has a little excess coarseness in it.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	 Then treat the locations with what was previously mentioned until healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization for apoplexy (ancient).
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	 If the apoplexy is ancient and the treatment with what was said does not help, and the sick person does not have a fever, then cauterize him with four cauteries on all of his skull's horn, and with a cautery in the middle of his head, as was said, and with a cautery at the back of his head according to what was previously mentioned; and the method of cauterization should be as previously described.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	 Also cauterized on the face of the stomach with a Cautery; and it is more extreme.

Then shave the head of the sick person entirely, and place upon his occiput an ointment from synapse as described in the treatise on ointments; and apply it frequently.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	 For this is the method of cautery; and do this in accordance with the same order as I stated there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	 If therefore he is cured by it, that is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	 If not: then make three cauteries in the back part of his head, which extend from the upper part of the head down to the lower part of the eye; and place between each cautery a thickness equal to a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	 Then care for the cautery, with what preceded.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	 If you wish an additional measure, and the sick person can endure it; then make a cautery in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	 If you wish an additional measure: then cauterize him on both horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	 Then care for him until he is cured; let the cautery be anointed in the manner as stated before.

Then scrape the head of the sick person: afterwards cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over the entire horn of the head, and with a cautery over the back of it, and three over the spine of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	 If, however, you need softening of the body with more of these [substances], and the person is weak and the illness is strong: then cauterize it with four cauteries over the spine of the back, and the last one with a cautery, until it burns through most of its skin, and loosen your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	 Then take care of him until he is well: and in this way cauterize with oil.

Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you clean the brain of him first with hyssop, and also with the remedy that we have said in the division when the sick person is severe or tolerant to medication.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	 If it is a child who does not tolerate medications, then administer gargarisma, and cleaning mouthwash for the brain, before that many days with good food purification.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	 And if the cause of melancholy is an excess of declivities leading to melancholy and the body of the sick person is damp, then give him a drink that cleans his brain as previously mentioned in the division; then shave the head of the sick person, and make a properly centred bandage of linen like a circle.

If you wish, cauterize it above both eyebrows with two cauteries in all places; let them extend from the temples and have a length equal to that of the eyebrows; do not place your hand with the cautery at the very edge but rather according to the amount that is being cauterized, the third eyelash.

Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	 The cautery is in it according to two modes: either a cautery with fire; or a cautery with a burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	 In the cautery with fire, order the patient to shave before it, if he is among those who shave, until they are extended and matched.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	 If they prick him at its root: then bind his eyes with a plaster, so that they do not move until it grows out.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	 When they grow out and are matched, then place the head of the patient in your lap: afterwards mark on the eyelids of his eyes with wax, marking that it is in the shape of a myrtle leaf; and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	 Then place a wetted dish on sheep's wool or on flaxseed mucilage over the eye.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then heat the cautery, whose shape is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	 Then burn the cautery gradually on multiple places until the surface of the skin, which is like a myrtle leaf shape, appears entirely.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	 And the mark of your health is that if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracting and the hairs growing up at the prick of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Lift up your hand then: and let it go for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	 Then place a dish with butter on it until the eschar is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Afterward care for him with an ointment until he is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If any hair returns after an hour and the eyelid softens: then repeat the cautery on that place as you did at first.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	 If there are hairs below it: then burn it until the hair grows out to its natural place and matches so that the hairs do not prick the eye.

Then take some known soap and undyed chalk from one or the other pound weight, about that much; then grind them together well with good grinding, and make it quickly, so as not to cool it.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	 Then from this compound spread it on the cloth that you have made in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and place it upon the eyelid of one eye or both.
Et pone sub oculo cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: et caput infirmi sit in sinu tuo.	 And place under the eye a cup filled with yolk of egg, and let the head of the sick person be in your lap.
Et pone digitum tuum indicem super medicinam, et preme ipsum parumper.	 And place your index finger upon the medicine and press it slightly.
Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	 And you move it as often as the sick person feels a bite of the medicine; because its bite is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	 While it thus continues to bite as the sick person feels, then release the medicine and move it with your finger.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	 When the bite ceases, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	 Then observe if the eyelid rises as it rises under contraction with fire or incision, this is good; and if not, then repeat over the same place from the medicine where the medicine does not press, and does not darken, until your operation is equal and the eye contracts.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	 Then place it upon the cup with butter, until the skin of the burn is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with an ointment like diaphine or another one, until he is cured.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	 And it is necessary for you at the operation that you keep the last guard, lest something from the medicine falls into the eye.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If the eyelid becomes softened after days and something fights from hairs within the eye, then repeat the medicine on that place which has become softened from the eyelid, as you did first.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it until it is healed.
Et haec est forma folii myrti.	 And this is the form of myrtle leaf.
Et scias, quod oculi hominum diuersificantur in magnitudine, et paruitate.	 And know that human eyes vary in size and shape.
Ergo secundum illud sit consideratio tua: et non occultatur uia rectitudinis illi, cui est studium de hac arte.	 Therefore according to this your consideration should be: and the path of rightness for him who is devoted to this art should not be hidden.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Fistula lachrymali.	 [Chapter Title] On the method of cauterization in lacrimal fistula.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Quando curas Fistulam, cum eo quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc, oportet ut cauterizes ipsam secundum hunc modum.	 When you treat the fistula, if your treatment does not improve as we have said in the divisions of diseases, then it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this method.
Praecipe infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo, et teneat caput eius minister inter manus suas taliter, ut non moueatur, neque agitetur cum capite suo.	 Command the sick man to place his head in your lap, and have one of his attendants hold his head thus, so that it is not moved or shaken with his head.
Deinde pone Cotum infusum in albugine oui, aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum eius: deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	 Then place the cotton soaked in alcohol or psyllium mucilage over his eye: then take the hot iron cautery, whose form is this.
Sit concauum, sicut forma cannae pennae uulturis ab extremitate una, cum qua fit Cauterium: et si uis sit penetrans usque ad extremitatem aliam, et si uis sit sursum sic tenta.	 It should be concave, like the shape of a goose feather quill from one end, with which the cautery is made: and if you wish it to penetrate to the other end, and if you wish it to be extended upwards in this way.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	 However, this concave form is better for your work.
Deinde exprime fistulam, si est aperta, et extrahe ex ea saniem, et exicca ipsam: et si non est aperta, tunc aperi eam, et extrahe pus eius.	 Then squeeze the fistula if it is open and extract the pus from it, and excise it: and if it is not open, then open it and extract its pus.
Deinde pone tunc super eam Cauterium, quod fit ignitum ualde.	 Then place the hot cautery on it.
Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	 And hold your hand near the cautery for a short time close to the eye, near the nose, so that your hand does not wander or the sick person is disturbed: and place the cautery on the fat of the eye and break it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	 If therefore you reach at the beginning of your cautery until the bone, it will be well.
Et si non: tunc itera Cauterium semel, aut bis, si indiges illo: et dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 And if not: then repeat the cautery once, or twice if necessary; and leave it for three days.
Deinde pone Cotum cum butyro, et cura ipsum cum unguento exiccatiuo, donec sanetur.	 Then place a piece of wool with butter, and care for it with an ointment made from dry resins, until it heals.
Quod si praeterierint ei quadraginta dies, et non sanatur: tunc pone super ipsum medicinam acutam corrosiuam, donec detegatur os: et rade ipsum secundum quod uenit in capitulo suo.	 If it exceeds forty days and does not heal: then apply a sharp corrosive medicine on it until the bone is exposed; and shave it according to what comes in its chapter.
Et est modus alius Cauterii fistulae, quem quidam primi dixerunt.	 And there is another method of cautery for a fistula, which some of the first ones said.
Intende ad locum fistulae, et finde ipsum: deinde pone in ipsam fissuram camahan subtile, id est, Cannulam subtilem, cuius forma haec est.	 Direct yourself to the place of the fistula, and cut it; then put a fine camel's-hair probe into the fissure, that is, a fine probe, whose shape this is.
Et funde in ipsum quantitatem drachmae ex plumbo liquefacto, et tene manum tuam cum Canna retentione bona, et non moueatur infirmus omnino, ut non currat, uel perueniat plumbum liquefactum ad oculum eius.	 Pour into it a quantity of lead melted as a drachma, and hold your hand with good retention on the probe, and let it not move at all, so that the melted lead does not run or reach the eye.
Et oportet ut ponas super oculum infirmi cotum infusum in albumine oui, aut in aqua.	 It is necessary that you place a warm woolen cloth over the weak eye or in water.
Plumbum enim comburit locum fistulae, et sanat ipsam sanatione mirabili.	 For lead burns the place of the fistula and heals it with marvelous healing.
Quod si sanatur fistula, cum eo quod diximus ex Cauterio, et curatione, est bonum.	 If the fistula heals as we said by cautery and treatment, it is good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est administrare foramen nasi, et reducere fistulam ad cursum nasi, secundum quod ueniet in loco suo sibi proprio.	 And if not, then it is necessary to open the nose passage and redirect the fistula to the nasal passages, according to what comes in its proper place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fissuris Labiorum.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in lips' cracks.
Caput XX.	 Chapter XX.
Multotiens accidunt in Labio fissurae, quae nominantur Pili, et praecipue in labiis puerorum.	 Multiple splits occur in the Lip, which are called Pilae, and particularly in the lips of boys.
Cum ergo tu curas has fissuras, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio, tunc igni cauterium paruum cultellare, secundum hanc formam.	 When you take care of these splits, as I said earlier for the division of diseases, and the treatment does not help, then use a small cautery, shaped like this.
Et sit concauitas eius secundum subtilitatem cultelli.	 And let its hollow be shaped according to the subtlety of a knife.
Deinde pone ipsum ignitum festinanter in ipsis fissuris, donec perueniat cauterium ad profundum fissurarum.	 Then place it (the cautery) quickly into those splits until the cautery reaches the depth of the splits.
Deinde cura ipsum cum caeroto, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with pitch until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fistula Oris.	 Method of Cauterizing a Mouth Split.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit apostema in radice gingiuae, aut in palato, aut in radicibus dentium: deinde facit pus, et rumpitur: postea antiquatur, et currit pus, et fit fistula: deinde curas ipsam, et non confert in ea curatio, tunc oportet ut ignias cauterium secundum quantitatem, quod capiat in fistula.	 When an abscess occurs at the root of the gum, or in the palate, or at the roots of teeth: then pus forms and bursts; later it becomes old and the pus runs and it becomes a split; then care for it and treatment does not help in this case, then one must use fire cauterization according to the size that can fit into the split.
Deinde intromitte ipsum ignitum in foramine fistulae, et tene manum tuam, donec perueniat ferrum ignitum ad profundum eius, et ultimum eius: fac illud semel, aut duabus uicibus.	 Then insert the fire into the hole of the split and hold your hand until the iron becomes hot to its depth and end; do this once or twice.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud, cum eo quod diximus de curatione usquequo curetur.	 Then care for it after that, as I said earlier about treatment, until it is cured.
Si ergo abscinditur sanies, et sanatur, erit bonum.	 If the pus separates and heals, it will be good.
Et si non, tunc necesse est detegere locum, et auferre os corrupum secundum quod ueniet in capite suo.	 And if it does not, then it is necessary to expose the place, and remove the corrupt bone according to what comes in its head.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Gingiuis, et Dentibus mollificatis.	 Method of Cauterizing in Softened Gums and Teeth.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter XXII.
Quando mollificatur gingiua propter humiditates, et mouentur dentes, et curas eam cum medicinis, et non confert: tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 When the gum becomes soft due to moisture and the teeth move, and care for it with medicine but it does not help; then put the head of the sick person on your chest.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma ueniet post haec, ita ut ponas Cannulam super dentem: et intromitte in ea Cauterium ignitum festinanter: et tene manum tuam parumper, donec sentiat infirmus calorem ignis iam peruenisse ad radicem dentis.	 Then place the cautery, whose shape will come later, on the tooth; and introduce in it the heated cauterium hastily; and hold your hand for a while, until the weak feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
Et eleua manum tuam: deinde itera Cauterium aliquotiens, secundum quod uis.	 And move your hand (away); then repeat the cautery several times, as you wish.
Deinde impleat infirmus os suum aqua salis, et teneat ipsam hora una: et exspuat ipsam.	 Then let the weak fill his mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour; and spit it out.
Dens enim motus firmatur, et gingiua mollificata stringitur, et siccatur humiditas corrupta.	 For the tooth moved strengthens (itself), and the gums, softened, are tightened, and moisture is dried out.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Dentium.	 [Title: Method of Cauterizing Tooth Pain]
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Quando dolor dentis est propter frigiditatem, aut in ipso est frigus, aut uermis, et non confert curatio cum medicinis: tunc Cauterium in ipso est secundum duos modos: aut Cauterium cum butyro: aut cauterium cum igne.	 When the tooth pain is due to coldness, or there is coldness in itself, or worms, and the treatment with medicines does not help; then the cautery should be used on it according to two methods: either with butter [and charcoal] or with fire.
Cauterium autem eius cum butyro est, ut accipias butyrum uaccinum, et bullias ipsum in cochleari ferreo, aut in uenera.	 The cautery with butter is such that you receive freshly churned butter, and boil it in an iron cauldron or a copper one.
Deinde accipe cotum, et inuolue ipsum super extremitatem tentae.	 Then take a linen cloth and fold it over the tip of the wound.
Deinde submerge ipsum in butyro bullito: et pone ipsum super dentem dolorosum festinanter, et tene ipsum donec infrigidet: deinde itera ipsum aliquotiens, donec perueniat uirtus ignis ad radicem dentis.	 Then immerse it in melted butter and place it quickly on the painful tooth and hold it until it becomes cold; then repeat this several times until the heat of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
Et si uis, submerge lanam, aut cotum in butyro frigido, et pone ipsum super dentem dolentem: et pone super ipsum ferrum ignitum, donec perueniat ignis ad profundum concauitatis dentis.	 And if you wish, immerse wool or cloth in cold butter and place it on the painful tooth; then put iron heated red-hot over it until the heat of the fire reaches to the hollow of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	 However, cauterization with fire is to be done using a pipe made of brass or iron.
Et sit in corpore eius quiddam grossitudinis, ut non perueniat acuitas ignis ad os infirmi.	 And let there be some swelling in the body so that the sharpness of the fire does not reach the weak bone.
Deinde igni Cauterium, cuius forma ueniet: et pone ipsum super illum dentem: et tene manum tuam, donec infrigidetur Cauterium.	 Then take a hot firebrand of the shape that will come; and place it on that tooth and hold your hand until the firebrand becomes cold.
Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	 Repeat this often for the pain to be removed, either on the same day or another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.	 And when applying the impression of the cautery, the weak bone should be filled with good butter and held for an hour; then spit it out.
Et haec est forma Cauterii.	 And this is the shape of the firebrand.
Cauteriza cum quacumque extremitate uis secundum quod est possibile: et haec est forma Cannulae.	 Use any end of the cautery as possible; and this is the form of the pipe.

Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Quando Strophulae sunt a phlegmate, et ab humiditatibus frigidis, et non sunt obedientes digestioni per mecicinas, et uis digestionem earum uelociter: tunc igni Cauterium concauum, cuius forma est haec.	 When Worms are with phlegm, and from cold moistures, and not obedient to digestion by medicines, and desire digestion quickly: then, to the concave Cautery, whose shape is this.
Habens duas extremitates apertas, ut egrediatur fumus apud Cauterium ab extremitate altera: et pone ipsum ignitum super ipsum apostema semel, et secundo, si indiges illo, donec perueniat ad profundum apostematis.	 Having two open ends so that the smoke leaves the cautery from one end: and place it heated upon the ulcer once, and again, if needed, until it reaches the depth of the ulcer.
Quod si apostema est paruum: tunc pone Cauterium secundum quantitatem apostematis.	 If the ulcer is small: then place the cautery according to the size of the ulcer.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super ipsum cotum infusum in butyro, donec remoueatur quod combussit ignis.	 Then leave it for three days, and place upon it a cup filled with butter, until what the fire burned is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dentis, donec sanetur forma cannulae.	 Then care for it with tooth ointment, until the form of the cannula heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in raucedine uocis, et constrictione anhelitus.	 [Paragraph about the method of cauterization in throat swelling and constriction of breathing.]
Caput XXV.	 Chapter 25.
Quando uincunt humiditates super cannale pulmonis, et praecipue quando illud est cum frigiditate complexionis, tunc oportet ut euacuetur infirmus in primis cum medicinis solutiuis.	 When moistures press upon the windpipe, and especially when it is with coldness of complexion: then a sick person must be evacuated first with loose medicines.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum in nocrati apud radicem gutturis in loce depresso: et caue, ne peruenias cum Cauterio ad guttur, neque in cute, nisi quiddam eius.	 Then cauterize it at the root of the throat in a hollow place depressed: and beware not to come with the cautery to the throat, nor on the skin, unless something of its substance.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum cauterio alio apud iuncturam colli in ultimo spondili eius ultimando: et sit Cauterium clauile secundum modum, qui praecessit.	 Then cauterize it with another cautery at the joint of the neck at the end of the last rib of that side: and let the cautery be a nail in accordance with the method which was previously mentioned.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with what has been previously mentioned, until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in aegritudinibus Pulmonis, et Tussi.	 [Paragraph about the method of cauterization in diseases of the lungs and cough.]
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26.
Quando Tussis et aegritudo Pulmonis sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, et infirmus non habet febrem, neque phthisim, et aegritudo antiqua: tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis supra furculam in locis depressis, lenibus, uacuis.	 When cough and disease of the lungs are from cold moistures, and a sick person does not have a fever, nor consumption, and the disease is old: then cauterize it with two cauteries above the clavicle at hollow, easy, vacant places.
Et cauterio alio in medio pectoris inter duas mammillas: et sit cauterium cannulae secundum formam quae praecessit.	 And with another cautery in the middle of the chest between two breasts: and let the cautery be in the shape of a tube as described before.
Et si uis sit cauterizatio tua punctando cum cauterio, quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma praecessit in punctatione doloris aurium: et sint puncta ex triginta punctis usque quasi ad alia.	 And if your cauterization is by pricking with a cautery named Punctum, whose shape was described before in the piercing of ear pain; let these punctures be thirty or more.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it as was described before, until it heals.
Et iam sit cauterium habens tres ramos: secundum hanc formam.	 And let the cautery have three branches; according to this shape.
Quare alleuiatur cum eo cauterizatio, quando tu facis cum eo uice una tria Cauteria.	 Therefore, when you use a cautery in its place instead of three cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Titillico, in dislocatione Humeri.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization in Titillico, in the dislocation of the arm.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter XXVII.
Quando dislocatur caput adiutorii caussa humiditatum, et nonfigitur in hora reditus sui a dislocatione sua, donec sit illud ei consuetudo reditionis, deinde dislocatur a paruo motu, qui accidit sicut nos iam testificauimus illud, tunc oportet ut reducas dislocationem in primis.	 When the head of the arm is dislocated due to assistance and it does not recover within an hour after its displacement, until this becomes a habit for it, then it should be dislocated slightly, as described previously, then you must reduce the dislocation first.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, aut super latus sanum.	 Then the sick person lies on his back on his own back or on the healthy side.
Deinde eleua cutim, quae est in interiori Titillici ad superiora cum digitis manus tuae sinistrae: et si iunctura dislocatur ad interiora.	 Then scrape the skin that is inside Titillico towards the upper part with your left hand fingers; and if it is dislocated towards the internal parts.
Deinde igni Cauterium habens duo uerua.	 Then take a cautery with two holes.
Cuius forma est haec.	 Its shape is as follows.
Deinde cauteriza cutim, donec penetret eam usque ad latus aliud, et ueniet figura cauterizationis cum quatuor cauteriis.	 Then cauterize the skin until it penetrates to the other side, and the shape of the cauterization will be as described with four cauteries.
Et quandoque fit cauterizatio cum cauterio habente tria uerua, quare fit figura cauterizationis tunc sex cauteriorum: et sunt uerua secundum subtilitatem tentae.	 And sometimes the cauterization is done with a cautery having three holes, therefore the shape of the cauterization becomes that of six cauteries; and there are holes according to the fineness of the attempt.
Et haec est forma cauterii habentis tria uerua.	 And this is the shape of the cautery with three holes.
Et quandoque additur super hunc modum unum, quare sunt cauteria octo.	 And sometimes one more is added to this method, therefore there are eight cauteries.
Deinde pone super cauterium porros contritos cum sale.	 Then place a hot iron (cautery) over squeezed leeks with salt.
Deinde fac adhaerere infirmum tranquillitati, ut non moueatur membrum tempore aliquo, donec confortetur.	 Then make the sick person quiet and still so that a limb is not moved at any time until it is healed.
Et si dislocatio est ad superiora, et raro fit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super humerum cauterio clauili, aut cauteriis multis punctando.	 If the dislocation is towards the upper part (shoulder), which rarely happens, then cauterize it with a hook-shaped iron or several needles puncturing.
Nam iunctura firmatur, et remouetur humiditas: et sanatur infirmus.	 For joining strengthens and removes moisture, and the sick person is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Stomachum.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing the stomach.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28.
Quando accidunt in Stomacho frigus et humiditates multae, donec extrahant ipsum a complexione sua, et multiplicentur catarri ad ipsum, et assiduas modos curationis, et non confert: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat crura sua, et manus suas.	 When cold and much moisture appear in the stomach until it is removed from its composition, and catarrhs multiply towards it, and persistent methods of treatment do not help; then the sick person should lie on his back, extend his legs, and stretch out his arms.
Deinde cauteriza cum tribus cauteriis, cauterio sub cochleari pectoris quantitate digiti unius cum cauterio clauili, et duobus cauteriis inferius a duobus lateribus cauterii unius, donec ueniat figura cauteriorum triangulata.	 Then cauterize with three irons: one hook-shaped iron of the size of a finger under the concavity of the chest and another hook-shaped iron, and two smaller irons below the sides of the single iron, until the figure of the cautery is triangular.
Et elonga inter utraque ut non coniungantur, quando facient pus.	 And stretch it apart so that they do not join together when pus appears.
Et sit profunditas cauterii quantitas duarum tertiarum grossitudinis cutis.	 The depth of the cautery should be equal to two thirds the thickness of the skin.
Et sit figura cauteriorum secundum hanc formam sine additione: et si uis cauteriza cauterio magno in medio stomachi secundum hanc formam: et sit cauterium quo fit hoc cauterium unum secundum figuram circuli secundum hanc formam.	 The figure of the cautery should be in this shape without any additions; and if you wish to cauterize with a large iron in the center of the stomach in this shape, then let the iron that forms this cautery be one circular in shape according to this form.
Et cauterizatur stomachus punctando ei qui terretur ab hoc cauterio: et est, ut signes super stomachum punctum secundum quantitatem, quam uis cum encaustro: deinde cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio puncti: deinde cura ipsum cum curatione, quae praecessit donec sanetur.	 The stomach is cauterized by pressing it with the cautery and making marks on it according to the desired size with encaustic; then cauterize it with the iron of that point; then care for it with the treatment that preceded until it is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Epar frigidum.	 On the method of cauterizing an earlobe with cold cautery.
Caput XXIX.	 In quo modus cauteri fumigandi corporis
Quando accidit in Epate dolor ex frigiditate et humiditate, aut ex uentositate grossa, donec egrediatur a complexione sua naturali egressione superflua, et curatur infirmus, cum eo quod diximus, et non proficit in illo: tunc oportet ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam, et signes cum encaustro tria cauteria secundum hanc figuram, et hanc quantitatem eandem super Epar inferius ab hypocundriis, ubi peruenit cubitus hominis: et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium secundum grossitudinem digiti: et sit cauterium secundum longitudinem corporis rectum: et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio multum.	 When there is pain in the shoulder from cold and dampness, or from a thick wind that has not been expelled by its natural discharge, and the sick person cannot recover with what was said earlier: then the sick person should lie on his neck and mark three places on his earlobe with hot cautery according to this shape, and the same amount below the hips, where a man's elbow reaches: and let the space between each cautery be as wide as a finger's width: and let the cautery be as long as the body straight: and do not press your hand tightly with the cautery.
Et sit quantitas eius quod aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, quantitas medietatis eius non additum: et sit infirmus stans super pedes suos.	 And let the amount that is burned be according to the thickness of the skin, half its width not added: and let the sick person stand on his feet.
Si autem non est stans, tunc sit iacens, qui iam extendit crura sua, et eleuauit brachia sua.	 If he is not standing, then he should be lying down, who has already stretched out his legs and raised his arms.
Haec est forma cauterii.	 This is the shape of the cautery.
Et tibi quidem possibile est, ut cauterizes ista cauteria cum cauterio cultellari, quando tecum est subtilitas et prudentia in arte.	 And it is possible for you to use these cauteries with a small cautery when skill and wisdom are with you in the art.
Et custodi te, ut non ultime procedas in cauterizatione, et aduratur spissitudo cutis totius, quare aduratur corpus totum, et perueniat ad intestina: quoniam cutis illic est subtilis, scias ergo illud.	 Be careful that you do not burn the entire thickness of the skin in cauterization, for the body is burned in its entirety, and it reaches the intestines: because the skin there is thin, know this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi apostemata Epatis.	 On the method of cauterizing abscesses in the shoulder.
Caput XXX.	 In quo modus cauteri fumigandi
Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	 When it comes out and you want to know if the abscess is in the shoulder muscle or its sheath: then if it is in the shoulder muscle, pain and heaviness without sharpness appear: and if it is in the shoulder sheath, with pain there is strong sharpness: and you see that the treatment of this has exhausted the doctors.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	 The sick person should lie with his head on his chest.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 Then the place of the boil must be shaped like a caustic (with) encaustic: then heat the cautery that resembles a rod.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	 And cauterize (it) with one cautery until the whole skin is burned and reaches the subcutaneous tissue, until all pus comes out: then care for it by treating it with ointments until it heals.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	 And one should not use this cauterizing method unless his devotion to the art of medicine has been prolonged; and whose hands these diseases often accompany along with experience: then he may dare to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	 But it is better for me to let it be (as it is).
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization for pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	 The ancients said, cautery with roots of Aristolochia for a cold pleurisy, according to this method.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	 And it is, to receive from the dried roots of Aristolochia, one longer root, which can be found among them, and let it be as thick as a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	 Then immerse it in oil, and set it alight in fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	 Then cauterize with one hot iron on that which is between the union of the collar-bone and the neck, and with two small irons near the area under the chin.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	 And with two more irons on that which is between the fifth and sixth ribs, slightly towards the back, and with another iron in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	 And with three more irons from behind: one on that which is between the two scapulae; and with two more irons from the sides of the chest, with the lower iron being between the two scapulae.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	 And it is not necessary that you press your hand with the iron, rather let it be clearly smell of skin.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	 And certain ancients have said that there are men who use a cautery made of iron similar to a ray, and they burn it and insert it into that which is between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess, and pus comes out: as we said in the case of an abscess in the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	 But in this perforation with the iron there is a fear, that either the sick person dies immediately, or a fistula occurs in the place, which has no healing.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	 Chapter 32: On the method of cauterizing the spleen.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	 When you treat the sickness of the spleen, as we said in the treatment of diseases, and your remedy does not work, then there is a need for cautery in it according to three methods, which are all correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	 One of them is to make three or four cauteries, extending along the length of the spleen according to the shape of the cauteries of the liver, whose previous figure it follows.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	 And let each cautery be of the thickness of a finger or more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	 Let the mode of cauterizing, as I have said in the cauterization of the liver, be equally distributed.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	 And do not press your hand with the cautery; let it be weak and lying on its back on its own back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	 Another method of cauterizing is: holding the cautery with two prongs, as we have said in the chapter on dislocation of the shoulder; and scrape off the skin which is directly on the spleen where the arm of the weak person reaches; and let your scrapping be according to the width of the body so that the cauteries fall along the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	 Then insert two prongs very hot until they penetrate the skin on the other side; then withdraw the cautery; thus there will be four cauteries.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	 And if you want to cauterize with a cautery having three prongs.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	 Then take care of the cautery after you release it to emit pus for many days; for this is more beneficial than the rest which have come before in treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in hydropsy (edema).
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	 A cautery does not fall in hydropsy unless it is specifically the head.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	 When you are treating hydropsy with the methods of treatment that we have mentioned in the division, and the treatment does not benefit, then it is necessary to cauterize the person with four cauteries around the navel, and one over the stomach, and another over the liver, and another over the spleen, and two behind the back between the vertebrae, and one on the front of the chest, and another on the front of the stomach; and let the depth of the cautery be close to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	 Then let the open cautery emit pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	 Do not evacuate the sick after cauterization with it: this must be done so that two intentions are applied to him, and healing will hasten towards it with God's help.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	 The form of the cautery used to cauterize the abdomen should be clavilis, as has been described before; and the one used for cauterizing the back should be olive-shaped, as has been described before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing feet and legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	 When amputated in hydropicus and filled with citrine water: it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot at the navicular bone, which is between the auricular and annular; then lift your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it; then lift your hand again, and do not touch it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	 The citrine water will evaporate, and let the cautery be in this shape.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	 Then make two cauteries on each leg, and let the cautery be of the form of a short knife at its end; let the cautery on the thigh be long, one below the knee, and the other lower than that, about halfway down the leg; and over the whole hip make two cauterizations; let the cautery remain open without treatment for a long time to allow some water to evaporate, then cure it as we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing in the resolution of the abdomen.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter 35.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	 When the abdominal solution is due to cold and moisture, until it weakens the powers of retention and digestion in the stomach and intestines; when this is cured according to the methods of treatment but does not heal; if you see a sick person tolerating an excessive cautery, then cauterize the abdomen with a large cautery on the stomach, as has been described before for cauterizing the stomach with a circular cautery and four subtle cauteries around the umbilicus with a fine clavile cautery; and with a large cautery or two cauteries over the alcatin above the hips.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	If you see excessive moisture and a weak patient enduring it, then cauterize him with the cautery on the forehead and on all of his buttocks; and perhaps add two small cauteries near the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	 The treatment is progressing successfully, whose benefit does not stray.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing Hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	 When there are many old hemorrhoids in the anus, either one and they are composed of thick, cold or corrupted fluids, and have been treated as described in the division, but the cure does not improve: then cauterize with three cauteries on the lower part of the buttocks slightly below the almoidate triangularly, and with a cautery under the navel about two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if you consider that his stomach is chilled and his food is not digested, and you see his face pallor, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery as described earlier; and cauterize on his liver and another on his spleen along with a cautery in the loins: and leave the open cautery for some time; then care for him until he is cured.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	 Chapter on the method of cauterizing Althelul after their removal.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	 When you remove althelul, then heat the cautery similar to a rod.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	 Then introduce the heated cautery into the removed althelul; and hold your hand last until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood flows: do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	 If there are many althelul, then cauterize each one with a cautery as described earlier.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them with the aid of the ointment that is suitable for them until they are cured.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if you cauterize it with a large cautery upon oil, it is more final in its benefit.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	 On the method of cauterizing an anal fistula.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter XXXVIII.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	 When the weak [patient] does not obey cutting and surgery as we have described earlier, and fears it, perhaps he can heal with cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	 When a fistula occurs and becomes old, pus flows from it, and corrupt humors.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	 Therefore, as is fitting, one should examine it with a thin probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	 Then determine the depth of its size with a probe.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	 Then heat the cautery, which resembles a rod.\] Si autem humectatum sit, calefac, donec sint in eo
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	 If it is wet, heat the cautery, until [the cautery] is hot.\] Then insert yourself, heated, into the fistula and measure the depth up to which the claw has entered.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 And repeat the cautery on it until all the corrupted bodies are burned, once, twice, or three times, according to your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	 And beware of burning the nerve or major vein if it is present; or if the fistula goes to the bladder or the intestine, then beware of these places altogether.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	 Do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place; and remember that it does not penetrate.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	 Then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	 If the place is sealed and the matter is cut away from it and remains for a long time, then you will know that it has healed completely.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 If the matter is not cut away from it, then you will know that it is penetrating, or that there is rotten bone deep within it, or like that of those [other cases] whose memory will come back to its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	 On the method of cauterizing the kidney.
Caput XXXIX.	 In what cases and on account of what things should a clyster
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 In what cases and for what reasons should a clyster be applied? When there is pain in the kidneys due to cold or because of thick effusion, and it decreases due to illness of the body, then you must cauterize it on a coal-bed over the kidneys, with a cautery over the entire kidney along with the cautery hook, whose preceding explanation has been mentioned earlier.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	 And perhaps we should cauterize it again at the second time on the same coal-bed.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	 Why do three lines appear?
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	 Therefore, they will be more beneficial in the end.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	 On the method of cauterizing the bladder.
Caput XL.	 In what cases and for what reasons should a clyster be applied
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	 In what cases and for what reasons should a clyster be applied in the bladder? When there is weakness or softening of the bladder due to cold and moistness, and it does not retain urine, then you must cauterize it on the lower part of the back near the bladder, where the hair of the beard begins, and with a cautery from the right side of the back, and another from the left; and let the length of the cauterization be according to the size of the knuckle of the little finger; and you must cauterize it with a cautery on the lower part of the back or with two cauteries if necessary, as was previously explained with the cautery hook.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	 On the method of cauterizing the uterus.
Caput XLI.	 In what cases and for what reasons should a clyster be applied
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	 In what cases and for what reasons should a clyster be applied to the uterus? When there is coldness and moisture in the womb, which prevents conception, and its menstruation is corrupted and their provocations are delayed, and pain occurs near their arrival, then you must cauterize it with three cauteries around the navel as was said for the bladder, and with a cautery below on the lower part of the back or with two cauteries; and use the cautery hook.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	 On the method of cauterizing an ankle in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	 Si vero tibia fracta, et pedis articulus ad se
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	 If the tibia is broken and the ankle joint has been dislocated, when mucosal fluids flow towards the plaster on the ankle, and this causes it to come out of its place: and a sign of this is that the leg extends beyond the other side when they are compared with each other: and the location of the dislocation is found to be empty in this case.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	 Therefore it is necessary to burn the weak spot on the plaster of the ankle with a similar cautery in the shape of a circle: after you mark with pitch around the plaster, as described above: and let the plaster fall into the center of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	 And let the cautery be of the same shape as that which has been described for the cauterizing of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	 If this cautery is not present to you, then burn the same spot with three cauteries, using a deep cautery made of oil and with a depth according to the thickness of the entire skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	 On the method of cauterizing in sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	 Si vero sciatica sit in articulo coxae: et cum
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	 If sciatica is in the hip joint, and when a pain occurs on the ankle plaster and the cause of this is cold and fluids: and it is treated according to what has been said above for dislocation, but treatment does not help, and the condition worsens: then it is necessary to dissolve the weak spot with foul pills or artificial pills and similar ones.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	 Then burn the same spot.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	 The method of cauterization is as follows, in two ways: either with a cautery with medicines accompanying it or with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	 The cautery with fire is according to many methods.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	 One [of these] is to cauterize upon the bladder stone with three triangular cauteries according to this shape.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	 Make a good or bad depth for them.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	 Let the space be between each cautery of the size of a finger; and let the cautery be anointed with oil.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	 Sometimes, however, the cautery is made in the middle of the bladder stone itself.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	 Why are there four cauteries?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	 If you wish to cauterize with a circle, whose form preceded the cauterization of the bladder stone displacement, one: so that the circle contains the whole bladder stone.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	 Burn the thickness of the skin all over.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	 This is the method of cautery for sciatica, when pain is attached to the bladder itself, and does not extend to the hip and leg.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	 But if it extends to the hip and leg, then cauterize the same on the hip with two cauteries at the place where the sick person indicates, where there is pain; and cauterize your knife four fingers deep into the outer part: let the cautery be a small knife.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	 Let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	 If the sick person indicates that pain extends almost to the toes, then cauterize it there where he indicates with a pointed cautery, three, or four, or more if necessary.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	 If he indicates that pain is turned towards the leg below the knee, then cauterize it there with a small knife cautery.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	 Take care of yourself in all your cauteries, so as not to burn the nerve or large artery, and attract harm or contraction through it onto the sick person.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	 And I myself have seen one and another of those who cauterized on the shin, and burned too much in their cautery, and the leg swelled until it reached the foot, and was pierced through, and the entire foot rotted; then there follows loosening of the abdomen, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	 If pain is in two parts simultaneously, cauterize each one according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	 Some wise men have said in cauterization of anus (a rectum), this is the method of cauterizing it.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	 Make a similar iron tool (cautery) whose diameter is half of a palm; and it should be at the orifice according to its size, equal to the circumference of a finger's knuckle, or slightly less; and within that iron tool, there should be another smaller iron tool.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	 And let the space between all iron tools be equal to the size of the knuckle of a thumb; and let these iron tools be open at two sides; and their height should be equal to or slightly more than a knuckle, or two knuckles; and make a handle from iron suitable for holding in these iron tools.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape (of the cautery).
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	 Then it is heated in fire until it glows and sparks; then it is placed on the pillow of the anus (a rectum), leaning weakly on a healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	 Therefore, cauterize him with three rounded iron tools at once.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	 Then leave him for three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	 Afterwards, apply ointment with butter; and let the open wound remain for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with an ointment until he is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	 Says Albucasis, with this shape of the cautery, we have used it insufficiently because of its terrifying appearance; and therefore, because few are found who dare to use it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	 Nevertheless, it is one of the good cauteries for him who endures it, and it finds its place with him.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	 But cautery with drugs is to be made by you into two iron tools having a perforated strap, on which descends the key of its door from brass or iron, whose length is equal to the height of the walls; and in their height, there should be two knuckles, or as if they themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	 And let the space be that which is between each quantity of finger thickness, and let it be open below and above; and let it contain one another, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	 Then place it on the boxwood plank, with the weak side lying on the healthy side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	 And press your hand upon the boxwood plank hard.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	 Then pour between two circles of warm water, which has been slightly heated by fire, and hold it for the length of an hour; let the weak one endure its bite and its burning, for he finds the bite as a fire does, until the biting stops.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	 Then clean your hand with the instrument, and wash the whole boxwood plank with warm water and sweet water; then let it be for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	 And place butter on it until the soot of burning is removed; and let it be for some days, and pus will flow out from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	 For it is the final remedy.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointments, until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	 If the pain extends to the hip or leg, make a splint for him in which there is water, as you made for the boxwood plank equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	 And this is the method of hot water; and I have already written about it in the tract on the correction of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	 Take lime and unburnt chalk of equal parts; grind each of them well, and put them into a new pot whose lower part is perforated with a small hole, according to the quantity that enters the radius; and place another earthenware pot below it; and pour over the lime and chalk from sweet water, so that both are submerged by one finger; then press them with your hand firmly; and let the pot be until the acid water descends in the lower part of the earthenware pot.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	 Then gather all that water and throw it over another limb; and let it coagulate until it returns.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	 For indeed, it will then be very strong and sharp, which is administered in many operations of medicine, and also in the cauterization of other members.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	 Because it performs the operation of fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	 And among the medications are those with which the ulcers are cauterized, also like teesie, and honey of cardamom, and chalk with soap, so that both are mixed together. ¶
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	 And Galen indeed reported the cure of a certain man from ancient times, who was cured of the pain of an ulcer and sciatic vein; and he highly praised its effect.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	 And he said that no other treatment was necessary for him, and that he was cured from the disease in one day until he reported that perhaps he himself had gone into a bath, and came out of it already well.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	 It is to be taken from the green seitaragi; and if it is not found, dry one should be taken, fresh: and grind a great deal with some fat, and place it over the ulcer, where there is pain, or leg, or hip: and bind it, and leave for a quantity of three hours, or until the weak feel the sensation of burning.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	 Then introduce it into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	 When his body becomes hot, introduce him onto a bed.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	 For the pain disappears and is cured.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	 And know that it is not necessary for anyone to use cautery with these medications, unless after evacuation of the body.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	 And Dioscorides himself said that the droppings of goats, when it is cauterized with the sciatic vein, give to it; and it becomes a cautery in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	 Take flax, and immerse it in old oil, and place it on a deep place which is between the big toe of the foot and the ball of the foot, and is closer to the ball of the foot.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	 Then take dry goat's dung, and heat it in fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	 Then place it on the flax, and let it burn out.
Deinde itera illud.	 Then repeat this process.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	 Therefore do not stop doing this until sensation reaches the edge through it and the pain ceases.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	 And this method of cauterization is called cautery of the cow hoof.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	 Section on the Cauterization of Back Pain.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter XLIV.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	 Sometimes pain occurs in the back due to various causes such as accidents, blows, excessive evacuation and similar conditions caused by the injection of cold and wet matter; and cauterization does not apply except in this one case which is done through the injection of cold and wet matter.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	 Therefore after the evacuation of the sick with foul pills and similar substances, three lines should be drawn on the back where there is pain, according to the width of a palm leaf, after marking them with encaustic in each line five times or more according to the amount that comes from the tolerance of the sick person; and cauterization should be done with cautery points.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries along with the medial nail cautery, in this manner.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in incaeptine Gibbositatis.	 Section on the method of cauterization for hump-shaped growths.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter XLV.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	 This illness often occurs in small children.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	 The sign of this hump-shaped growth in children is that it occurs on the child when a stridor occurs during elevation and movement; and you will find at the end of the spine of the back and the nodes of it, which has already begun to protrude above the other spines.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	 When therefore you see that thing and wish to do it, then cauterize it with a cautionery which is in the shape of a circle.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	 And let the cautionery catch over all the mussel-shell equally; and if you wish to cauterize around the mussel-shell with a pointed cautionery, let there be two or three points, and they should be close to one another.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	 Then take care of the place until it heals as we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	 And beware, do not administer the cautionery on a swelling which is caused by a muscle spasm.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization for gout and for joint pains.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter XLVI.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	 When the joint pains are caused by cold moistness that spreads to any part of the body, then when they occur in the feet, it is customary among doctors to call it gout properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	 When the treatment for cold-caused gout has been used without relief of pain, then the cautionery removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	 And it is that you should cauterize him after evacuation around the joint of the foot with many cautioneries; and let the cautionery be Olivary.
Cuius haec est forma.	 This is its form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	 And if you need to make points on the sole of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautionery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	 If the pain ascends to the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize it over all the knee with three or four cautioneries from all sides, with the same clavicular cautionery.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 If you need more of this cautionery, then cauterize it.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	 And do not immerse your hand with the cautionery, rather let it be about the thickness of the skin.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	 If the pain ascends to the knees and back, then administer what was said in its chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	 If the pains are only in the hands, then make punctures around the joints of the fingers, as two lines are rolled up.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	 If pain persists in the fingers, then make punctures over every nodule and on the back of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	 If the pain rises after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both from all sides.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	 And do not evacuate a sick person through good regimen and administration of medicine.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	 For if the diet is good, and phlegm is evacuated, it will be cured with this cautery by the help of God.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	 Chapter on the mode of cauterizing in ruptures.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	 When rupture occurs in the groins and the intestine or zirbu (a term for a diseased testicle) descends towards the testis, and it begins to be near: then it is necessary that you order the sick man to abstain from food on his own day.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	 And he should use laxatives so that stool passes from his bowels.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	 Then let him sit on your hands upon his back: and command him to hold his breath until it comes out, or the hernia appears, or the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	 Then reduce him with your fingers, and make a mark with hot iron under the hernia on his neck, with the mark whose end is similar to half of a circle above the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	 Then heat the cautery of this shape until it turns white and throw sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	 Then reduce the hernia or the intestine to its hollow.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	 Then let the assistant place his hand on the spot to prevent the intestine from coming out: and you have already opened between the legs of the sick person, and placed a stone under him, and another servant is serving over his thighs, and another over his chest who holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	 Then place the cautery upon the mark, with your hand holding the cautery straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	 And hold him until you reach the bone with it: or do it again with another blow, if you have not reached the bone with it in the first instance.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	 And be careful to observe the exit of the intestine during your cautery, lest you burn him and bring harm upon him or great evil.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	 And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, the operation is not effective.
Et oportet ut sit cauterium infantium subtile, secundum mensuram eorum.	 And it must be that the cautery of children should be subtle, according to their measure.
Deinde cura cum reliquis unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with ointments until he is well again.
Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	 And let the sick person lie on his back for forty days until the wound is healed.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	 And it must be that you place his food in length according to the time of his treatment, so that it softens his stomach; so that no hernia may come out during attempts and evacuations.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	 Then when he wishes to rise after forty days, then administer a belt made properly, and let him hold it for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	 And let it (the wound) be diminished by work, and filled with food and drink, and with strong voices.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	 When this regimen is used, the cure is complete healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	 And I shall say the cure for ruptures with incision in its own chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	 If ruptures occur in the rest of the abdomen and they are starting and do not want to heal, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size: and that which is cauterized should be like the third part of it from that time on.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	 Then take care of it as I said: do not increase (the incision).
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	 And some have said that a rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this shape.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	 After it is signed with wax, and a line is placed that goes across the width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line below.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	 And place your hand in the middle with the cautery claw.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	 But the first cautery is easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	 Chapter on the method of cauterization for pain due to injury or blow.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter LVIII.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	 If pain occurs in certain members due to injury or blow, and the pain persists for a long time and does not help with medication, then it should be cauterized with a puncture cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	 And the puncture cautery should be of the size and part of the member, its weakness, its strength, its location of twisting, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	 If it is healed by the first cautery, that is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	 If not: then repeat the cautery over it.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	 Because it is customary for these pains to change from one member to another that is nearby.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you follow them with a cautery until the sick one is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Lepra.	 On the method of cauterizing in leprosy.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter XLIX.
Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	 Leprosy is sometimes helped by a great cautioning.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	 And particularly the type of leprosy that occurs due to putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: when considering burning it itself.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	 If leprosy is beginning and you have treated it with what was said in the division, but it does not subside nor stay: fear for the weak one, lest corruption spread over his entire complexion; then cauterize him on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head known, and second lower toward the forehead at the end of hairline, and two above the horns, and one behind on the back of the neck.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	 And finally put your hand with the cautery a little bit, until it makes an impression on the bone smaller, and the cortexes come off from it; so that the expiration of gross vapors from it is relieved, and cauterize also with the cautery on the spleen according to what preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	 If leprosy has already spread over the weak one and is apparent: then it is necessary that you cauterize with these cauteries which were said in the head, and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and two cauteries on the cheeks, and two cauteries on the hips of the neck, and six on the hips of the back, and one large one on alhahosos near the tail and one above it, in the almeidat; and two over the ankles: namely over the whole ankle with one, and two over knees, and two over shoulders, and two over elbows, and two over the tendons of the chest; and cauterize on all the joints of his fingers of his hands and feet, and on all the heels of his feet, and on the soles of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	 Be careful to spare the nerves that are on top of the last heel bone, so as not to burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	 And sometimes it is burned with a cautery upon the cheek bone, and upon another upon the forehead, and upon another upon the nose.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	 Know that the more you add to the cautery, the greater is the help and the better it is.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	 Know that an ill person does not find pain in the cautery, as a healthy person does: for this reason, because his body is already numb.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	 It must be that the cauteries are of suitable size and shape according to the limbs and joints: in accordance with which they were preceded by types of iron tools.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then treat the burn with flour of herbs and honey, and the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Stupore.	 Chapter on Cauterization in Fainting.
Caput L.	 Chapter L.
Quando stupet aliquod membrum, et curatur cum medicinis, et oleis, et emplastris, et non sanatur, tunc cauteriza ipsum membrum stupefactum cauteriis, secundum quod meretur magnitudo membri, aut paruitas eius.	 When some part faints and is treated with medicines, oils, plasters, and does not heal, then cauterize the numbed part with cauteries, according to the size or smallness of the member.
Et sit cauterium tuum intrans in spissitudinem cutis parumper.	 And let your cautery penetrate only a little into the thickness of the skin.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	 And sometimes it is burned for some fainting that happens to the hand and foot, at the joints of the back near the exit of nerves that move that member, and the fainting disappears.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	 But do not presume to apply it there unless he who is wise in the anatomy of the limbs and the exits of nerves moving the body knows.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Albaras.	 Chapter on Cauterization in Ulcers.
Caput LI.	 Chapter LI.
Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	 When the ulcer becomes old and nothing of medicine helps in it: then cauterize over it with a deep cautery, according to the thickness of the skin, until the white disappears and its color changes.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with the flour of herbs, and lentils with rose oil, and leaves of arnoglossa, and blood of a dove, and blood of a crane: each should be one part: mix all these together, and apply on cloth, and let it adhere to the place until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Cancro.	 On the method of cauterizing in Cancer.
Caput LII.	 Chapter LII.
Quando Cancer est incipiens, et uis ipsum sistere: tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio circuli in circuitu eius, sicuti reuoluitur.	 When Cancer is beginning, and you want to stop it: then cauterize it with a circular cautery around it, as is rotated.
Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	 But the wise have said, that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	 To me, however, it does not seem so: because I fear that it may burn, and I have already seen that many times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	 And it is correct, that it should be cauterized around it with a circle, as we said, or with many cauteries.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	 On the method of cauterizing in Adubelati.
Caput LIII.	 Chapter LIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	 When someone has Adubelati, and it slows down in maturation, either because of an excess causing it or because of age and weakness, or when there are few blood vessels remaining, or because time is needed and you want to hurry the maturation of Adubelati: then cauterize around it with many small cauteries by pricking.
Deinde dimitte eam.	 Then let it rest.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	 For itself will hasten when it has matured.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	 If you want to pierce it with a cautery, then heat the cautery, whose form is this: (Here follows a description of the shape of the cautery)
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	 Place it in the middle of Adubelati; let it penetrate the skin; and let the cautery be weakened from that which follows, so that the course of the pus may be relieved.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	 On the method of cauterizing in a cancerous case.
Caput LIIII.	 Chapter LIV.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	 A cancer is not anything but corruption walking in a member and consuming it, like fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	 If you see a cancer in a place that can bear the cautery with fire, then use much cauterization, small and large nails according to what suits the place where the cancer is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	 Then cauterize it from every part until you have eradicated the entire corruption and there remains nothing of it beneath.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	 Then leave it for three days and place over the cauterized areas sulphur pulverized with oil until all scabs and all corruption are eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	 Then care for it with unguents that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	 If you see that after three days flesh is born by healthy generation in which there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	 And if not: then repeat the cautery on what remains of the corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	 A cancer is sometimes treated with an acute medication.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	 It arises in the place of the cautery.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	 However, cautery with fire is more swift in its help; and I have already said that the cauterization of it with an acute medication is in division (surgery); so take it whenever you need it there.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	 On the method of cauterizing in nails and verrucas (warts).
Caput LV.	 Chapter V.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	 This illness often occurs in the lower parts of the feet; it is a swelling, filled with matter, which injures the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	 The cautery is indeed in them according to two modes: the cautery with fire, and the cautery with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	 As for the one with fire, it should be shaped like a hollowed-out raven's feather; made of iron according to its size, which contains a nail from all sides; and it should have fine edges.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	 Then place the heated one on the nail.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	 Then turn the hand with the cautery around the nail, until the cautery reaches the depth of the nail; and leave it for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	 Then apply salve made of wild herbs crushed with salt; and leave the salve on it at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	 It will be uprooted from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat the place with a fine ointment for the skin until it heals.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	 If they are not cured and keep recurring on the body surface, especially in hands and feet; then administer cautery with hot water. It is to be noted that you will take a cannula made of brass or iron or raven's feather; and place it on the nail or althea root.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	 Then pour a small amount of hot water into the cannula; hold your hand and turn it with a slight pressure, so that the tip of the cannula is pressed against the root of the nail, and let the hot water find its way to the depth, to the root of the nail; and wait for an hour for the weak patient under the burning sensation of hot water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	 Then release it, as the nail will be uprooted along with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	 Do this to them one after another until you have treated all who are affected by them on the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	 Then treat them after they are uprooted, with a fine ointment for the skin.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	 Method of Cauterizing in a Shaking Manner.
Caput LVI.	 Ubi ossa infranguntur et perforant
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	 When the bones are broken and perforated:
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	 The tremor ceases with cautery oiling, and hastens the health's recovery from cold disease.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	 On the method of cauterization, Albatheer.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	 Sometimes, Albathir expels foul things from the body, that is, pustules which are caused by corrupted matters.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	 Therefore, it is necessary first, when they appear, to cauterize on every pustule head with a subtle cautery together with myrtle wood, whose tip is set alight with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	 Or with the root of long aristolochia.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	 Or with a lenticular cautery.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	 And sometimes they are cauterized, at the beginning of their expulsion, according to this method: and they do not increase: and the surplus is broken, making them, and it heals from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	 However, it must be done afterwards with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	 On the method of cauterizing in bleeding from an artery at a wound.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	 Often it happens that blood flows from an artery which is cut near a wound, which occurs externally, or at the incision of a boil, or of cautery on a limb, and similar things: and it is difficult to separate him.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	 When this happens to someone, then hurry with your hand to the artery's orifice, and place your forefinger on it: and press him strongly, until the blood is held under your finger, and nothing escapes from it.=*/ When such a thing happens to someone, then quickly go with your hand to the orifice of the artery, and place your index finger upon it; and press it very hard, until the blood is held under your finger, and nothing comes out of it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	 Then place a small oil-filled cautery on fire, and many large ones with numerous ones: and blow on them until they are very hot.=*/ Place a small oil-filled cautery on fire, and many large ones with numerous ones; and blow on them until they become very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then take one of them (the heated irons), either small or large, according to the wound and the place where the broken artery is, and place the cautery on that vein; afterwards remove your finger quickly: and hold the cautery until the blood is severed.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	 If it is expelled along with withdrawing the finger from the artery's opening and extinguishing the cautery, then take another cautery quickly, from those which are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Therefore, do not stop doing that with one after another until the blood is severed.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	 And beware, lest you burn the nerve that is there, and other evil happens to the already weakened person.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	 And know that when blood flows from the artery, then it is not possible to sever it; particularly since the artery is large, unless with one of four methods.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	 Or with a cautery, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	 Or by extraction, when it has not been extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For when it is drawn out, the ends contract and the blood is severed.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	 Or it will be tied with a strong thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	 Or medicine from the property for severing blood is placed upon it and it is tightened with a decent ligature press.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	 But he who performs the severance with a ligament and a tightening with fabric or with substances that burn and similar, does not fully help him unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	 If that happens to someone and he is not present with the doctor or medicine, then begin by placing the index finger over the opening of the vein as we have said, and constrict it very tightly, until the blood is obstructed from above the wound and on the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	 And the finger is not to be removed from above it with cold water of intense cold until the blood clots and thickens and is severed.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	 And meanwhile, consider in him what requires cautery or medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	 On incision, perforation, and phlebotomy in wounds and similar cases.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	 As we have said in the first chapter, every disease for which burning with fire and medicine is suitable, as well as its occasions, causes, instruments, and forms of cautery.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	 And there I set out chapters from head to foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	 And I will proceed in this chapter in the same way: to alleviate the one seeking the thing sought.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	 And before I begin that, you must know, my sons, what is found in this chapter from the terror of that which was in the first chapter about cautery.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	 And therefore it is necessary for there to be greater caution because, in the operation that is in this chapter, evacuation often falls out with blood, with which life stands during opening of a vein, or incision over an abscess, or opening of an exit wound, or treatment of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision over a stone, and similar things: from all of which tremor, fear, and death occur in many.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	 And I warn you that this should not happen to you, for at times people of this art fall into these conditions with the weaknesses of men.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	 For there is one who becomes angry with his illness and is light as far as death is concerned: because of the vehemence that comes from his weakness and the length of his wickedness.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	 And when illness is due to fear, it signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	 And there is one who gives you false hope and deceives you with it, hoping for health, but the illness of this one is deadly.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	 Therefore, it is not appropriate that you agree to him who comes to you from those whose manner is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	 Let your caution be more intense than your greed and avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	 And do not presume about anything from that, unless after certain knowledge, which is verified among you as to the matter that has reached a praiseworthy outcome.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	 And use in the treatment of all your sick, prediction and direction concerning that to which it is appropriately healthful.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	 For there is assistance for you in the matter of acquiring reputation and glory, memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	 May God inspire you, O son, His understanding, and not deprive you of guidance and inspiration, for that is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	 And I myself have arranged this Chapter by dividing it into sections, according to what was in the chapter on Cautery, from neck to feet: so that your request is made clear to you regarding what you desire and need from it.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	 Chapter on Treatment of Water that is Collected in the Heads of Children.
Caput I.	 Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	 Know that this affliction often occurs in boys during childbirth: either when the midwife tightens the boy's head without ease.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	 And it sometimes occurs also for hidden reasons that are not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	 And I myself have not seen this affliction in others than in boys: and to every one of them whom I have seen, death has followed: for that reason, it seemed to me that I should refrain from the operation on it.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	 And I myself have seen a boy whose head was filled with water, and his head swelled up every day until he could not sit on himself due to the size of his head; and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	 And this moisture, it may accumulate between the skin and the bone: or it may accumulate under the bone above the forehead.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	 And the operation on him, if there is moisture between the skin and the bone, and the abscess is small, then it is necessary to make a single fracture in the middle of the head along its width: and the length of the crack should be like two knuckles, until the moisture runs out.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	 And this is the form of the trepan.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	 If then the moisture is more increased, and the abscess is larger, then place these two cracks according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	 And if the moisture is under the bone, and the sign of this is that you see openings of the skull all around; and water comes out when you press it with your hand from within, and it does not hide itself from you: then it is necessary to make three cracks in the middle of the head according to this method.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	 And after the incision, remove all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	 Then bind the cracks with cloths and wool.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	 Then anoint it above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	 Then cut (the) ligament, and care for the wound with sutures and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	 And do not release the head without equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	 Feed the weak with dry food of little moisture, until (the) limb is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	 Another method of incision is to consider where the abscess appears large and the collection of water (for) irrigation.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	 Because sometimes it is more in the head or skull, or right, or left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	 Therefore ascend with incision where the abscess and filling of water appear to you, and cut it as possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	 And observe, do not cut an artery, and let the flow of blood occur and the weak one dies from this flow with evacuation of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	 Chapter on incisions of the arteries that are after the ears.
Caput II.	 Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	 When catarrhs occur to someone's eyes or chest, and it does not improve with medical treatment, then the final cure is in this, incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	 Therefore when you wish to cut them (the arteries), let the sick one shave his own head.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	 Then rub the place with a rough cloth, so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	 Then let the sick one tie his own neck with any cloth of his.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	 Then consider, where the vein pulsates.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 And the places of both are places that are depressed after the ears, and they are rarely hidden, unless in some men.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	 Then mark both with hot iron, and cut each one with a thin knife from both sides, the incision reaching the bone, and let it be wide enough for the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	 And if you wish, introduce the thin knife under the artery and cut it from above with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	 The length of the incision should be like that of two fingers joined.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	 When a vein is cut, blood flows out by pulsating exudation, which leaps to the interior by frequent jumps.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	 If however an artery is not apparent to the sense, then one should measure the quantity of space with three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	 Then mark [the place] with wax and cut up to the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	 And that which must be let out from the blood is six ounces, and perhaps you will let out more or less from it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	 Do that [letting out of blood] according to the quantity which appears to you due to the strength of the patient and the filling of the artery.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	 Then, consider the wound.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	 If there remains something on the bone from the flesh, then cut it, so that no warm abscess occurs; then stitch the wound with linen strips.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with an ointment until he is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	 Chapter on the extraction of arteries, which are in the temples.
Caput III.	 Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	 When an old hemicranium (migraine) or acute catarrh due to acidic humidities and warmth in the temples, or an old soad (scrofula), violent, and similar conditions occur in a man; and it is treated with modes of curative medicine, but it does not help; then we have experience in these afflictions in extracting arteries from the temples, or cauterizing them, as we have related.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	 The method of operation for extracting (them) is that the sick person shaves hairs which are on the temples, and stretches himself to the visible artery in the temple.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	 It is indeed shown to you by its pulse and it is rarely hidden except in a few men or in case of violent coldness.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	 If it is hidden from you, then the sick person should tighten his head with any cloth of his and then scratch the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	 Or fumigate the place with hot water until it appears to you in a clear manifestation.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	 Then take the spatula which I have prepared earlier.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	 Then scrape off the skin with it easily until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	 Then plunge a hook into it and pull it out towards the top until you pull it out from the skin, and make it exit from the tunics that are beneath it on all sides.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	 If the artery is fine: then fold it with the tip of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Then cut from it a portion according to the length its ends extend and contract, so as not to cause bleeding.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	 Because if it is not cut and if it is not severed, blood will not rise up deeply.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	 Then evacuate six ounces of blood, up to the third.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If the artery is large: it is necessary to tie it in two places with thick thread made of silk or twine; or with gut-string, so that putrefaction does not approach it before the wound consolidates and there is bleeding.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	 Then cut off the redundancy, which is between two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	 Do this at that hour or another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	 And if you wish, cauterize it with the cautery until it reaches the bone, using a sharp-pointed cautery: until its ends are cut off and it remains in place for that same operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	 And this work is better unless the patient has a fever or is of chilly constitution.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	 Because the cautery is from those things that help to stop moisture (bleeding).
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	 Therefore, it is better as a remedy.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	 And after the extraction of arteries, the place should be filled with hot ashes; and fine pulverized charcoal should be placed on it.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	 And after the dissolution (of gangrene), it is to be scraped with dry medicines that cause new flesh to grow and with linen until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If during the operation there is bleeding from an artery, then hasten to cut it off with a cautery or to fill the place with wax; and press your hand until the bleeding stops.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	 If none of those is present to you, then place your finger on it until the blood freezes.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	 And apply a cold compress to the place with water of intense cold until the pain ceases and it is pressed according to what is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	 And of that which is easier and less difficult for the extraction of an artery, it is to cauterize the vein with this cautery having two points: let the point of the two points be similar to an almond (small round object).
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	 However, they are much less sharp than two needles.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	 Because if they are as sharp as two needles, there will be frost for both; and they will not cut through the flesh quickly.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	 When there is a certain amount of thickness [in the diseased part], it is necessary to apply heat from fire and quickly cut off the flesh; for this operation is better than any other, and easier, and more straightforward.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	 And the space that is between two knives should be a thickness of one finger's breadth, after you have marked two places with hot iron; and lay both heated ones down until they reach the bone, and cut the vein in two places: so that what lies between the extremities may be removed.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	 For this cautery does not heal [the wound] completely.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	 And this is the shape of a cautery.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	 Chapter on the treatment of chronic, sharp tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	 When tears are persistent and flow from the veins on the outside of the skull: and no medication for treatment is applied to them with medicines, and the face of the sick person becomes red, and sensation is felt in the forehead as if it were ants crawling: and the eyes are exhausted, wet, so that the hairs of them are already corroded by the corrosion: and the eyelids have been heated due to the sharpness of the tears: then, in their treatment, ancient physicians resorted to this operation, which they called the Cure with a Sword.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	 And it is to instruct the sick person to shave the hairs that are on their forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	 Then make three incisions on the forehead of equal length, and let the length of each incision be approximately two fingers, and one incision be equal in length to the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second slightly beyond the movement of the arms, and the third on the opposite side: and be careful not to cut through the arteries that are on both sides: and extend your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let the entire length of the incision be three fingers' width apart: and prepare for yourself a piece of sponge or dry cloth with which to absorb blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	 Then insert two sharp points, following their form.
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	 From the first incision to the second, scrape off the skin that is between the two incisions, along with the forehead above it.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	 Then do the same from the middle incision to the second incision.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	 Then remove the sharp points, and insert another instrument called a sharp knife, with one edge, not sharp on both sides, into the first incision.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	 And place the pointed side of it facing the skin attached with flesh, and the blunt side facing the bone; then push it until it reaches the middle fissure; and cut along with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes, except that the incision should be continued up to where it appears on the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	 Then make it in the middle fissure up to another fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	 And when an equal quantity of blood flows out from it, squeeze the places from the clotted blood's stumps.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	 Then put linen cloth from an old cooking pot into every fissure, and place over them wetted wool soaked in oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 And see to it that no warm abscess occurs.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	 And on the third day loosen the bandage, and administer a large infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	 Then take care of it with a basilicon ointment and the other things that heal wounds until it heals.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	 Chapter on the treatment of sharp tears and catarrhs of the eyes from internal parts of the head.
Caput V.	 Chapter V.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	 When someone gets sharp, severe, continuous catarrhs, and you see their eyes are stretched, small, and already weakened in appearance; and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hairs fall out from them, and there is acute pain deep in the head, causing discomfort and sneezing; then take from these symptoms, that those substances and catarrhs do not come unless from many veins.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	 A better treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	 And it is to command the sick person to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	 Then make one cut in the middle of the forehead, or slightly to one side for less width, and start with the cut from the left temple to the right temple; let the incision go as deep as the bone: extend your hand away from the moving temples until the bone is exposed: and absorb all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	 Then separate the cut between the two lips of the wound with tweezers or linen strips.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then bind it on top with thread: and soak the threads in wine and oil to prevent a hot abscess.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	 And when you loosen it and see that the abscess is about to subside: then break the bone, until new flesh begins to grow in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	 Then treat the patient with a drying regimen that promotes new flesh growth; as if you were taking two parts of wheat flour and four parts of pitch; and prepare an ointment from them, and apply it to promote new flesh growth in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	 Chapter on the treatment of wounds that fall into the ear.
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	 Everything that falls into the ear is one of four species: either a mineral stone, or something resembling a stone such as iron and glass: or it is from a plant, like peas and beans: or it is liquid, such as water, vinegar, and similar things: or it is some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	 When a stone falls into the ear or anything similar that does not grow in the ear and is not added to it, expose the ear alone: if you see a stone then pour something from violated oil or sesame into the ear.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	 Then administer the extraction of it and make him sneeze with snuff mixed with powdered charcoal, and obstruct the nostrils near the moment of sneezing, after you place around the ear fragments from cloths or wool, and stretch the ear upward.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	 Many times it escapes with this treatment.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	 If it does not escape, then administer the extraction of it with Guidon's method (that is, subtle Pizigarol), whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	 If it escapes with Guidon's method, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	 And if it does not, then administer the extraction of it with a fine hook, several times repeated.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	 If it does not escape through that, then make a tube from brass and insert the end of the tube into the ear opening widely, and obstruct what is around the tube with beeswax softened with oil so that there is no way out except the tube: then draw it out with your strong attraction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	 Many times it escapes with what we have said.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	 If it does not escape by that method: then take some helkalimbated or water (that is, prepared gluten), a small amount, which birds are caught with: and place it at the end of the radius when you have properly placed a sieve on it: then insert it into the ear opening gently, after you have removed the ear from moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	 If therefore it does not come out with all that I have mentioned, then hasten to cut, before a hot abscess or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	 The method of lancing is as follows: first draw blood from the patient with a lancet; and remove according to the power of the lancet from his blood.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	 Then make the patient sit between your hands and turn his ear towards above and make a small lancet-like incision at the base of the ear in its fatty tissue where it is depressed; let the lancet be of lunar shape until you reach the stone; then remove it along with it, as far as possible with your instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then make the lancet incision from your side quickly and take care of it until it heals.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	 If what falls into the ear is one grain or more which grow and swell; then administer its extraction.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	 But if it does not obey you to come out, then take a fine, thin probe shaped as follows.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	 And administer with it the excision of that species from the grains which fall into the ear and do not do this when you think that that grain is already moistened by the steam of the ear, until you place many fragments upon it; then remove it with tweezers, or with a fine probe, or with suction, as we have said; for its extraction is eased.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	 In water which enters the ear, the patient should use sneezing when he is forced to do so first; and already his ear has filled itself with some hot old liquid; and it lies on that ear where the water is.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	 If therefore it comes out through this, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	 But if not: then take many small, soft stones of the length of a finger and heat them slightly with fire; and let the patient insert one from these into the ear's opening; and let him spit on his foot from that side, and strike with a stone upon the stone in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	 Therefore, it should not cease to be done with stone and stone until all water comes out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	 And now the water comes out in such a way that you take one from parchment or reed, and insert its end into the ear; and light the other end with fire until it is burned as much as possible.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	 Then take another reed and do this many times until all water comes out; and draw it out with a tube as previously mentioned in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	 In the extraction of an animal entering into it (if it is small in body, like a louse, and similar to it), care should be taken of it as previously mentioned in division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	 But if it is of a large body, which appears to the senses: then administer its extraction with forceps and hooks; and its nature is easier for all who hold it in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	 In the extraction of worms generated in the ear, when you care for it as we have previously said in division and in the treatment of distillations, and your care does not help: then you should look at the ear in sunlight.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	 If therefore something appears there from worms, then draw it out with forceps or fine hooks.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	 If however nothing appears there, then take a tube with this shape, narrow below and wide above; and insert its fine end into the ear according to how much weak it can tolerate; then draw it out forcefully with that suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	 Do this many times until all worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	 If however they do not obey you to leave, then bind them with the tube of poppy seeds as previously mentioned in the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	 If they do not come out with what was said, then administer the distillations which the ancients have already experienced in the destruction of worms; and you will find it in the treatment of distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	 And let your flow (be) with oil and medications into the ear using this tool, whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	 As you see, make it from silver or brass, narrower below, with a small hole at the bottom and a larger one on top.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	 Therefore, let the implement that is within the concavity of the tube be made of brass properly.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	 And if you wish, take radium (a type of brass) and wind its end with a suitable coil; then pour oil, juice or whatever medicine you desire into the tube; let this be in the ear; then insert the radium with the coiled part on top and press it with your hand until the oil is forced into the concavity of the ear, and let the sick person feel it inside; and whatever is poured into the ear should already be slightly heated by fire; but take care that what distills into it is not too cold; for medicines cannot tolerate this.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	 [Section on the treatment of aural impaction]
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	 When some infants are born from the wombs of their mothers without perforated ears.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	 And it happens to some people that impaction occurs in the ear due to a wound or flesh born there.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	 And this impaction sometimes occurs in the deep hole of the ear which is not visible to the eye; and sometimes it occurs near the outer hole of the ear which can be seen.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	 Therefore, that which happens in the deep part of the ear and is not within the reach of sight, is difficult to cure in many ways.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	 And in that which can be seen, it is necessary to place the ear of the sick person in the sun and examine it; then if you see the impaction appearing, open it with a thin spatula whose form is as follows, its end having a small notch, part of which is sharp; and the rest of the spatula should be of two flat sides so as not to harm the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	 If therefore the excision is born from the flesh within the ear: then hold it with a fine hook, and cut it with great force, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	 If therefore the boil is deep within the ear: then take a fine and gentle probe, heat it slightly with fire; then insert it into the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	 If you feel the boil with it, that it comes accompanied by weakness and loss of hearing, try to open it gently; and beware, lest you injure the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	 Then place linen within the ear according to the size of the hole you have made, having wrapped it in Egyptian ointment; do this for several days until you are certain about the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	 Or take linen, and immerse it in rose water, and grind upon it alum powder, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	 If you see the ear already discharging: then you must draw out the linen, and allow it to be with another linen that you wrap in a pot made with rose oil, until the abscess becomes warm; then care for it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	 If there is bleeding, however: then immerse sponge or cloths in cold water and place it on the ear; and use the rest of the treatment that removes the mentioned bleeding by means of distillations.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	 Chapter on Althaea's care for the eyelids.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	 These are the Thehelil that occur in the eyelids when they are sometimes moist and sometimes dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	 Therefore, it is necessary to hold them with tweezers or with a hook, and cut them at their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	 Then place on top of the wound a piece of linen cloth that has been ground up.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	 If however blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine lens-shaped cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	 And to cauterize them is better after an incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	 They often return when something remains from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	 And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots will burn away and they will not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	 Chapter on the care of swellings in the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	 Often something happens in the eyelids that is similar to a swelling in its hardness and toughness, and it is called a Crandin because it is an accumulation of coarse moisture on the upper eyelid and the lower one.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	 Therefore, the operation is to determine if it is a Crandin that appears on the eyelid and moves to all parts, and its substance is soft.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	 Make an incision over it in width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	 Then remove it from all sides with ease until it comes out.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	 Then hang it with a hook and cut it off.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	 If the removal of it is not prepared for you unless after you have made an incision into the eyelid a little, then it may harm someone weak with that.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the incision is large: then stitch it up with sutures: and care for it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	 And if it is small, no harm will come to you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	 For an ointment restores it and fills it in.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	 If a foreign body is directed towards the inner parts of the ear and turned against the intrinsic surface, then invert the eyelid and hang up the foreign body with a hook; besides which you will need incision, and press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	 If the eyelid is stretched by incision, it does not harm anything.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	 Then clean the eye after the incision of the foreign body with salt water; and take care of the place where it was, until the affected part heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	 Chapter on the treatment of eyelids.
Caput X.	 Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	 The Axirnath is a growth that arises in the upper eyelid tissues; and it mostly happens to children; it burdens their eyes, and they get cataracts in the mornings, and they cannot see the light of the sun, because tears flow towards them, and therefore you can always see them lying on their faces, and sleeping on them, and their eyelids are always wet under the eyebrows, which has already been covered by swelling; and the appearance of Axirnath protruding is visible to the eye, and when you press the place with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method of treatment for it is that the patient places his head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	 Then take a clean cloth, and prepare a linen bandage on it, and make a circle from the linen around Axirnath to its entire size.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	 Then place it on the bandage and press with your fingers all around it, so that Axirnath gathers in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	 Then find in the middle of that moisture with a spatula-like instrument and make shallow cracks parallel to its width, but do not make the crack larger than what is done in phlebotomy in depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	 It is necessary that you find the entire skin, until you reach Axirnath, for in many dispositions, Axirnath proceeds from the fracture according to the shape of a white plum's pit.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	 Draw it out with a cloth that you have moistened between your fingers to the outside: and you rotate your hand to the right and left, until it is dispersed; and be careful not to add anything in the fracture, so that you do not reach the spittle to the eye, and harm it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	 If, however, Axirnath does not appear to you at the beginning of the fracture, you shall add a little in the fracture with ease, until Axirnath proceeds.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	 Then draw it out as we said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	 Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the place, and bind it with small stones.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	 And among men there are those who grind salt and put it into the hollow of the fracture, so that it melts what remains from that moisture.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	 If, however, a boil hot appears in the place, then take care of it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	 Chapter on the modes of Ataxmir (eyes), that is, when the eyelid softens, so that it weeps as it should not.
Caput XI.	 Chapter XI.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	 When hairs grow in the eyelids beyond the course of natural hairs and become old; then they harm the eye, and cause the occurrence of diseases such as constant weeping, softening of the eyelid, and whitish film, until it becomes the cause of the destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	 And indeed the eyes are treated according to four modes (methods) of Ataxmir.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	 Through cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	 With sharp medicine, according to what has been mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	 The ataxmir is cured by incision and suturing.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	 With reeds, according to what I shall say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 You must place the head of the sick person on your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	 Then, turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	 If it is thus turned, that is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	 And if not: insert the point into it, where there is a thread from below the eyelid, and make the point penetrate with the thread above, and let it be close to the hairs themselves, that is, close to the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow: and pull the thread upwards with the eyelid, and turn it with a rod.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	 Then, find on the inside of the eyelid under the added hairs with a spatula slipping from the greater lacrimal gland to the lesser one.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	 Then draw out the thread and put a small feather under the eyelid from cooked wool or cloth; then mark on the eyelid with wax, as the figure of a myrtle leaf.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	 However, it should be made according to the size and elevation of the eyelid, because it is diversified among humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	 From those who require that an incision be made according to the size of the eyelid, in proportion to its softening.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	 Then with the spatula find on top of the two lines which you marked, and start from the greater lacrimal gland to the lesser one, and let there be a split near the natural hairs, as the width of a rod.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	 Then insert the hook into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	 Then scrape it all.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	 Then gather together with suture two lips, with a sharp needle and fine woolen thread: and clean the blood, and make adhere what excesses from the threads on the two eyebrows, with some adhesives if you wish to do so: and if not, do not care.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	 Then release the suture and threads for three or four days, afterwards take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	 If you wish, release the wound without suture and take care of it as it dries and contracts.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	 For the eyelid is to be raised during sealing of the wound and its bandaging, but it will be better later.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	 This method of treatment was taught by the ancients Ataxmir.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	 However, there is worry about the sick person in it, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	 And another method is also in Ataxmir, and it is that signs are made on the eyelid in the form of a myrtle leaf, as we have told.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	 Then raise the eyelid with three separated or joined combs according to the following form, then cut what exceeds with small scissors according to this form, with equal incisions.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	 If it is not possible for you to hold the comb and it does not fit equally, then take a needle with thread on it, and insert it into the middle of the figure: and insert another thread near the larger tear duct, and another thread near the smaller tear duct: and gather the threads between your fingers equally.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	 Then raise your hand evenly with an elevation, and lift the skin where it is marked by the incision, as we have told.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then gather together two lips of the wound with suture: and take care of it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	 If a boil or an ulcer occurs at your incision or your wound, swab it with linen and wax, and apply ointments that soothe such things.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	 And sometimes the eyelashes may also turn inwards.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	 Therefore, it is necessary to use the method mentioned above for this case, but stitching both parts should be more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	 Chapter on the care of the bite of a mad dog.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	 And it is necessary to turn the eyelid and cut the wound that is on the inside, as I have explained.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	 Then make two needles or thin pieces of wood whose length is the same as that of the eyelid and their width less than the width of the eyelash; and you have now cut into the ends of both, from both sides where you hold the thread.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	 Then bring each one together with fine material over the surplus of the eyelid of the eye and sew two needles tightly from both sides with a strong stitch and leave it for some days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	 For skin that is sutured will die, become darker, rot and fall off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	 If it does not heal quickly, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	 When it has healed, the eyelid is lifted and no hairs are plucked.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	 And this is the shape of two needles that you should make according to this pattern and size in length and width.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	 Chapter on removing hair from the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	 Chapter 12.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	 The operation is to take a fine needle and insert a thin thread from silk into it gently.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	 Then bring the ends together and knot them tightly with a fine knot; let the length of the threads be one palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	 Then, on the Alinxotati thread, make another slender one beneath it in short length, and knot its ends if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	 Then let the sick person put his head in your lap and the operation be near the sun for it to be visible: since it is a subtle or minute operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	 Then insert the needle along with Alinxotati into the root of the eyelid and make it penetrate into the eyelid quickly until you pull out the natural hair from above.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	 Then pull out the hair above Alinxotati and insert this hair into Alinxotati: if there is one or two or three, but not more than that.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	 Then pull your hand with it until the hair comes out together with Alinxotati from the eyelid along with the natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	 If Alinxotati is pulled out and no hair comes out with it, pull Alinxotati towards the bottom while keeping the thread you made in it until Alinxotati comes out from the upper hole, and you see it through the eye: then pull Alinxotati and the thread; remove both and close the eye; leave the closed one for two or three days until hair grows back at its place and flesh covers it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	 If the hair is short, then join a long hair from the natural hairs with it and lift them up together; or leave it alone until it grows longer, and then lift it up.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	 Chapter on the treatment of Xatrat which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	 When this Xatrat happens to the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And this Xatrat is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	 Therefore, the accidental Xatrat arises from a congealing of wounds, cuts, cauterizations and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	 The method of operation is for you to locate that consolidation, and to separate its lips, and to place in it a linen cloth within, and to tie it until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	 And it is not appropriate to use in the treatment of it things that dry and constrict: for if you do that, Alxatratus becomes worse than it was: rather use in it things that soften, such as fenugreek; and embrocation with water, in which althea has been cooked, linseed seeds; and dyaquilon ointment, which has been made liquid with some oil; and wrap it with linen cloth, and treat it with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	 The treasure of your cure is that you strive with all your skill, so that it does not become consolidated again, in its original form first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	 And indeed this operation that I have said is nothing but a correction of Alxatratus, so that the form of the place does not return to what it was entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	 Chapter on the care of Alxatratus that is performed in the lower eyelid, and it is a swelling or contraction upward to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIII.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	 This Alxatratus that occurs below is what is truly called Alxatratus.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	 It is natural and it is accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	 And the accidental Alxatratus is made from a wound, or a split, or cautery, and similar things.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	 The method of operation in it is that you take a sharp probe with a double thread, and stain it in the flesh, and make it penetrate from the left tear duct to the right tear duct until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	 Then extend the flesh upwards with the probe and cut it with a broad spatula.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	 If therefore the form of the eyelid returns as it should be, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	 And if not, take radish, and place it in the fissure, and turn it with it the eyelid; and make two fissures in the interior side of the eyelid, and let their ends be from two angles of the incision, until they converge and form an angle: until when they are gathered together, let the figure be this figure, and it is the Greek letter Lambda.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	 Then remove that flesh to the extent of its sharp lower part, from what follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	 Then gather the separated parts; or join it with a thread of wool.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them with that which I said, with softening medicines and linen, until they heal.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	 If Al-Zaturat occurs from the fissure or suture, or cautery: then it is necessary to make a flat incision below the eyelashes, according to what has preceded.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	 Then separate between two lips with linen, as I said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	 The summary of the treatment for Al-Zaturat, whether it is above or below, is that the operation should be carried out on it, according to the preparation of the Al-Zaturat's form.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	 For indeed it is of many varieties in its shape: and the skilled artisan prepares his skill with whatever means is possible for him, until he returns the figure to its natural form or close to it, and himself the sick person, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in many different positions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	 Chapter on the adherence of the eyelid with conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	 Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	 Sometimes this consolidation occurs in many people, so that the upper eyelid adheres to the whites of the eye and prevents it from performing its natural functions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you introduce the extremity of the radius beneath the eyelid, and lift it up: or extend it with a hook: then cut the adhesion with a subtle spatula, which should not be with the sharpness of spatula incisions, but rather blunt slightly: so as not to disturb the weak during the operation, and remove the spatula, and injure the eye with its sharpness: and let your incision be as if you are scraping off that adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and the adhesion heals completely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	 Pour salty water into the eye, while washing it: or distill onto it from seive made, with dissolved zinc mixed with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	 Then separate between eyelid and eye with a linen cloth: and place warm wool soaked in egg white over the eye: and for three days use zinc, and with ointments, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	 [Chapter] On Incision of the Nail and Protrusion of Skin of Tear Ducts.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	 Know that the nail is according to two modes.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	 Or it is nerve-like: and it is like a horn, subtle.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	 Or it is not nerve-like, similar to the hardness of frozen milk, which when touched with iron, or attempted to be taken with a hook, is cut off, and the hook does not stick to it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	 And neither of these types start, unless from the greater tear duct, up to where it gradually penetrates, until it covers the vision, and prevents light, and movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the method of operation in its incision is: that you place the head of the weak in your armpit.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	 Then open the eyes of his, and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	 Then gather the nail with a few-fold hook and stretch it upwards.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	 Then take the awl and insert a hair from a horse, ox or sheep into it; let it be a thread and slightly double the tip of the awl and fix it in the middle of the nail; pierce with the awl and tie the nail with the thread and stretch it upwards. Scrape off the side of the nail that follows the pupil, as if you were pulling it with the hair until the end of its root.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	 Then cut the remainder at the root of the lacrimal duct with a fine spatula or small forceps; and let the natural tissue of the lacrimal gland remain, so that no constant flow of tears results from the incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	 And sometimes the nail is extended with a hook alone; or with thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	 Then scrape it with a soft spatula, which has this shape:
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	 Be careful not to touch the spatula on the horny layer and cause a break there, and pierce the pupil.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 After the incision, throw into the eye something of ground salt or made from cinnabar and leave it until another day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	 Then care for the eye as necessary until it heals.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	 If the nail is not nerve-rich and you cannot insert the awl into it or the hook does not take hold there, then this type of nail is repeatedly treated with medicines until it heals as I have said in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	 If you wish to cut it, then open the eye of the sick person and take a soft, fine, delicate spatula of low hardness in this shape:
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	 And scrape the nail from above with fineness.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	 If you see that it becomes hard and crumbles and presses the nail with the scraper, then pour from your hour into the eye from cinnabar made from zinc or red cinnabar or ground salt; and close the eye until another day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 Then repeat the operation until the entire thing is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	 If a warm abscess is not present in the eye, then leave it alone and take care of the abscess until it heals.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the operation on it with reason, until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	 A protrusion of flesh from the lacrimal duct, if it causes great harm to the eye, is suspended with a hook and cut out from there; do not make a deep cut so that the flow of tears is not interrupted.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	 Then let blood from the lacrimal sac or ruby-red wine, or use silver nitrate, until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	 Chapter on Alguardenic's Incision and the flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	 There sometimes arises in the eyes of humans a red flesh composed or laid over, which covers the pupil, approaches it, or presses on the eyelids and possibly turns the eyelids outwards; it resembles a rosebud on a pillar.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And the operation in it is also to place the sick head in your armpit.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	 Then open his eyes and gather all that flesh together with appropriate forceps; and hold it with a single pair of forceps or tweezers.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	 Then cut the flesh first, to finish everything with a knife (or lancet).
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	 And be careful not to cut the eye itself during the operation; and let your incision be where you are cutting, or with a lancet as we have mentioned in the chapter on toe amputation, or with small forceps, such as those used for probing an abscess, according to its form after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	 When your incision is complete and all the alguardenic (pus) has been removed, then fill the eye with a solution of ground salt or distill red powder and similar medicines from corrosive substances; and place on top of the eye outside a piece of cotton with white fat of an egg, to protect it from hot inflammation.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	 If there remains some pus and you are dominated by hot blood and fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye alone, and treat the same with what calms an abscess.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	 Then repeat the operation over him until he is healed.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	 And likewise do with the flesh that occurs around the eye of this type.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	 However, it is necessary that any weak eye from natural or accidental causes be treated without iron, and you should not insert your hand into any of these operations until you see that the limb can endure this treatment.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	 Chapter on draining an abscess from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	 Abscesses are red veins that surround the eye and prevent visual function; they weaken the eye with the passage of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	 It is necessary for you first to consider whether the eye where the Sebel (cataract) is present, is strong and there is no other illness except the cataract. Then collect the cataract from it.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	 And it is to command the weak (patient), that he puts his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	 Then hang those veins with one or two needles according to your judgement. And let the needle be fine of double-thread thickness, or there should be two needles graduated within one body according to this shape.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	 Then collect those veins with fine forceps and cautiously, remove the blood by the hour, until you see the veins removed from the eye and dissolved; and be careful not to harm the eye with the points of the forceps.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	 And let your procedure be at midday before the sun, and be very firm in your procedure; so that you do not cut except those veins.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	 And when you have finished (the procedure), then distill into the eye, either green or red; so that with its own acidity it burns what remains of the cataract.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	 If it is not possible for you to collect it all in that hour, then apply a plaster to the eye with what alleviates the pain of the eye; and leave it for some days until the pain subsides; and secure it with warm compresses; afterwards repeat over it according to the same method until it heals.
Et haec est forma forficis.	 And this is the shape of the forceps.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	 Chapter on reducing Arissa (nasal polyps) to the nose.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	 The physician named Arisate treats a Fistula, which he cares for with a cautery or with a sharp medicine burning, as his narrative precedes.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	 If it is not cured, then there is no skill in it; except that you should open above the abscess at its birth, and extract all the moisture that is in it and the pus, until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	 When the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackness in it, then grind it with this tool, whose shape is as follows.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	 And it is called an Asperi capitis (Aspergillus capitis).
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	 Make it from iron indo, and let its head be round like an azir (a type of abrasive stone), which is punctured with a file or with the subtle point of aliskilfer (another type of abrasive stone): and place it over the corrupted bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	 Then turn it with your fingers, and press your hand a little, until you know that the corruption is already ground down; and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	 Then restore the place with most powerful healing balms.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	 If the place consolidates and flesh grows there, and a flow of pus is cut off; and it remains for 40 days without being renewed, without developing an abscess, and no accident happens in it; then you will know that it is cured.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	 If not, then there is no skill in it, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril opening, according to this shape.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	 And it is to expose the bone of the second bone (presumably a toe) with iron or with sharp medicine; and when the bone is exposed, then take the trephine according to this shape, its end should be iron, triangular: and the wood of it should be pyramid-shaped, extended to the end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	 Then place it on the very same skin: and let it be near the tear-duct: and stretch out your hand slightly from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	 Then turn your hand with the lancet until it penetrates the bone, and feel it weaken: through this you will know that air is escaping from it, when he holds his hand over his nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	 Therefore, then restore the place with medicines drying, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	 When the flesh grows and hardens, then the matter which was flowing out goes back to the nose; therefore it is lighter over the sick place.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	 [Chapter Title: Reducing protrusion of the Eye.]
Caput XX.	 Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	 When the eye protrudes completely and there is no visual harm or reduction, then it is necessary to dissolve the weakened part. Then apply leeches [phlebotomes] to it. After that, place warm fumigations on the neck without scarification but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	 Then apply a poultice made from acacia, aloe, frankincense [olibanum], and colophony [sarcocollyra] on the eye.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	 Then bind the eye above with a plaster containing many small beetles [pulvillas].
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	 The method of the beetles is: take soft cloths many, and fold all the cloths over four; make many [of them]; then place one on top of another according to the quantity that the eye needs; then bind them tightly with a strong bandage.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	 And repeat the fumigations without scarification but with suction.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	 Then remove the fumigations and let the eye be bound day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	 If the binding becomes soft again, then it is necessary to bind it tightly; then remove the binding after a day and night as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	 If therefore you see the eye already returned to its sheath, it is good: and if not, then repeat the ointment, leeches, tightening bandage, and fumigations until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	 Chapter on the Incision of the Sheath.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	 When there is a rupture of the sheath of the eye, then it protrudes and comes out beyond the eyelids like a grain of sand, and it fouls up the human form due to this, and one wishes to cut it: at that time, an operation should be performed on it, as I have said; and it is to insert the needle into the root of the eye from the bottom to the top.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	 Then insert another needle with a double thread from the tear duct side, and make it penetrate; and release the first needle according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	 Then cut the place of the double thread, and tie a piece of it around the eye with the needle; and tighten it strongly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	 Then remove the needle, and place wool soaked in oil over the eye on the white part: and leave it until the thread falls with the eye.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then care for the eye with what strengthens it, until the wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	 And sometimes the eye is tightened from all sides with a circle made of cloth, until the eye protrudes greatly.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	 Then it is pierced with a fine cannula that reaches deep into the eye, and moistens the white part; and the eye sinks down, and enters immediately; then tighten it until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	 Chapter on the Treatment of Conjunctivitis.
Caput XXII.	 Chapter XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	 This malady called Alcomnati is nothing but pus gathered in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	 The method of operation in this case is to make the patient sit on a prepared seat or straight chair.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	 Then take his head with both your hands and move it until you see the pus descend to the lower part of the eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	 Then make it stop and do not let it descend, and the vision shall be cleared; and let the patient see as he did before: and if it does not descend to the lower part, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	 If, however, there is no descent of pus as mentioned above, then make the patient sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	 Then take a sharp probe and puncture it above the corneal membrane a little near the junction with the cornea in the corona (rim) until pus comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When the pus comes out, then pour warm water mixed with honey into the eye, or warm water in which you have already boiled fenugreek and honey; afterwards treat it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	 Treatment for water that descends into the eye or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	 Chapter XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	 We have already said the type of water in division, and which is suitable for perforation in discussion and explaining; then take it according to its health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then you must make the patient sit between your hands facing the light, near the sun; and bind the healthy eye and compress it strongly; then with your right hand close the eyelid of the eye in which there is water, or with your left hand if the eye is on the right side.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	 Then take your right hand (if the eye is in the left), or your left hand (if the eye is in the right).
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	 Then place the forceps called almagdah near the corona (cornea) by the thickness of a radius within the white part of the eye that appears as the lesser lachrymal; then push the almagdah with force, and you will turn your hand with it until it penetrates into the white part of the eye, and you will feel that the almagdah has already reached the empty space.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	 The measurement of the journey of the almagdah to depth should be the measurement of the space from the pupil up until the end of the blackness; and that is the cornea of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	 You will see it (the almagdah) within the pupil vision of the eye, because of the clarity of the cornea membrane.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	 Then place the forceps called almagdah up to the place where there is water (in the anterior chamber).
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	 Then press it (the almagdah) downward with a slight push after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	 If the water then descends immediately, then the patient sees what is before him immediately, and the forceps in his eye (the almagdah).
Deinde quiescas paululum.	 Then wait for a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	 If the water descends, then remove it (the forceps) after it has come out of the almagdah.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	 When it is fixed and does not rise again: then remove the forceps with ease; and you turn your hand slowly.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	 Then dissolve something from salt in clear water (saline solution) and wash the eye inside with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	 Then place a pad of wool soaked in rose oil or linen over the white part of the eye and tie it to the healthy eye.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	 We, as well as those who are in our time, place camphor powder over him with the white part of the eye.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	 If the forceps called almagdah does not obey you to enter the eye due to its hardness because it is a human eye that is very hard; then it is necessary for you to take spatulia called Alberid, whose shape is as follows:
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	 Perforate [the abscess] only with the same [incision], and do not insert your finger into the hole: it is only to make a way to a subtle place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	 Then insert the probe, as we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	 Furthermore, for the completion of your work, prepare a well-made bed for the sick person, in which he may sleep on his back in a dark room; and let him be kept from all movement, and from coughing; and let food be given to him that soothes his nature; and let him not move his head to either side at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	 And let the binding be according to its placement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	 Then loosen that [the bandage] in the dark room and test his sight; and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	 Then bind it again until the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	 It is not necessary that he perform it at the hour of treatment, or immediately after the incision; on the contrary, it should be left to others, because water rises quickly through a heated opening.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	 If however an abscess becomes hot: then it is necessary to loosen the eye before the seventh day; and straighten that which soothes the abscess, until it is soothed; then without his sight, and place a device for regulating his vision over his face, for several days, while he remains in the dark room.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	 Then he should leave the house gradually and change into his clothes.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	 And know that a student is not excused from watching [the operation] on several occasions; then he will dare to perform [the operation].
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	 And now one of those from Alayrach has arrived, who said that the phlebotomy in Alayrach has been perforated, through which water flows.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	 Therefore, I have not seen anyone in your land who has done that; nor have I read it in any of the ancient books. It is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	 These are forms of species from Magda, to stand over her who does not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	 Let them be made of brass; and let their ends have the same subtle triangular shape, and sharp ends.
Formae magda.	 Forms of Magda.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	 Chapter on care of the newborn flesh in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIV.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	 Whenever newborn flesh of various kinds grows in the nose, some of which resembles a scorpion with many feet; and from this is the cancerous meat, stony, dark brown in color; and from this is that which is tender, not dark brown.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	 Therefore, regarding that tender flesh which is not fraudulent or cancerous, it is necessary for the weak person to sit opposite your hands on the ground; and open his nostrils, and thrust the hook into those fleshes; then pull them towards the outside, and cut what you have caught with a fine, sharp spatula from one side, until you know that all of the flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	 If something remains of that from whose removal is not possible; then shave it with a subtle tool with ease until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	 If blood dominates over you, or a hot abscess occurs; then apply to it what is necessary: or if it is from malignant abscesses, then run towards cauterizing him until the blood is separated, and all fleshes are removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	 Then pour vinegar, water or wine into the nose after the incision.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	 If the nose opens and moisture comes out until it reaches the palate; then you will know that he is already healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	 If the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that within it is flesh born in the upper bones of the nose, which did not reach with the cutting instrument.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	 Then it is necessary that you insert a thread of flax with some thickness and knots in it; and place between each knot an amount equal to a finger or less; and bind the weak one, so that he sends out one end of the thread into the nose with a probe, or with whatever is possible for him after he has made it similar to a syringe; and draw out the odor, until it reaches the cavity, and exit onto the throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	 And indeed many times do the boys in school perform this like Atomus; and it is an easy matter for him who wants to.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	 Then place the two ends of the thread, one end which exits on the nose, and the other which remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	 Then as a servant, you tie up the flesh with the knots that are in the thread.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	 Do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	 Then extract the thread; and place linen inside the nose after bloodletting, which you have soaked in Egyptian ointment; do this for three days or more, until the ointment has eaten away all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 Then place a lead pipe at the end into the nose for some days until it heals.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	 If, however, it requires drying treatment, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	 For the purge to be made with olive oil and other medicines poured into the nose, make it of silver or copper; that it be similar to a small lamp, open like a shell; and its channel likewise.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	 And if you wish to make a closed pipe, as with a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	 And prepare the instrument for caputpurgery, let it be filled, exposed: to which belongs a handle at its end, with which you hold it, when you heat oil or what you wish from suction and flowing things in it.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	 This is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	 Paragraph on the treatment of the nose.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter XXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	 Many times a Thelul is born at the end of the nose, and it grows and increases with days until its appearance becomes disgusting.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	 And therefore, when it appears at the beginning, it is necessary to cut it off completely.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	 Then place upon its place either a cautery, or a burning medicine that stays in its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	 If the cutting is delayed until it grows and becomes large, then consider whether it is made of stone, hard, dark in color, with few senses: then do not touch it with iron because it is a cancerous ulcer.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	 For many times I have seen that one has cut an apoma and evil has happened to him who possessed it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	 And if the apoma is soft, not dark in color, and you see that cutting can be possible throughout it, then evacuate the weakened part, and cut it without fear or worry: and care for the place with it which drains and contracts until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	 Paragraph on the suture of the nose, lip, and ear.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter XXVI.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	 Know that when discontinuity of a one of these cartilages occurs, little help is provided by the operation except in certain people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore, when something happens to anyone from it, consider whether it is a recent wound with blood flowing from it: and then apply two bandages to the wound with suture: then care for it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	 If the continuity of the solution has already been separated and each part is healthy, then it is necessary to scrape off all parts appearing from the skin until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then gather together the two lips with sutures and bind them, and sprinkle draconian powder over the bleeding dragon's blood, and finely powdered olibanum: and place above the powders a piece of emplastrum diafinicon, and any other consolidated plaster: and leave it bound for two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	 Then dissolve it, and change the medicine: and leave it until the threads separate on their own.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with an ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	 The method of stitching is to gather together the solution of continuity, or with needles, as we have described in the suturing of the abdomen: or gather together the solution with thread, as I have taught you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	 Chapter on the Extraction of Lumps on the Lips.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter XXVII.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	 Many people indeed have hard nodules similar to grains of grass appearing on the inner parts of their lips; some of them smaller, and some larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	 Therefore, it is necessary to turn the lip over, and make an incision over every node of it, and hang it with a hook, and cut it off from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 Then fill the place after the incision with zega finely powdered, until the blood separates.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	 Then wash it with vinegar and treat the place where there is a stoppage until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	 Chapter on the Incision of Born Flesh on the Gums.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter XXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	 Often flesh grows on the gums which is called abuluss by the ancients.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	 Therefore, it is necessary to hang it with a hook or hold it with forceps and cut it off near its root, and allow the pus or blood to flow out.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	 Then place over the place [that is] crushed, or other astringent powders, drying ones.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	 If the flesh returns after treatment, for it often returns, then cut [it] again and cauterize it; for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	 Chapter on Tooth Extraction with Iron.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	 When [teeth] collect on the surfaces of Teeth from within and without, and between rough gums, rotten, and sometimes turn yellow or greenish until corruption reaches the gum, and teeth become foul because of this.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands and put his head in your lap, and file the root and tooth where the gums appear to you, and grind it until there remains nothing of them; similarly for blackness, greenishness, yellowishness, and others, until they are cleaned.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	 If what is in them [teeth] is removed at the beginning of the filing, that is good; and if not, then repeat the filing on them on another day, the second, and the third, until finally the purpose is reached in what you wish.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	 And know that a tooth requires rasors of various shapes and figures; according to what is prepared for your operation, because the rasp used to file the tooth from below is another than the rasp used to file between teeth, according to other shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	 And these shapes of rasps should be prepared by you, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	 Chapter on Extracting Tooth Pain.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter XXX.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	 It is necessary to heal the Tooth from its pain with all skill, and proceed slowly in extracting it.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	 For it is not that another substance can replace [the tooth] when it is extracted; because it is a lofty substance; until there is no excuse for extracting it, then if the sick person must extract it, it should be firmly held and assured by you that the painful tooth will be extracted.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	 Many times pain deceives the sick person and makes him think that it is in a tooth called Saha and removes it; then the pain does not subside until the diseased tooth is removed.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	 We have already seen this from the operation of phlebotomists.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	 When the tooth itself is certified as painful with you, then it is necessary that you incise around the tooth with a spatula, in which there is something of virtue, until the gums are loosened from all sides; then move it with your fingers, or with delicate forceps first of all gently, until you shake it.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	 Then place large forceps in the location on it and hold the head of the diseased tooth between your knees; what you have firmly grasped, so that it does not move; then pull out the tooth straight away, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	 If it does not come out, then take one of those instruments and insert it beneath it from all sides with ease, and try to move it as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	 If the tooth is perforated or eroded, then it is necessary that you fill the hole with cloth; and tighten it with the end of a small radius so that it does not break during your compression with forceps on top of it.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	 And it is necessary that you make a careful incision around the gums from all sides.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	 And maintain your strength so that you do not break it and leave a piece of it to return over the diseased tooth with the greater pain that was first present.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	 And be careful not to do what ignorant phlebotomists do in haste and the overconfidence of their own removal, exceeding what we have mentioned.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	 Many times they cause great ailments to occur in people, whose difficulties it is more difficult for them to be broken and all roots remain, or some of them; or to pull it out with some bones of the jaw, as we have often witnessed this.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	 Then, it is to be softened after excision (of the tumor) with wine, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	 If there is bleeding from the place (for it often happens), then rub something made of pomegranate peel and fill the place with it; and if you do not have this, cauterize it yourself without the pomegranate peel.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	 The handles of the delicate forceps, which move the tooth, should be long at the ends and short at the gripping part, thick so that they do not split when pressed against the tooth; they should resemble the handles of large forceps, until you are squeezing with them and they do not bite themselves or split; the ends of the handles should be sharp, made of steel or well-made iron, directed at an angle; and there should be teeth in their ends, some of which enter into some and tighten by a suitable constriction, strong.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	 And at times the ends are shaped like the beak of an eagle's mouth, which is called a ciconia, and they are strong in constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	 Chapter on the Extraction of Teeth and Removal of Fractured Jaw Bones.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	 When some part remains in the extraction of a tooth that breaks off, then it should be placed on the spot with warm cow butter for one or two days until the place softens; then introduce into it the algasti or forceps whose ends are shaped like the beak of an eagle's mouth called ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	 The form (of the forceps) is as follows:
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	 The ends should be made in the shape of a file or like an aliskilfe.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	 If the tooth does not come out with these forceps, then you must cauterize on the root and strip the flesh completely and introduce an instrument called the small palanca whose form is as follows:
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	 The end should be short and somewhat thick: and it should not be filled, so as not to break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	 If the root comes out through that, it is good: and if not, it needs to be helped with these other instruments whose shapes are such.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	 The shape of the first triangle's end has a certain thickness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	 The shape of the triangle's end is delicate.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	 It is also helped with this instrument having two branches, which has this form.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	 And with other instruments and tools that have come before for the reason of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	 It is also helped with this instrument resembling a large hook, having the shape of a triangular twisted end, which has some thickness, so as not to break, and it should not be filled.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	 And know that there are many instruments for teeth: and similarly the remaining instruments are not counted, and the skilled craftsman, subtle in his art, finds for himself an instrument according to what the operation and the illness themselves signify.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	 Since there are illnesses for which the ancients did not make an instrument due to the diversity of their forms.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	 If the bone is broken from the jaw or from other bones of the face, or it rots: then examine it at its place with that which suits it among the instruments and pliers I mentioned for extraction of roots, and help it whose shape is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	 Let there be some thickness gradually, so that the bone can be pulled or held with it and does not run away and move, until the bone comes out: and restore the place with appropriate medications for that.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If there is minor rottenness in the bone, then scrape it from its rottenness, and treat it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	 About locking of protruding teeth over others.
Caput XXXII.	 Head XXXII.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	 When teeth emerge not according to their natural course, the appearance becomes foul; and particularly when this happens in women and girls, namely in those who are in menstruation.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore it is necessary that you consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 If a tooth is born after another tooth and does not settle or can be closed, nor can it be filed itself; then uproot it; and if it is attached with another tooth, then cut it with this instrument, of which this is the form.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	 It resembles a small beak, and is made of iron point, having an extremely sharp tip.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	 And let your cut be such that you cut it on many days, and because of the hardness of the tooth, and so as not to disturb another tooth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	 If it is protruding exposed for filing; then file it with a rasp from iron, of which this is the form.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	 Let it be made of iron, and its handle small, with many sharp points like a rasp with which teeth are filed; with which you grind the tooth gradually on many days with ease, so as not to disturb another tooth, and let it fall; then smooth it gently, and finally sand it down with some rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	 If it is a tooth that breaks off and injures the tongue; then it must be filed even more so until the roughness of the fracture is removed and it is made smooth; and it shall not injure the tongue nor corrupt speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	 Chapter on the filing of teeth with gold threads.
Caput XXXIII.	 Head XXXIII.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	 When the anterior teeth are shaken and dislocated by blow or accident; and a weak person cannot hold down what he eats so that it does not fall out; and you have treated them with medicinal adhesives, but the treatment has not been effective; then they should be sewn with gold thread; because silver becomes corroded and putrefies after days; but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	 And let there be a thread of middle fineness and thickness according to its quantity that can pass between Teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	 The form of the rete is such that you take a thread and pass it through the gaps between two healthy teeth; then you weave with both ends of the thread the movable teeth, whether one or more, until you reach with the needle to the healthy tooth on the other side.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	 Then repeat the weaving until you reach the part from which you started; and hold your hand with subtlety and wisdom until it is not removed completely; let your constriction be at the roots of the teeth so that it does not come out.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	 Then cut the excessive ends of the thread with scissors; and bind both together and turn them towards each other; and hide the bound ones between the healthy tooth and the movable tooth, so as not to hurt the tongue; then release it when it is sufficiently tight.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	 If it loosens or breaks, bind it with another thread, and it will remain thus for the entire time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	 And this is the form of teeth, and the figure of the rete of two healthy teeth, and two movable teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	 And sometimes it happens that a tooth or two return to their places after a loss, and remain as we have said, and this does not happen unless the skillful and experienced artisan does it.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	 And sometimes a tooth from the bones of a cow is shaped; and it is placed in the place where the tooth is guarded and tightened, as we said; and it remains and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	 [Chapter] On the incision of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XLIII.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	 When this ligament that occurs under the tongue is natural, it is born with a man; or it happens accidentally, from a healed wound.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	 The operation on him is that you open the sick man's skull in your hollow, and elevate his tongue; then cut through the nerve-ligament across its width, until the tongue is released from its hold.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	 If there is something hard and knotted in him, and it is due to consolidation of the wound; then strike with a hook on it, and bore through it across its width until you cut the ligament, and the knot is released.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 And beware, lest there be a cleft in deep flesh, and you cut an artery there, and there be a flow of blood.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	 Then it is scraped in the wound-track with rosewater, or with vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	 Then place a flax cloth beneath the tongue, which the sick man holds all night; so that it does not consolidate again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	 If however there is a flow of blood, then place over the place zege tritum (perhaps meant to be zege tribitum, meaning crushed or powdered zege).
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 But if the blood holds you back, then cauterize the place with a lentiginous cautery, which is suitable for it; then care for him with the rest of the cure until he is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	 Chapter on the extraction of ranula beneath the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	 Sometimes there occurs an aposteme beneath the tongue resembling a small frog, hindering the tongue from its natural function; and perhaps it swells so much that it fills the bone.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	 The operation on him is that you open the sick man's jaw facing the sun, and examine the aposteme.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	 If you see it black or dark colored, hard and insensitive: then do not touch it, because it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	 And if it is hollowed out towards whiteness where there is moisture, then throw in the hook and cut into it with a fine chisel, and release it from all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	 If your blood is confined by it during your operation, then place on top of it a piece of zecha ground, until the blood is released; then return to your operation until you extract it along with its entirety.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then wash it with vinegar and salt, and take care of it according to the appropriate treatment until it is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	 Chapter on the treatment of two tumors (amygdala).
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter 36:
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	 Whenever there occur swellings in the throat resembling goiters (thyroid), namely glands that appear outside: and they are called the two amygdalae: when treated with what we have said regarding division, and they do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	 If it is a hard aposteme of dark color with few senses, do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	 And if it is of red color and the root is thick: then do not touch it even with iron, fearing blood flow, indeed let it be, until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	 Then either pierce it (the swelling) or it will burst on its own.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	 And if it is of white color and round and the root is subtle: then it should be cut (incised).
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	 And the operation on it is to consider before the operation if the aposteme has been quiet for a long time and has grown smaller by some diminution: then let the sick person sit facing the sun, and hold his head in your lap: and open his mouth, and have a servant take hold of his lower jaw with one hand, and press down on his tongue with an instrument whose shape is as follows.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	 Let it be made of silver or brass that is thin like a knife (cultellus).
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	 When you press the tongue with it (the instrument), and the aposteme is revealed to you, and falls upon it through your sight: then take a hook, and pierce it in the amygdala, and pull it out as far as possible towards the outside, taking along with it something from the tunics.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	 Then cut it (the amygdala) with an instrument whose shape is as follows.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	 It resembles pincers: but its extremities are curved, so that each of them has an acute orifice facing the other, ensuring that it is made of iron (indium) or brass coated with alum.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If however this instrument is not present, then cut it with a lancet, whose form is as follows.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	 It is pointed at one end and not pointed at the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	 And after you have cut one almond, cut the other according to the same shape of the incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	 Then, after the incision, let the sick person gargle with cold water or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 If there is bleeding, let him gargle with water in which the rinds of pomegranates have been boiled or the leaves of myrtle and similar ones from poplar trees until the bleeding stops; then take care of him until he recovers.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	 And sometimes boils other than the two almonds appear in the throat.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	 Therefore, cut them as I said in the incision of the two almonds equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	 I myself have been cured of a woman who had a boil that was born in her throat which drew towards the swelling, with a few senses, which had almost closed her throat; and the woman breathed from a narrow opening, and already forbidden her eating, and drinking water; and it had come close to death if it remained one day or two.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	 The boil had risen so much that it had expelled two branches until they came out through the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	 I therefore ran quickly and inserted a hook into one of them.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	 Then I pulled it out, and a large piece came out with it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	 Then I cut off the piece where it was grasped from the nostril.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	 Then I made that which came out from the other nostril.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	 Then I opened his mouth, and pressed his tongue; and afterwards inserted a hook into the boil; then cut off a piece of it, and no more came out except a little blood; so the woman's throat was cleared, and she began to drink water immediately, then she started eating.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	 I did not cease to cut from that ulcer many times in a long period of time: and the ulcer followed the place which I was cutting until it became too extended and with that [the thing] itself.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	 I have cauterized the ulcer between the throat.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	 Therefore, it stood still after [the operation]: then I walked on that side, and I did not know what God did with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	 Chapter on the incision of a mouth ulcer.
Caput XXXVII.	 Chapter XXXVII.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	 When catarrh descends to the mouth and it ulcerates and is long: then it is called perpendicular; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a boil.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	 When it is cured along with what I have said in the division, and treatment does not help: and you see that the ulcer is warm and has stopped, and is soft: then it should be cut.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	 And that which is gathered round it and is not long, and is red or dark colored or black, and has no sensation: then it should be cut out.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	 For there is fear for the weak [patient] in it.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	 Therefore, when you see it according to the way I have said from its whiteness and its length, you should make the weak [person] sit before the sun: and press his tongue with the instrument that was previously mentioned: then fasten a hook in the mouth, and pull it downwards: and cut it with one of two instruments that were mentioned in the incision of two molars.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	 And it should not be cut from it, unless what is added goes beyond the natural limit without additional [factors].
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	 For if you cut from it more, you will harm the voice and speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	 Then after the incision, use what was said in the incision of two molars: and treat it until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	 If the patient is afraid of incision: then it is necessary to use skill in cauterizing him without fear and dread.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	 The method of cauterization is not other than with sharp water: and it is to place the head of the patient in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	 Then press his tongue with the instrument as we said.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	 Then take water as I said in the chapter on cauterization and make a not-extinguished lime, do not make it thick nor thin, fill its concavity with this instrument which has this shape.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	 Let the end of it where the medicine is placed be concave, as concave as the cochlea of a radius.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	 Place the instrument with the medicine upon the ulcer itself: and let the patient lie down on his side, so that saliva from his mouth runs out of his inner medicine, and something does not fall from it into his throat and harm him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	 Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	 And you from above apply it on the ulcer for a first time with the quantity of half an hour until you see it already blackened and quieted by the bite of the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	 And if you wish to take a hot iron and roll it over the end of the radius, pour the iron with medicine into the socket above, and insert the radius with the heated iron into the pipe from above until it sticks to the ulcer.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	 Do this several times until you achieve what you desire from the cauterization of the ulcer.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	 Then let it be: for indeed it burns and falls off after three or four days.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	 If you need to repeat the medicine, repeat it: and after cauterization wipe the area around the ulcer with a hot iron dipped in butter, and clean the area around it with what remains from the medicine: and let it be washed with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	 And it shall be treated from without with cupping glasses, and from within with gargles, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	 This kind of treatment is more healthful than cutting and farther away from fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	 And sometimes the ulcer is also treated with something more subtle than cautery and cutting; it is treated with fumigation in this manner.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	 Take calaminthe, hyssop, origanum, rutus, thyme, chamomile, abrotanum and similar herbs: and mix them all together, or some of them in a pot, and submerge them with vinegar, and boil; and the pot should be well coated with clay; and there should be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave instrument is placed in this manner.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	 Make it of silver or brass; and insert the end, where there is a grain, into the mouth of the sick person, until the vapor rises to the ulcer through the tube, until the ulcer is filled with a great deal of smoke.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	 Then repeat this several times, until it burns.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	 And beware, do not perform this treatment at the beginning of an abscess.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	 For in most cases, pus is added to an abscess; and it should not be done unless near the decline of the heat of that abscess.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	 If this instrument is not present to you, then take a reed, and prepare the bark of an ox at its end; so that the bone of the sick person is not burned; because the bark of an ox prevents steam from burning the bone; and this is one of the good treatments with safety.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	 Chapter on the extraction of thorns and bones from the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	 Chapter XXXVIII.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	 Often a bone or a fish spine adheres to the throat, or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you extract what appears on it upon which sight falls, after pressing the tongue with an instrument in the sunlight, and it becomes clear to you that it is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	 What is not apparent to you and hidden in the throat, it is necessary that you make it vomit before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	 Perhaps therefore it will come out the attached thing through vomiting.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	 Or the sick one swallows a piece of nap or radish root, or a mouthful of dry bread; or takes a piece of soft dried sea sponge and ties it up; then he swallows it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	 When therefore it reaches the place where there are thorns or bone, and it is extracted, then it comes out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	 If therefore it does not come out as we have said: then use an instrument made of lead in this shape.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	 Let it be thicker than a finger, but have a rounded tip at its end, which he introduces into the throat easily; and let it have its head raised upward.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	 And let him beware of touching his epiglottis, so that he does not cough, and push with it bone or thorn, or the physician introduces it with his hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	 But what the sick one introduces, that is better: because of his knowledge of the place where the attached thing is located; and he pushes it downward or pulls his hand with the instrument upward, all of it according to its quantity which is prepared for him, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	 [Section on Extraction of Leeches]
Caput XXXIX.	 Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	 When the leech is treated with what I have said in the section on cure with medicines, and it does not work, then consider if in the throat of the sick person, before or after exposure to sunlight, when you press his tongue with the instrument that I told you about.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	 If your vision falls upon the leech, remove it with a small hook or with thin forceps properly.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	 If it is not possible with those (instruments): then take a concave cannula and insert it into the sick person's throat up to his neck; then insert hot iron into the concavity of the cannula.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	 Do this often, and let the sick person abstain from water all day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	 Then let him take a vessel filled with cold water, and open his mouth in it; and rinse his mouth with it, but do not swallow anything from it; and move the water with his hand for an hour after an hour.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	 For the leech immediately lets go when it feels water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	 If it does not come out with what I have said, then fumigate the sick person with bedbugs or with camphor with the instrument that I told you about in fumigating the throat.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	 Do this often, for it will let go by itself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	 The method of fumigation is that you take a pot, in which there are live prunes with fire; and the pot should be covered with a lid, in the middle of which there is an opening; and the end of the instrument should be placed in that opening.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	 Then throw the fumigation and let the sick person place his mouth at the end of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation does not escape before you know that the fumigation has reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	 For the leech will immediately let go.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	 If it does not fall (the tumor), then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	 The sick man will bear thirst, eat salt and other foods, but drink no water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	 Therefore it is necessary for him to go out (leave the house) with this regime.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	 This is the shape of the instrument with which a leech is drawn from the throat, when it falls upon the eye.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	 It is like forceps, as you can see, except that this hook which goes into the throat is curved.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	 And its end resembles the mouth of a bird called stork, which has roughness like a file; when it captures something, it does not let it go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	 Chapter on opening abscesses and their section, and care in general.
Caput XL.	 Chapter XL (Fortieth chapter).
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	 The species of abscesses are many, according to the remembrance (description) of each one, that is to say, there is one for one in this book; and they differ in their perforation, and cutting open (section) from two kinds.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	 One of them is of the species of an abscess within itself, and because it encompasses moistness.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	 The second method is due to places where it occurs from the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	 Since an abscess occurring on the head is another than an abscess occurring in the anus; and an abscess occurring in a fleshy place is another than an abscess occurring in joints: and each of them has its own judgment through operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	 And from abscesses there are those that should not be punctured unless after the maturation of pus in them, and its completion; and from these there are those that should be punctured while raw, and do not mature according to their completion.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	 As abscesses which are near joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	 Since when an abscess occurs near a joint and prolongs itself until it becomes rotten what is around its circumference perhaps corrupts the ligaments or the nerve of that joint; therefore it is the cause of closer contraction of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	 Or it is an abscess near the main member; because if you delay puncturing it until it matures, it will harm either the one himself or through the main member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	 Or it is near the anus, so puncture it immature; and it is not necessary to puncture a raw abscess, not completed digestion, unless it is near the anus, so that it does not rot deeply, and prolong towards the inner parts of the anus, and become a fistula, or it will be in its end which will not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	 It is necessary that you know the hour of puncturing an abscess, which has matured according to its completion; and it is in sedation of pain, retreat of fever, and reduction of redness, and pulsation, and acuity of head of the abscess; and the remaining signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	 And it is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower part of the abscess, and of more prominent protrusion: and let the perforation be directed in the length of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of hands and feet, and places of arms, and tendons, and nerves, and arteries, and finally in all places where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	 In those which are reflected, proceed with the perforation according to that limb.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	 If however the abscess is in fleshy places: then it is better to defer the perforation of it until its digestion has been confirmed, as we said in the supplement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	 Because if you perforate it before that, the course of the virus from it is prolonged, and there are many filths and foulnesses, and perhaps its edges harden and its depth increases.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	 And some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the body due to necessity, or according to that part which the limb requires.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	 And it is necessary to administer a small perforation for small abscesses, and a large one for large abscesses; or many incisions in proportion to the size of the abscess.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	 And among abscesses there are some in which the skin must be concave: and it is cut when it has become like a cloth, and it has reached the end that is already dead; such as happens with many, as in buboes.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	 And among them there are some which are to be cut by a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	 And from this one is cut like the figure of the myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	 Like an inguinal abscess.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	 And among them there are some in which a round incision or crescent-shaped incision is administered, and ones similar to these from the incisions.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	 That which does not have a head, such as suppurating superficial ulcers, should be pierced with a shallow penetration or only superficially.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	 When an abscess is large and has collected much pus, it should be pierced so that it does not spread and all the pus is removed at once: rather, remove a portion of it from it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	 Then, open an abscess until the next day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	 Then remove some more pus.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	 Do this repeatedly according to degree, until it comes out: particularly if the patient is weak in strength, or a woman pregnant, or a small child, or an old person decrepit: for animal spirit often dissolves with the release of pus; and perhaps the weak one will die, and you will not receive payment.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	 Be careful, therefore, to take great precautions in this chapter.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	 After your piercing, which you perform on these abscesses, it is necessary to clean the wound and think about it.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	 If the wound of the abscess is small or a plain incision, then administer linen strips or an old bandage.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	 If the abscess is large and there are many openings of the piercing, then insert linen into each opening until they meet.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	 If you have removed part of the skin from an abscess or hollowed it out, then it is necessary to fill it with old bandage, or as when a cloth is sewn, or shorn with linen wool without wetness; and bind it for three days.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then expel it, and take care of it with what is necessary from ointment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	 If there is bleeding during your operation hour, then administer cold water and vinegar, after which a cloth is soaked; and place it on the site of bleeding many times.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	 If the bleeding persists, then it is necessary to administer treatment, care, and powders, as I have described in many places of this book, and by division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	 If it is winter time and the place of the abscess involves many nerves: then it is necessary to pour hot poultices with wine and oil onto those areas.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	 And if it is summer and the areas are fleshy: then it is necessary to place hot poultices that have been soaked in water, oil, or wine and oil, and let everything get cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	 Until the third day, as we have said, then it is necessary to open and clean the abscess, and administer treatment suitable for its healing until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	 Therefore, this is what is generally required for the knowledge of treating abscesses.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	 According to the method of division, I have already said about every kind of abscess, how it is the pathway for its treatment one by one.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	 Chapter on cutting abscesses that occur on the skin of the head.
Caput XLI.	 Chapter XL.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Pustules small, resembling nodules, occur on the skin of the head, and are contained by the tunics that resemble pouches, as if they were swollen like a hen's glands.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	 And their types are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	 Some of them are fatty: some contain a similar moisture to clay: and some contain a similar moisture to ointment and poultices: and those resembling, and some are hard like stone.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	 And in the cutting of all [of them], and their removal, there is no fear, as long as it does not create opposition to an artery during its cutting.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	 The operation in their cutting is that you try it with the instrument whose shape comes later, which is called Introductus, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	 For if it contains moisture, then cut it along its length with a surface incision in this manner.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	 Begin with an incision along the line b to line g. When the moisture is evacuated, then excise the cyst that contains this moisture, and do not leave anything inside it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	 For many times it returns if something remains in it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Then immerse the wound in Egyptian ointment if it is present; and if not, in water and salt; fill the wound with it, and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	 For that which remains from the cyst will corrode itself.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	 Then again repeat over the wound with the second Egyptian ointment, and the third, if necessary; until you are confident that nothing remains from the cyst, then care for the wound with ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	 If the pustule contains a fat nodule: then cut it according to this shape, having the form of a cross; and throw out the uncinis between the two openings of the incision, and excise it from all sides; and strive for your strength in the extraction of the tunica that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	 If however an artery opposes you, then do what I shall tell you afterwards.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	 And similarly [do the same] in an abscess, if it is stone-like, through cutting and treatment as we have said before.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	 The cutting of a stone-like abscess is easier: since it contains little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	 And sometimes there are such abscesses [in the head] of certain men, without deep moisture.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	 This is what it means: because I have cut over an abscess on the head of an old woman, and I found the abscess to be like a solid and hard stone, rough and white, which could not be broken: and if someone struck it with something, he would wound himself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	 However, in other abscess cases on the head, except for these abscesses which occur on the heads of children and at the roots of ears, the cutting [of them] should be a surface cut.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	 Or place a perforation in them always from their lower part, to divert the flow of pus downwards.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	 Then treat it with what is suitable for its cure.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	 Chapter on cutting of the Straphules (glands) in the neck.
Caput XLII.	 Chapter XLIX.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	 These abscesses often occur in the neck and under the armpits and groins: and sometimes they occur in the rest of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	 And on those which occur in the neck, there is one [type], and many: and they are generated from one another: and every Straphule from them is within its own layer, like in the knots and abscesses of the head, as we have said before.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	 And the types of these Straphules are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	 For from them there are stone-like ones: and from them there are those which contain moisture: and from them there are malicious ones, which do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	 In that which you see good arrangement in touch, whose color is evidently close to the skin's and moves throughout all parts, and is not attached with the neck nerves, nor with the tendon, nor with an artery, nor deep: it must be separated by a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body along line b to line g. And scrape off its entire surface with a knife, or with multiple knives if needed, as we said regarding tumors of the head, and extract it gradually.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	 And it is advisable not to cut vein or nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	 Let the forceps not be very sharp, so that it does not injure your hand with the incision or disturb the sick one, and cut what is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	 If you cut vein or artery, it prevents you from operation, then place in the wound sieve crushed or certain powders that dissolve blood, and tie up the wound, and let it be until the sharpness of the tumor subsides and the wound becomes soft or begins to rot.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	 For the blood is dissolved by tuncica (linen) Redi then to your operation until you finish.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	 Then ask with your index finger if anything remains of the Strophulus (a small stone) or similar small ones. If so, cut and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	 If it is in the root of the Strophulus a large vein: then it must not be cut from its root, but rather tie it with a strong double thread and let it fall by itself without harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	 Then fill the wound with an old cloth that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	 Then take care of it (the patient).
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	 If the Strophulus is completely cut off, then gather the edges of the wound and sew it immediately when you see that there remains no unnecessary excess.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	 If you see that there remains superfluousness due to the size of the Suture, then it is necessary to stretch towards cutting its root and pulling it out: and administer the suture as we said.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	 And that which contains the humidities of the Suture, perforate it with a superficial perforation: so that its maturity appears to you: and place the perforation from what follows below the body, as we said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	 Then administer after the perforation linen with ointment, and similar things, so that what remains from corruption corrodes, until when you see the wound already clean: then care for it with ointment of healing flesh, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	 [Title: Surgery on the Epiglottis due to an ulcer within the throat.]
Caput XLIII.	 Chapter XLIII.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	 The ancients said this surgery on the Epiglottis, and I did not see anyone in our land who has done it: and this is their writing.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	 In those who have a synanchia [a condition where the epiglottis is fixed to the base of the tongue], it is necessary to avoid surgery on the Epiglottis: since no benefit comes from this, because all the veins and lung are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	 But in those who have a hot ulcer in the mouth, or throat, or both tonsils, when there is no sickness in the channel, it is necessary to use surgery on the Epiglottis, to avoid destruction which occurs from strangulation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	 Therefore, when we want to cut the Epiglottis, it is necessary to cut under three or four rings of the Epiglottis, with a small section in width, where it is between two rings in depth, which is the cut in cartilage, not in bone: and this place is suitable for cutting, since it is devoid of flesh, and the vessels of blood are distant.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	 If the surgeon is afraid, then it is necessary that he should spread the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	 Then let him find the skin until he reaches the channel: if he sees anything from it, he should stop the blood vessel.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	 Then cut what I have mentioned (the channel): it is indicated that from the mucus which comes out of it and with what is torn apart, and with cutting off the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	 And leave an open wound for some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	 When the danger of suffocation is removed, join together two lips of the wound skin, and sew only the skin without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	 Then administer medicines which make flesh grow, until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	 Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	 This is the summary of the conversation I have told, the explanation is not given unless when they see that one of these abscesses of the throat of the sick has burst open: and the sick person is raised up near death and wants to be cut open to breathe: they go to cut the Epiglottis so that the sick person may breathe over the place of the wound with a certain breathing, and thus be saved from death: and for this reason they commanded to leave the wound open, until the malignancy of the illness is consumed, and the malignancy is this for three days, and as it were itself: then therefore they commanded to sew up the wound, and to take care of it, until it heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	 And this that I have seen myself is that a maidservant took a knife and sent it into her throat, and cut a part of the trachea of the lungs.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	 And I was called to care for her, and found her moaning, as is the moan of the dead.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	 So I opened up the wound, and found blood which had come out from the wound to be small.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	 The wound had not drained pus, nor did it suppurate; and the wind issued forth from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	 I became anxious over my own wound and treated it until it healed; nothing happened to the servant except a coughing fit when speaking; and she returned after several days to her usual condition.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	 From this I say: there is no fear in cutting the Epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	 Chapter on the sectioning of a hernia in the throat.
Caput XLIIII.	 Chapter XLIV.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	 This protrusion called a hernia of the throat is a large abscess, resembling the body's color; and it occurs much in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	 It is of two types: either it is natural or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	 In the case of a natural one, there is no congenital defect.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	 An accidental one is also of two types: one of which resembles fatty knots.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	 And the other type, is similar to an abscess caused by a node in an artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	 There is fear associated with it, and it should not be presumed to be cut with iron unless it is small; examine it yourself and probe it with a sharp instrument.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	 If you find it resembling a fatty knot and is not suspended by any veins; then cut it, just as knots are cut; and extract it along with what contains it from the cyst, if it is in a cyst; and if not, then thoroughly examine the entire area.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the place where it was with what is required for treatment until it heals.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	 Chapter on cutting across nodes.
Caput XLV.	 Chapter XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	 There are many types of nodes, and I have already mentioned all their kinds in the division; it is necessary that here I explain the difference between a node and an exitus, when there is confusion.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	 I say therefore, when the heat departs, and the fever, and the strong pains, until the effervescence of superfluity subsides, and the rotting is completed: then indeed the fever and the heat cease.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	 When indeed the heat is not present, nor the fever, nor the pains, and they are confined by a bag known as kistis, which is their proper container, and it is according to the color of the body; it begins like a chickpea, and it becomes like bataga, and both major and minor.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	 And they are of two kinds: either fatty: or containing moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	 And the colors of moisture are many, according to what I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 Therefore, when you arrive at the treatment of the Node, it is necessary to try it out and examine it with the tool called Introscope, according to its form as it will come in the chapter that follows this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	 And the method of examining abscesses and all nodes is to take this tool and insert it into the more moist place that you find in the abscess; then move your fingers slowly with it until you know that the tool has already pierced the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	 Then, lay your last hand according to the measure of the size of the abscess.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	 Then, remove the Introscope, and observe what comes out with it.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	 If therefore the running moisture comes out, whatever its color may be: then cut it with a surface incision, according to what I said in the other abscesses.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	 And if the moisture does not come out in the footprint of the Introscope, then you will know that it is fatty; cut it with a surface incision having the shape of a cross, according to this form, as I have taught you; and suspend it with hooks, and scrape the skin from all sides with ease; and keep the kistis over it if you can so that you may extract it along with the node while it is still healthy.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	 If a cyst bursts during an operation and it cannot be safely extracted whole, as often happens, then extract it piecemeal until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	 If something remains of it, whether little or much, a node (inflammation) will return more often than not.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 If it (the inflammation) conquers you and leaves something remaining: then fill the wound during your treatment with some corrosive, sharp powders; tie up the wound; place upon it a warm poultice of an abscess and care for it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	 If the node (inflammation) is large, then make two flaps of its skin and care for it along with that which becomes solidified.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	 If it (the node) is pulsating or non-pulsating artery, then rush and fill the place with powdered vinegar and leave it tied up for two or three days until the wound begins to rot and the boiling of blood subsides; then return to cut what remains from the node.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	 Chapter on external instruments for cutting and puncturing.
Caput XLVI.	 Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	 These (instruments) have shapes of probes, and there are three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	 Among them is the large one, among them is the medium-sized one, and among them is the small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	 Make them from iron with squared ends well-centered so that they may enter quickly into an abscess.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	 And these (probes) are the shapes of experienced ones, and those which pierce or penetrate; one of them is called beris (piercer), and they are three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	 From these are great, middle, and small [ones].
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	 They join together to be incised for abscesses, wounds, fistulas, and buboes from what is between the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	 And others are round, smooth, and flexible, like the large needles that chairs have, made of citron, or brass, or iron, or silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	 Those that are better are the ones made from citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	 And also (ones) are made of black lead, which join together to test fistulas, whose concave part reflects with their flexibility, so that they reflect with the smoothness of those reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	 They are again of three kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	 Because there are long ones, medium ones, and short ones, according to the size of the fistula and its narrowness.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	 The form (of forceps) is of the shape of a pair of scissors, and it has many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	 Because there are simple ones, that is, those with one curvature: and they have three kinds as you see, large, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	 And (there are) blind forceps: and they have three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	 And there are forceps with two curvatures: and they have three kinds; and from these there are forceps with three curvatures, and they have three kinds; and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	 And these are the forms of scalpels, with which knots and abscesses are cut and scraped: and they have three kinds; because there are large, middle, and small [ones].
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	 The ends where the cutting is made are sharp, the other ends are not sharp; they are not placed thus except to provide help in scraping knots near fear of incision of vein or nerve: and that the weak may be healed through them, and may find a little relief from burning which he finds during the scraping of abscesses.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	 These are Magnesia, and they are species of three.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	 They are made of air and resemble Radix (root) from which alcohol is made; at its tip there is a hidden point called Spathulum (spatula), which penetrates to the inner and outer parts as desired, just as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	 The shape of spatulae hidden among the fingers for incision of abscesses; these are not perceived by the weak; they come in three species: large, medium and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	 The forms of ventosa (sponge) with which blood flow is cut off; they come in three species: large, medium and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	 Make them of air or citron wood, round, shorter than what you see, delicate.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	 It is necessary that the forms of ventosa are large and small in your possession so that when required you may quickly cut off blood with them and when medicine is not available to you.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	 However, do not use them for cutting blood in every part of the body, and do not use them except in fleshy parts such as arms, legs, hips, shoulders, breasts, abdomen, groin, and similar areas, from fleshy parts that are wet.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes they are made into small instruments resembling the core of a fist, according to their shape, which are used for cutting blood when it flows from the place of phlebotomy or incision of vein or artery; and sometimes they are round in this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	 Chapter on care for human breasts resembling those of women.
Caput XLVII.	 Chapter XLVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	 Whenever the nipples of some men swell during sleep (that is, when they begin to dream), until they resemble those of women; and remain corrupt.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	 Whoever avoids that (swollen nipples during sleep), it is necessary to cut them with a crescent-shaped incision, according to this shape from the line b to the line g. Then scrape off all the grease.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	 Then fill the wound with a medicated ointment.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then gather together two folds of the wound with suture, and care for it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	 If the nipple turns downwards and softens due to its size, as happens with women: then it should be cut into two upper sections, similar in shape to a crescent, each of which is contained by the other at their ends so that the larger line contains the smaller one, according to this shape from the line b to the line g. Then scrape off the skin that is between the folds, remove the grease, and administer what I said about sutures and powders, which is necessary for treatment, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	 If you do not complete the incision that is required of you to cut it (the swollen nipple), either due to the restlessness of the sick person or due to bleeding: then fill the wound with a plaster soaked in a corrosive ointment, and let it be, until it corrodes what remains from the grease.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	 Chapter on the Perforation of an Abscess, which occurs under the breast.
Caput XLVIII.	 Chapter 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	 These abscesses that occur under the breast are of the types of calluses that contain cysts, and those that contain liquids.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 Whatever are among those that contain moistures should be scented with a lunar section, according to this form, from line b to line g. When everything that is in the boil is evacuated by pus, then fill it with an old linen cloth and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then remove the linen cloth, and treat it with a suitable ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	 If the boil is of the kind like knots (Strophules), then cut over it, as we have said in the section on Strophules equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	 If however the wound extends so that it discharges pus, then administer cautery to it, as we have said in what has been mentioned before.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	 Chapter on the incision of boils due to artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	 Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	 When an artery bursts and the skin that is above it hardens, a boil often occurs on it; and similarly, a boil and swelling occur in a vein.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	 And the signs by which it is known that a boil and swelling are due to an artery or vein are as follows: for when a boil is due to an artery, it is long and aggregated in the depth of the body; and when you press the boil with your fingers, it feels like a grating sensation.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	 And that which is due to a vein is round on the surface of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	 And an incision on this boil is a mistake, and especially when it is under the armpits, groins, neck, and in many parts of the body; and it is very great.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	 Therefore, its treatment with an iron (i.e., cautery) should be avoided; and what is also present in the limbs or head, it should be avoided.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	 Cut open the skin incision lengthwise to find that which comes from the swelling of the opening of an Artery.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	 Then open the incision with scissors, afterwards the Artery; and free it from the tunics until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then insert a probe under it and make it penetrate to the other side; and tie the Artery with doubled thread at two places, according to what I taught you about the extraction of two Arteries that are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	 Then pierce the place between the two ligaments with a lancet until all the blood that is there comes out; and the abscess is dissolved.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then administer treatment that generates pus until the ligaments fall off; then care for it with appropriate ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	 If there is an abscess due to a vein incision, then it is necessary that you hold with your hand what is possible from the abscess along with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	 Then insert a lancet under the place that you hold with your hand and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread in it until you draw it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	 Then tie the abscess with a good suture; according to what I told you about the suture of the vein, from two parts with two ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	 If you are afraid that the thread will be drawn out, then insert another lancet with a different thread under the entire abscess near the incision; press, and tie your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	 Then cut the abscess in half through the middle until what is inside comes out; then cut off the excessive skin and let go of that which is tied to it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	 Then place a poultice made of wine and oil on top of the boil that you have immersed.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then administer treatment consisting of liniments and ointments until it is healed.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	 On the amputation that occurs from a twisting of the nerves.
Caput L.	 Chapter L.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	 As it happens with an aposteme in Artery and Vein, similarly it happens with an aposteme in Nerves: what happens to them by striking, or happens from excessive labor, and similar things: and it most often occurs in places more assisted, or at the heel, and in every place where joints are moved: and the aposteme is severe.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	 Its color resembles that of the rest of the body, and it is found in various dispositions without pain: and when it is pressed with force, one feels weak, similar to a state of numbness.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	 And the aposteme is not gathered deep within the body, but it is under the skin, and it moves to every part: it does not reach forward, nor backward, neither towards the front nor the back.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	 What is on joints from them should not be invaded with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	 Perhaps it may happen that contraction occurs.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	 However, what is from them on the head or forehead, pierce the skin with a lancet.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	 If it is a small aposteme, then hold it with forceps and remove it from its root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 And if it is large, then bind it with a ligator, and scab it: then remove it, and close the wound with stitches: care for it until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	 [Title] On the cutting of an aposteme that occurs in the abdomen.
Caput LI.	 Chapter LXI.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	 These grow frequently in the bellies of some men, and in the remaining bodies of them, 'Fungalia', which are called by likeness to mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	 Their root is subtle, and their head is thick, and the lips of them are turned around.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	 It has a small part from it, and there is something from it that is greatly enlarged.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	 And I myself have seen a man, and in his belly were two 'Fungalia', which resembled mushrooms more than other things: there was no difference between them, they were white and had small roots, the lips of them turned around, and they were swollen, and moisture flowed from them constantly.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	 I cut them, and one weighed approximately X and VIII ounces, and the other approximately VI ounces. The operation in cutting them is to consider then if he who is sick is weak and humid, and the 'Fungalia' are white, moist, and subtle roots: then cut it with a broad spatula, and have cautionery iron in your presence.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	 For many times blood is expelled at the cutting of it: therefore beware if blood conquers you, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 If you see one who is sick, fearful and timid about the cutting with iron, then take a well-made wire from lead, and tie it with that 'athelul': its method is as we have said, and release it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	 Then add (a substance) to the lead seal.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	 Therefore do not cease tying the lead wire whenever it presses on 'Fungalia', until it is cut off and falls by itself without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	 If 'Fungalia' is large at its root, then there is some fear and terror in the cutting of it: especially because it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	 It is possible to cut through its middle.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	 Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then treat it until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	 And beware not to cut what is of a dark purple color, few senses, foul appearance; for it is a cancerous apostema, and I will come again with the reminder of Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	 Chapter on the treatment of umbilical hernia.
Caput LII.	 Chapter LII (102 in modern numbering).
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	 An umbilical hernia occurs for various reasons.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	 Or from fissures that are above the abdomen, from which comes out either the althub (small worm) or intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	 Or from blood that flows from the vein, or from the artery, according to what was mentioned earlier.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	 Or from constipation that has been blocked there.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	 If it is due to a fissure of the sifac (anterior abdominal wall) and outflow of pus: then its color resembles that of an apostema; it is loose, without pain; and the position appears diverse.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	 If it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its position is more violently diverse with what we have stated.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	 When you press it with your fingers, it is hidden; then it returns, and possibly there is a sound; and it swells greatly at the opening of the bath, and the pain is severe.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	 But if it is due to moisture, it is soft; then it does not hide when you press it with your hand, nor does it contract, nor does it swell.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	 If it is due to blood, then with these signs an abscess appears dark red from the heel.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	 But if it is due to fleshy matter, then the abscess is heavy, large, hard, and pierces through by a certain quantity.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	 If it is due to windiness, then when touched, it is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	 And the operation in this case is to consider if the protrusion of the navel is due to bleeding from an artery, vein, or windiness; then it is necessary to prohibit treatment of it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	 For there is fear and terror, as I have taught you in the chapter where I said abscesses due to an artery or vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	 If the protrusion of the navel is due to the intestine or tumor; then you must command the sick person to hold his breath and stand extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	 Then mark with a cautery around the entire navel.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	 Then command him to lie on his back between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	 Then circle around with a broad spatula around the navel over the place which you marked with the cautery.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	 Then extend the middle of the abscess to above, with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	 Then bind him around firmly with thread or with a silk cord: and let the knot of the bandage be tied in an alenxotate manner.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	 Then open up the extended middle part (of the abscess) above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	 If you find (it) already caught by the ligament: then extract the alenxotati, and insert your finger into it, and push intestine towards the inner part of the belly; and if you find a stone, then take it with a hook, and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	 If however, an artery or vein is against (it): then bind it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	 Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	 And take two needles and insert strong threads into them; and insert the needles into the stitches you made around the abscess in the shape of a cross, which you make penetrate (them).
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	 Then stitch the abscess in four places around the needles; and if you wish, remove the needles and leave room for the rotten flesh to extend; and let it fall by itself; or cut it when it becomes soft and rots.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of (it) with what is necessary from ointments until it heals.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	 If the protrusion of the umbilicus is from raw flesh or moisture on it, then you must hollow out the abscess as we said before.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	 And remove blood or moisture that you find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	 Then take care of (it) to close the place.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	 Chapter on cancer care.
Caput LIII.	 Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	 We have said about the species of Cancer (cancer) in division, and how its treatment is with medicines; it must be cautioned against it during its treatment with iron, so as not to ulcerate it. We have also said that Cancer is generated in the matrix (womb), and a cauterization should be avoided in its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	 The ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated; such as cancer which is in the breast or hip and similar parts, from detachable limbs; particularly when it is starting small.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	 But when it grows old (advanced) and becomes large, it should not be approached.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	 For I could not heal anyone from that; nor have I seen anyone else before me who has succeeded in treating it (the advanced cancer).
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	 And the operation on it, when it is placed as we said, is to go before (excise), and to release a weak one from black choler several times.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	 Then, if you find phlebotomy (bloodletting) in it with obvious fullness.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	 Then prepare the weak one with a preparation, in which it is located during the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	 Then cast hooks into Cancer (cancer) that match it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	 Then hollow out the whole thing from every part with skin (layer), according to examination, until there remains nothing of its roots; and let blood run, and do not cut it quickly, rather press the places, and remove all coarse blood with your hand or as possible there with instruments.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 But if a flow of coarse blood from the incision of an artery or vein opposes you; then cauterize the vein until the blood is cut off.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with the remaining treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	 Chapter on Hydrophysis (hydrocele).
Caput LIIII.	 Head LIV.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	 We have now spoken about the types of Hydropsis and how water collects; and the signs of all its types, and their treatment with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	 That which is cured with iron is only the type of ascites alone; it does not approach iron in the case of tympanitis; neither deeply in the case of hypoascarcia, for that is fatal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	 When you have already been treated with this kind of Hydropsis due to tympanitis with medications, and the treatment has not helped, then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	 For if weakness has already come upon the sick person, or there is another illness in addition to Hydropsis, such as cough, or loose stools, and similar ones; then beware not to treat him with iron, for it is dangerous.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	 If however you see the sick person overflowing with strength, and there is no other illness in addition to Hydropsis alone; and if he is not a child nor an old man; then the method of operation for him is as follows: you should raise the weak person who stands before your hands, and afterwards let another press his abdomen by hand, pushing water down towards the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	 Then take a pointed lancet.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	 Let it have two sharp points, long, and with an acute tip like a lancet.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	 However, it should have something short about it, so as not to penetrate through it during the operation up to the intestine and injure it.
Deinde considera.	 Then think about this.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	 For if the hydropsis is due to the intestines, then you must make an incision of three fingers' length from the navel downwards, along its upper part above the chest.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	 If however the hydropsis is due to liver disease, then your incision should be three fingers' length on the left side from the navel.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	 And if its generation is due to the spleen, then let the section be in the right side: and it is not necessary even that it should be a section on the side over which the sick person wishes to lie, so that superfluities do not run to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	 Perforate the entire skin with the instrument.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	 Then insert your hand into that incision and dissect it with the spatula between the skin and the underlying tissue, as if you are excoriating it; let the quantity that is excoriated be equal to a fingernail or approximately so.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	 Then perforate the underlying tissue until the spatula reaches an empty place; and that is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	 Then remove it (the spleen) and insert an instrument into the opening, whose form is this: (Here follows a diagram or description of the instrument.)
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	 It is similar to a cannula: it is made of silver, copper or brass, cleaned; at the lower part of it there is a small hole; and on its sides there are three holes, two from one side and one from the other; and the end of it is cut in the manner of an incision like that of a reed, as you see; on the upper end of it is a strap.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	 For when the instrument reaches water, then it (the spleen) immediately descends upon the instrument; therefore evacuate from the water a quantity of about half an hour.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	 Because if you evacuate more than is necessary from it, perhaps the sick person dies through resolution of his animal spirit; or he gets a syncope approaching death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	 But evacuate from it according to its virtue and according to what the signs of the sick person's condition indicate to you from the force of his pulse and the quality of his complexion.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	 Then remove the instrument and retain the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	 This is because it (the water) is immediately retained due to the skin which keeps the hole that is on the underlying tissue; about which I said that you should perforate it in this way.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	 Then repeat the instrument on the second day, if you see that the patient can endure it; and extract also a small amount from water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	 Carry out that procedure for some days without fear, and be careful to avoid error; until there remains in the water only a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	 If you fear for the patient and let a large amount of liquid remain; then take care of him with hot sand, much sweating in the bath and sun, and let him fast; and take care of him with strong medicines, until he is cured; and cauterize over the stomach, liver, and spleen, after the extraction of water; as I told you in what went before.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	 Treatment for infants born in places where their urinary tracts have not been perforated.
Caput LV.	 Chapter LV.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	 When a child is born from the womb of its mother, and its head is not pierced, or there is a narrow opening, or it is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	 Therefore, it is necessary to help with the piercing of it immediately when it is born, with a sharp spatula very much, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then place a fine nail made of lead into the opening and tie it; hold it for three or four days.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	 When it desires to release urine, let it be removed, and mix it.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	 Then bring it back.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	 And if you do not place lead, it is now possible that the urine flowing over the place does not allow it to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	 But if its opening is narrow, it is cured with lead as we said, for many days, until it is widened.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	 Those in whom the opening is not in its proper place are harmed.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	 Because the opening is at the end of the spine of the one who is born, therefore it cannot mix towards the front until it raises the spine with its hand to the upper part.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	 It is not generation for it, because the seed cannot reach the mother in the correct way; and it is a very foul disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	 And the method of operation in that one is to turn the sick one onto its back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	 Then extend the spine of its head with your left hand and cut the head of the spine from the place of priapus, with a sharp knife or pointed spatula; as it is the cutting of a reed, or like rooting something, so that the medium comes out similar to the head of the spine, and for the hole falls in the middle as necessary.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	 And be careful during your operation not to have bleeding.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 Often does that happen.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Oppose it with it when it cuts blood, and take care of the wound until it heals.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	 § On Albather that occurs in the foreskin and head of the penis, as well as rotting, blackening, and adhering.
Caput LVI.	 Head LVI. (In a list or table of contents)
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	 Often occur these Albathers in the penis, and it is a prominent flesh foulness.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	 And from this, one is malignant, and another is not malignant.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	 Do not allow the non-malignant one to hang with a fine hook and cut it off until you clean it completely.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	 Then place on it a pot immersed in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it itself after that with dyafinicon ointment until it heals.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	 If Albather is malignant and of a foul color, then administer cautery after its incision and removal.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	 If, however, the Albather is within the foreskin and has not been circumcised, and part of it is inside the foreskin and part outside, then you should remove the Albather that is inside first, until it hardens, and then care for it externally; because when you treat it, the foreskin will not heal unless it breaks.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	 And now they also occur in the testicles, and blackening and rotting of the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	 Therefore, you should excavate all that has become blackened, and what is about to rot or has already rotted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	 Then place linen on it after that with honey that has been shaken with flour from a nutmeg and sieved herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	 If, however, bleeding occurs, then administer cautery with lunar cautery in this manner. (The text describes a procedure using a specific tool called "cauterium lunare".)
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	 The cautery is useful for two purposes at once, namely for blood flow and a wound when it is corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	 If the head of the rod (clyster) is corroded and destroyed within an hour, then it is necessary to introduce a cannula made of lead into the penis, so that the weak one mixes with it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	 In the case of adhesion of the foreskin with the head of the rod (clyster), and this adhesion does not occur unless in one whose foreskin is healthy and circumcision is not required for it: at times, adhesion occurs due to a wound or an abscess. Therefore, it is necessary to remove the adhesion with a Spatumili chisel (a tool used in surgery) until the ligament is released and the head of the rod is freed from all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	 If it is difficult to distinguish that adhesion (between the foreskin and head of the rod), then it is necessary to remove some from the head of the rod and some from the foreskin.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	 Since the foreskin is delicate, it may be easily perforated due to its delicacy.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	 Then separate the foreskin from the head of the rod with a fine linen cloth that has been soaked in cold water to prevent them from sticking together again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	 Then it is cured with wine of staghorn (a type of resin) until it solidifies.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	 Chapter on the cleansing of infants and treatment due to their mistake.
Caput LVII.	 Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	 Circumcision is not a solution for continuity, like other wounds; however, since it comes from our operation, with our will, and its use is specifically for boys, it is necessary to mark the operation as better and leading to a lighter way towards health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	 I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books; since they do not use it in their laws and it is only because we have acquired it through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	 I have found a greater number of artisans and phlebotomists to use disinfection, circumcising with scissors, and with forceps: they employ cauterization, suture with thread, and incision with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	 I have now proven all these methods, and found no better disinfection with forceps, or suture with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	 Since the skin often slips away during circumcision with scissors.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	 Since the skin of the prepuce has two layers: perhaps the upper layer is cut, and the lower one exposed: it is therefore necessary to make another incision, and pain will result.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	 And with the disinfection performed by cauterization (digital), which is used by tailors [for sewing], the tip of the masculine member is not severed: since it may enter its opening.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	 However, in the disinfection with a nail, perhaps iron will enter [the wound], and ruin your operation: indeed, the skin of a child is naturally short, and often it does not require disinfection; I have already seen that.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	 The experiment of disinfection with forceps and suture with thread revealed itself good to me: since forceps are proportionate to the incision: therefore, the sharpness at the top is like the sharpness at the bottom.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	 When you press your hand, the two sharp points correspond, and they incise simultaneously according to one operation in a single moment: and a compression of similar shape is formed, containing the skin like a cord from all sides, with which no error occurs at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	 And the method of your operation is, to let a child, especially if he understands somewhat, to perform it himself, except that you tie thread on his own member only: and leave him until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	 Then make him rejoice and be happy in every possible way for you, from the fact that he receives his understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	 Then make him stand before your prepared stance, and let him not be sitting: and hidden scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that the boy sees them not at all, nor anything from the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	 Then insert your hand into his member, and blow on its skin, and pull it upwards, until the head of the member comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	 Then cleanse it from that which accumulates in it as dirt.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	 Then tie the marked place with double thread.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	 Then tie below that a little ligature again.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	 Then hold it with your index finger and thumb, and keep the place of the lower ligature well in retention, and cut between two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	 Then peel off the skin upwards quickly, and extract the head of the member.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then let the blood flow slowly (it is better), and put powder on top: and over the powder a cloth in which a roast lamb's fat has been beaten with fresh good olive oil: and let it lie on that until another day: and take care of it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	 The form of the scissors for cleansing is as follows.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	 Let there be two sharp points at the ends, and let them converge so that the nail does not come out between them: and let the length of the two sharp points be equal to the length of two hands equally.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	 But error occurring in cleansing is as follows: since perhaps the inner skin may completely escape, or part of it near the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you stretch it out from your own hour with your nail before the incision of the place: and cut it evenly.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	 If you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a tweezers, and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	 If it extends beyond three days and there remains what is under the navel inflated, it is an abscess: then let that be, until the abscess settles down warm, and scrape off that abscess easily, and cut it according to how it prepares for you; be careful not to touch the head of the vein.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	 It will not harm him that.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	 Therefore treat that wound with it as it consolidates the wound with powders, which we have described in the treatment of powders; and if it is cut through the skin beyond measure and penetrates to the upper part, it will not harm him even that.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 Therefore treat that until it heals.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	 Chapter on the extraction of a retained worm in the bladder.
Caput LVIII.	 Chapter LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	 Retention of urine in the bladder occurs from obstruction made by stone, frozen blood, pus, flesh born, and similar things from those which we have said in the treatment methods in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	 And if the urine is not resolved, and you see that its retention is due to a stone already in the neck of the bladder: then it is necessary that he be weakened on his knees bent.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	 Then place his feet on his back, and he shall stretch out his abdomen from the upper part of his back, and contract his breath as much as possible for him.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	 Therefore with the neck of the bladder is compelled towards expulsion of the stone, why the urine is discharged.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	 If it is not resolved with what we have said, and the force is upon the weak: then it is necessary to administer extraction of it with an instrument called syringe, whose form is as follows: It is made of silver, and is subtle, soft, concave like a feather cannula in fineness of radius, long like the palm of one and a half, and wide: which has a subtle cannula at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	 The method of extracting a worm is as follows: take a doubled thread and tie at its end a good ligature: insert the end of the thread into the lower part of the syringe; and cut with scissors if there is any surplus from the wool, but forcefully insert it into the cannula, like alder.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	 Then anoint the syringe with oil, or with butter, and alum of wool; and make the patient sit on a chair, and apply warmth to the bladder, and the herb with moist oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	 Then introduce the syringe into the herb gently until it reaches the root of the herb.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	 Then fold it over twice above the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	 Then push the syringe into it until it reaches the bladder, and let the patient feel that it has reached an empty space: and this is not done according to this order unless because there is a twist in the channel through which it goes.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	 Then slowly extend the thread with wool.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	 For the worm will follow the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	 Then draw it out and let the worm run through the urinary way; and repeat the syringe, and do not cease to do so until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	 Section on clepsydra for the quality of clysterization of the bladder.
Caput LIX.	 Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	 When a wound occurs in the bladder, or blood congeals there, or pus is constricted within it and water and medications are desired to be distilled into it: then let it be done with an instrument called Clepshydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	 It is deaf, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	 And there are three openings in it, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	 And the concave part where what drives it is located should be proportional to the quantity that fills it without addition, until when something is pulled with it, it is attracted from humidities; and when it is driven, along with it something is expelled far away: this is how a clepshydra works, which shoots naphtha, that is, Greek fire in the war of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	 Therefore, when the desire is to expel humidities into the bladder, insert the end of the clepshydra into the humidity and pull what drives it upwards; for the humidity is drawn into the hollow of the clepshydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	 Then insert its end into a rod, as we have told in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	 Then push the humidity with what drives it; for that humidity immediately reaches the bladder, so that it feels weak.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	 The shape of a subtle enema, with which to enema the bladder.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	 Make it from silver or gold; whose head is higher like a small pitcher and under it there should be a cavity in which the cord can fall.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	 Then take the bladder of a ram and put the humidity into it, with which to enema the bladder.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	 Then tie her between two cavities with a strong cord using double thread; and heat the humidity a little over fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	 Then insert the end of the clyster in a cannula, afterwards press your hand on the bladder with a suitable amount of moisture for the ligature, until the weak one feels that the moisture has reached the bladder.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	 If the bladder is not present for you, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle out of it, and pierce it from all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	 Then insert a thread into those holes as they are rolled up.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	 Then gather the circle as it is gathered with wax: when you put in it what you wish from waters, oils, and water.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	 Then tie it up in the instrument: and make with it as you did with the bladder by squeezing it with your hand until the moisture reaches the bladder.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	 [Paragraph on Extraction of a Stone.]
Caput LX.	 Chapter LX.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	 We have said in the division of the species of the Stone and its treatment with medicines, and I have told the difference between a stone generated in kidneys, and bladder, and the signs of its entirety: and I have told the operation on the Stone that is done with the hand or section: and this Stone is specifically generated in the bladder: and it which is formed on the string: and I am telling this with a clear explanation and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	 Therefore, I say that the Stone generated in the bladder most often happens to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	 And among its signs is that urine comes out from the bladder like water in its subtlety: and it appears in it white sand, and the weak one scratches his stick, and labors with it, and it often hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	 Then it is erected, and it comes out with it when many of them do so.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	 And the healing of boys is easy up until they reach fourteen years of age.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	It is difficult in the elderly.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	 It is medium [difficulty] in the young, because it is between that [condition] and its stone is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, the treatment is reversed [to be more difficult].
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	 When we approach the cure [of a condition], first it is necessary that we clean the patient with an enema, which extracts all the feces that are in his intestines; because sometimes it forbids the discovery of the Stone during examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	 Then the patient is taken with his feet and shaken and moved towards lower parts; in order that the Stone descends to the depth of the bladder or comes out several times from a high place.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	 Then make him sit between your hands, and his hands should be under his buttocks; in order that the bladder becomes entirely hollowed towards lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	 Then examine [him] and touch him from outside.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	 If therefore you feel the Stone in a space, then approach immediately with cutting upon it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	 If it does not fall with your touch at all, then it is necessary that you remove the index finger with oil of the left hand if the patient is a child; or the middle finger if the patient is a grown man; and insert it into his anus and examine for the Stone, until it is under your finger; and turn it gradually towards the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	 Then press upon it with your finger, and push it towards the outside against the place where you want to make the incision; and command the assistant to press on the bladder with his hand, and command another assistant to extend the testicles of the right hand upwards; and with the other hand remove the skin which is below the testicles in the part near the place where the incision will be made.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	 Then introduce a pointed probe [or instrument], whose shape is as follows:
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	 Find in him what is between the anus and the testicles, not in the middle, to the side of the left: and let the cut be above the stone, and your finger in the anus: and make the incision transverse, so that the incision is broad externally and narrow internally, according to the amount such that the exit of the stone from it is not greater.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	 Perhaps the finger, which is in the anus, compresses the stone at the incision and comes out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	 And know that from the stone are its angles and edges, therefore the exit of it is difficult because of this.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	 And from it is soft, like a gland, and round: and the exit of it is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	 To him who has angles and edges, add them to the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	 If it does not come out in this way, then you must press on it: or tighten it over him properly, whose extremity is like the moon, which tightens over the stone, and does not escape from it: or that you introduce under it a subtle instrument with a curved extremity.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	 If however you cannot do so, then enlarge the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	 If something stops you from it with blood, cut it off with a knife.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	 If however the stone is more than one, then push first on the bladder bone.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	 Then cut over it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	 Afterwards push a little after that: and do the same if there are more than two.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	 If it is very large, then ignorance is to cut over it with a large incision.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	 Because it happens to the sick one of two things, either he dies or there is a constant flow of urine: because the place is not consolidated at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	 But administer its expulsion until it comes out: or press on the break of it with forceps, until you extract it piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	 When you complete your operation, then fill the wound with tar, aloe, and dragon's blood; tie it up and place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose oil, and cold water; so that an abscess may sit down warm.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	 Then turn the sick person over onto his neck, and do not loosen the bandage, until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	 When you unbind him, anoint the place with oil and water.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	 Then care for him with diaphine ointment and basilic ointment until he is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	 If, however, an abscess hot and corrosive arises in the wound, similar to when blood congeals in the bladder and urine is prevented from passing out of it; and this is known by the passage of blood along with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	 Therefore insert your finger into the wound and extract the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	 For if it remains, it promotes corruption of the bladder and its putrefaction.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	 Then clean the wound with vinegar, water, and salt; and apply to it everything that agrees with the healing process, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	 And during the entire healing period, it is necessary to bind two hips together and tie them, because of the medications that are placed on the place.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	 If the stone is small and is located in the bladder, and it blocks the passage of urine; then care for him with what I mentioned before, until you reach the incision.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	 For often during this treatment, you are freed from the incision, since I have already proven that.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	 And it is to receive the perforator from an iron awl, whose shape is triangular at one end and sharp, fixed into wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	 Then take a thread, and tie it to the rod under the stone, so that it does not return to the bladder.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	 Then insert the perforating iron into the rod with ease, until it reaches the Perforatorium at that stone; and turn the Perforatorium by your hand in the said stone gradually; and press the perforation of it, until you make it pass through from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	 Indeed, urine is discharged immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	 Then press your hand on what remains of the stone from the outside of the rod.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	 Indeed, it breaks and goes out with urine, and heals the sick one.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	 If this treatment is not prepared for you because of something that prevents it from him: then tie a thread under the stone and another thread on top of the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	 Then cut above the stone on the rod between the two bindings.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	 Then pull it out (the stone).
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	 Then untie the knot and clean the congealed blood that is made in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	 And it is not necessary to tie the thread under the stone unless to prevent its return to the bladder; and another knot above, unless when the string is untied after the stone has gone out, the skin returns to its place, and covers the wound; and for this reason you must do this when you tie the upper string, so that you remove the skin to a higher level, so that it returns where needed, and covers the wound, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	 Chapter on extracting stones in women.
Caput LXI.	 Chapter LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	 Too little stone (calculi) is generated in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	 If it happens to any of them that a stone occurs, then the treatment is difficult and forbidden due to numerous ways.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	 One of them is: that the woman may possibly be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	 And secondly, because you cannot find a woman who will reveal herself to the doctor when she is chaste or married women.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	 Thirdly, because you cannot find a woman well skilled in this art, especially the operation with the hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	 And fourthly, distance from the place of the stone; hence it requires deep section, and there is fear (involved).
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	 If necessity forces (you) to it (i.e., surgery), then one must take a woman-doctor, well skilled; and it is hard to find such.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	 If you are afraid of it (i.e., surgery), then look for a chaste and skilful doctor; and seek a midwife well skilled in women's matters, or a woman who is familiar with this art; make her present, and especially tell her to do everything that you order concerning the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	 Firstly, whether the woman is a virgin; then it is necessary to insert the finger into her anus and search for the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	 If he finds it (the stone), press it with his finger and then order the midwife to insert her finger into the weak part (of the bladder) and search for the stone, after she places her left hand on the bladder and applies a good compression.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	 If he finds the stone, then it is necessary to move it gradually from the bladder opening towards the lower parts with utmost care, until it reaches its root at the hip.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	 Then it is to be cut near the opposite middle part of the bladder at the root of the hip, from whichever side it is prepared for him; and he feels the stone in that place; his finger should not be removed from the stone, pressing under it; and the incision should be small initially.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	 Then introduce the rod over that cut.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	 If he feels a stone, then let him add to the incision according to the amount proportional to what the stone is coming out from there.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	 And know that the shapes of stones are numerous.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	 From these it is small and large, smooth and rough, long and round having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	 Know its shape so that it may be shown to you by this for what you want on that [object].
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If blood conquers you, then add at the place crushed pumice and hold it for an hour until the blood is cut off.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	 Then return to your operation until the stone comes out; and do so that you prepare yourself with those tools which I said for the removal of a stone in men, to aid you in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	 If the flow of blood conquers you and you know that the expulsion of blood is from an artery which has been cut; then place dust over the spot and tighten it with a suitable suture thread; do not move it; and leave the stone alone, and do not pull it out.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	 Perhaps a weak woman may die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	 Then care for the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	 When the sharpness of blood subsides after days and the place becomes rotten, then return to your operation until the stone comes out.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	 Section on a watery hernia.
Caput LXII.	 Chapter 62.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	 A watery hernia is not, unless a collection of moisture in the scrotum white, which is under the skin of the testicle containing eggs; and it is called scrotum.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And at times it is in its own panniculus (fatty fold), which nature has prepared for it in the ear part, until it is thought to be an egg; what is there is the testicle's skin wrapped in a serous membrane, which we have said is rare.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	 This generation (of a hydrocele) indeed arises from the weakness that happens to testicles; therefore, this material is discharged towards them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	 And at times it occurs as a result of a blow on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	 This moisture (hydrocele) has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	 For its color is either yellowish, reddish (blood-like), brown, black, watery white, and the latter is more common.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	 And the signs by which one knows where the accumulation of water is, are these:
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	 For if it is in the white serous membrane (we have said), then the abscess is round and slightly shorter than the figure of an egg; and the testicle is not visible because the water contains it from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	 And if the moisture (hydrocele) is in its own panniculus, then the abscess is round with a part of the ear; and for this reason, a man is deceived because it appears to be an egg.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	 And if the moisture (hydrocele) is between the skin of the testicles and the white serous membrane, it falls under the sense (of touch).
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	 When one wants to learn the color of the moisture (hydrocele), then test its color on an abscess with a flat probe, whose shape has been described earlier.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	 According to what comes out (from the abscess) in the track of the probe, judge about that which is between it.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	 When we come to treatment with iron (ligature), then it is necessary that you command the patient, if possible for him, to be bled; and observe his body full (of the hydrocele).
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	 Then he lies down on his back on a raised platform slightly, and put many cloths under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	 Then you sit on his left side and command the attendant to sit on his right side, who extends the rod to one of the two sides of the skin of the testicles, and to the part of the hernia of the abdomen.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	 Then take a broad lancet and cut the skin of the testicles in the middle along its length up to the pubic bone, making an incision parallel to the line that divides the skin of the testicles, until you reach the fat tissue encompassing it; peel it off and observe carefully or avoid peeling too much, and your peeling should be on the side that hangs more with the egg. Subtle examination with the peeling according to the amount you can manage.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	 Then pierce the sac filled with water with a wide perforation and drain out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	 Then separate the two lips of the incision with tweezers and pull up the sac and do not touch the skin surrounding the testicles; cut the sac in whatever way is possible for you to cut it, either completely or partially, especially the delicate side of it.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	 For if you do not carefully examine, there will be no security in that incision so that water may return.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	 If the egg comes out from its skin during your operation hour, then when you complete the incision of the sac, bring it back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	 Then gather together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it as other wounds until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	 If you find a rotten egg due to darkening from some other reason, then it is necessary to tie vessels which are suspending, fearing bleeding.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then remove the testicle with its suspender, and extract the egg; afterward care for it as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	 If water is added to two parts, then know that there are two branches; therefore cut the other part equally as you did in the other one.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	 And if it is equal so that the operation becomes one, then do this: afterwards remove the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	 And insert a submerged wool into the cuts, or in red oil; and place another wool outside which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over two testicles, and inspect the belly; and put double cloths on top of them, and there are lice; and tie them above with a ligament that has six knots according to this shape.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	 Then take two cloths and rinse them, and fill them with carmine dyed wool, according to this resemblance; and make the ends which are pressed from cotton, or wet wool; and add it together with a bandage in the loins; and one end takes on the anus up to the back, and the other takes to the part of the neck; and two ends below take to two thighs, and two others above take to two groins; and the entire bandage is added to the loins.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	 And at times this branch is artificially treated with a cautery in the place of the cut with iron; and it is so that you take a sharp cauterizing knife, and sever the skin of the testicles with it; and it is lit, as we have said, until the white membrane containing water appears; then take the cauterization, according to this shape.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	 It resembles Greek letters.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	 Then pierce it with that membrane, and it is lit until all the moisture comes out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	 Then extend the sheath with forceps, and excoriate it with a fine cautionery heated, and cut it as much as possible for you, until you root out all of its parts.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	 And be careful not to burn the egg.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	 Know that this operation is safer, more distant from bleeding, and better than the operation with incision.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If, however, the counteraction happens to you at the time of incision or at the time of cauterizing, a boil, or bleeding, or something else: then it is necessary that you treat what causes the counteraction from it with the treatment that suits it, according to what was mentioned earlier.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	 If the patient is weak and afraid and does not expect this operation due to its horror: then administer a puncture as I tell you that, and it is.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 When you are assured to you at your home about what I said about the signs, that the branch is watery: then it is necessary that you make the patient sit on a raised chair.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	 Then puncture the boil in its lower part with a broad spoon-shaped instrument and place the puncture along the length of the body and let it be wide open until all water flows out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	 Then place a warm pad on the spot and tie it up and let the remaining water flow out; then treat it until the wound heals.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	 If the counteraction happens during the exit of water at the time when you puncture it and this is not due to anything else except a white gauze that causes counteraction in the wound opening and prevents the flow of water, then it is necessary that you insert a feather into the wound or an instrument with which the water from hydropic sores is extracted, whose shape was mentioned earlier, or add slightly more in the wound treatment.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	 And know that water returns and accumulates after six months, approximately.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	 Therefore, when it accumulates, it should be stirred in the same manner, and the sick days will pass through.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	 Chapter on the Treatment of Fleshy Roots.
Caput LXIII.	 Chapter LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	 Know that in a section on this shinbone (Ramicem), it leads to danger in many dispositions due to fear.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	 Therefore, it seems to me that its release would be beneficial from that [position].
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	 And I remember the operation in that [place], and the appearance of the excised part.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	 I say that many excisions occur in the body, of which the testicles are composed; this happens due to various causes, such as...
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	 Or from an excess of sharp or acid fluid that is discharged towards the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	 Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	 And the color of an excised part is according to the color of the body, and there is no pain found in it; and an excision is heavy (or large).
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	 And perhaps it is a stone-like excision, whose color is dark, and there is no sensation in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	 And sometimes it happens from the swelling of the arteries and their inflation; as has been mentioned before; or from the swelling of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	 What then is known to be from the inflation of the arteries can be recognized by the appearance of the excised part, when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	 And one should not touch it entirely (or fully).
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	 But that which happens from the swelling of the veins does not spill out anything under compression with fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	 And now it is possible that a section can be made on this appearance and on the remaining flesh; and it is to cut the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	 Then spread the egg to the top, and extract it along with its sac (sifach) of white; and release the suspension from the abdomen, and tie the abdomen; then cut the suspension after you have released it from all parts of the egg.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	 If the hardened egg is attached to those born (or growing) flesh, then you must pull the egg and cut it.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	If there is an adhesion between something from the siphunculus, or within what is between the vessels: then it is necessary to release the entire adhesion and cut it with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	 If it is a flesh birth in the place of the adhesion that is behind: then it is necessary to cut the entire thing and extract the egg, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 When your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; afterwards take care of it with the remaining care until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	 Chapter on the Care of Branches, which is related to the Vine.
Caput LXIIII.	 Chapter LXIV.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	 A tumor is enclosed by some swelling resembling a bunch of grapes with the softening of testicles; and it becomes difficult for movement and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And in the treatment of this illness there is a fear because of the memory of what preceded it.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	 However, it is necessary to say that the operation should be done according to what the first ones did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	 I therefore say that it is necessary to make the sick person sit on a raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	 Then pull down the suspender of the testicles towards the lower part.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	 Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, near the vessels which are close to the penis; and let another servant hold it and stretch it with a strong extension.\]
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	 Then cut with a wide, sharp, transverse incision directly over the vessels, until the vessels are exposed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	 Then scrape away from every side, as I have told you in the extraction of arteries that are in the temples.\]
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	 Then insert a needle with a double thread into them and tie it at the first places where vines occur; and tie it again at the end of them.\]
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	 Then cut it in half straight through the middle along the body's length, and extract what collects from foul and corrupted moistures.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	 Then care for the wound along with the treatment of other wounds, where pus is generated, so that vessels which nourish one testicle may fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	 For it is not harmful through that [pathway].
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	 If it happens that all the vessels are affected, then they must be extracted because of the testicles along with the vessels: so that the egg may not be deprived of nourishment due to the incision, and it may decay or burn, and not be helpful with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	 Chapter on the care of intestinal roots.
Caput LXV.	 Chapter 65.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	 The outlet of these roots is from the incision which occurs on the extended sifach above the abdomen in the inguinal part of the liver.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	 Why do the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	 And this rupture is either from the sifach or its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	 These two types of ruptures occur for many reasons: either from a blow, a jump, a shout, raising a heavy object, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	 And the sign is when it is due to the extension of the sifach.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	 It happens gradually over a long time and does not happen suddenly: and it is an abscess turned deep: therefore, because the sifach compresses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	 And its sign is when it is from the section of the sifach, because it causes a sudden intense pain from the beginning: and it is an abscess different, appearing below the skin close by: and this is due to the outlet of the intestine, and its course to the exterior sifach.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	 And sometimes it comes out with the intestine called zirbum: and this root is called intestinal root, and zirbia: and sometimes it occurs with wind.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	 And at times feces run into the intestine and are retained there; it is with great danger for the sick, because it causes severe pain, especially when pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	 And in the treatment of this kind of illness with iron, there is fear; therefore one must be careful about accidents happening in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	 The method of the operation is to order the sick person to bring their intestine back with their own hand to the hollow within themselves, if they obey the return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	 Then he shall lie on his back upon his neck between your hands; and lift up his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	 Then extend the skin that follows the skin upward, and cut the skin of the testicles entirely along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	 Then fix two hooks on the lips of the incision, according to what you need to open the incision with them; and let the incision be according to the size, so that it is possible for the egg to come out of it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	 Then scrape the scrotum, and what is beneath the skin of the testicles, until the albumen of the scrotum becomes hard from all sides; then insert your index finger into what follows the testicle, into that which is between the albumen of the scrotum, which is under the skin of the egg, and between the scrotums according to, and without adherence to it in the posterior part of the egg.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	 Then move the right hand toward the inner skin of the testicles; and while doing this, stretch the albumen of the scrotum upward with the left hand; and lift out the egg with the scrotum to the part of the incision, and command the assistant to extend the egg upward; and you separate the adherence that is behind the complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	 And search with your fingers whether there is something inside the scrotum from the rolled-up intestine in hard albumen.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	 If you find anything from it, then push it downward to the lower stomach.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	 Then take a probe with a thick thread made of linen from ten strands, and insert it at the last sifach, that is, the tunica underneath the skin of the testicles following the incision: then cut the ends that project from the thread until there are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	 Then arrange some of them above others in a cross-like fashion and tie the sifach, which we mentioned is the ligament beneath the skin of the testicles, so that no pus from those vessels can be sent to them: to prevent the development of a hot abscess there.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	 And place another ligament beyond the first one, at least two fingers away from it.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	 And after these two ligaments, release a piece from the sifach beneath the skin of the testicles, as big as a finger. Then cut the rest in a circular manner and remove the egg-like substance.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	 Then make a cut on the lower part of the scrotal skin from which blood and pus flows, as we described in that which was mentioned before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	 Then apply wool soaked in oil to the wound and place the ligament we mentioned.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	 And sometimes burn the white sifach which we described after its incision, to prevent bleeding.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	 It often happens that this occurs.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	 Release the ligament until it falls off by itself.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	 If the condition does not improve, then fumigate it with hot water, and place on top of what we described until it falls off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	 Then treat the wound with the usual treatment for wounds until it heals.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	 Chapter on Ventose Hernia.
Caput LXVI.	 Chapter 66.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	 In this ventose hernia, I did not see anyone who dared to treat it with an iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And indeed they first said, that it is done as we have narrated in Ramice which is with Vite.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	 That is to tie vessels after the section with ease below it; then cut in the middle, and care for it afterwards with what opens itself, until the vessels fall out; and care for the wound, as we have said, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	 On the disruption that happens in the groins.
Caput LXVII.	 Chapter LXVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	 When rupture happens in the groins, as we have said, and the place becomes open, and nothing from the intestines descends to the testicles; and if it does descend, it is little, and returns at all hours; but if prolonged with it, a fissure is added in sifach until the intestines descend into sifach.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	 And this happens due to the extension of sifach, which is in the groins, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	 That is because sifach extends; then it softens, and the place is massaged, and it comes out.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	 And its care is with a cautery, as its previous narrative has described.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	 And sometimes it is cured with iron, according to this method; and it is to lie weak on his back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	 Then cut the place of the rupture and protruding, with a cut across its width, according to the size of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	 Then tie off the alisifak and what is beneath the skin until white sifach, which is beneath the skin that follows it, appears.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	 Then take the cautery and place it on the protruding place from sifach, and press it deeply into the abdomen.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	 Then take two protruding places on the extremity of the radius from sifach, and join them with a suture; then remove the extremity of the radius.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	 Do not cut the anus at all, nor stretch the egg, nor anything else, as I have taught you to know in the treatment of intestinal branches.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	 Then treat that with the remedy for wounds.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	 When you cut the thread, clean it, and restore the wound until it heals.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	 For indeed, a sisycos (a kind of tumor) is contracted, and there is no swelling due to rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	 And cautery is better in this place because it is closer to healing.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	 Chapter on the softening of scrotal skin.
Caput LXVIII.	 Chapter LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	 The scrotal skin is often softened in some men because the flesh between them becomes soft and its appearance is disfigured.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	 Therefore it is necessary for the person who is asked to treat this condition to have him lie down on his back, and to cut through all the softened skin over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	 Then gather the two lips together with suture: and if you wish, or especially if there is excess of softened skin, trim it off using three or four stitches, and sew firmly.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	 Then cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	 Then treat the remaining wounds with remedies until they heal and the thread falls out.
¶ De Castratione.	 Chapter on castration.
Caput LXIX.	 Chapter LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	 You should know that castration is prohibited by our law, and because of this I may omit it in my book and there is no need to remember it except for two methods.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	 One reason is that this knowledge should be in the medical profession when asked about it: and so that he may know the treatment for the condition when it occurs.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	 And there is another method that we often need for the castration of some animals, due to our needs from it, as for example sheep, goats, cats and similar ones among animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	 I say therefore that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	 Or by attrition.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	 Or by making a cut and dividing it (i.e., surgical castration).
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	 In the case of castration by attrition, the method of operation is: that we make the animal sit in warm water until its testicles soften and relax and hang down; then rub them with your hand until they resolve and no longer appear under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	 In surgical castration, it is necessary that you hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	 Then tie the scrotum and cut through it entirely over every egg until two eggs come out: then cut where you have scraped off both, and do not leave anything besides the chyle (seminal fluid) that is on the vessels.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	 And this method of castration is better than the one by attrition: because attrition perhaps leaves something from the testicles, therefore the animal desires intercourse.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	 Then care for the wound until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	 Chapter on the care of Hermaphrodites (intersex individuals) in two ways.
Caput LXX.	 Chapter 70.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	 A hermaphrodite is male according to two modes.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	 One of them is because there appears in it what follows the space, or in the skin of the testicles, in that which is between two testicles, a figure resembling a female wolf, in which hairs are found: and sometimes urine flows from it, which is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	 But in women there is one species, and it is a female wolf on the forehead like small testicles of a man, projecting to the outside: of which one is like Priapus (a mythological figure with an exaggerated male sexual organ) of a man, and two are like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	 And the treatment of the three species (threes types), two from men, and the one species from women, is: because it is necessary to cut into the flesh added, until the impression of them escapes.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	 Then cure them with the treatment of other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	 But in the second species of men from which urine flows out, which is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is its treatment at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	 Chapter on the incision of tentigo (an inflammatory disease) and the flesh projecting in female wolves.
Caput LXXI.	 Chapter LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	 Tentigo (an inflammatory disease) is perhaps added superficially until it becomes ugly and the appearance of it becomes foul: and sometimes it swells so much in some women that it extends like it does in men, and reaches to coitus (sexual intercourse).
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 Therefore it is necessary to hold the superfluity of tentigo with the hand or with a hook and cut into it: and not to go too deep in cutting, especially at the root, so that bleeding does not occur.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then cure it with the treatment of wounds until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	 The flesh that arises is the flesh that is born in the orifice of the womb until it fills itself: and perhaps it comes out to the outside, resembling the tail: and because of this some call the disease "caudatus".
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	 It is necessary that we make an incision in it as we do with a tumor, and treat it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	 On the treatment of the Alraqic ulcer, which is not penetrated by the vagina.
Caput LXXII.	 Chapter LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	 The arteria is that it should be a female's unperforated wound, or it should have a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	 And it is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	 Accidental is caused by the preceding illness; and it itself is made either from flesh naturally added, or ifach subtle, or thick; and it is made either in the deep of the womb, or in its sides, or on its top, or bottom; and it prevents coitus and impregnation, and parturition, and perhaps prohibits menstrua.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	 And the knowledge of this is obtained through the examination of an obstetrician, if the membrane is visible nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	 If it is not visible, then search for it with your fingers, or with a probe.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	 If the membrane is from ifach subtle and is near two lips; then, pull it and break it apart.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	 And it is to place two small pills on top of the lips.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	 Then place your thumb and index fingers together, and the woman lies on her back with legs apart.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	 Then spread the two lips with force until the ifach subtle is torn and the membrane is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	 Then take wool and wet it with oil, and place it on the site; let the woman anoint it every day so that the site does not heal in another way.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	 If the ifach is thick and large; then it must be cut with a broad-bladed leaf of myrtle.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	 If the membrane is from flesh naturally added; then hang it with hooks and cut it; and have medicines that stop blood flow without constriction, such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and cedar resin mixed with egg white.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then administer a wide cannula of lead to prevent the wound from healing quickly; hold it for several days; then apply linen cloth, and then care for the rest of the treatment until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	 And sometimes a birth in the womb of flesh from other parts occurs: it is therefore necessary that they be cut according to this manner: before there is no abscess, for an abscess that is cancerous in the womb, should not be opposed at all with iron.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	 On the care of hemorrhoids, Attechel and Bothet regarding redness in women's ulcers.
Caput LXXIII.	 Chapter LXXIII.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	 Hemorrhoids indeed are the opening of vein orifices, until much blood runs out of them continually.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	 Therefore when hemorrhoids persist, they become piles; and I have already said about their species and the signs of them in the division, and now I will say which ones receive a cure, and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	 I say therefore that hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb and are not felt by touch, then there is no cure for them with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	 But those which are on the opening of the womb, over which there is touch, these are those which can be cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	 Therefore it is necessary to introduce a woman into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	 Then extend Attechel with forceps or rough cloth and cut them from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	 Then powder over them near the flow of blood from one powder of incision without biting: such as acacia, and dragon's blood, and alum, and similar ones.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	 Then press his feet to the wall at noon.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	 Then lay her down in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	 If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumach, and rind of pomegranates, and vinegar, and similar ones.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	 Then take barley flour, knead it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with it on his back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	 If therefore blood is cut with it, good; and if not, make the back adhere to bladders, and nipples, without scarification.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	 Then take wool, and dip it in the juice of tarathit or arnoglossa or alaulat branches (aglanter), Pontic wine, and make it adhere to the loin.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 When therefore the abscess is quiet, then care for the place with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	 However, the red one resembles the heads of alhaasse and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Therefore it is necessary that you cut what appears from it, according to what I said in thehelil equally; and care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	 On the Perforation of the Dead Fetus that occurs in the Womb.
Caput LXXIIII.	 Chapter LXXIIII.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	 Many species of abscesses occur in the womb, such as cancer, stone abscess, ulcers, adubelati and alekilati (herpes), fistulae, hemorrhoids, ragadiae, thelil, and hot abscess.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	 And I myself have already said all these diseases and their species, the signs of them, and their treatments in division: it is necessary that I say in this treatise about the hot abscess that occurs in the womb when it is one of the abscesses that collect pus; and know how to make its opening with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	 Therefore it is necessary that you consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	 If then the pain of the abscess in its incision is sharp with striking, and burning, and fever; and you see it turn red; if it falls on sensation, then do not rush with perforation of it: and care for it with that which helps for maturation until when the acuteness of the symptoms subsides.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on a bench which has two arms, and she should recline or lean upon her back, and bring her feet to the lower part of the abdomen: and her hips should be spread open, and she places her arms below her knees, and tie each with a band corresponding to that.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	 The midwife should sit by the right side, and administer the instrument for opening the womb's opening.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	 Its form comes to those that are after.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	 And it is necessary that when you administer this instrument, you mark with the deepest part of the rod of the woman's womb: so that what enters from the instrument is not more than the depth of the womb and harms the weak.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	 If the instrument is deeper than the depth of the womb, then it is necessary that you place pillows on the top of the deep part of the woman's womb: to prevent the entire entry of the instrument into the depth of the womb and to make a loop, which runs in the instrument, from the upper side: and to hold the instrument and for the attendant to turn the loop until the depth of the woman's womb is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	 When it appears that the baby is about to be born and it is touched with a hand, and it is soft and smooth, then it is necessary that you remove her to the head with a broad spatula.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	 When the pus is expelled, then it is necessary to place a linen cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil, containing some sticky substance, on the wound: and to place the cloth and make an incision in the depth of the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	 Place a clean woolen cloth soaked in water boiled with mallow over the womb and the comb.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	 Then it is cured for two days with an ointment suitable for that until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	 And sometimes the matrix (womb) and wound are washed, so that they are cleansed with water and honey: then, with water in which the root of the lily has been boiled, or long aristolochia, return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	 If the wound is hidden internally within the matrix (womb), then it is necessary that you refrain from treating it with iron, rather treat it with what I said in the division section.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	 Part of Obstetrics: How to treat living embryos that have been born abnormally.
Caput Lxxu.	 Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	 It is necessary for an obstetrician to first know the shape of a normal birth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	 From these signs it is that when you see a woman being pressed towards the lower part and desires to smell air, and there is lochia on her who is in labor, and she hurries the birth of the embryo: then you know that this birth is according to its natural shape, and its exit is over the head and the second one with it: either suspended, or hanging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	 When you see these signs, then it is necessary to press her abdomen so that the embryo descends quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	 For when it descends over its head, the second one also descends with it, and it is cleaned from these excesses with good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	 But whoever is beyond this birth, is unnatural, unlawful.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	 Because sometimes the fetus comes out over its feet, and its body comes out before its head, and its feet and hands one or both: or the head and hands come out: or the navel comes out: and perhaps it turns on its neck, and similar unlawful figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	 Therefore it is necessary for an obstetrician to be wise and cautious in all these matters, and to avoid errors and deception: and I am showing every figure of them, and how there is intelligence in it, and it is indicated by that, and it will stand on top of it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	 When the fetus comes out on its own head during natural delivery and it becomes powerful over the woman, and birth becomes difficult for her, and you see that his strength is already weakened: then make her sit on a chair, or women hold her; and fumigate her windpipe with fennel boiled, and with moist oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	 The midwife introduces a small spatula between the fingers and cuts the second finger, and snips it with her nail until what is within her becomes dry; then she presses the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	 If it does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be cleansed with a fennel mucilage, with sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	 Then command her after the cleansing to be bound; and make her sneeze with pepper and hold her nose for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	 For the fetus will immediately come out.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	 If two hands of the fetus come out first, then it is necessary to reduce them gently and slowly with a reed.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	 If it does not obey when introducing, then put the woman on a chair and raise her feet upwards; then strike the chair on the ground; and hold her so that she does not fall during the shock.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	 If then the hands do not come out and the fetus dies; cut them off, and extract the remaining fetus; tie her hand with cloth, and extract him evenly; for he will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	 The emergence of the embryo is on its foot.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	 When the fetus comes out on its feet, then push them upwards; then turn the fetus gradually; afterwards extract him evenly.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	 Then take one foot of his and stretch it gradually.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	 When they (the instruments) come out up to the hips, then command him (the patient), let it be pressed, and make it sneeze with a powder: it will come out if God wishes.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	 If it does not come out as we have told (described), then gradually draw back the fetus until you place it in its natural position.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	 For it will then come out easily through delivery.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	 If it is prevented from coming out as we have told (described): then take althea mucilage, sesame oil and dissolved gum: grind all together well in a mortar using good pounding; afterwards, apply the mixture with a thread to the woman's womb and lower abdomen.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	 Then make her sit in warm water until the afterbirth follows.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	 When you see that the lower parts (of the woman) are now warmed up, then give her some (substance) from myrrh: and place it under her.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 When an hour has passed since you gave her the substance, then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	 Then make her sneeze: and hold open her mouth and nose: and press the lower part of her abdomen gently.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	 For the fetus will come out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	 The exit of the fetus above the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	 When it comes out in this manner (described), then make her give birth gradually by introducing her hands little by little.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	 Then the woman lies on her back with her feet hanging down: and she lies down on a bed and wraps her hands (around the fetus).
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	 Then press gently on her abdomen little by little.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	 Then remove whatever is under the woman's feet from the pudendum, until it is prepared below (in the vagina).
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	 If the fetus does not come out, then take her feet and move them forcefully.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	 Then press gently what is above the hypochondrium gradually, until the fetus rises upwards.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	 Then insert your hands and gently press the fetus: and instruct the woman to compress herself until the fetus exits.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	 The exit of the fetus is wide-spread hanging from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	 Make an incision for reducing the hand (of the fetus).
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	 If it cannot be reduced, then lift the woman and make her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	 But if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed: and strike her legs violently.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	 Then apply the ointment you prepared from glue.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	 But if she receives her labor, then make her sit on a chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	 Then strive for the reduction of the hand and gently press the fetus according to its natural shape: and make the woman sneeze, and instruct her to compress herself until it exits.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	 The exit of the fetus is on its neck, with spread hands, and its face is towards the back of the mother.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	 The midwife must hold the hand of the fetus, then gradually turn it and press it gently with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	 When it is turned, then place it on the wound that we have mentioned, made of oil and glue.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	 Then instruct her to move slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	 When you have done that, then make her sit on a chair and instruct her to lean to the right side.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi.	 Then instruct her to compress herself: and make her sneeze with powder.
¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	 The exit of the prepared fetus is on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	 When it descends to the woman's opening in this manner with the afterbirth, then cut the afterbirth with your nail until it is expelled due to moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	 If the fetus is suspended over the face and its neck, then cut it from the navel so that it is not retained and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	 Then push the fetus towards the inside until you place it as required; and tell the woman to compress herself several times; for it will exit easily.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	 Section on Twins or Multiple Fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	 Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or even four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	 However, such a thing is rare and unusual.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	 But five are absolutely beyond nature and do not survive long; and contain them, although they multiply, by the second one; and separate them through a surgical incision (sifach) that distinguishes the connected cord at the navel of each of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	 And sometimes they exit like a single fetus through a natural, easy birth canal; and they exit in an extraordinary way, as we have told.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	 If some of them are difficult at birth and reach the condition that I have said in unnatural ways (from the figures), then care for them as we have described; and let a skilled midwife be there, and she should do what she does with ease and slowness, and invent according to all possible shapes to prepare herself to save them.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	 Section on the Recollection of That Which is Formed in the Womb from Embryos, and Miscarries.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	 Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, or even more than ten embryos are formed in the womb and miscarry; and it has already been proven to me that a woman, while miscarrying, has expelled seven, and another fifteen, all fully-formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	 That which was done by the measurement of a wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	 Therefore, this entire matter should be known by an Obstetrician.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	 Perhaps it will reach that one similar to it: Therefore oppose to it what is necessary.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	 On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	 Chapter LXXVI.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	 When you treat a dead fetus, as previously stated in the division of medication, and it does not come out, and you are forced to use surgery with your hand, then it is necessary for you to consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	 If the woman is of good health and not with any accident from which destruction may be feared over her: then it is necessary for the woman to lie on a bed, on her back, and her head should be inclined downward, and her legs raised: and the attendant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed, so that her body does not come out during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	 Then the mouth of the womb should be moistened with oils, almond gum, and flaxseed.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	 Then the midwife should anoint her hand with these oils and gums: then she should insert it into the womb easily.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	 Then she should seek with her the place where she will fix the hooks on the fetus, and places suitable for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	 Therefore consider then, if the fetus is prepared to descend onto its head: then fix hooks in its eyes, or its neck, or its mouth, or its palate itself, or under its beard, or in its armpits, or near the ribs, and under the breasts.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	 If, however, it is a descent onto its feet: then fix hooks in its chest and the middle of its ribs.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	 And it is necessary that the hook should be held with the right hand: and she should place her thumb on what is between the fingers of the left hand: and insert with the hand easily, and fix the hook in one of those places which we said, until it reaches an empty space.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	 Then fix another hook or a third one, if necessary: so that the constriction is equal, and it does not lean to one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	 Then it should be extended with an equal extension, and it should not be an extension only in a straight direction, rather it should be moved to all parts, so that its outlet is relieved: just as it happens when a tooth is extracted for its removal.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	 And it is necessary for what is between it [the extended part], that the extension be made soft.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	 If a part is retained from it [the extended part], then it is necessary that the midwife insert certain fingers with oil and turn it with them, which is retained.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	 If, therefore, a part of the fetus emerges, then the hooks should be moved to another higher place: do this until the entire fetus has emerged.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	 If, therefore, a hand emerges before other parts and it is not possible to return it because of its twisting: then a cloth should be wound around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	 Then extract it until when the entire [part] has emerged, cut it at the joint of the foot or the elbow: and thus you should do so with the other hand, and in two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	 If the head of the fetus is large or it has a twisting in its emergence, or water is collected around its head: then a sharp pointed spatula called Spatumile should be inserted between the fingers and pierce its head and extract the water; or break it with the instrument called Almisdac, whose shape comes with the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter following this.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	 Similarly, do as follows if the fetus is of large head nature: then pierce it with a cautery called Algengematu; or extract it with misdach, as mentioned before.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	 Then draw the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	 If the head emerges and twists at the neck: then it is punctured until the moisture inside the chest is released.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	 If it is not complicated and does not obey to exit: then cut the head roughly, as much as possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	 If below the abdomen is an apostema or it is in him hydropisis: then you must pierce it, until the moisture runs out from it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	 If indeed the fetus is above his feet, then the drawing of it will be easy, and its direction to the bone of the matrix will be light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	 If however it is twisted in the abdomen or chest: then you must draw it out along with a cloth which you have wrapped over your hand; and pierce the abdomen or chest until what is within them runs out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	 If however the remaining limbs are removed and the head returns: then the midwife should insert her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	 If therefore the bone of the matrix is open, then insert your hand into the depth of the matrix and search for the head with it, and draw it out with your fingers up to the bone of the matrix; then insert a hook in it or hooks two, and draw it out with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	 If the bone of the matrix is twisted, because of a hot apostema which has happened to it: then you should not work on it, but rather administer a solution of moist things, oily; and administer poultices; and sit in waters that soften and moisten.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	 If the fetus is on its side, then it may be equalized: then administer what we have said for a living fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	 If that cannot be done, then cut it roughly and draw it out.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	 And it is necessary not to leave anything from the second part inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	 When you complete your operation, then administer what we have said for hot apostemas which occur in the matrix.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	 If bleeding occurs, then lower [the patient] into warm water and administer the remaining treatment.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	 I myself have seen a woman, whose womb was dead due to one fetus; afterwards she became pregnant again with another fetus, and that fetus also died.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	 Therefore, after a long time, an abscess occurred in his navel and it became swollen until it opened; and he began to discharge pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	 I was therefore called upon for his treatment, and he was treated over a long period; but the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	 I then applied to him some strong adhesive plasters; and bone came out from the place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	 Then, after a few days had passed, another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	 I was therefore amazed when no bone was found in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	 Therefore, I thought that the dead fetuses were made of bones.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	 I therefore asked the wound, and took out many bones, when the woman was in good condition; and she lived for a long time in this state, but emitted little pus from the place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	 I did not apply this foreign substance here unless there was knowledge and help for the treatment that is given by the medical artist with his hand.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	 § On the shapes of necessary instruments for extracting fetuses.
Caput LXXVII.	 Chapter LXXVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	 Here is the form of a Stricture Instrument, by which books are evened, having equally two spiral threads at the ends of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	 Nevertheless, this Spiral must be finer than the Stricture Instrument; and it should be made either of Ebony or Boxwood.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	 And let the thickness of all the wood be about two fingers; and the edge of each of them is like one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and a half; and in the middle of two pieces of wood there are two additions of the same kind of wood, which have already been fastened to both, whose length is half a palm or less; and the width of each is about two fingers or less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	 And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the matrix, to open it when you turn two Spirals with them.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	 The form of the Spiral that opens the matrix.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	 Another form similar to it, but finer and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	 Let it be made of Ebony or Boxwood, according to the likeness of forceps.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	 Nevertheless, at the end of it there are two additions, as you see here above; and the length of each addition is about a palm; and the width of each is about two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	 When therefore you wish to open the matrix with it, then make the woman sit on a bed, with her legs apart, opening what is between her thighs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	 Then insert these two additions together into the matrix; and you hold the end of the instrument below her hips.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	 Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with forceps, equally according to the amount by which you wish the opening of the matrix; until the Midwife does what she wishes.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	 Form of Vertigo other than what the ancients called Form of Pushing, by which the fetus is pushed.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	 The shape of the Molar-grinder, by which the large head is crushed: and it resembles a pair of forceps, having teeth at its end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	 And sometimes it becomes hook-shaped, like a pair of forceps according to this shape, as you see, having teeth like the teeth of a saw, by which it cuts and crushes.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	 The shape of the Molar-grinder, by which the small head is crushed.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	 The shape of the Scissors having one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	 The shape of the Scissors having two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	 The shape of forceps with saw-teeth, by which the fetal head is crushed.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	 The shape of the Spatula having two ends for severing the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	 The shape of two Spatulas also broad.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	 All these instruments are applied, and the more their forms multiply, and the more they are prepared by the craftsman, it is quicker for its operation, and higher in the eyes of men, due to its quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	 Therefore, do not disregard any instrument, as it may be prepared for you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	 Indeed, their necessity is unavoidable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	 Chapter on the Second Extraction (Cesarean section).
Caput LXXVIII.	 Chapter LXXVIII (78).
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	 When the Second Extraction (Cesarean section) retains during childbirth, then order the weak to hold their breath.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	 Then make her sneeze with powder and press your hand over her mouth and nose.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	 If it comes out through this (the incision), that is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	 If not: then take the pot and pierce a hole in the covering (uterus): and put in there opening herbs, such as camomile, rue, anise, chamomile, wood-ear, centauray: take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them with water, and place them on fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	 Then place the bulb of the reed on the opening of the pot's cover, and the other end into the bone of the matrix; and hold it until the vapor reaches the concavity of the matrix.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	 Then make her sneeze, as we said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	 For sublingual secondaries, it will come out easily.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	 If it remains after this treatment and does not come out, then order the Midwife to immerse her hand in sesame oil or marshmallow juice.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	 Then insert [the hand] into the cervix and seek out the Sublingual.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	 When it is found, then take it and gently pull it out gradually.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	 If it is attached deeply in the matrix, then insert [the hand], as we said, until when you find the Sublingual and draw it out gradually along the correct path to avoid the strong attraction of falling into the matrix; indeed, it should be moved gently to the right and left sides: afterwards, add to the amount of the attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	 It then subsides and is saved, and escapes from the adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	 If the bone of the matrix is twisted, as we have already said: treat it with sneezing and medication from the pot with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	 If it does not come out with everything that we have said, then take care not to tire yourself by repeatedly attempting the extraction.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	 However, whatever comes out of the bone of the matrix from there, tie it to the woman's hip.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	 Then enema her with the four-ingredient ointment.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	 It will rot and dissolve after a few days, and it will come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	 Nevertheless, when it rots, the foul smell is raised to the stomach and head, and harms the weak one.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	 Therefore, it is necessary that suitable fumigations are administered for that purpose.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	 Some of the ancients have already experienced the fumigation of nasturtium and dried figs.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	 The shape of the instrument used to fumigate a woman during retention of the second birth and menstruation.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	 Make an instrument similar to an alembic, or from a jar. Place its wide end over the fire, and place the fumigation on plums. Hold it until the fumigation is consumed, then take another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	 Chapter on the treatment of an unperforated anus.
Caput LXXIX.	 Chapter LXXIX (79).
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	 Many boys are born, and the anus of some of them is not perforated, which has already been cauterized with a sharp probe.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	 Therefore, the midwife must perforate it with her finger; and if she cannot, she should perforate it with a pointed spatula, but be careful not to touch it (the rectum) with her hand.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	 Then put wool soaked in wine and oil on top of it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat it with an ointment until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	 If you are afraid that it will be cauterized (healed), then put a leaden tube into the opening and remove it when the boy wants to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	 And now, cauterization of the anus also occurs due to the consolidation of a wound or abscess.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	 Therefore, that consolidation must be cut, then treated with the remedy as we have said for the treatment and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	 Chapter on the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part (of the body).
Caput LXXX.	 Chapter LXXX (80).
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	 The fistulas that occur in the lower part are nodes (lumps), and swellings that occur near the anus outside; or in a space of one part; and there is one fistula or more than one.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	 When therefore the ancient knot is untied, watery whiteness or subtle pus flows out from it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	 And sometimes there are penetrating ones among these fistulas.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	 Therefore, those that penetrate are recognized by what comes out during discharge, and its gaseous nature, when the sick person uses discharge; and perhaps a worm comes out from them.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	 And there are fistulas among these when they penetrate into the space up to the bladder, and up to the meat of the penis.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	 And there are those that penetrate up to the hip joint, and up to the coccygeal node.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	 From this it is recognized that the penetrating fistula up to the anus can also be recognized by the non-penetrating one, by inserting your index finger into the anus; and inserting a probe made of thin copper or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	 If there is tortuosity in it, then insert a thin lead probe or horsehair into it until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	 If you do not feel it all the way through, nor does anything come out of it during discharge, nor gaseousness, nor a worm as I said; then you will know that it is not penetrating; approach then for treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	 And when the fistula is penetrating up to the bladder or the urethra; then its sign is the outflow of urine from it, and its prohibition is that the location should not be closed with medicine.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	 But if it is penetrating up to the hip joint or the pelvis; then its sign is that the probe reaches there, if there is no tortuosity up to the bone; and pain in the surrounding area can be found, and pus always comes out from it; and medication cannot be applied in it, nor closed with an ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	 In these fistulas that penetrate, there is no treatment at all; and their cure is toil and futility for him, upon whom they are formed, by foolish physicians.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	 In those not penetrating and also not ancient, healing is hoped for with a knife; as I tell you, and I have already tested it; and there lies the sick one between your hands upon his back; and raise his legs up to above his hips, and let his hips be inclined towards his own belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	 Then introduce a lead or copper rod if there is a twist in the fistula, until you know where the probe has reached.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	 If the sick one feels it around the anus, then you must insert your finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	 If you feel the probe already penetrate itself through the detected fistula, except that you also feel it between your finger and the fistula or flesh; then you will certainly know that it penetrates; therefore do not labor in it, because there is no healing for it, as we have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	 They say that flesh heals in some people and that the remedy by which they hope for help consists of applying a fine cautery to the size of the fistula, as previously described, and then introducing the burning cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	 Then repeat this twice or thrice until you know that all the flesh added by filtration, which is similar to a bird's quill, has been burnt up.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	 Then treat it with linen strips soaked in butter until the burnt flesh emerges; then treat it with ointments that produce and heal skin and make it firm.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	 If it heals, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	 If not, then it will never heal with any other treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	 If it exits [the anus] and does not reach your finger, which is within [the anus], and there is a thick membrane of flesh or sifak between it and the anus, and you see a fistula in what follows the surface of the skin, then cut the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you go cutting with the fistula what is in the fistula, until the incision reaches where the edge of the membrane ends, and the membrane is released and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	 Then clean those fleshy parts resembling the quill of a bird's feather, so that there remains nothing of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	 If blood overpowers you and dissolves between you and your operation so that the fleshy parts cannot be separated, then it is better for what is being done, and more expediently helped, to cauterize it with fire or with a sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	 Because the cautery with fire brings about good results in searing those fleshy parts, burning of these added caruncles, and drying up of blood and moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	 Then treat it with bandages rolled in butter or softened cabbages until the place emits pus and those seared fleshy parts emerge in the pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	 Then treat the wound with consolidating ointments that produce tough flesh; there are medicines containing styptics and astringents.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	 For when it is restored, then it heals; and do not fear the repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	 If the fistula has already reached the depth of the anus and is prolonged from the body's excess: then insert your finger into the anus and examine it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 If therefore you feel a membrane, and there is between you and it a membrane from sifak or flesh, and it is close to perforation: then there is no operation on this, unless according to the way of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	 The substance is, because it is administered in him one of the three methods: either to cauterize it itself, as we said; or to excise it, until you reach its concavity, so that it is possible for you to insert a linen, and cure it from nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	 And do not proceed much with the excision, so as not to cut the muscle containing the anus, and a harmful outcome of evacuation occurs without its will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	 Then cure that with what I said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	 For perhaps it will be cured: or you elongate the skin itself, and clean it after you cut it up to near the anus, as I said, either with a pouch or with another sharp-pointed instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	 Then clean those fleshy parts filtered which are in the excision, up to where you can with examination.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	 Then try the healing of the whole wound with the excision, and at the superior orifice where it consolidates; and remains a hole opened in the inner part of the anus, and it will be lighter for the sick one.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	 And sometimes a fistula is sucked out by this method: and it is when you insert the pouch in the fistula: and it is on the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and margin of the anus; then take the perforated tip of the pouch, which is like the point of the awl, that is, prepared from calfskin, according to this shape.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	 And insert into it a thread rolled up from five threads, and around there.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	 Then insert the pouch with the thread in the fistula, until you reach its concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 If it penetrates into the inner margin of the anus near, then extract the thread from that hole; so that you insert your finger in the anus and extract the tip of the thread, and gather both ends together: and tighten both, and leave it for one day or two days: and as much as the thread cuts into the flesh, tighten it well, until those fleshy parts which are between the two ends of the thread fall down; then care for the wound, until it consolidates and heals.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	 If, however, the opening of the Fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate in whatever way you prepare, unless it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	 For you there is no need to do this for the arm, so that you may not cut it yourself.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	 Then proceed with it as we have said, until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	 The form of the Spatulinis spiny is used to cut the Fistula whose sharpness is very keen, and one part is not keen so that it does not cut what is unnecessary, as you can see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	 On the suturing of hemorrhoids from which blood flows from their incision, and on the care of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	 Chapter LXXXI.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	 There are hemorrhoids according to two modes.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	 They are either within the anus, similar to coal-like blisters or prunes, or they are like grains of wheat themselves.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	 And among them there are small ones and large ones; and blood flows from them always, and some are single, and others are many.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	 And they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	 However, those which are outside the anus are for the most part dry, from which yellow water or little blood flows persistently, and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	 And the treatment of that which is within the anus is to order the sick person to fast and rest: and it is pressed out, until it appears from the anus, and is seen by you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	 Therefore, either suspend them with hooks, or hold them with your nails.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	 Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	 If they are not held in them by the hooks due to their moisture and softening: then grasp them with a rough cloth or with a comb made of double wool, and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	 Then cut them (the vessels), and sprinkle some warm powders over them after the incision to remain in the place of cautionery.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	 Cauterize them according to what was mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them with the rest of the treatment until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	 If the anus does not obey to evacuation, then administer a gentle enema to the sick one containing a small amount of purgative, so that it cleanses what is in the anus, and let the sick person evacuate quickly when he releases it.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	 If the objects are external from the anus, then their nature is light and easy: it is as if you seize them with your nail, or seize them with a tweezers, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	 Then care for them with what I have said until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	 And whoever abhors the incision with iron, then it is necessary that you administer suture for them in this way.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	 Take a thread wound around, and insert it into the point.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	 Then extract the objects towards the upper part, and let it penetrate with the point into the root from the other side: and wind up two ends of the thread, on the lower part of the point, and let them be broad: and tie the objects tightly with a strong ligature.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	 Then knot the thread, and extract the point.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	 Do this with all the objects, and leave one of them: do not seize it yourself, so that excess of blood may flow from it.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	 Then place a cloth soaked in rose oil or pitch on the anus and place it on the anus: and command the sick person to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	 Then let him go until he falls asleep.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 When the objects fall out, care for them with ointments and the rest of the treatment until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	 On the treatment of fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	 For they often occur due to evacuation of feces and constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	 When they have been long standing and no medicine is of use for them: then it is necessary to shave with spatula or nail until they become moist, and the upper layer which prevents their consolidation should be removed from them.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	 Then take care of them until they heal as required.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	 If they do not heal: then sharpen them more forcefully than before, until they bleed much and are opened again, then take care of them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	 On the treatment of sores that are not inverted and those that are inverted, and about scrofula and ants.
Caput LXXXII.	 Chapter LXXXII.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	 Know that Almirmar is not anything but a round knot similar to the color of the body, like a nail head: it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers: and pain arises from them during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	 Therefore it is necessary to cut what surrounds the nail head and hold it with forceps or a tweezers, and extract it from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	 Then take care of that, and if you wish to cauterize it as described in the previous chapter.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	 From scrofula, there is one raised part, a small and rough, filtered, round swelling above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	 And they often occur on boys' hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	 The treatment for it is to stretch the scrofula and cut into it, or sew it with silk thread, or with hair until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	 If you wish, cauterize it with fire or sharp medicine, as mentioned before; and now the inverted scrofula and the non-inverted scrofula are removed with an instrument which I will describe.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	 Formica is also a small pimple that is filtered and coarse on the surface of the body, penetrating deeply; and when it is found cold, it feels like a bite of an ant in it, and it becomes throughout the body; and it mostly happens in hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	 And the treatment of it is that you take a reed from a goose's feather or a strong bird's feather; and place the reed on the pimple, until the circle of the reed contains its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	 Then turn your hand with the reed until it separates what is in the pimple's circuit; and place it in the flesh's depth, and pull out the pimple from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	 And if you wish, do this with a reed of air or iron, in this manner.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	 Let the upper end of the reed be pulled to its limit, wrapped in something soft, so that it may be relieved when grasped by the finger and its rotation.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	 And if you wish to cauterize the pimple according to what was mentioned before in the caution of Athelil, in the chapter on cautery.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	 Chapter on instruments for administering to fumigations for diseases of the anus, and solutions of the stomach, and colics.
Caput LXXXIII.	 Chapter LXXXIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	 When fumigations are made of silver, gold, copper, or tin-bronze (malachite).
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	 And sometimes one of these instruments is small, and large, according to those in whom it is used.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	 Therefore, that which is administered for the treatment of small children should be small. And as regards those with weak anuses or painful ones, so too should their clysters.
Clistere magnum.	 Large clyster.
Cistere paruum.	 Small clyster.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	 The head of the cannula, i.e., the upper part where it is tied to the uterus, should be wide according to this method. It should have a distinction so that it can be tied to the uterus as you see, and its lower end, which is inserted into the anus, should be closed, i.e., not open, soft, very flexible, drawing towards subtlety. And on one of its sides there should be two holes, and in the other side there should be one hole.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	 And let the size of the hole be according to the thickness of the radishes, and slightly larger than that, and let the uterus in which medicines are placed be that made from the bladder of an animal or from goatskin, which should be small like an asphorate with a root of one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	 And it should be perforated by many holes as is customary, and the space between each hole should be the thickness of a finger.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	 Then insert into those holes a thread, perhaps made of raw silk, which should be from ten threads or about that, and bind it with it like an asphorate.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	 When the cannula is placed in the uterus, tie the clyster at its head with a strong constriction between two of its distinctions.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	 Then clysterize it (the uterus) with that.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	 And this is the shape of a circle and holes as depicted here.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	 The quality of clysterizing with it is: to fill the uterus or bladder with medicine which should be heated according to the tolerance of the sick person, and take care that it is not too hot or too cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	 Then the sick person lies down on his back and raises his legs towards above: and place under him a skin or linen, that is, a hide upon which people lie, or a cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	 Then pour oil, or lard, or fenugreek mucilage on the extremity of the Clisteris (clisterium).
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	 Then insert it gently into the anus.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	 Then let the assistant take the bladder with both his hands and squeeze it strongly until all that is in the clisterium (clisterium) has passed into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	 Then remove the clisterium, and let the sick person raise his legs towards the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	 If the medicine causes him to discharge, then hold as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	 And if he sleeps all night with it, it is more helpful in his recovery.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	 If the clisterium does not help him with abdominal diseases and he quickly discharges: then repeat the clisterium until he is cured.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	 If there are hemorrhoids or wounds in the anus: then let the clisterium be very subtle, very soft, from those clisteria with which boys are cleansed.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	 And this should be the shape of a subtle clisterium, upon which the skin is tightened.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	 Chapter on the treatment of head wounds without bone fracture.
Caput LXXXIIII.	 Chapter 84.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	 I have already said in the division of treating wounds that it belongs to a book, and here I will say about their treatment with hands and with medicine as a supplement.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	 Therefore, I say that wounds are diversified according to the cause of the wound and according to the place where the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	 Therefore, the causes of wounds are as numerous as the thrown stone: cut with a sword or knife: struck with a spear, stick, or arrow: and similar things from various objects.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	 Wounds that are made according to the parts of the body are, for example, a wound on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the abdomen, or the back: and similar ones from these members.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	 And I am telling cures for some wounds, in order to lay down reasoning and rule for the rest of the wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	 And I shall begin with simple wounds of the head, since the memory of composite wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	 Therefore, I say.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	 If there is a simple wound on the head and no bone is fractured, consider whether it was caused by a blow from a stone or similar objects, and only the skin has been broken; and if the wound is large, and you fear an imminent abscess of hot pus, then hasten and make a phlebotomy (letting blood) from the head immediately; do not delay this, and draw out as much blood as the strength of the patient allows, provided there is nothing prohibiting a phlebotomy, especially if little blood is flowing out from the wound.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	 And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wounded part.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	 And let the weak patient avoid being filled with food and drink, and heavy foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	 If anything prevents a reduction (of the wound), then let there be a reduction in food, and avoid approaching meat or wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	 Place on the wound if a hot abscess occurs, warm compresses soaked only in rose oil or with wine in which there is soap.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	 If you are free from a hot abscess, then place on the wound if it is recent with its own blood and has not been exposed to air, and then wait a little while, and if the air has already changed, then place some ointment on it until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	 If the wound is large or from a sword cut and similar ones: and its edges are not brought together by pits, then gather it up with sutures, as I shall speak about in the wounds of the abdomen regarding their suturing.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	 If the wound has already been exposed by a bone and is hanging, and there is no retention of it except in a small suspension: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	 Then take care of the wound with medicines, and restore the hard flesh to its place in the skin, and tell the weak one to eat thick foods such as heads (of animals) and boiled wheat, until it becomes soft; and similar things.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	 If you find corruption (rot) in the skin and it is not adhering to bone: then cut away the rotten part, and throw it out; then take care of that.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	 If, however, in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which blood flows, and it cannot be separated by medicines, then ask about the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	 If you find it uncut, then cut it with a spatula or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If there is a need and it does not obey what has been said, then cauterize it until the blood separates.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	 If these wounds are small and simple, then the matter is easy and light; in such a way that you sprinkle this powder on them: because it solidifies them before they change to air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	 Recipe puluellum albi, molae de caule aquileae, et bicarbonatum;
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	 Take one part of olibanum (frankincense), two parts of dragon's blood (cruor draconis), and three parts of unquents non extinctae (unburnt pitch); grind all together very finely, and strain it; fill the wound with it and tighten it with a good constriction, until it adheres well above it and coagulates with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	 Then bind it from above with threads, and leave it alone, do not untie it while it remains, so that it does not become undone.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	 The medicine is not to be removed from him until he is well.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	 And sometimes a plaster made of lime alone is used when there is no olibanum or dragon's blood available at hand. Even dragon's blood performs the same function in many serious wounds when it is necessary to put it on and bind them, and the wounds are fresh with blood that has not been affected by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	 If air has already affected the wound in some way, especially during summertime, then this powder is not effective. Therefore, treat it as we have said, by putting something digestive ointment over it, or applying poultices made of barley flour mixed with water and honey until pus is emitted.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	 Then treat the remaining part of the wound with the rest of the cure until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	 If a fracture occurs with the wound in the bone, and it is small, then extract it with trephine; I will now speak about the treatment of skull fractures, which follows.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	 Chapter on neck wounds.
Caput LXXXV.	 Chapter 85.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	 If a wound occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple skull wound.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	 If the nerve or artery of the neck has already been cut, if it is a nerve, there is no skill in treating it except to prevent its intense stiffness with remedies such as zinjar and zegeh, and similar ones.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	 Because they harm the nerves and contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	 And do not put anything cold at all on the wound because the substance of nerves is cold and they are continuous with the brain, which is above the body's organs; let what is applied for treatment be made from soft medicines like lime mixed with sweet water several times infused with oil or rose oil, or with tuthia when it is also washed with sweet water; and other mineral stones, in this way, as well as moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	 If however the wound is large, then administer suture; or sew together its irregular edges with small catgut.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	 If however the wound is deep and there occurs a cavity at its lower part which already collects pus, then open it up more deeply in that place.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	 If an artery has already been cut in the wound and there is bleeding from it; then separate, or cut it off, and tie it; or cauterize it if necessity requires this.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	 If however the cartilage of the throat has been cut, either entirely or partially, and the windpipe is spared; then bring together the edges of the skin with suture on top of the windpipe, and do not touch the windpipe; instead lift it up, and place it back in its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	 Then close it by stitching with a suitable suture, and let it rest for some days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointments containing styptics and astringents until it heals.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	 If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then explore it; if there are fragments of bone in it, extract all of them or as many as possible; and what cannot be prepared for removal, leave it until the ulcer rots, separates and drains away naturally.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	 If the wound is recent, then dust powder over it as I have said.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	 If a bone appears in the wound and a fistula forms; then care for it with the remedy that comes up in its own chapter.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	 Chapter on wounds in plates or shields.
Caput LXXXVI.	 Chapter LXXXVI.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	 If it is a wound from a spear or knife; and you can see its depth, then examine it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	 If therefore a wound discharges pus, when, being ill, one breathes from it, then you know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	 If it does not have depth and is recent with its own blood: then do not put powder in it from the first hour nor tie it up so that blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart and kills the sick one; but put on it attracting ointment, and dissolve it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	 If however ointment is not present with you, then put on the wound's opening an old piece of cotton to absorb what discharges from it by humidity; and make the sick one sleep over the wound so that what collects in it may run off.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	 If however three days or more have passed from the wound, and no spasm occurs to the sick one nor a bad heart tremor nor difficulty in breathing, and you see that his other conditions are good; then know that the wound is healthy.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Treat him then with linen cloths and the rest of the treatment until he is healed.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	 If however his healing breaks open again and it keeps opening, then know that it has become a fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	 Treat the fistula from its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	 And if the wound is from a sword or knife cut and simple on the surface of the chest or back; then treat it with that which came before from suture, if it is large; or with powder, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	 If however it has made an impression on the bone and cut off fragments from it; then look for the wound and rush to extract those fragments if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	 If however they are not separated, then leave them alone until the wound rots, for extraction is painful.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	 Judgement for treating other types of wounds on remaining limbs is the same as what we have previously mentioned.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	 On abdominal wounds and the evacuation of intestines, and their treatment.
Caput LXXXVII.	 Chapter LXXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	 A rupture that occurs in the abdomen can be great, medium or small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	 From a great rupture, sometimes the intestine or number of intestines evacuate.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	 Therefore insertion and stitching is necessary for them, and the stitching is more forceful and difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	 A small rupture also causes difficulty in a different way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	 Therefore, the reduction of them is more difficult if you do not hurry to insert it into its place immediately; because it inflates, opens and swells, which makes the entrance difficult.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	 Therefore, a medium rupture is better because with it the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is in these two types [small and great].
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	 Know that the stitching of the abdomen is done according to four methods.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	 Two types of stitching are common to abdominal stitching and stitching for other body wounds; and two other types of stitching are specific to other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	 However, they are more specific for abdominal stitching; and I will tell you one by one with an explanation and clarification.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	 Therefore, if the wound is small and something from the intestine comes out of it and reduction becomes difficult; then that is due to one of two methods.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	 Or because of the smallness of the rupture, as we have said; or because there is inflation in the intestine due to cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	 When this is the case, then it is necessary to heat it up so that you immerse a sponge or damp cloth in warm water.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	 Boil in water squill (squinant), daisy (cyperus), spike and broom in it, until the swelling is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	 Sometimes this decoction makes wine that has a stypic property: and it is better than water alone for resolving swelling.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	 When therefore you see the swelling already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which the wormwood (althea or artemisia) has been boiled, or with mallow (malva).
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	 For this purpose an opening is prepared for it with a small instrument.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	 If however the return (reflux) is lost after this treatment, then close the wound slightly with an instrument for hemorrhoids cutting.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	 And the first cure is better when it is prepared than section; and there should not be compulsion to cut after necessity and lack of instruments.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	 Let it have one part that is twisted, pointed, and another part not pointed, and the end should not be subtle like a spatula, rather it should be slightly blunt; and it resembles a shoemaker's awl, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	 When the wound is enlarged and the intestine enters, then it should return to its natural shape in its own place, if possible above it; because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	 But when the wound is wide at the lower part of the belly; then you must make the weak person lie on his back and place his legs higher than his head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	 And if it is at the upper part of the belly; then raise the head and chest higher than the lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	 And similarly if the wound is on one of the two parts of the belly, then keep your attention and consideration always in this: so that the part where the wound is should be higher than the other part.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	 And thus it is necessary to apply it to large wounds and to medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 In small wounds, place it accordingly as it has been prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	 Then make sure that a faithful servant is present among your hands, who holds the entire tear with his hand and brings the lips together.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	 Then take something from it for the one who follows to sew, and this is the common method of suture for one.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	 And it is that you receive a needle or the number of needles according to the size of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	 Then let go from the edge of the tear a length equal to a finger, that is, the doctor's; and sew in one needle beyond which you insert the thread into both sides of the skin, with both ends of the sifac (that is below the skin) from within, until you make it pass through from the other side, and you have already brought together the two sides of the skin and the two ends of the sifac; and there are four rows.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	 Then sew with double thread around the point of the needle several times from both sides together, until the two lips of the wound are brought together by a suitable approximation.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	 Then let go the thickness of a finger and sew again with another needle; then draw it back with thread, as you did with the first needle.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	 Therefore do not cease to do this with the one you need from among the needles until you complete the closure of the entire wound.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 And let the needles be of medium thickness between coarseness and finesse; because fine needles penetrate the flesh too quickly, and coarse ones are difficult to enter the skin; therefore, it is necessary that they be medium in finesse and coarseness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	 And it is not necessary to sew the needle in the two sides of the skin that are close together; so as not to penetrate the flesh too quickly and open the wound before its consolidation, and not to elongate when sutured, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidating.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	 Then cut the end of the onion so as not to harm the sick person during his sleep; and place small cloths around its ends, and leave them until you know that the wound is already healed.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	 And this manner of stitching with onions is indeed more suitable for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	 Because one or two onions, or about the same number, are sufficient for their stitching.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	 The second stitch is common, where you bring together the edges of four: the edges, two of skin, and two of fat (in place of one), with an onion that has the thread wound equally fine and coarse around it.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	 Then when you pierce with the onion these four edges, remove the onion from the side where you began, so that the thread protruding from the upper part of the wound falls out; in this way the stitch is made, like a stitch with cloths as they sew clothes, and place between every stitch an amount of thickness equal to that of a little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	 This stitch is known to men.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	 And with this stitch I sewed up my own wound which had happened to a man in his abdomen, who had been wounded with a knife, and the wound was larger than a span; and about two spans had come out from the small intestine, and the tear was in the middle of the abdomen.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	 I therefore sewed it up again when his intestines had stopped coming out for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	 The wound had therefore healed in about fifteen days; and I cured him, and he recovered; and he lived for many years afterwards, converted to his own dispositions.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	 And the physicians judged that he would not recover.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	 And it was a miracle that I did not cure it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	 Since I was in a place where no ointment could be found nor any medicine.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	 I therefore put an old pot over the wound twice a day and kept washing it with water of honey until it was healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	 I will now describe two types of suture according to the narrative of the speech.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	 And it is, when you begin with sharp stitching: and you insert the needle from the outside to the inside part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	 When the needle penetrates the skin and follows the length and width of the entire body: release the end of the thread on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate the other end from the inside to the outside at the opposite end.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	 When you have made it penetrate [the thread], then make it penetrate in the same end as follows: from the outside to the inside; and release the end of the thread on the side where you inserted it, and make the needle penetrate the other end from the inside to the outside; and make the penetration go through with your penetration that you are making in the end of the thread, which is in that part, until it penetrates completely.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	 Then also begin from the same side, and take hold of it with the end which is on the other side of the thread; and remove the needle from the skin that it penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	 Then return it to the same skin, and take hold of the other end of the thread with this end; and remove it from the skin that is on its side, and do the same thing again, and the other, and so on until you secure it all outside according to this example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	 The summary of this suture is that you should sew the skin of animals such as hides: in such a way that one end of the thread is on one side of the skin, and the other end is released on the opposite side, until you complete it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	 Second type of simple suture, as Galenus said.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	 This speech is told in such a way as some physicians do it, aggregating all parts to their corresponding part by nature; and they apply the end of the sifac to its other end, and the end of the mirach to the end of another part.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	 And that is done according to what I tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	 It is necessary that you fix the point of the needle near the end of the mirach on the outer side and let it penetrate to the inside only; and leave two ends of the sifac.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	 Then turn the needle and let it penetrate from the outer side to the inside through both ends of the sifac.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	 Then turn both and let both penetrate from the inside to the outside through two ends of the mirach on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	 And this method of suture is better than common easy suture, and it is the suture which is mentioned previously.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	 Therefore, this is also the speech of Galenus.
Et dixerunt quidam.	 And some said.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	 The suture of the abdomen is sewn with two needles.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	 Insert the thread into each of them (the two ends of the abdomen to be sewn) and begin with the insertion of the needle from where it is with you, letting it penetrate to the other side according to the equal stitch of those who sew leather equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	 And know that when the break is in the middle of the abdomen, then the suture of it is more difficult than that of other parts of the abdomen.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	 The judgment of the dressing of wounds is the judgment of all wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	 When you catch a fresh wound with its own blood before it changes due to air, and you reduce the intestines, tie them, and prepare them; then place it on powdered meat.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	 If the wound has already changed (for the worse): then place upon it certain ointments which are present to you, until they cause pus; and let the threads fall out, and may it heal well and be closed up.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for that wound as one would care for other wounds, until it is healed.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	 If there are no medications available to you, then immediately place upon it something old and warm; and change it twice a day as I have taught you, until it is healed.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	 For you do not need other medicines when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	 If you fear that the wound may communicate with the main limbs upon injury, then it is necessary to immerse a soft wool in warm oil or rose oil; and place it around the areas which are between the groins, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	 If it feels pain, or punctures, or rotting in the bowels (for this often happens), then cleanse it with warm stiptic wine, black; especially if the rotting has already reached the intestine, and it becomes a penetrating issue as deep as its concavity.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	 And know this, that what comes from the large intestine is easier to heal; and what comes from the small intestine, is harder to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	 The intestine which is called Jejunum does not heal from a wound that occurs in it at all; and this is because of the multitude of its veins, and their size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	 If what comes out from the wound is pus, and you follow it recently: bring it back according to your normal reduction of the intestines.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 If the specified time has passed and it has already turned green or black: then it is necessary to tie it with a thread above the discolored spot, so that there is no bleeding.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	 In it there are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	 Then cut what is beyond that ligament and place two ends of the thread hanging from below on the wound side, outside it: to relieve the pulling of it toward you, and to draw out at the risk of the instrument the pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	 Reminder of a wound that occurs in the Intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	 When there is a rupture in the Intestine and it is small: then it is possible for some people to be restored: because I have seen one who was wounded in his belly with a spear blow, and the wound was on the right of the stomach, and the wound was old: and it became a Fistula, and exuded feces, and gas.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	 I therefore treated it until I was not doubtful about its healing: nor did I cease to probe it, until it was healed and the place had become solid.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	 After I saw the place had become solid, I feared for the weak person, that an accidental evil would happen to him in his belly: and it did not happen to him from that accidental evil.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	 And he remained in better conditions for himself, eating and drinking, urinating, and went into the bath, and was active in his regimen.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	 And some experimentalists said that when a wound occurs in the Intestine and it is small: then it should be tied up according to this method.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	 It is, that you receive large-headed ants.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	 Then join two edges of the wound and place one ant with an open mouth on the two edges of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	 When therefore [the] head is placed on it, and the head is tightened, cut off its head, for it adheres, and does not loosen.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	 Then place another ant near the first one, and do not cease to perform this until the ant after the ant according to the size of the whole wound.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	 Then draw it back, and suture the wound.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	 For these heads remain attached in the intestine until it is fed, and healed, and no harm befalls the sick one entirely.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	 And now it is possible that the intestine can be tied even with a fine thread; what has been removed from the intestine of the animal, being attached to it when inserted into the point.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	 And it is to take the end of this thread from the intestine and remove a lot of flesh.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	 Then tie a thread of fine linen at its end.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	 Then insert the thread into the point, and suture it with the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	 Then draw it back to the rupture.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	 And this method of suturing with ants and intestine, is not but by the way of confidence and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	 Know that a large wound, wide, especially if it is in one of the thin intestines; then there is no artifice, nor is its healing altogether.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	 Chapter on Zuchomen (ulcer) care, and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	 Chapter LXXXVIII.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	 Know that every wound, or abscess when it becomes old and decayed, and becomes an ulcer, and does not consolidate, and always emits pus, and does not heal; then it is called universally in whatever member it may be Fistula, and we call it Zuchomen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	 And Fistula indeed is according to truth a knot filtered, hard, white; with which there is no pain, which has the hollow of a bird's feather pen; and for this reason some call it Risati, that is, feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	 And there are certain hours that emit pus, which is moist.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	 Perhaps the moisture splits in some hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	 And at times this moisture is abundant and at times it is scant; and it is thick and at times it is subtle.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	 And now I have passed on to the division [of the subject], when I said wounds; for every sore that does not heal and is not generated within it flesh, is not that except because of one of nine causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	 One of these is when it is due to the scarcity of blood in the body; or its badness; or because within and on top of it there is hard flesh, which prevents the generation of flesh; or because there is much dirt and filthiness; or because the sore itself is putrid and the matter that is sent to it is of bad quality; or because the medicine is inappropriate for its healing; or because corruption falling in the region is a kind of pestilence, as happens in Caesaraugusta, where the digestion of diseases is difficult and healing of ulcers through nature is delayed; or because there is one bone or number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	 And I have now shown all these causes and their signs, and the cures of them with medicines in the division; it is necessary here that I make you know the cure for fistula and zucchus, which is done by the way of operation with hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	 Therefore, you should know that fistula occurs in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	 For from these are fistulae that reach to large veins and arteries, nerves or joints; or intestines, bladder, or one of the ribs; or to one of the vertebrae of the back, or to any of the connecting parts composed of them: such as hands and feet; and from these are those that approach the proximity of a main member and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	 That which is of these fistulas according to this method, is difficult for healing, and does not receive cure, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	 If it is one of the fistulas whose depth does not reach to those places which I said: and you hope, believe in its cure, and wish to attain knowledge about it, then take a probe made from bronze or iron, if the fistula is straight, and examine it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	 If there is a twist in the fistula, then investigate it with a fine probe made of lead.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	 Because lead, due to its flexibility, can be easily bent according to the twist.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	 If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to sign it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	 Cauterize therefore from its openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	 For the moisture with which you cauterize it, goes towards other openings and runs out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	 Then investigate and inquire according to the way that is possible for you: so that you may know if there is a bone or nerve there, and if the fistula has a deep concavity, far or near; or if it is one with many openings, which stands over all of it, with the greatest strength of your hand, when questioning the sick, and discovering pain upon compression with your hand on the spot, and similar signs and causes of injury.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 When you have stood steadfast over all of these with true certainty, then proceed to cure according to your confidence: and consider then if the fistula is near an apparent one, or in a distant safe place away from union, nerve, artery, vein, or any of the places which I have told you; then cut the fistula according to what has been said in my narrative, remove what is in it from filtration and rotten flesh, which is born in its opening out of meat, fat, and similar things; and care for it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	 If a fistula is deep-seated and straight: then it should be cut as deeply as possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	 Then clean it from all the rotten flesh of its own.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	 Then wrap a linen cloth around the fistula with sharp medicines and insert it as far as you reach the depression of the fistula with iron: do this frequently, until the sharp medicine corrodes everything that remains in the depression of the fistula due to decay.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	 Then restore it with unguents which promote healthy flesh until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	 But if it does not heal through this, then cauterize it as we have said before.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	 If the cause of the fistula is bone and it has been confirmed to you: then investigate it and cut it as I have told you; if it does not prevent you from cutting anything from the vein, or nerve, or major limb, as we have said before.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	 If you find bone and there is something decayed and blackened within it: then scrape it until the decay is completely removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with what cures it to make it heal.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	 But if it does not heal and emits pus like before: then you know that you have not completely removed the decay.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	 Investigate further over it, and find out the reason for it and clean it with all your might.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	 Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	 If it heals, it is good; and if not, then you know that the decay is in a deep-seated part of the body which you did not reach.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	 Therefore, you do not have skill in it unless you allow nature to take its course.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	 If a small bone is decayed and can be reached by you, draw it out with fine forceps that fit the place.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	 If there are many bones, then carefully draw them all out without leaving anything behind with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	 If something occurs to you from the moist parts and there is no fear or mistake in cutting them: then cut those moist parts and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	 If you are not prepared to remove the bones at your time, then place something over the wound that will rot it and let it go until it rots what is around those bones from the flesh and moist parts.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	 And keep the wound so that it does not harden.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	 And contract the incision which you cut during your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	 Place over it, if you fear, a piece of copper submerged in crushed sulfur with oil; or a piece of copper submerged in Egyptian ointment, or any green ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	 For when those moist parts rot and the bones separate from them, remove them and draw out the bones.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	 If there is a single large bone, such as the shin bone or hip bone and similar ones, and what has been corrupted from it is a large part: then shave it with the final rasp, until that blackness and corruption is removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	 Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	 If what is in it has become a large part and corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to saw it and cut it completely until the corruption stops; then care for it until it hardens.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	 And I tell you about a woman who had a problem with her leg: place this example and help for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	 A young man of about thirty years had pain in his leg due to a cause that moved within it from inside the body until the matter reached the leg and an abscess formed, which was large; there was no external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	 The incision has therefore been made at the same time as the error of the physicians, until the abscess was opened, and many materials have gathered together with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	 And the treatment of it was delayed until the leg ulcerated, and many openings were made in it: which all emitted pus, and moisture of the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	 Therefore, the crowd of physicians treated it for about two years, and there was no skill in healing hands among them until I was called, and I saw his leg, and the materials that were flowing out from those openings at a great speed: even the whole body of the man had already become swollen, and his color was yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	 I therefore inserted a probe into one of the openings, and it reached the bone.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	 Then I examined all the openings: and found that they were penetrating each other from all parts of the leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	 I therefore approached, and cut through one of the openings until I exposed a piece of bone: and I found it corroded: which was already corroded, blackened, rotten, pierced, and penetrated up to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	 I therefore sawed what had been exposed to me, and prepared it from the corroded bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	 And I assigned, that there was no part of the bone except for that corruption, which I had cut off and sawed.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	 And I had already removed it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	 Then I placed a restoration of the wound with firming medicines at a distance.
Et non est consolidatum.	 And it is not solidified.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	 Then I tried again, and exposed a second bone above the first exposure: and I found continuous corrosion with the bone: and I sawed what appeared to me also from that corrosion.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	 And then I attempted a restoration of it.
Et non est restauratum.	 And it is not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	 I therefore examined it again and did not cease to cut the bone piece by piece, and tried to restore it; and it was not restored until I cut about one palm's length of bone and pulled it out with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	 Then I healed it with medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and cured; and this repetition in the operation and section of it was not necessary, except for the disposition of weakness in the patient, the scarcity of his tolerance, and my fear of death; since it often happened to him at all hours from an excess of evacuation syncopes bad.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	 It was therefore completely cured; and there grew in the place of the bone tough flesh, and good arrangements were made in his body, and his strength returned; and he turned to his own dispositions; and no harm at all was done to him by walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	 If, however, the projecting bone in the body is already broken; then it is necessary that you bind it thus: and this is to take a ligament, and tighten it at the end of the protruding bone; and order someone to stretch it upwards; and place another thicker ligament of wool around it first.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	 Then bind it over the flesh that is on the bone; and extend its end, so that you may pull the flesh downwards; and you will uncover the flesh over the place which you want to sew, so that the saw does not harm the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	 Place a stick or board underneath the bone below; because when you do that, it is not forbidden to cut the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	 And it is necessary that the saw is over the corrupted place a little, so that there is no corruption in the hollow of the bone; and it does not appear to the senses when viewed, and forces another to be its substitute for the saw.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	 If the bone is corrupt and not projecting, but rather continuous with a part of it, and the corruption is in the middle or a part of it: then excise all the flesh from every part.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	 Then place the log below (it).
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	 Next, saw that (part) from the affected side where the corruption is, until it reaches the other side of the incision; and let the saw-cut be shorter than the corruption length, as we said before.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	 If the corruption is at a joint, cut through the affected joint and saw the bone where it connects from the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	 But if the corruption is between two joints, then it is not a fracture but an abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	 If the corruption is at the beak of the hand or foot: then matters in it are very difficult.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	 However, you must examine the corruption to see how it appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	 And abrade it, and cleanse it according to any possible arrangement for you, and with whatever skill available to you: when it does not cause you opposition from Vein or Nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	 And know that the saws and saws for cutting these bones are many according to the position of the bones, their preparation, and their size, sharpness, magnitude, smallness, hardness, and scarcity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	 Therefore, you must prepare every kind of instrument suitable for the operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	 And know that these operations indicate to you the type of instrument you need, when your study has been prolonged.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	 And the knowledge of the methods of this art is a testimony to the methods of illnesses: then you will find for yourself that which suits it from among the instruments for every ailment.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	 And I confirm to you at the end of this chapter's number of instruments, which you will place examples upon that you cut into, and a proof by which you test on others.
Forma Serrae.	 Form of the Saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	 Form of another Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 Form of yet another Saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	 Form of another Saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	 This form of the Saw should be well made.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	 Make the upper part of its arch, sharpen it from iron; and let its handle be made of boxwood, and let it be pyramidal shaped well.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	 Form of the Razor for joints.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	 Let the head of this Razor be in the shape of a star-headed nail's head; and its points be in the shape of the points of an enchased nail.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	 And it is not suitable, unless they are rubbed with the heads of connected joints when they are corrupted, or a large and great bone.

Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	 Form of the Scraper suitable for scraping that which has been pierced from bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	 Its end is triangular and its points are sharp.
Fit ex Indi.	 It is made of India (ivory).
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	 And likewise, everything that we have said should be made from Scrapers, Chisels, and Saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	 Chapter on the Incision of Edges and Sawing of Bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	 Chapter LXXXIX (89).
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	 Extremities become putrefied either from external cause or internal cause.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	 When you have treated the corruption with medicines and the cure does not improve and you see that corruption is spreading into the member which it did not affect previously: then it is necessary to cut that member as far as where the corruption appears, so that the weak part may escape death or a greater evil due to the defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	 And a sign of this is that the member turns black until it seems rotten; that fire has burned it itself or it becomes putrid after turning black: until the rot is cut as far as the following member and it creeps throughout the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	 Approach therefore with the incision of his, and similarly if the cause of corruption is from the strike of certain venomous things such as the marine scorpion, viper, weasel, and similar creatures.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	 If the corruption or striking is at the extremity of a finger, then incise the finger, and do not leave room for spreading (of the corruption), until it reaches the rest of the hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	 And similarly if it happens in a hand, then incise it from the root of the wrist, and do not leave room for spreading (of the corruption), until it reaches the forearm.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	 And if it spreads within it (the wound), then incise the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	 If the corruption passes through and you see him about an elbow's length, then it is death of a weak person.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	 And beyond that (the treatment), the amount is virtue (of the medicine).
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	 And similarly with a foot, when corruption spreads to the toe, then cut it at one of the joints; and if it reaches the heel of the foot, then cut off the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	 If it rises to the knee, then cut off the leg at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	 If corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no help except for release and to leave the weak person to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	 And the manner of cutting a limb, or sewing it is that you bind (tie) the ligament at the lower end, which you wish to cut, and tie another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	 And let one attendant stretch the ligament to the lower part, and let another attendant stretch the other ligament upward.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	 And you separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments with a broad (blade), until all the flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	 Then it is cut or sewn.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	 And it is necessary that you place a clean linen cloth over all the parts and not touch a healthy place with the blade; and for a weak person, an additional injury occurs and a hot abscess.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	 If however bleeding occurs internally while you are operating, then cauterize the place quickly; or place some powders on top of it that absorb blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	 Then return to your treatment, until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then tie the wounded member with an appropriate ligature and take care of it, until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	 And I tell you what happened to a man in his foot, the same thing that I told you happened.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	 It is that, because blackness occurs in his foot, resembling the burning of fire; and the rot starts first in one of his toes, until it began to affect the entire foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	 Therefore, the man came out of himself after he saw the rot spreading in his limb with severity, which he found from pain and burning; and he cut it off at the joint, and he healed.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	 And after a long time had passed for him, the same rot occurred in one of his fingers on his index hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	 Therefore, he came to me and I attempted to recover the amputated part using medicines on his hand after cleansing his body; but the amputation was not recovered, and it began to affect another finger until the rot affected his entire hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	 He therefore called me to cut off his hand; and I refused it, hoping for a recovery of the amputated part in me; and I also feared death itself for him at the cutting of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	 Because the man was of great strength.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	 Therefore, after he had given up on me, he returned to his own land; and he came to me again because he was in a hurry, and cut off his entire hand; and he healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	 I did not bring this narrative unless it should be of help for what falls under the genus of this illness; and in order to signify what is meant, and according to which procedure it is to be carried out.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	 On the treatment of nosebleeds, and the quality of clysterization with medications.
Caput XC.	 Concerning the Treatment of Nosebleeds and Cly
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	 When a boil occurs in some fleshly members and the duration of the boil extends until it collects pus: then it bursts or is perforated and what is inside the boil exits as pus and leaves a hollow place like a vessel: and the skin that is on top of it becomes thin like a cloth that has been softened: and it does not reach its ultimate corruption, nor presses upon a bone, nor a nerve, nor a ligament: it deserves to be called a Sinus: and it is not named a Fistula: however, if the duration of its hollow space extends until corruption spreads into one of these members, then it is named a Fistula or zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	 And its treatment is that you should cut the entire skin as it is rolled: and especially when it has become thin like cloth: and trust that it will not adhere to the place because of its corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	 But if you hope that the skin will adhere and this ultimate corruption does not follow: and if there is a thickness in the skin from flesh: then treat it with Clisterium: and know that it concerns a Sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	 Then if it is large and the pus that is emitted from it has a foul odor: then clisterize it with medicine from Egypt, which is vinegar, oil, and zinnia, taking equal parts, to be mixed in a jar: and boil them over fire until the medicine turns red: and let it come to the consistency of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	 Then take what is necessary from it: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clisterize the Sinus with it: and compress its opening, and let the medicine be released into it to the quantity of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	 Then remove it along with pus expression: make this daily until the sinus is purified and the stink is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	 Also, when you are not present for this medication, clisterize with ashes water: and it is to receive the ashes of vinewood, or the ashes from holm oak; and throw water over it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	 Then wash (it) and clisterize with it until you trust that the sinus is now cleaned.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	 If the patient cannot bear the Egyptian medicine or ash water, then clisterize it with water and honey, which already has something mixed in of crushed gum.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	 Or clisterize it with honey and wine mixed, because honey has the property to purify and wash (it), and wine makes the sinus sticky, especially when there is an excess of dryness and dryness in the wine.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	 When you do it several times and trust that the sinus corruption has been removed: then clisterize it with what makes flesh grow in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	 And it is to receive from the ointment dyafinicon: and dissolve it with rose oil and stiptic wine; or clisterize it with certain medications and other unguents whose properties I have written in the treatise on unguents.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	 If the sinus opening is narrow and cannot receive the clisteris cannula: then expand it slightly with iron; or place linen folded in Egyptian ointment, or basilicon ointment inside until it is expanded.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	 And similarly, if the opening is also wide, then join its lips with suture: and allow a quantity for the clisteris to enter without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	 And similarly, if the opening from which pus flows is elevated to the top: then cut it at a lower place that is within it, so that pus runs out below; because when the pus is constricted in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from growing in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it is not possible for you to cut the bladder about below it as you wish: then try, so that you prepare the member for running out pus with ease according to its preparation for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	 Try not to retain anything of the pus within it at all: and take remedies that are put on top of the mark, suitable for what you wish.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	 And stretch them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	 And let the cloth be of such a size that there is communication with the entire bladder.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	 Then cut with scissors into the opening of the bladder the hole of the bladder more widely than the bladder opening itself.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	 Then stretch out from soft ointments over another cloth according to the size of the hole: and place it on top of itself at a distance long from the bladder opening, so that the exit of the pus is eased: and do not remove the large cloth unless after several days with one exception.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	 The one who is on the bladder opening, that is the one you remove at every hour, so that what accumulates in it from the pus may exit: and so that you know if what runs out of it is much or little; or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	 And with this repeatedly consider the place of the bladder itself, if its master feels pain there or not; and whether there is a tumor there or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	 When your medication is thus extended and you see the matter that exits from the bladder opening, then you know if the bladder already adheres or approaches to adhesion: then soluble it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you soluble the wound, then change the cloth and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	 If it exits from the bladder after a long time subtle pus, then do not despair of its adhesion, for its healing is approaching, because there are people who slow down the generation of flesh in their wounds and there are those who act contrary to this.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	 If however it comes out from the Sinus after many days as an un-digested pus, then you know that the sinus is not adherent.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	 If the adherence of the sinus is delayed and prolonged, then add moist medicines in the excision. However, physicians should do this, so that the medicines are moist in substance but dry in effect, such as the unguent dyafinicon, when it is added to it, excess should be avoided from zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	 And from the remedy that is applied last, it is to receive the unguent dyafinicon, and let it be dissolved with rose oil, and let it be rubbed on top of old wine equal in substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	 Then mix it with that, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	 And now this action is similar when you do not have the unguent dyafinicon, honey, when you boil it until it thickens, and use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	 Or receive myrrh, aloes, and frankincense: grind all of them, and powder it on top of the honey while it is above fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	 Then apply a linen cloth over it, and tie it over the sinus: and line with the honey that you have boiled until it thickens, and powder it over it as a layer, and put it on top of the linen cloth, and tie it up.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	 And sometimes the following is administered in it: long aristolochia root, celestial lily root, and common lily: and flour of herbs, and chamomile.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	 Use these simple substances or mixed ones, grind them and sift the powder: and powder on top of the honey that I mentioned, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	 If the sinus prolongs and is not cured by this treatment: then you know that there is corruption in its depth: either it makes an impression on the bones or on other hard members or ligaments: then cure it with fistula treatment, as was previously mentioned.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	 On the treatment of corns and worn nails, and the incision and section.
Caput XCI.	 De quibusdam cunctis infirmitatibus
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	 Corns are the lesions that occur under the nail of the thumb or big toe, or possibly on other fingers or toes.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	 When the matter prolongs itself and is neglected in its care and it is treated with a hot cautery, or it corrupts and emits pus until it corrodes the root of the nail; and perhaps it corrodes it completely, and perhaps the corruption reaches the bone, until there is a foul smell to it; and the end of the digit becomes wide, and its color becomes dark.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	 When the matter is not cared for as mentioned before, then it is necessary to cut with iron the surplus that remains from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	 Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	 Indeed, cautery is very beneficial.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	 If the bone is healthy and the nail is also healthy, and empty additions of the nail already press the flesh towards the inside, and begin to pierce it, and wound it; then it is necessary to place subtle Radium under the angle of the nail which pierces the flesh, and push it upwards; and cut the flesh with ease, and place on top of what remains of the flesh from medicines that burn, corrosives, until all of it is removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it with ointments until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	 If the corruption has already pressed into the bone, then it is necessary to cut the bone and remove it; for the corrupted bone will never heal while it remains there.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	 If you see the corrosion and corruption advancing in the finger, then cut it at one joint, according to what has been mentioned before about its memory.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 If the nail is rubbed or struck and a very strong pain results, then first apply leeches.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	 Then cut off the nail with the sharp Spathamelus incision from above to below.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	 And beware lest the incision reach the flesh that is beneath the nail, for you will cause a violent pain to occur over it, and it will become a cause of adding flesh at that place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	 Then take care of the spot with it (the oil), so that it alleviates the pains.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	 The finger that is born in some human hands may perhaps be completely fleshy; and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail in it; and some of them are born at the root of the joint, or its birthplace is in some knots of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	 Therefore, the one that is born in some knots of the finger does not move; and the one that is born at the joint of the finger perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	 Its incision (of the flesh-like structure) is easy (to perform).
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	 What you should do is to make an incision at its root with a broad spatula.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	 But the treatment of the one whose birthplace is at the root of the joint is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	 Therefore, refrain from making an incision on it.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	 In the one that is born in the finger at the end of the knots, then it is necessary to make an incision into the flesh with a round incision up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	 Then saw the bone with one of those saws that fit for it.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it (the area) until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	 Consolidation that occurs in the fingers often occurs either from human birth (that is, it is born with the person), or from consolidation of wounds, burns from fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	 Therefore, you must remove that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	 Then place linen or cloth soaked in rose oil between them (the fingers) to prevent rapid consolidation and separate them; or place a thin lead plate between them until the area is healed as required.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly, if consolidation occurs in certain fingers with the palm, then cut off that consolidation, according to how it is prepared and fits the shape of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	 On the Vices of Incision.
Caput XCII.	 Chapter XCII.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	 Uites are swollen veins, large and filled with melancholic superfluities that occur in many parts of the body; and their most frequent occurrence is in the legs, especially in those who travel frequently or work hard, and those who carry heavy loads.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	 Therefore it is necessary to administer the purgation of the body with strong purges from black bile at times.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	 Then bleed the patient through the basilica vein.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	 The cure of them with iron is done in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	 One way is to make an incision and draw out black blood.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	 A different method is to elevate the vein and draw out all of it.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The section, however, is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	 First, irrigate the leg with much hot water until the thick, foul blood is resolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	 Then tie the affected leg from the upper part of the hip to the lower part of the thigh with bandages.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	 Then cut the vein at one, or two, or three wide sections.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	 Then drain the blood from your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and it is necessary that the leech draws the blood from the affected person first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	 Then cut off the nail and continue to drain blood until a sufficient quantity comes out that you can see and that the strength of the affected person can withstand.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	 Next tie it up and tell him to abstain from foods that cause black bile; and repeat the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are filled, as this is harmful for the affected person.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	 The elevation of it, however, is according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	 If the affected leg has many hairs, shave it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	 Then immerse it in the bath; or irrigate it with hot water in the affected leg until it turns red and the veins swell; or exercise it with strong exercises if there is no bath nearby until the limb warms up.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	 Then cut open the skin directly over the vein section along its length; or at the end of it near the knee, or at the lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	 Then open the skin with scalpels and scrape off the vein from all sides until it becomes visible to the touch; and when it appears, you will see it turn from red to black.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	 When it has come out of the skin, you see that it is white like a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	 Then insert the Radium under it until it rises and exits from the skin; suspend it with a blind hook, softly.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	 Then make another cut near that cut with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	 Then scrape the skin from above the vein until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	 Then raise it with Radii and suspend it with another hook as you did before.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	 Then make another cut or several cuts if needed for that one.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	 Then scrape and cut it at the very end of the sole (calcaneum).
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	 Then pull it out through the cut that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	 And do this until you pull it out through the upper cut or any higher cuts until it completely exits; then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	 If it does not obey you to pull and raise it: then insert a strong needle with double thread and tie it, and pull it out; or insert a Radium under it and turn your hand over all parts until it exits.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	 And be careful, it is not cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	 For if it is cut, it will be very difficult for you to raise it and a harm will enter upon the patient from it.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	 When you pull it out completely, then place wool soaked in wine and rose oil or olive oil on the wound site and care for it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	 If the vein is contracted with twists and loops, not as we have said according to straightness: then it is necessary that you find all parts of its twists and the places of its loops.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	 Then suspend it with hooks until you raise it completely; and be careful at your cut on it not to cut the vein or wound: for it will be difficult for you to raise or pull it out.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	 Preserve therefore your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	 The form of the wound heals a vine.
Forma Vncini caeci.	 The form of the blind pouch.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 It is not like other pouches in that it has no scabbing, nor a sharp end which would wound the vein; rather it is of thick and flexible form, soft; for if it were delicate, it would wound the vein by its fineness; but excessive thickness is superfluous as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	 On the extraction of a leg vein.
Caput XCIII.	 Chapter XCIII.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	 This vein is generated in the legs of warm lands, as Al-Zahgi says, and in the lands of Arabs, and in dry, warm, sparsely vegetated areas, that is, where no herb or tree grows.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	 And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	 Indeed its generation is due to the putrefaction which occurs beneath the skin, such as happens within snake and ascariasis worms, and worms generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	 And a sign of the beginning of this vein's development is that it occurs in a swollen leg.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	 Then it blisters over.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	 Then the vein begins to come out of that blistered spot, as if from the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	 When its end appears, then you should wind around it a piece of lead weighing one keil's drachma, up to two and a half drachmas and nodes; and let the lead hang down from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	 Whenever something comes out of it to the outside, wind that up in lead, and tie it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	 If it prolongs itself a lot, then cut off a part of it and wind up the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	 And do not cut it at the root before it has come out completely.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	 If you cut, it contracts and enters into the flesh; it causes an abscess to appear, and pus in that place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	 Therefore it is necessary that it should be treated gently, and drawn out gradually, until it comes out completely, and nothing remains in the body; and from this vein it flows out in some men which is of its length five palms and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	 And now it has come to me, because it came out from a man of twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	 If it is cut at your time of treatment; then insert a radium into its hole and pierce it with a long hole along with the body, until all that is in it from the matter comes out; and administer the rottenness of the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	 Then cure it with the treatment of abscesses.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	 And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears at the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself; and openings occur for it, and a branch flows out from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	 Therefore care for it as we have said in the division, and with what was previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	 Section on worms generated under the skin, and this condition is called Bouina.
Caput XCIIII.	 Chapter CXIIII.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	 This condition is called Bouina in a certain land among us; because it often happens to cows, and there is a small worm that is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	 And it moves throughout the body, ascending and descending; and it is felt by the senses during its movement from limb to limb until it bursts wherever it bursts on the skin and flows out.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	 And its generation is from the rottenness of some fluids.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	 As worms and snakes, that is to say, earthworms and roundworms, occur in the abdomen.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	 And it is feared from his malignancy.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	 Because when he himself moves in the body, and is raised to the head, and reaches the place: then perhaps it opens there, and goes out, and destroys the eye: and this happens frequently.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	 When therefore one desires to cure him and extract him, it is not done except during his walk and his appearance to the sense.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	 Therefore, it is necessary that you tie what is above him and what is below him with a strong binding.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut above him, and extract him.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	 If it penetrates into the flesh and you do not find it: then place a cautery over the place with fire until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	 And a greater thing that is feared is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	 If however you see him already arrived at the head near the eye, then tie below it with a good binding of the eyebrows.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	 Then cut above him, and extract him.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	 And it is necessary that the sick one use purification of his body with medications that dissolve corrupt, bad humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	 Let him beware for himself from foods causing corruption.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	 Chapter on the incision due to Nakir's disease.
Caput XCV.	 Chapter XCV (105).
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	 This disease is called in our land Nakir: it is a pain that occurs in certain members; then it changes from one member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	 And I myself have already seen it, as I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	 I was called to a sick woman in certain villages.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	 And she extended her arm and I saw a small swelling in the vein of the arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	 And when an hour had passed, I saw a swelling moving with a probe, like a worm, ascending more quickly than possible to the shoulder of that man, as silver runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	 Therefore, pain left from that place, and it was fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	 Then it sat for an hour, and it ran to the rest of his body until it reached another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	 Then he told me that it revolved in his entire body, according to what I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	 I was therefore amazed at the swiftness of its exchange from limb to limb.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	 And indeed, before that I had not seen this disease in my eyes as it happened in such a way.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	 Nevertheless, I saw many who experienced pain exchange from limb to limb; and I did not see it as I saw it in a woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	 And I do not think that it was anything but because she was one of those who are from dry bodies with dilated veins; hence it appears to be the windiness exchanged (from one place to another).
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	 And it is necessary that it does not appear according to this reasoning in those who are delicate and bodies with hidden veins.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	 When one desires to cure it and the patient feels that pain; then if it appears to you as we have said, then press upon it quickly and below it; and cut above it until that windiness compressed escapes; and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	 If however you do not see it with your eyes; then cure it by means of the body's shaking and what drives out windiness, and mix them with foul pills and pills made from resin and similar substances.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	 On the extraction of arrows.
Caput XCVI.	 Of the extraction of arrowheads.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	 Arrowheads differ according to their kinds and the places where they enter the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	 The diversity of them is as follows: for there are those which have large points and small ones; and convex and flat-headed.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	 And among them are those with three corners.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	 And among them are those which have tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	 And among them are those with stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	 However, those which fall upon the limbs, are of two kinds.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	 The limbs are hollow like the main organs such as the brain, heart, liver, lung, kidneys, intestines, bladder, and similar ones.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	 When one of these limbs falls and you see signs of death that I will tell you about later, then it is necessary to make an extraction of the arrow from it, for death follows where it is, in many cases.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	 And when these signs are not visible to you and the arrow is not hidden deep within the limb, then extract it, and take care of the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	 Among the signs of the brain when an arrow falls into it and penetrates the bone and exits through the siphac above the brain are: because strong headaches occur, along with scotoma, vertigo, redness in the eyes, swelling, redness of the tongue, spasms, confusion of mind, vomiting of cholera.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	 And perhaps blood may come out from the nose or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	 And perhaps speech may be cut off and the voice destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	 And whiteness similar to putty comes out from the wound site.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	 And it resembles the consistency of boiled flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	 If these signs appear to you, then refrain from treatment, and extract the arrow if it does not come out on its own.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	 The signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart are that it is near the left breast and the person feels as if the arrow is fixed in a solid object, not in an empty one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	 And perhaps there is movement similar to that of a pulse, and blood runs out from the wound black.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	 Then follows coldness in the extremities, cold sweat, and fainting.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	 Know that death is surely approaching.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	 The mark of an arrow when it wounds the lung is the appearance of foamy blood from the wound; and the vessels that follow the neck should be cut off, and the patient's color changes.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	 Expires a great and deep breath; seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	 If the arrow falls into the lung, which is in the chest; then it is near the ribs slightly; and a great sighing with violent pain occurs along with a movement of all the shoulder joints.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	 If the arrow falls into the stomach, then perhaps something undigested comes out from the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	 If the arrow falls into the abdomen and sticks there, something like feces comes out from the wound, or pus, or an intestine that has already been torn apart.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	 Therefore there is no hope for its treatment, nor in the removal of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If the arrow falls into the bladder and comes out with urine; and something goes outside from it, and the pain is greater on the patient; then you know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	 The rest of the members, such as face, neck, throat, spatula, help, dorsal vertebrae, crosspiece, thigh, leg, and similar limbs are saved in various ways; when the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve, and there is no poisonous arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	 And I tell you what I saw about these arrows so that you may know it for your treatment.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	 It is that a man had an arrow shot into his eye socket of the lacrimal duct and nasal root.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	 Therefore I took it out from the other side, under the cheekbone of his ear; and he was cured, and no harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	 And I extracted another arrow from the Jew, which had fallen into his eyelid below the lower lid; and the arrow was already concealed, and I could not grasp it entirely, but only a small part of it that adhered to its shaft; and the arrow was large among the arrows of the Turks, with a soft iron, in which there were no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	 The Jew was then healed, and no accidental harm came to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	 And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	 The arrow was Arabic and it had feathers.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	 So I cut through the throat along the middle line; and it was already submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	 I became sharpened with that, until I extracted it; and the Christian was healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	 And I extracted another arrow from a man who it had fallen into his belly; and we thought he would surely die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	 After thirty days had passed, and nothing had changed in his condition, I made an incision along the arrow; and I opened it up, and extracted it; and he was healed, and no accidental harm came to him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	 And I saw a man who an arrow had fallen into his back, and the wound was solidified over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	 After seven years, the arrow emerged at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	 And I saw a woman who an arrow had fallen into her belly, and the wound was solidified over it, and the arrow remained within her; and there was no change in her condition, and the woman found no harm in any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	 And I saw another man who an arrow had fallen into his face; and the wound was solidified, and remained, causing him little pain; and similar cases there were many of these.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	 And I removed an arrow from a man among the princes of the King, which had fallen into his nose in the middle and was beginning to deviate toward the right side slightly; and the entire arrow was hidden.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	 Therefore I was called for his treatment after the loss of the arrow for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	 Thus I found the arrow wound very constricted.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	 So I investigated it with a thin probe and did not feel it; but he himself discovered a puncture and pain from his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	 Therefore I hoped that the puncture was at the end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	 I therefore applied the place with a plaster containing an attractant and digestive properties, confident that the wound would heal and appear as a sign of the arrow for me to cut through; but it did not happen at the expected location, indicating that the arrow had passed through that spot.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	 I therefore attended him for many days with the plaster; but it did not happen as expected, and the wound was consolidating; and he remained weak from the extraction of it for a space of several days until he felt the arrow within his nose one day.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	 And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	 Therefore I placed on that wound a sharp, corrosive medicine for many days until it opened; and when I investigated it with a thin probe, I felt the end of the arrow adhering to wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	 Then I added this sharp medicine in the wound's opening until the end of the arrow appeared to us clearly; and I passed with him a space of time about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	 Then when the wound was swollen, and it became possible for me to insert forceps into it, and move it, but it did not obey to exit; then I did not cease to investigate and manipulate on it with various techniques, until on one day I began with well-made forceps according to the shape that will come at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	 Then I restored the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	 And indeed physicians judge that the nasal cartilage cannot be restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	 I therefore restored it, and the wound healed, and the weak recovered with complete health: nothing at all harmed him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	 And I tell you the quality of the extraction of some arrows: so that you may place this rule and significance over what I have not said.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	 Since the parts and distinctions of this art are not grasped when narrated; nor does that book contain it, and a wise craftsman compares with little over much; and with what is present, regarding what is absent: and he discovers a new operation, and a new instrument in the descent of foreign matters of this art when they occur.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	 I say therefore that arrows do not leave the members to which they are fastened unless in two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	 Or by attraction from the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	 Or, conversely, by the part of the opposite side.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	 And that which leaves where it entered is either a proceeding arrow in a soft place: and it attracts and leaves.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	 If it does not obey to exit at the hour in which it fell: then you must let it alone for several days, until the flesh that is around it becomes putrid: and its attraction diminishes, and its departure takes place.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	 And similarly if it penetrates into bone, and does not obey to you for an exit, then let it alone even for several days: and you should touch and move it every day until it departs.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	 If it does not obey to you for an exit after several days, then it is necessary that you bore around the arrow in the very bone from all sides with a fine awl, until the arrows swell up.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	 Then attract it and draw it out.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	 If the arrow is fixed in the skull bone and has already pierced one of the brain ventricles, and some of its symptoms appear to be weak, then refrain from pulling out the arrow and let it be until it equalizes with its state after days.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	 If the arrow reaches the heart, then death is not prolonged for him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	 And if the arrow is not fixed except within the body of a bone alone and does not penetrate to the heart; and it remains weak for some days without any other symptoms appearing: then skill should be applied in pulling out the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	 If it is fixed deeply and does not yield to pulling: then apply the leeches around the arrow as I have told you; then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	 If the arrow is already hidden in the body's location, concealed and hidden from sensation: then search for it with probing.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	 If you feel it (the arrow), then pull it out with the instruments suitable for its pulling.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	 If you cannot pull it (the arrow) because of the constriction of the wound and because of the long arrow deep within; and there is no bone, nerve, or vein there: then sew over it until the wound widens and it becomes possible to extract the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	 If there are ears attached to it (the arrow): then free the fixed flesh from them on all sides with all the skill you can; and if you cannot free the flesh through dislocation of the ears or by twisting them, then break the ears until it comes out.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	 And when you apply the extraction of the arrow, wherever it may be, then use the twisting of your hand with tweezers in all directions until you make it come out; and with the greatest subtlety, so as not to break the arrow, and so that its pulling will be difficult for you, and its own extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	 If you cannot perform it within an hour, then leave it for several days until what is around it putsrefies.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	 Then repeat it: for the tunica will be relieved, but if it causes a flow of blood contrary to you, then administer what was said in the cure chapter, and keep your power from cutting the vein, or nerve, or tendon.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	 And administer all ways possible for the extraction of the arrow: and let it be with ease, peace, or slowness, firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	 And it is necessary that when you pull the arrow, it becomes weak as it was at the time of the arrow wound in him.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	 For it is more beneficial.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	 But if that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	 The arrow that comes out from the opposite side of another part, or already proceeds to something on the outside, or makes a hump at the end of the arrow by feeling from the upper part of the skin nearby, and you see it protruding: cut above it, and make the incision according to the size so that forceps can grasp it.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	 Then pull it out: for it will become easy to come out.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	 But if it is retained in the bone, then twist your hand according to its roundness until the arrow presses into the bone and enlarges itself: then pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	 And if not: leave it for several days: then repeat it until it comes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	 If the arrow shaft is in it, then push it out with it.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	 But if the arrow shaft has fallen out, and you have the intention to administer a push: then insert an instrument with a hollow, so that it enters the hollow of the arrow: then push it out with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If however the arrow is concave, then push it with the instrument as it enters into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	 The arrow is pushed through it.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	 If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to remove the entire concave flesh, where the venom is: if this can be done by you.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	 Then take care of her with what is suitable for that place.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	 If the arrow falls into the chest, or in the belly, or in the bladder, or on the side and it is near where you touch with your hand and it can be cut above it: then cut it, and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve and remove it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	 Then suture the wound, if you see it, and take care of it until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	 And this is the form of Forceps used for extracting arrows.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	 The tips should be like a bird's beak, which are made of iron: when they grasp the arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	 And they are made in many forms: large, small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow, its narrowness, the width of the wound, and its depth.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	 The form of a Concave Pusher.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	 And the form of a Deaf Pusher.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	 This is the deaf tip like a Radius, to push it into the concave arrow and advance it.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	 The tip of the Concave Pusher is also concave like a bird's feather: to push it into the arrow and apply pressure on it.

Et phlebotoma eam secundum transuersionem: quoniam os est propinquum: et fortasse in eo frangetur phlebotomus quando est subtilis.	 And cut the lancet across; since it is near the bone; and perhaps the lancet will break if it is too thin.
¶ De phlebotomia Venarum in duobus Lachrymalibus.	 [Chapter Title] On the Cutting of Veins in the Two Tear-ducts.

Then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a fine and long lancet; and fix it in the middle of the leper's nose, between that part which distinguishes the nose according to its straightness.
Quoniam uena non apparet sensui illic, et quia sanguis incipit fluere statim.	 Because the vein does not appear to the senses there, and because blood begins to flow immediately.
Et oportet, ut ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo parumper: et facias currere ex sanguine secundum necessitatem tuam.	 It is necessary that you hold your hand with the lancet for a little while; and make the blood flow according to your need.
Deinde liga ipsam nocte una.	 Then bind it at night.
Ipsa enim restauratur uelociter.	 For it heals quickly itself.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Guidegi.	 Chapter on the venesection of Guy de Chauliac.

Sanatur enim uulnus.	 The wound heals.
¶ De phlebotomia uenarum Algeberich.	 Chapter on the venesection of Albucasis.
Venae autem Algeberich phlebotomiae iuuamentum est: quia confert ad alcolam in ore, et corruptionem gingiuae: et ulcera mala: et fissuras labiorum, et ulcera mala, etiam quae sunt in naso, et in circumitu eius.	 The venesection of Albucasis has benefit for alcohol consumption in the mouth, and corruption of teeth, and bad ulcers, and fissures of the lips, and bad ulcers, even those that are in the nose, and around it.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae earum est, ut facias sedere infirmum coram te: et stringe collum eius cum uitta.	 And the quality of phlebotomy is that you make the sick person sit before you; and bind his neck with a ligature.
Deinde reuolue labium eius, et aspice ad duas uenas: quarum una est a dextera labii, et secunda a sinistra eius: et demonstratio utriusque est per nigredinem ambarum.	 Then turn the lips of him and look at the two veins; one is on the right side of the lip, and the second on the left of it; and the demonstration of both is by blackening them.
Et illud uerum est: quia in circumitu earum sunt uenae minutae, nigrae.	 And that is true: because around those [veins] there are small, black veins.
Incide ergo utramque incisione incidente.	 Make therefore an incision on both with a cutting incision.
Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	 If there is doubt about you and you do not know which one it is; then turn to the larger incision of them, and make it more evident.
Et similiter fac de duabus uenis quae sunt in labio superiore: et plurimum quidem currit consuetudo cum eo: et incide duas uenas quae sunt in labio inferiori.	 And similarly do the same with the two veins which are in the upper lip; and indeed the custom is mostly with it; and make an incision on the two veins that are in the lower lip.
¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	 Section on Phlebotomy of the Vein under the Tongue after Cephalic Phlebotomy.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	 However, the help of the two veins that are under the tongue for phlebotomy is that the cephalic phlebotomy is for the inflammations that are in the throat, and the illness of the voice, and the illnesses of the mouth.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	 And the quality of phlebotomizing them is that the sick person should sit between your hands before the sun; and pull out the tongue of his, and look under the tongue on one side of his, and on the other side of his a vein; and the color of each declines to blackness.
Phlebotoma ergo utramque: et custodi, ne ultimes manum tuam in phlebotomando eas.	 Make therefore an incision on both; and be careful not to go too deep when phlebotomizing them.
Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	 For under there are the arteries, and perhaps there may be a bleeding from those arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	 Section on the three veins in the elbow.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	 The three veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow are those whose phlebotomy is customary in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	 And phlebotomy [is performed] according to two modes.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	 Or piercing with a broad leech (myrtinus) and phlebotomy: or draining to the point of subtlety, using a slit: or cutting with a small knife, and this is called Alnesil.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	 Thus, Alnesil [is performed] when there is incision.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	 And from these [methods], there are broad and subtle ones according to the width of the veins and their constriction. The form of leech (myrtinus) phlebotomy is broad, as you see.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	 And it [Alnesil] is suitable for opening hollow veins, full, protruding, apparent, thick ones, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	 And this [method] is smaller in width and more subtle for fine veins.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	 And it [this method] is suitable for the phlebotomy of fine veins that contain subtle, yellowish blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	 Sectiones phlebotomi faciunt in quatuor locis: in uentre superuenienti, et in capite, et
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	 In the abdomen ascending [area], and in the head: the basilica (Basilica) is one of these three veins that benefit from phlebotomy.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	 Because it drains blood from illnesses that are below the throat and neck, because it follows the chest and abdomen: it is suitable for the phlebotomist to bleed this vein, provided that he be careful, since beneath it is an artery.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	 Therefore, if [the phlebotomist] errs and adds in the piercing of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery, and blood will flow out.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	 Therefore, the phlebotomist must not pierce it [the basilica vein]: instead, he should cut with Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	 If the basilica is not apparent by a clear manifestation, then it must be sought elsewhere, or one should exchange it for another, or find one of its branches: or use the arm vein in its place.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	 The operation itself is clear; cut it with Phlebotomus Anesil, as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	 If however you want to perform phlebotomy on this same [person], then it is necessary before the tightening of the arm, so that you touch the place, until you know the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	 Then mark the spot with encaustum (pitch), then the arm, and cut the vein with a curved incision by Phlebotomus Alnesil, as we said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	 And beware that the blow does not fall into the space from the place of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	 And when you see, as you tighten the ligament, swelling at the spot which you marked with encaustum (pitch), then that swelling is the swelling of the artery; therefore avoid it.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	 If you see blood appearing at the phlebotomy site, as if it were urine of a boy, and it is thin, red: then know that it is from the artery's blood.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	 Therefore, approach and place your finger on the spot for a long time, then remove your finger.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	 If therefore the blood is cut (for it is often cut), then tighten the arm and let it go; beware that the weak one does not move from it, and it should be on guard over it.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	 And do not move it for several days, until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	 If however the blood does not flow and it overcomes you, and medicine is not present for you at that moment, then cut the artery if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	 For its ends contract, and the blood flows out.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	 Or take the bark of a fig tree and pound it; take half of it and bind it over the place where the vein was tied with a ligament and small pieces until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	 Then if blood flows out, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	 And if not (the case): then care for him himself with the one who preceded him, remembering the place of the dust particles causing blood flow removal; and the removal of his blood is not difficult in many positions, due to the small size of the wound, and the possibility of tying from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	 Of Phlebotomy of the Vein Fusca.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	 The assistance of phlebotomy for the Vein Fusca is that it draws blood from the upper part of the head and lower body; because it is composed of a branch of Basilica, and a branch of Cephalica, as we said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	 And it is appropriate for the phlebotomist to know this vein, since there is a nerve under it.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	 If therefore the nerve is touched during phlebotomy and found, stupor occurs, and healing becomes difficult; and perhaps it will not be healed completely.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	 And this nerve often appears to sensation.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	 If however it is hidden in some people, and is subtle, and does not show; then you should place your phlebotomy where the vein is phlebotomized, with a section like Alnesil's, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	 If the vein is between two nerves, then pierce the vein lengthwise.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	 Of the Vein Cephalica.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	 The assistance of phlebotomy for the Vein Cephalica is that it draws blood from the head, and contributes to eye disorders.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	 And in this vein, if you want, it is appropriate for the phlebotomist to anoint it with olive oil or myrtle oil when puncturing; because it is safer than all veins, because it is not under an artery, nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	 It is fitting for you in phlebotomy that you ask the phlebotomist to take only the head of an arm, and seek a softer place: and it does not harm him if it is not found with the first blow, but he should repeat on it several times with phlebotomy.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	 Perhaps in some people it may be apostematized when not phlebotomized in the first blow, but the apostema does not harm him at all in any case.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	 Chapter on the utility of Phlebotomy and the precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	 The quality of phlebotomy, and its accidents from which correction is required, about which you should reflect.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	 First of all, you should know that phlebotomy is not administered except in the preservation of health and its continuance, and with caution to prevent illness.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	 And phlebotomy should be performed on one of the three veins that are in the arm, namely the Cephalic, the Flexor Tendon (Fusca), and the Basilic.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	 And phlebotomy should be performed at the beginning of spring after fasting, in summer and autumn, or winter following consumption, when signs of fullness appear.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	 Phlebotomy should be performed on the first or third day, after three hours have passed since the previous day.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	 But phlebotomy administered in illness has no fixed hour; it should be performed whenever the situation and necessity require it, day or night, and at any hour, and at any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	 Phlebotomy should not be performed on boys until they reach the age of fourteen.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	 A pregnant woman should not be phlebotomized except from the fourth to the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	 Old men who have passed sixty years should not be phlebotomized.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	 If anyone wishes to be bled for any reason, it is necessary that he cleanses his intestines before bleeding with a lenient enema, if much feces has been retained within them: so that no putrid superfluities from the intestines may attract near the veins at the time of bleeding and harm the main organs.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	 A patient should not be bled when afflicted with toctina, that is, satiety of the stomach; nor in a state of drunkenness or vomiting until it has passed away from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	 A man who is ill with dropsy should not be bled.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	 Caution should be taken from bleeding again after a colic attack, and vomiting, diarrhea, increase in sexual activity, labor, exercise, wakefulness, fasting, and any other thing that weakens the body or animal strength.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	 Then consider in detail about humors before this, if the blood is thick with food and drinks, and medicines; if it is possible for him to do so.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	 Then enter a bath, unless something prevents it; or exercise with some exercise, to make the blood thin.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	 Place the bleeding of this person in the chest on the third day, as we have said; and strive to expel the chest of that person on that day from all animal ailments such as tightness, anger, fear; and from all bodily ailments such as labor, punishment, excess, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	 And let him have present with him the things that are useful to him from aromatics and fragrances, and cheering things, and similar things, according to their availability in quantity.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	 Then the bloodletter should sit on a stool that is higher than the stool for bleeding; then he should draw out his arm and rub it with his own hand twice or thrice.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	 Then bind the ligament with a cord and wrap it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	 And let the ligature be moderate, because an uneven ligature, either by excess in the ligature, then it forbids the course of blood; or by softening, even then it also forbids the course of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	 Then after ligature, it is necessary that the phlebotomist press his hands together alternately until the veins swell and are revealed to the sense.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	 Then the phlebotomist cleanses the instrument with a little oil, properly ancient.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	 Then he places his index finger of the left hand upon the same vein at the place where he wants the venesection, a little; so that the vein does not flee and the blow is confined.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	 Because from the veins you find one as fleeing like an escaping cord at venesection; and there is one which is full of wind; and when you place the instrument upon it, it contracts under the phlebotomist, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and does not open the vein; and if he opens it, it is constricted; therefore for this reason the phlebotomist must be firm and careful in all these matters.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	 Then lay down the instrument (phlebotomum).
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	 If then a vein is opened from one side, it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	 And if not, then do the same on the other side at that place a little; or above it with haste, if the place is not displaced.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	 What if it is displaced, or the weak person starts and trembles, then let him rest for a day, or two days; and do not bind the ligament.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	 Perhaps the abscess attracts the displacement (calidum).
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	 Do not enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	 Then repeat the venesection if it is loved (amat).
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	 If the opening is small, or blood flows subtly: fear that the quantity which you desire will not exit; then repeatedly perform venesection in the same opening and add a little more in the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	 Do it promptly before the site is closed, for in many people the closed site is difficult during a small operation.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	 If therefore you see that it has been closed, then do not go over it at all, for nothing will excuse you in your eyes.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	 Place something from oil paste on it: because it alleviates the flow of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	 And it is better at this site than olive oil itself and other oils.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	 And likewise administer oil paste in every venesection of your own where you are stopping the flow of blood; and they do that in the East, the Tyrian alfarach and the Sagzena, when it is put on the site.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	 For the blood is made thin and dissolved when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	 If it happens at the site of venesection a large abscess, which often occurs especially in those who are not a venesection expert except that day, or if the opening of the vein is small, then hurry and put a sponge soaked in water and salt, heated slightly, on the spot and press it for one hour; because it dissolves.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	 And it is necessary that you do this after the blood exits from the vein itself, when it has been completed or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	 If something black or green remains at the site after a few days, it does not harm; and if you want, put something of aloe or myrrh dissolved on it; or something from the juice of mint, that is, camphor or similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	 And indeed, abscesses and swellings frequently occur at the phlebotomy sites in the Basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	 Place your hand upon it; if you find a soft spot under the pressure applied to it, then that swelling is harmful.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	 Be careful, so that you place something on it from what I said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	 For perhaps blood from the artery will flow out of it.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	 But make an ointment for it with what I said, so that the place hardens.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	 Then take care of it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	 It is necessary that blood be let from every person according to the quantity of its virtue.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	 And what appears as a reddish color on top of the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	 For if the blood is black, then let it come out until it turns red; and similarly, if you see it thick, let it come out until it becomes thin; and similarly, if it is sharp, let it be removed until its sharpness disappears.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	 It is necessary for one who is full, strong, and needs bloodletting once to be increased in venesection of the vein, and that the venesectioner be on the left side; and for one who is weak, it should be the opposite of this.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	 It is necessary that it be let out in the veins and that the opening be narrow; and it is better what is given in venesection of the vein that it be a cross-cut, not a prick.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	 This method of venesection is safe from bleeding and from nerve injury; and it is more praiseworthy and safer than venesection by length and width.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	 And for one who frequently faints at venesection, it is necessary to give him a little bread soaked in water of honeyed mulberries or sekanjabin (a type of beverage), if he is heated; and let blood from three or four veins.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	 If it is of a cold constitution, then let it take bread soaked in syrup of honey, or in syrup of scented honey with spices, or in scented and fragrant syrup, before phlebotomy.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	 If fainting occurs during phlebotomy and the cause is excessive bleeding: then it is necessary that one drink meat water, subtle scented syrup, and use aromatics with seaweed, and let the chest be washed with it; and let the other things mentioned in the division on fainting from evacuation be used.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	 He who wishes to cut his arm and let out blood in the second stage: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is due to a large evacuation, and the strength of whose arm is weak, that he lets out blood gradually according to the strength of his arm over continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	 But he who wishes to cut his arm and let out blood in the second stage, and his body is possibly weak: then let him do this after seven or nine hours following his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	 But he who wishes to draw blood from his body towards the opposite side of where it is inclined: it is necessary that this be done on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	 In a body where blood is already much heated and sharpened, causing fever: it is necessary that the blood comes out once, and a large amount is extracted; and the opening is enlarged until fainting occurs; after you have observed all conditions of phlebotomy: and place your hand over the pulse of his arm during the flow of blood, so that death does not occur in its place instead of fainting.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	 For it often happens that this occurs when the phlebotomist is unaware and falls because of carelessness.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	 It is not appropriate when you wish to dissolve an arm, and to dissolve blood when the orifice of the vein has already been closed, and the exit of blood becomes difficult, that you apply forcefully upon it, and the injured one be quickly stretched out.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	 That is very bad indeed, rather let it remain, until it can be bled a second time.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	 Either remove with sharpness the coagulated part from the blood in the vein's opening, and place something of salt dissolved in water upon it.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	 And place something from turpentine, alfrax or sage root on it, and hold it with gentle pressure until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	 If the vein has already burst, then let it be, and do not cover it up until the abscess subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	 If necessity demands the dissolution of blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then either bleed him in the same place or in another vein in the other arm.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	 The cord of the arm is bled in the place of Fuscus and Basilicus, when they are not found and are hidden because it is composed of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	 And the quality of bleeding is that a weak person should insert his hand into hot water until it turns red, and the vein appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	 Then it should be bound over it with a cord of moderate tightness.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	 Then the second bleeding should be done transversely gradually, not broadly or lengthwise, and let the opening be wide, and your second bleeding should be made a little above the joint of the hand.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	 If the outlet of blood is forbidden, then place your hand in hot water and let the blood flow into the water until you achieve your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	 If you are in the days of summer, then you may excuse yourself from immersing hands in hot water (repeatedly).
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	 The course of blood is mostly placed in hot water during wintertime.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	 And the phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all other veins, since it is not under a pulsating vein, nor a nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	 The phlebotomy of the right hand's Saviour (vein) is beneficial for liver diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	 And the quality of its phlebotomy is that you should tie a leash to the thumb with a cord, or with your hand, after inserting it into hot water, until the vein becomes swollen and clearly appears to sensation.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	 Then cut (make an incision) through the phlebotomy (vein).
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	 And if you make a complete incision on it, it will not harm him in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	 Keep (your hand) clean, so that you do not cut yourself with the phlebotomy.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	 Indeed, there are nerves of the fingers exposed from the flesh beneath it.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	 Then repeat your hand to hot water and let the blood flow in it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	 For if you do not repeat it in hot water, the blood clots at the opening of the vein and prevents its flow.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	 When you have extracted the necessary amount of blood from the blood, then place oil and salt on the vein so that it does not clot quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	 And similarly, it is required that you do this with every constricted (vein).
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	 The remedy for the phlebotomy of this vein from the left hand is that it is beneficial for spleen diseases; and similarly do with its phlebotomy as you did with the second one equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	 The remedy for the phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as uterine diseases, retention of menses, kidney weaknesses, old sores of the hips and legs, and similar diseases.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	 The quality of phlebotomy is that the ill person should immerse his foot into warm water, and make abrasion on it until the veins swell up; and bind above the joint of the foot with a tourniquet.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	 The vein's location is at the heel, appearing towards the thumb; and many branches ramify from it on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	 So, phlebotomy should be made in a larger branch of it, or at the heel in its group; for it is better and safer.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	 If phlebotomy is made on the face of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are beneath it on the surface of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	 And place your phlebotomy tool for cutting it across, as if you wish to cut it; and the name of the phlebotomist is Nesil.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	 If the outlet of blood is forbidden, then immerse his foot in warm water; and let the blood flow into it until it is evacuated.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	 If the phlebotomist misses the vein in the first attempt, then let him go up with the phlebotomy slightly more towards the top; for it is safe, and there is no harm in it when you beware of the nerves, as we said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	 Similarly, regarding the saphenous vein of the other foot (as well).
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	 The location of the Sciatic vein, as we said, is at the heel from the wooded side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	 The aid of phlebotomy is for the pain in the ankle, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	 The quality of phlebotomy is that the sick person should enter the bath and hurry; and bind the leg from the side of the ankle up to the heel with a thin bandage four fingers wide, for it does not appear except for this reason.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	 When it appears [the tumor], then make an incision on it according to whatever skill you have, either by transverse or longitudinal manner. It is better, or to cut it with a cut, or to excise it with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	 The place of its location is safer, and it is very well hidden in many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	 If you do not find it [the tumor] and it does not appear at all to the sense: then make an incision on one of its branches, and there is one that appears on the back of the foot and turned towards the ear; be careful about the nerves, and let the amount of blood flow that you wish.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	 Then dissolve the stricture, and place skin over the incision site, and tie it up.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	 It heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	 On ventosation and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	 Chapter XCVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	 They are made from horns, copper, and glass.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	 Ventosation is done in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	 With scratching and bloodletting; the other is ventosation without scratching.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	 And this ventosation which is without scratching, is done in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	 Or it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	 Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	 And the places on the body where ventosation with scratching and bloodletting are administered are fourteen.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	 One of them is the ventosation of Alnocrates, and it is the last on the head; Alkehel, and it is in the middle of the neck; Alhagdahim, and they are two plates on the neck from both sides at the same time; ventosations of the brain, and it is under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth; ventosations of two spoons; ventosation of Alachosos above the tail; ventosations of two nuts, and they are in the middle of two arms; ventosations of two legs; ventosations of two calves.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	 And Venesection does not draw blood from you from the small veins scattered throughout the flesh, and because of that its power is not lost as it is in phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	 It is not necessary to administer venesection either with fire or without it for any diseases caused by overfilling, until the whole body has been evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	 If necessity arises for venesection due to illness or custom, it should be administered at the beginning, end, and middle of every month, and at any time necessary.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	 Because there are some people who, when their blood multiplies too much within them, find a pain and swelling in their head, and a feeling of heaviness in the limbs.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	 And among them are those who find overfilling and redness on their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	 And among them are those who find itching on their face and forehead, and darkness and confusion in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	 And among them is one who scratches the place of his venesection.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	 And among them is one who laughs too much.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	 And among them is one who tastes blood in his mouth: or the tongue is cleansed and the blood is spit out.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	 And among them is one who has excessive sleep.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	 And among them is one who sees blood and redness in his dreams, dead people, wounds, and things similar to those in waking life.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	 When we see something of those conditions, and more specifically if it is in the third week of the month: we then prescribe venesection to be done after two or three hours have passed since the day.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	 The benefit of venesection in the neck is that it relieves headache and that which is drained out goes to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	 It is necessary that it [the wound] should be after the evacuation of the entire body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	 This is indeed a ventose in place of cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	 It is not allowed to use it who has cold constitution or who has catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	 For it causes him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	 Therefore, it is not fitting to use it by the elderly and who have cold diseases of the head.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	 He who continually does it generates oblivion upon him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	 Therefore, you must warn the ventosator to lay down his hand with the ventose for a short while at the lower part, fearing lest it generates oblivion.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	 Ventosation or alkehel is in place of phlebotomy Fusca, and phlebotomy Basilica, and therefore causes asmati, constriction of breath, breathlessness due to the instrument's fissure, coughing, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	 It is necessary to push the ventose alkehel for a short time, because if it is placed lower, it generates weakness of the heart and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	 Ventosation alhagdahim causes accidents of pain in the head, migraine, hemigraina, perforation, and tooth root pain; it is in place of phlebotomy Basilica.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	 You must warn the ventosator not to press his hand with the scarification, lest he cut an artery and cause bleeding.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	 Ventosation under the chin causes alcohol in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and similar diseases that are in the mouth; it stands for phlebotomy alieherich, which are in the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	 Ventosation with spatulas causes alchafacha, which comes from compression and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	 Interior partitions' ventositation provides aid to phlebotomy of three veins, Basilica, Fusca and Cephalica; since it draws blood from all those small veins which are in the flesh, and those small veins draw blood from larger ones unto themselves until the attraction reaches to three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	 It is necessary that you warn the Ventosator not to proceed too far in scarification; because there is a place denuded of flesh under which are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	 The ventosa that sucks on the anus provides help for hemorrhoids of the anus and for lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	 It is necessary that you warn the Ventosator to have a large ventosa and made of metal; because the place requires strong suction, and perhaps small ventosas break easily: and it should be scarified with a large scarifier.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	 The ventosae of the legs diminish clearly; because they draw blood from all over the body, and they bring old pains to kidneys, womb and bladder: they provoke menstruation, and they bring forth wind and phlegm: and they are in place of phlebotomy for two saphenas and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	 However, they weaken the body greatly, and cause fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	 The help of the ventosae of alhorcobeni is nearly the same as that of the ventosae of two legs.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	 The quality of the position of the ventosae is that you place the ventosa first in a vacant place and suck with moderate suction: and do not prolong the position of the ventosae, but put them quickly, and remove them quickly, so that fluids come to the location at an equal rate: and do not cease to repeat this and continue until you see the place already redden and swell, and redness of blood appears: then scarify, and repeat the suction gradually.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	 Then consider in the arrangement of bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	 For a person who is from soft flesh and sparse pores, it is necessary to scarify him once, not more: so that the location does not ulcerate.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	 And command the Fan to expand the scarification and not to make it too deep: and moderate the suction in ease, speed, and gentle motion.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	 If there is thickening of blood, then it is necessary to scarify him twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	 In the first instance, an opening is made for the subtlety of blood and its thickening: and in the second, a detailed examination is made for the extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	 But if the blood is very fetid, then the scarification should be done in the third instance: so that it follows the last.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	 And finally, when we wish to draw blood slowly or slightly, a single scarification is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	 But if we want the extraction of much blood, we scarify with multiple scarifications.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	 And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it is necessary to be scarified with a deep scarification: and the end equal in the scarification, is the depth of skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	 § What that needs to be administered from oils at the position of Fans, and what the one who fans should avoid.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	 In the one whose skin is thick, hard, dark, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary to anoint the places to be fanned with oils that are opening, soothing, resolving: if it is in summer, such as alkali oil, or camphorated oil, or oil from sweet almonds, or oil from pumpkin seeds.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	 And if it is in winter time, then use oil of narcissus, or oil of lily, or oil of chamomile, or sarbatinum; and similar things.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	 If there is excessive fat, cold: then use oil of amaracus, or oil of balsam, or oil of white poppy, or oil of dittany; and similar things.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	 If the wind-pipe is stopped by narrow passages of flesh: then it should be prohibited from oil, and those places should be washed with rose water, or cold water, or salt water, or water of cucumber, or water of purslane; and similar things.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	 But the one whose blood has much moisture, should wash the wind-pipes with vinegar or water of myrtle, and sumac; and similar things.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	 For the one whose excessive fat is coarse, wash the wind-pipes with old wine or water of sage, or infusion of dittany, or chamomile; and similar things.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	 And it should be cautioned against wind-pipes treatment in the bath or near the bath, indeed it should be administered after leaving the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	 And it is not allowed that someone sleeps after wind-pipe treatment.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	 What is to be done before treating the wind-pipe, or phlebotomy?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	 And after that, it is necessary to consider: then if the wind-pipe or phlebotomy patient is choleric and his sharpness and inflammation prevails over his blood: then it is necessary for him to receive cooling things, such as pomegranate molasses; and also figs steeped in vinegar and lettuce, and shallots, and garlic; and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	 Place his food for the birds, and salted mutton pieces, and cooked meals with vegetables: and similar things to them.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	 If his condition is cold, he should take syrup made from honey, or from almonds, or from the seed of asafoetida in his drink; and use moderately aromatic wine, which is between old and new; and it must be prescribed that he use sparingly of food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	 Place his food for the birds, and chicken; and sparrows, that is, small birds; and he should crush pigeons eggs.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	 It is necessary that the drink on the day of venesection and bleeding be more than the food; and it is to be given in some people's drinks during the hours of Tyria alfaroch, or medicine made from musk, that is, musk, or ale-seltz at any time before venesection; and before or after: so that they may be strengthened and the blood may become thin.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	 It is not necessary to take it in a hot drink.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	 Chapter on Venesection without Scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	 Venesections which are without scarification are those placed on the liver, spleen, foot, stomach, navel, and flanks of the kidneys, and anus: because these members do not bear scarification upon them.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	 Nor is it sought through them, except for the drawing of blood from one member to another; such as placing a venesection on the breasts in the sickness of nasal bleeding.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	 And we use them to relieve cold and unbearable venosity in one member by another; such as placing a venesection on the stomach, and navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	 For it makes the member thin, warms it, and removes pain because it has resolved that venosity.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	 Also it is placed on the kidneys, when there occurs in them an abscess or a stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	 By virtue of its own attractive force, it possibly opens an abscess, or extracts a stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	 Likewise it does when it is placed over the spleen, and for grinding the liver or spleen on either side in case of windiness.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	 These [windy conditions] are treated in vacuums during operation only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	 And at times they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	 And at times they are administered with warm water in pleurisy diseases: and this is to fill the vent [cavity], and make it large, with only hot water or water in which herbs suitable for the case have been boiled.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	 Form of a vent administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	 The width of its [vent's] opening should be two fingers apart, according to what we have constructed; and its depth should be half the size of a palm; and on one side, in a place about halfway along it, there should be a small hole, according to the size that an awl can enter; it should be made of brass, citron wood, smooth, equal sides, cleaned: so as not to injure the part when it is placed upon it; and in its middle there should be a crossbar transverse from brass or iron, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	 And now it becomes this swollen one large, greater than what we spoke of, and not much smaller than that, according to the illnesses and age of the person using [it].
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	 For swellings in boys are different from those in men, and thick-bodied ones as well.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	 The quality of applying heat to this swelling on a limb is that you should ignite linen with fire from flax or a small tallow candle, and place it on the middle rung of the crossbar which is in the middle of the swelling, so that the fire is about halfway up the swelling, so as not to burn the body of the sick person.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	 Then it is to be placed on the limb, and a finger should be over the opening I mentioned, until we hold the swelling; when we need it, we remove the finger, and steam will come out through that opening, and the swelling will immediately be solved.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	 Then apply fire to the linen in its manner, and repeat it if you need it [the heat].
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	 In swellings administered for pleurisy with water, there is no crossbar nor opening; it is not administered except that it is filled with water and placed on the limb only.
Et haec est forma eius.	 And this is its shape.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	 And a swelling that is larger, so as to hold more water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	 Chapter on Suspension of Sanguisugars.
Caput XCIX.	 Chapter CXCVIII.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	 Chapter CXCVIII: Sanguisugas are not administered in many places except where there is no possible position for swellings due to their smallness, such as the lip, gums, and similar parts.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	 Or in a bare member, such as a finger or nose, and similar parts.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	 And the quality of using them is that you should come from Sanguisugas which are in sweet, clean water, free from putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	 Then they should be kept in sweet water, day and night, until they are hungry and nothing remains in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	 The body shall first be evacuated with bleeding and with blistering.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	 Then clean the sick limb until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	 Then they are placed upon it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	 When they are filled and fall off, and there is the possibility of sucking out the place with blistering, then it is more beneficial for healing; if not, then clean the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	 Then wash it with much water, rub and squeeze it.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	 If the flow of blood persists after a leech application, and this is due to a discharge, then dip the cloth in cold water, place it on top, until the discharge ceases.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	 If the blood multiplies, then sprinkle on it powder of almonds ground, or gallnuts and similar things from poppy seeds until the bleeding stops.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	 Or lay halved, peeled beans on the place and let them remain until they adhere to the location, because blood is stopped by this.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	 And it is necessary that if a repetition of leech application is required, when possible, replace them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	 If leeches are forbidden from suspension, then clean the place with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	 Or make an incision in the places, until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	 Then place them, because as soon as they feel something from the blood, they will stick immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	 When you want them to fall off, sprinkle something from ground aloes, salt or ashes on them; they will fall immediately.
¶ Partis Secundae Finis.	 End of the Second Part.
¶ Liber Chirurgici Albucasis Pars III.	 Third Book of Surgery by Albucasis.
¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	 Universal Discourse on the Restoration, Dislocation, and Treatment of Twisting and Similar Conditions.
Caput I.	 Title I.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	 This Chapter is also frequently necessary in the art of Medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures and dislocations occurring in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	 Know ye, O Sons, that foolish physicians and the common people boast about this Chapter, and those who have never looked upon the book of the ancients nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	 And for this reason, this method is deprived of knowledge in our land.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	 And I have never encountered it in good form at all, nor have I attained that which I have attained except for the length of reading the ancient books and my devotion to their understanding until I extracted this knowledge from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	 Then I adhered to experiment and study throughout the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	 And now I have described for you from that Chapter all that my knowledge contains: and over what experiment failed me after I explained it to you, and released it from the burden of length, and shortened it from the end of shortening, and showed it from the end of declining; and I formed in it many shapes of instruments which are administered therein, as I did in the two preceding Chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	 Summary and collections from the existence of bone fractures, of which the premise is necessary before we begin to recall broken members, and of various ones, if any particular one.
Caput II.	 Title II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	 It is necessary to say in the preface of this Chapter, the main points and chapters, which must first be understood by the artist at his station concerning their truth: namely that you, and those who are prompt, may know or learn this noble art from you, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	 Therefore I say that when fracture or dislocation or twisting or fall occurs in someone, then it is necessary to hasten firstly to phlebotomy him, and to be drained or both at the same time: unless something prohibits this, such as weakness of power; or he who suffers from one of these things is a boy or an old man worn out; or there is a time of intense heat or extreme cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	 Then let him be content with his food, cold vegetables, and onions, and beans; and forbid wine, and thick meats, and filling himself with foods and all food that fills the veins with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	 Until he is secure from a hot purge, and no longer fears the flow of matter to a member; then let the sick person return to his own diet first with which his custom was accustomed.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	 When the broken bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the sick person eat nourishing foods in abundance, coarse, heavy, with viscosity; such as food made from cooked flour and water, rice, heads, feet, entrails of cows, eggs, fresh fish, thick wine, and similar.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	 When this regimen is followed, the setting of the fracture occurs more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	 And know that broken bones, when they are in men who are in the first old age and decrepit, it is not possible for them to be held together and consolidated according to their nature always, on account of the drying up of their limbs; and they consolidate and hold together those which are from them at the end of softness, like the bones of small children.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	 However, nature connects something similar to glue around the broken bone from all sides, in which there is thickness, by which it adheres and tightens it until they consolidate opposite each other, and are bound together until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until it does not prohibit anything from its operations; and for this reason it is necessary that you place nourishment for the sick person in foods which have thickness, viscosity, and thickness, as we said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	 And know, that the types of fractures are diverse, according to the differences of the members: for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the head bone; and a fracture of the breastbone is different from a fracture of the backbone; and similarly all other members exist differently to each other; and I come with the reminder of every type of fracture explained in its own chapter, distinct from one another.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	 And fractures of bones are also diversified among themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	 For there is a curved fracture (which occurs) besides the occurrence of stars (stellae).
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	 And sometimes there is a fracture along the length of the bone; and these are its cracks (stagiae, or stars), that is, splinters (astellae), as well as additions proceeding from them, such as in a reed, when a knife is sharpened for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	 And not proceeding (from the bone): and there is a fracture with wound and rupture in the head; and there is a small crack (fractura fissura parua).
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	 And every type has a skill or its own tool in its restoration, according to how it will be remembered, distinguished in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	 And from that which is recognized in a bone fracture, there is its twisting (tortuositas), and its protrusion (ipsius eminentia): and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when it is compressed with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	 When therefore there is no apparent twisting, nor sound when it is touched with your hand or compressed with pressure, nor does a weak great pain occur: then there is not fracture in that place; indeed, it may be a twisting (or a small crack): thus, do not move it with your hand and compression at all; instead, lay medicines on top of it, which will be remembered afterwards, after the appropriate time has passed: then the wound will be sutured with a fine string.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And know that when the place is curved and split, except for what happens in it as a result of strangulation, nevertheless, all its parts are separated from their own: then you should begin from your hour for its correction, equalizing it before hot ulcer occurs to it.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	 If a hot ulcer occurs to it, then let it be for some days until the ulcer subsides.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	 Then equalize it according to whatever method can be done with gentleness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	 And know that the restoration of it, and its equalization, is easier than bones, where strangulations occur.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	 Then tighten it, according to whatever memory comes to you.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	 If there are strangulations in the bone, then necessary is the extension of this broken member from two parts, if it is a hand or foot: or with your hand, if the member is small: or with two ropes, or with a rope and your hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	 And let your position be when you place the member on a level place according to its natural shape, until the parts of the broken member are extended: then try, with all skill, and according to whatever method you can in their places, to bring back those additions; and be careful, according to your strength, that pain or injury does not occur to the weak due to your operation: and try, according to your strength, to apply one of two bones with its partner, according to the best forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	 And it is necessary that at that hour you try and touch it with your hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	 If therefore you see something different there, correct it, and equalize it according to the measure of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	 And be careful not to extend violently or compress too forcefully, as do many fools.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	 They often cause to occur by their operation a hot abscess or contraction in the limb; as we have already seen from their operations many times.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	 Then attach after the amputation, and a suitable operation, and the tightening of that limb, and calmness, and tranquility; and warn the sick person about it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	 And make him be careful not to move himself in the hour of his watchings and sleep, at his turning and agitation, and during his illness, and all movements of himself with the utmost strength of his power.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	 And let him be careful that the position of the limb does not follow a pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	 Because when he feels pain or injury in the position of the limb, then it is necessary that he changes himself to another position from which he does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	 And be careful with him so that his position is equal and straight; so that no twisting occurs in the limb when it is being restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	 The quality of the tightening of the broken limb is as I have told.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	 Know that the broken limbs are diversified according to their smallness, and the size of them, and their shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	 Those that are small, such as the arm, and finger, and foot, and similar ones; then it is necessary that there be a wrapping of soft and delicate cloth.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	 But those that are large, such as the hip and leg; it is necessary that there be a wrapping wide and hard in them.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	 Because a wide bandage connects a large limb and tightens it uniformly from all sides with an equal tightening, so that no stain enters it.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	 Then begin after your amputation to place a suitable ointment on it, on soft wool at the site of the fracture itself.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	 Then begin to roll the ligament over the location of the fracture with three or four rolls, according as the limb deserves; and tighten your hand slightly with the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	 Then go with it to the upper part from the location of the fracture, and tighten it less than your previous binding that you bound the fractured place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	 Then stretch the roll from the location of the fracture slightly, and soften the binding gradually until you take from a healthy place a large amount.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	 Then take another linen cloth, and roll it again over the fractured place with rolls.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	 Then go with the roll to the lower part from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	 And let your operation be in binding and softening of the roll, according to what we said in the upper roll.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	 Then place between the rolls from soft wool or cloth equal to the curvature of the fracture if there is any curvature; and if not, do not put anything there.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	 Then roll over another linen cloth.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	 Then place stars evenly over these rolls immediately, if there is no swelling or hot abscess.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	 If there is swelling or an abscess, then place over it what sits under the abscess, and remove the swelling; and leave it for some days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	 Then bind over them the stars.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	 The stars should be made from the middle of a wide reed, shaved and well-formed; or they may be made of wood from which cribra are made, such as pine, elder, or palm branches, or calingi; and let the width of all the stars be according to this form and the same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	 However, the star that is placed over the affected limb should be a little thicker and wider than the other stars; and the length of the star should be according to what is appropriate for the member in size and thickness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	 Then bind over the Star with another plaster, according to the first binding.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	 Then bind properly with threads, as we said regarding binding; and this is so that your binding over the site of the fracture is stronger than the fracture itself; and the farther away from the fracture the binding is, the less it should be.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	 The threads should be of medium thickness and fineness, and made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	 Because if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the operation of fools binding with thick cords of twisted linen, there is a great error; for the binding falls away from them due to their poor quality.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	 And thin threads do not fit again; because you will not obtain with the binding what you wish.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	 It is not appropriate that there be less than a finger's width between one star (stitch) and another.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	 If the patient is injured by the extremities of the stitches after binding in healthy places: then place beneath them with soft wool or camel's hair until nothing is injured from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	 But when there is a fracture with a wound, and the break occurs in the skin, I will come back with regard to this matter in Chapter 2, specifically.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	 And know that not every fractured member should be bound with stitches from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	 Because when a member is large, it is not necessary to place stitches on top of it unless five days, or seven, or more have passed, according to your safety from the risk of hot abscess.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	 This is the method of plasters, with which the ancients restored fractures and dislocations.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	 § Common Plaster Method summarized, restoring a fracture, suitable for multiple temperaments, particularly women and children; because it is from that which heat does not prevail, nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is to receive from the flour mill dust, and it is the kernel of wheat that hangs on the walls of the mill during the movement of the millstone; and make it thus, except that you sieve it with egg white; and place its mixture not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	 Then use (it).
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	 Another emplastrum method, for healing a fracture, and dislocation, and twisting.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	 Prepare almess, laudanum, acacia, enula, and mugath; squeeze, from all of them an equal amount of juice, 10 parts of myrrh, 5 parts of each aloes, and 20 parts of alethil should be ground and sieved, and mixed with water alethil, or with egg white if the covering is heated for the weak.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	 Then use this emplastrum.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	 For it is a good mixture, it heals broken bones quickly, and benefits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	 Another emplastrum method, which also helps with fractures and twisting.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	 Prepare mugath, mess, white alteae, all in an equal amount of 10 parts of myrrh, 5 parts each of both aloes, 6 parts of acacia, and 20 parts of Armenian pounded bulbs should be ground with much pressure, sieved, and mixed with water or egg white; administer them.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	 Another emplastrum method for joints and separated bones from their places; it relieves pain that comes to them, and fissure of the bone, and fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	 Take sheared wool, immerse it in vinegar, boiled oil; place it on the location.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	 And in this emplastrum there is no virtue of healing, but it is good for the relief of hot boils; and it drives out pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	 Method of Empalisting, which restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	 Take leaves from the fig tree of deafness and leaves from the wild papaver (opium poppy) tree; grind them all together and make an ointment from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	 Method of quick emplasting for the restoration of a broken bone and when you wish to dissolve a remaining boil.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	 Take equal parts of root of althea (marsh-mallow), chamomile, flowers of violets, and herb flour; grind all together and make a paste with wine if the member is not heated.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	 If it is heated (the affected area), then make the paste with warm coriander water or with water and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	 Another stronger method for the dissolution (of a boil), which is more powerful than the first, when a hard boil appears during the restoration of a member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	 Take equal parts of root of althea (marsh-mallow), linseed, balustium (balm of Gilead), melilotus, samsucci (white poplar), flowers of violets and chamomile; grind all together and make a paste with sweet water, salix water or wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	 Apply this (paste) according to the warmth of the member and the calmness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	 Hippocrates, however, did not say in his book that it should be placed on a broken member during its restoration except for a plaster made from beeswax and oil; no other (substance); and he said that it should be medium between thickness and subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	 Galenus, however, saw fit that such materials should be placed on a broken member during its restoration as those in which there is an absorption of heat, such as myrrh, aloes and frankincense, and similar ones from what we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	 Method of plaster application for wound and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	 Mix ground figs, chickpeas, human hair cuttings or bird feathers, alum and equal parts of salt. Grind and sieve them, then make a plaster from this mixture.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	 The amount that should remain bound depends on whether pain does not occur, nor itchiness, nor is the broken bone moved from its place. Then do not dissolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	 If there is severe itchiness, disturbing pain or swelling at the site, then hurry and dissolve it within an hour, remove the plaster from it: take a soft cloth or seawater-soaked sponge, moisten it with warm water, wash the area until the itchiness subsides and the pain is relieved.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	 Then let the limb rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	 Then place on it a piece of soft, vinegar- and oil-soaked wool or rose oil: tie it over it at night until you are safe from a hot abscess, the swelling of the limb subsides, and the pain is relieved.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	 Then repeatedly apply fine binding and small plaster: do not bind it with your initial tight binding or delicate bandages until it is healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	 If you see that the abscess, redness, pain, swelling and all other symptoms have been completely removed, and if you need plaster and binding, then do as before equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	 If there is no symptom in the limb that we mentioned before, then do not dissolve it, unless after three days, four, five or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	 And when it is released after twenty days, according to your observation from the dissolution of the limb, as we said, until the fracture adheres and the coagulation of flesh grows on it: also add more binding in your binding than your first binding, and also increase the amount of weak food, according to the reminder of its presence.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	 If you see that the place of the fracture is already drying out and shrinking too much: then you know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	 Pour warm embrocation onto it at every juncture where you are dissolving it, and let it be for all three days, and alum tighten it slightly.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	 By this procedure, nourishment flows to the limb and it heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	 But what foolish restorers do, replacing the fracture of a limb by another method, when it should not be replaced at all according to what is necessary, and it is replaced crookedly, is an error from their procedure, and great fear: and if it had been correct, they would have said it in their ancient books, and operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	 And I did not see any trace of theirs at all in that matter, and it is more correct to not do that.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	 [Section] On the making of an injury in the head.
Caput III.	 Chapter III:
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	 Species of fractures are diverse, and their shapes numerous: and causes of it are distinguished.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	 From a fracture is one that occurs from a blow with a sword, and the blow removes the bone completely to where it reaches the pith, which is under the bone, just as an ax does in wood; and because of this, this type of fracture is called Axial Fracture.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	 Or a sword cuts something of the bone and cuts its face but does not cut through to the end of it; and this type of fracture is called Calcan, that is, Absolute Lever Fracture.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	 And there is a wound of two fractures, either large or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	 And from a fracture is one that is crushing, or grinding; and the cause of it is a blow with a stone, or a fall upon a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	 And this fracture is also penetrating, which already approaches the flesh that is under the bone; or it is on the face of the bone; and this type of fracture has a wound, either small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	 And from a fracture is one that is hidden in the bone at its subtlety (the tip) of a hair; and it is a small crack, and because of this, this type of fracture is called Hairline Fracture.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	 And from these (fractures) is a fracture that occurs from a fall or blow of a stone and similar things, which make the layer of bone to enter inside and make a hollow place; as happens with brass caldrons when they are struck and part of them enters inside.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	 Indeed, it most frequently occurs in the bones of moist heads, such as those of children's skulls.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	 And all these types of fractures are set separately, and I will return with a reminder of this (treatise) to its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	 We know all these types of fractures through examination upon them, and investigation of their nature with probing, and removal of the rotten flesh that is on them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	 The species of Capillaris is known by this, that it appears on the face and is scraped off and sewn over with an ointment; for the fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	 In the treatment of a fracture, consider first the condition of the patient; then if you see from his conditions that it indicates a manifest sign of fear, such as cholera vomiting, stretching, loss of intellect, absence of speech, fainting, acute fever, eye discharge, redness of eyes and similar conditions in multiple disorders, without a doubt it will not heal; but if you see non-terrifying conditions and hope for recovery, then begin the treatment.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	 If someone comes to you wounded first with a wound, and this is in winter days, then it is necessary that you strive for the removal of the bone before the 14th day under any circumstances.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	 And if it is in summer days, then it is necessary to hurry and remove the bone before the 7th day, before what is under the bone from fat corrupts, and such conditions occur as we have mentioned.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	 If the fracture of a bone has already reached the fat touching the brain and is accompanied by grinding and pulling, then it is necessary to cut the grinded and smoothed part, as I have told you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	 And it is necessary to shave the head of the wounded person; and to examine the face according to whatever method possible for you; and according to the shape of the wound, and what is light on the patient.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	 If blood flow or hot abscess occurs to you while examining the bone, then oppose it with what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	 And it is that you fill the place with cloths soaked in wine and rose oil; and make the wound rest until the abscess settles, and be careful of bleeding.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	 Then begin with the treatment of the bone, and its removal.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	 And that is done according to one of two methods.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	 One method is to cut the bone with a sharp knife; and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	 Then administer another knife wider than the first, somewhat; and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	 Then administer yet another knife even wider than the second one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	 And the second method is that you have a number of different knives; some of which are wider than others; and some shorter than others; and they should be at the ends of sharpness, and made of iron or steel; and use them with ease in striking the knife, so as not to hit the head and hurt it.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	 If the bone is hard, then it is necessary to bore around its circumference before you administer the knife, with trephines that are not too deep; and they are not called thus unless because they do not penetrate through the bone to what lies beyond it; therefore the tip of the trephine is rounded above that which is beneath the head, sharp below, like an edge, and a small circle prevents submerging and penetrating the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	 And it is suitable for you to take a number of these trephines, one of which should correspond to the thickness of the bone, until the present bone has all the trephines; whose sharp edges should be of a quantity in length and width, according to the thickness of that skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	 And this is the form of three kinds of trephines or trepans.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	 The nature of the perforation on the bone fracture is as follows: you should place the trephine upon the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has already been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	 Then change the trephine to another place and place there the size of a fingertip within every hole, or about that much.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	 Then cut with the chisels what is between each hole in the bone, and make that more delicate than possible on top of the edge of smoothness, as we said, until you root out the bone, either with your hand or with some other tools which you have prepared for it: such as tenaliae and subtle forpices.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	 And it is necessary that you take all caution so that the trephine or chisel does not touch any part of the skull.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	 When you are perforating the bone and it is separated from the skull, if it is continuous with it and you extract it, it is necessary that you file down, and even out the remaining part on the bone with another similar chisel.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	 Nevertheless, it should be thin and delicate more than other chisels.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	 If some part of the small bones remains and the cartilages: then take them with ease, with whatever tools are at hand.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	 Then care for the wound after that with linen and ointments as we said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	 Another method of the operation is easy, completely far from fear: which Galen said and praised it greatly: this is his speech.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	 It is necessary for you first to begin to remove the bone from the place where the fracture is more violent and clear: until when you have removed that part, and placed under it the end of this concave chisel, whose shape this is.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	 And the concave part of the lens, not cutting anything: and the sharp part of it extending in two sides of it, as you see: so that the concave part of the lens is attached to the siphoid, with its sharp edge incident on the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	 Then strike upon the Incisorium from one side with a small hammer, until you cut through the bone easily, as is customary: and be careful that no cloth happens to fall into it, which might happen accidentally, which you fear entirely.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	 And if the physician were not more foolish than men, nor ignorant of it, nor asleep, then if anything remained attached to the bone from the cloth in some places, he would cut it off along with the edge of the incisorium lenticularis itself, and remove it easily.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	 It is freed from it without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	 If the bone fracture does not penetrate to the cloth, and that which is cut off from the bone is its face, and coarseness and subtle spicules remain in it: then it is necessary that you smooth out that roughness, and grind out those spicules with finer rasps, which you have prepared in various amounts, so that it is possible for you to apply them more conveniently and correctly at each place according to the operation, and the fractured bone, and its figure.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	 And it is necessary that you administer it according to your own measure, first grinding the bone more widely with those rasps.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	 Then use a finer one after it.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	 And do not cease to do that continuously until you reach administering it more thinly and finer of them all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	 In each of the remaining small fissures and fine fractures, it is necessary to administer care according to that which leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	 And it is a matter that cannot be hidden over all, to which in this art every study applies, and it stands on what we have written and shown regarding large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	 If the membrane is found to be retained when you are removing bone: then it is necessary that you take a linen cloth, according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	 Then take another cloth, either doubled or tripled, and immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it on top of the first one; make it as easy as possible to do so without burdening the wound.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	 Then administer it on top of the broad ligament, and do not tie it unless for the amount that holds the wound only; and leave it with this care for one day or two days, until you are assured of being free from hot inflammation.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	 Then dissolve it and administer the following remedies with which excessive dryness is needed: such as the root of the lily, and grain of wheat, and pepper, and aristolochia, and similar ones; and it is to be made from these remedies a powder that is powdered over the wound like dry things.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	 And universally administer all medicine with the property of purging and not biting (or harming).
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	 And be careful according to your strength (ability), so that the wound is clean during your treatment; neither let it be dirty with ointment nor filthy.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	 Do not allow the pus to accumulate in it at all, since when pus collects on a cerebral membrane, it corrodes it and rots it, and afterwards a great evil happens after that; and this has already happened in the head wound, when the bone is being cleansed from it, especially when care of it is neglected, blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	 Consider then, if afflictions occur to the sick as we have said, know that it is certainly dangerous (or fatal).
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	 If the swelling does not occur, unless it is caused by the medicine placed upon him, and it is in the power of that medicine to cause the swelling: then it is necessary for you to take one part from honey and three parts from rose oil, and anoint with them a cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	 Then place him on a sow's bladder: afterwards, take care of him with medicinal substances that are appropriate, until he is cured.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	 On the Restoration of the Nose when it is Broken.
Caput IIII.	 Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	 Know that the nose is not broken except for its two superior parts together or one of them: this is because there are two bones in it; since its lower part is cartilaginous, it does not break and no other damage occurs to it except abrasion, twisting, and deviation.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	 If one of the two parts is broken, then it is necessary for you to insert a small finger into the nostril and align the fracture with your index and thumb fingers from outside until the nose returns to its natural shape; and this should be done skillfully and easily.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	 And beware that during your procedure you do not cause pain to the sick person.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	 If the fracture is in the superior part of the nose and the finger does not reach it: then the radius must be aligned at the end where there is a small bulge.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	 If the fracture is in two parts, then do the same: and hasten with its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	 And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day in a warm room of sweating patients.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	 Then insert a strip of linen from a flax cloth into the end of the nose if the fracture is in one part; or insert two strips if the fracture is in two parts: and let there be a bulge of sufficient size on the linen to fill the nostril.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And some of the ancient restorers said that linseed should be poured into butter and exchanged daily.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	 That does not seem right to me, on the contrary, it should be that linseed is poured into butter made from cow's milk, mixed with flour milled powder.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	 Then let the linseed go until the bone hardens and the cartilage becomes calloused.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	 And sometimes a goose feather is inserted into the place of the linseed, after it has been covered with soft cloth; and this causes the fracture in the nose to be held more firmly, and prevents the weak from being prevented from breathing.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	 And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	 If you wish, do it; if you wish, do it with linseed.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	 If the nose again occurs while you are operating on a boil, fill the nose with hot plasters made of alum or pitch soaked in rose oil or with a little jalap.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	 But if it does not occur that the boil is hot, then it is necessary to fill it with plasters made of wheat bran and incense powder mixed with butter from cow's milk.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	 Then place a soft wad on top of it, and do not tie the nose with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	 If the bones of the nose are broken in a small fracture or ground, then it is necessary to cut through them and extract them with instruments that are suitable for them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	 Then take care of it with it until it heals and hardens with suitable plasters or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	 If a wound occurs between the nose, then it is necessary to treat it with linseed; and administer a lead tube until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	 Chapter on the restoration of the lower jaw when it breaks apart.
Caput V.	 Chapter V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	 When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound: observe then if the fracture is only on the outside and it does not break into two, and bends towards the inside: then its recognition is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	 Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side of the jaw, you should insert your left index finger into the weakened bone: similarly, if the fracture is in the left jaw, then insert your right index finger: and press with it the swelling of the fracture towards the outside with ease using your other hand from the inner part of the bone properly, and push it equally.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	 If the fracture of the jaw has already separated into two parts, then it is necessary to administer traction from both sides, according to rectitude: until a possible alignment can be achieved.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	 If however movement or displacement of the teeth has already occurred, or if they are broken: then bind them with a thread of gold, silver, or silk.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	 Then place linen cloth over the broken jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	 Then place over it a double cloth and place on top of the cloth a large cross made properly or an equal piece of leather soles in length of the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	 Then bind it above as you prepare the binding for it and its application is suitable until it is not destroyed: and tell the patient to remain calm and at peace: and place mild soft food for him.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	 If you think that something has changed in shape by some means: then go quickly and dissolve it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	 Then correct what has changed from it, and apply a plaster made of milled flour with egg white or with wheat flour, after you have removed the linen cloth: and place soft wool over the plaster.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	 While that adhering plaster remains on it, and the bone arrangement does not change, leave it undisturbed until it heals; or suture the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	 This fracture is frequently sutured in three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	 If a warm abscess should occur meanwhile, then administer what I said several times for its alleviation until the abscess is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	 And if there is a fracture with a wound, be aware.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	 If already the bone fragment is separating out, or from a wound bed: then be skillful in this matter, to remove those fragments of the wound bed together with what fits with you in their removal using instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	 If, however, the opening of the wound is narrow, then enlarge it with a leech according to your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	 Then when you have removed the wound bed and nothing remains of it, or if the opening of the wound is wide: and if not, place on top of it ointments that are suitable for this, and let it heal until healed.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	 Chapter on Restoring a Fork (when it breaks).
Caput VI.	 Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	 The fork breaks most often from the front part near the shoulder, and its fracture occurs according to one of three modes.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	 Or it breaks apart into two parts, apart from the presence of wound bed; and this is easier to restore.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	 "Likewise, that which happens in ossify satagia: and it is more difficult for restoration.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	 "Likewise, that which is a fracture with a wound.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	 "And the operation in it when there is a fracture without a wound, is to have two assistants present, so that one holds the support for the broken furcula, and the other extends the neck towards the opposite side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	 "Then make an equal fracture with your fingers until it takes the desired shape; there should be neither protrusion nor hollow in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	 "If you need more extension, then it is necessary to place a ball under the weak person's head made of cloth or wool; and let its size be according to your need; and stretch, lift, and compress the ball with your hand until an equal fracture is achieved, as required.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	 "If you cannot pull out the extremity of the furcula because it has reached deep inside; then the weak person should lie on his neck; and place a puluinar medium under his shoulder in size, and press an assistant's shoulder towards the bottom, until the bone of the furcula that is deep inside is lifted upwards; and then correct the fracture and make it equal with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	 "If you feel a swelling from the furcula and it moves; then you should press on it and extract the swelling with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	 "If it remains in the bone, then use your drill bit in its incision, after you have placed a saving instrument under the furcula; and the tool is made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	 "And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	 "It resembles a spiral shell without hollow.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	 "And let its width be according to the need for it from the size and part of the bone.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	 The length [of the instrument] is also as much as possible for you for the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	 It has two ends, as you see: and one end should be wide, and the other narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	 If the wound opening that you cut when extracting the splinter of bone is wide, and it gapes, remove the hot cautery; then bring together two lips of the wound with stitches.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	 If the wound opening is small, or if you fear hot cautery; then fill the wound with cloths and lint according to the size of the wound incision.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	 If hot cautery occurs, then soak the cloth in rose oil, vinegar and wine and place it on top of it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	 But the binding of the bone without a wound and without cutting is to place plaster made from milled flour with egg white on it.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	 And place a soft woolen cloth over it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	 Then place a sphere underneath if you need it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	 Then take the hemata, which is a roll that the Saracens hold, it should be very long; and its width should be one palm or approximately this much.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	 Then place two lints on top of the woolen cloth and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	 Then take a needle made from thin wood, whose width is three fingers, and similarly long.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	 Then thread the needle with the lint.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	 Then sew the cloth at the place of the hemata that falls on the break and location.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	 Then place the hemata on the break as they are rolled, and sew it over his neck, and under his healthy side, and under his weak side: and bring it over all parts, and so that the binding holds the break securely; and this is what will not be hidden from you, and entirely, so that the needle does not remove the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	 It is necessary to examine the sick person every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	 Whenever the ligament becomes soft and you see the knot moving, then correct it, and tighten the ligament.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	 Then place the sick person's sleep on his back, and put a small awl under his sleep near his side, so that when he is raised up, help comes to him from his side.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	 Raise then the fracture of the collarbone through the elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	 Or bind his arm to his neck; and do not loosen the bandage unless it occurs at the place occurring from itch or abscess, until twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	 Then renew the plaster if you see his face toward that (it).
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	 And add to the incision, and let it be, until it is healed and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	 The fracture of the collarbone is tightened and supported for as many as forty days; and sometimes it happens to some people in less (time).
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	 Chapter on the Restoration of a Fractured Spatula.
Caput VII.	 Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	 A spatula rarely breaks, and when it does, it is usually at a wide place; and the edges are the only ones that break from it.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	 When it breaks at that place, and breaks in the middle of it, and is not known unless by touch; then according to its shape, prepare the treatment for the fracture.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	 And bring it back to its natural shape in every way possible to you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	 Then put powder of millstone with egg white and soft wool on top, and place a small piece of double cloth on it.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	 Then put a wide knot made from thin wood of the same size as the spatula or slightly larger on top.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	 If there is a depression under a star in any spatula's handle, then equal the depression with soft wool until the star descends equally.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	 Then roll over it with long alchemilla thread, using a suitable tightness and the firmness of the star, until it is not moved from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	 And consider the suture in every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 Whenever the suture is softened, tighten it and equalize the star if it moves from its place: let the weak lie on the side of the healthy.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	 And indeed the spatula is restored within twenty days or thirty days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	 When this number (20 or 30) is complete, then loosen the suture: and you will be safe.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	 For it is from bones whose fracture is not feared nor their solution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	 If it proceeds from a bone fragment and pierces beneath the skin, then cut above it and remove it.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	 And do as we have said in the fracture of a clavicle from the application of hot compresses if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	 Chapter on the restoration of a breast fracture.
Caput VIII.	 Chapter 8.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	 The breast is sometimes broken in the middle and it rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	 Its extremities, however, are much more often broken and crushed due to their accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	 When the middle of it is broken, which inclines towards the lower parts, and there occurs a violent pain, difficulty in breathing, and coughing; and perhaps blood vomiting occurs, and a depression is revealed in the fractured bone, and it is not hidden from sensation, its restoration is that the weak lies on its back: and place pulvinar between its spatulas.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	 Then press the humeri of it and join the ribs from both sides or flanks with hands: and compress in equal alignment of it, as much as possible for that and it agrees, until the shape of the bone returns, as it should be.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	 Then place on top of it (the wound) an ointment and a stopper (bandage), and on top of that place a small wooden peg from subtle wood such as willow or boxwood, and similar ones in a thin form, after you have wrapped it in cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	 Then bind it (the fracture) with a bandage so that it is not moved: and go around it according to its roundness to the back several times, and tighten it appropriately with a splint.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	 Then consider the bandage in every hour, and whenever it softens, tighten it: and if its loosening is caused by itching, corrosion that occurs at the place, or pain, or abscess: then hurry up, and unbind it, remove the ointment, and correct what has occurred with the method of its treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	 Then apply the ointment back to the wound if you see it coming off: and attach a splint until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	 Chapter on the Restoration of Ribs when they are Broken.
Caput IX.	 Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	 Know that the break of ribs does not occur except in large areas which follow the back and from their extremities on the front side.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	 And it does not happen to them because of rubbing, but rather because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	 And the knowledge of this (the broken rib) is not hidden from the sensation when it is investigated with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	 And the restoration of this (the broken rib) is done so that it is aligned with fingers according to the possible method until it is in its original shape as needed.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	 Then apply ointment and bind the fractured bone with a splint if necessary.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	 If the break of ribs is towards the interior: then a severe pain occurs for the sick, and puncture, like that which occurs in pleurisy; because the bone pierces the lining, and even to him there occurs difficulty in breathing, cough, and blood vomiting many times; and this is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	 And the ancients have been skilled in this with many instruments: and among them are those who say, to place foods for the sick that generate inflammation and windiness, so that the stomach is inflamed, and extended, and pushed outward towards the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	 We however abhor, that a cause for making a hot abscess should occur, unless it happens.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	 If it has already happened, then add (something) to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	 And some of them said: place a windy substance on the spot, then suck it out with force, and it is more similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	 Nevertheless, it is feared that windy superfluities are attracted to the spot due to the position of weakness.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	 And some of them said: the spot should be covered with wool that has already been soaked in hot oil; and lice should be placed between the ribs until it is filled; so that the bandage is equal when it is folded according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	 Then the sick person will be treated with a treatment of pleurisy from food and medicine.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	 If something powerful constricts the sick person, more than he can tolerate, and wounds his flesh with a sharp point or puncture, and we fear over him; then it is necessary that we cut open the spot and reveal the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	 Then we place on it an instrument that conserves the sifac (a tool used for breaking bones), whose memory has gone before; and we cut the bone easily, and cut it ourselves.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	 Then we bring together two lips of the wound, if it is large with suture; and treat it ourselves with plasters, until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	 If a hot abscess occurs meanwhile; then run, and put lice in rose oil, and place it on the spot; and treat the sick person with whatever is suitable for an abscess.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	 The patient should also lie on his side regarding the side he sleeps on, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	 On the restoration of a fracture of the spine and neck.
Caput X.	 Chapter X.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	 Fracture sometimes occurs in the bones of the neck, and it rarely happens to them that there is rubbing: and similarly with the spondylus of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	 Whenever such a thing happens to someone, and one wishes to know whether it can be cured or not: then consider it carefully.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	 If you see his hands already softened, stunned and dead; and he cannot move them, nor extend them, nor contract them; and when you press them with your fingers and prick them with a needle, he does not feel it or any pain there: then you know that it is incurable, and in most cases it is mortal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	 If he moves them and feels the pressure with his fingers and the prick: then you know that the hump of the bone is sound, and that what is weak will be cured with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	 If a similar thing happens to the spondylus of the back, and you wish to know whether it can be cured or not: then consider his feet; then if you see that they are softened, and that the same thing has happened as in the hands; when he lies on his back, flatulence and hunger come out without his will; when he lies on his stomach, hunger comes out without his will; when he tries to defecate, he cannot: then you know it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	 Therefore, no effort should be made in its treatment.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	 But if nothing like that happens to him, the condition is less severe.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	 And the treatment for what happens in that condition is to apply hot poultice; so place warm oil on the rubbed spondylus: or with the poultice of goose fat.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	 Place it on top of that frequently throughout the day until the hot poultice settles down; then place a plaster there, one that strengthens, dries and binds, and bind it with a bandage: and tell the patient to rest in peace and quiet.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	 He shall not sleep on the part where he found pain until it is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	 If it happens near the fracture of the bone sathaiatum, or something which is already separated from it: then it is necessary that you excise above the skin and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	 Then gather together two edges of the wound if it is large, with suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	 Then treat him with some ointment of the incarnation until it is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	 If the last bone of alhausos is broken and it is the end of the tail: then it is necessary to introduce your left thumb into the anus, and with your right hand break the broken bone equally, according as possible, and with a second correction.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	 Then place him on his back and remove the bone: then treat the wound as before with the preceding care until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	 Chapter on the restoration of ankle.
Caput XI.	 Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	 Rarely are the bones of the ankles broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	 If they are broken, then the fracture is not except for comminution at their extremities; and they are cut in length and decline towards the inside; and it happens that a weak pain occurs at the location, and puncture; and the leg which is broken becomes paralyzed.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	 And the restoration of it is that you stretch out your hand over him until you know the shape of the fracture.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	 If the fracture is only at its extremities, then align that fracture according to the correction you are prepared with, until it resembles its natural shape.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	 If the fracture is in length or already declines towards the inside: then make the weak one lie on his stomach until you are prepared for the restoration of that fracture.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	 When you align it (the bone), place an ointment on it; then place a pin made of wood or hide over it, and bind the bandage on it so that you do not fear the displacement of the fracture or the removal of the pin.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	 Apply an equal concavity to those [things] that fill it, until it is seized by a ligature according to equality; and command the sick person to sleep on his back or on his healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	 If however it happens to be a hot abscess: then cease from its extension and its restoration until the hot abscess settles; and place upon what is sitting the hot abscess, according to what has preceded, then return to its restoration; and bind it as necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	 If however a fracture occurs in bone, or it is crushed, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	 Chapter on the restoration of fractures, Aid.
Caput XII.	 Chapter 12.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	 Aid is that which extends from the elbow to the head of the spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	 If it therefore breaks, then its restoration is according to one of two methods.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	 One is: that you take a flat board of medium thickness, according to this shape which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	 And bind two cords at its two ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	 Then it is suspended from a raised place; and the sick person sits on a chair.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	 Then throw the broken arm over the board so that it reaches its hinge, where a notch is attached to the middle of the board.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	 Then suspend something heavy above it so that the servant extends towards the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	 The physician then sets the fracture with his hands until it returns to its proper position.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	 And another method is to lay the patient on his back and hang the hand from his neck with a rope.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	 Then command two servants to hold one of them above the fracture with their hands and for the other to hold below it and each should extend to their respective sides.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	 And if you wish a stronger extension, then bind under the fracture with rope and above it with another rope and let each of the servants stretch to their respective parts.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	 If the fracture is near the end of the upper arm, then a rope should be placed under the elbow and another one below the fracture towards the forearm.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	 And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow, then a rope should be placed at that place and above the elbow.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	 Then set the fracture easily and without strain until it is in its proper position and applied well. Then bind it if no warm abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	 But if a warm abscess occurs, then release the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	 Place on it soft, scoured linen soaked in vinegar and rose oil until the abscess settles down. Then bind it and the method of binding is to place a plaster over the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	 Then apply a new cloth wrap over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	 Then raise the arm to support it and place your open hand on the shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	 Place a cloth and bind the supporting arm so that the arm remains in place like a star, unless it prevents you from moving or anything breaks off from the fractured bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	 If you fear that something might change from a broken bone, then use a larger and stronger awl: it is to place the awl over the fracture itself which is wider and stronger than other awls.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	 Over every awl, place its width equal to a finger: and let the length of the awls be according to the fracture with an addition of three fingers from all sides.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	 Then tie over the awls the ligature that I said at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	 And it is to be your ligature over the fracture site stronger.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	 As the fracture lengthens, let the ligature become smaller.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	 If you see the position of the awls and ligature, as we have said, at the time when you restore the limb immediately, then do so: and if you fear a hot abscess, then release the ligature and awls until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	 Then consider the ligature for three days, so that itchiness, swelling, or food not reaching the limb due to the tightness of the bandage does not occur.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	 Correct it all, as we have said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	 But if you are confident that nothing will happen from it: then do not release the ligature, unless after three days or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	 The sick person should lie on his back and place his hand on his stomach: and put under him a wool-filled cushion evenly.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	 Consider at all hours of the night or day that the figure of the broken limb is not loosened, or the ligature softened.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	 Correct it all with your power.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	 Place the food for the sick person according to the order we have given, so that the food is subtle at first, until the bone begins to bind: then it is necessary for the food to be thickened.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	 In custom for assistance and of the leg, it should be bound for forty days: then therefore it is necessary, that it should be loosened, and a bath administered, and it should be treated with ointments which correct it.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	 If the break is foul, scrape it: then do not loosen the bandage and splints from it for fifty days, and until two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	 Chapter on the restoration of the broken arm.
Caput XIII.	 Chapter 13.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	 The arm is composed of two bones which are called the two fore-arm bones.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	 One of them is small: and that is the one which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	 And the other is large, and it is placed below the small one from beneath.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	 Therefore perhaps only the larger fore-arm bone breaks, or perhaps both break.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	 When therefore the smaller fore-arm bone above breaks, then the restoration of it is easy, and its healing is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	 And when the lower fore-arm bone breaks, the breakage of it is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	 And that is worse, when both bones break together.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	 If the bone that breaks is the smaller fore-arm bone above, then it is fitting for the doctor at its restoration, to set a smaller extension with ease, until it becomes equal (to the other part).
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	 But if the larger fore-arm bone is the one that broke, then it is necessary to set a strong extension.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	 And it is necessary to set the shape of the hand at its restoration, and the extension of it extended beyond the wrist.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	 The thumb of the hand should be higher than all the fingers above it: and the lower joint (of the thumb) should be higher than all the joints or the rest: and the wrist should be level with the weak one sitting squarely upon itself, and the wrist should be in front of it, or directly under it, at a height so that the weak one does not labor.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	 Then, the servant shall extend the arm from the lower part, either with his hand, or with a ligature.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	 And another servant shall stretch [it] similarly from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	 Then the physician shall equalize the bone, until he reduces it to the best shape possible.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	 If there are shards in a broken bone, then try to return every fragment to its place using your strength.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	 If it appears that a shard has been separated and punctures the skin, and there is no hope for its restoration: then seal over it, and remove it as we have said in the previous [instructions].
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	 If there is a fracture with an open wound, I have already made a special chapter for that, so follow its treatment from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	 If a hot abscess occurs at the beginning of your treatment, then take a cloth soaked with wax made from rose oil, white wax, and be in between thickness and subtlety; tie the cloth over it with a thin ligature until the abscess subsides; then remove the wax, and place an ointment prepared from flour mill powder and egg white.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	 Then place the trepan (or trephine) over it, and let the trepan placed on the fracture be slightly wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	 And know that the number of trepans for the arm is six in multiple arrangements; whether it is a fracture in one hole or two holes simultaneously.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	 Then place a stronger and more intense ligature over the location of the fracture, and add some extra tension to the ligature above or below the fracture; or place a softer ligature slightly closer to the fracture, according to what was remembered in the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	 And let the bandages wrapped around the fracture be made of soft, moist fabric; and they should not be hard or rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	 And let the thread with which it is tied be made from linen, of medium thickness between subtle and coarse, as we have said.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	 Consider the limb and the ligament after days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	 If something happens for which correction is necessary, such as itching that occurs in a limb: then it is necessary, to anoint the limb with embroces and warm water until the itching ceases, and then let the limb alone until it has ceased, and then repeat the binding.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	 If the binding has already been softened and the bone has already been removed, and similar cases: then correct it completely with your skill, and consider it again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	 For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to an excess of binding, then it is necessary to soften it a little and let it alone for some days until it reaches its nourishment, and then bind it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	 But if nothing of what we have said happens to the sick one, then it is not necessary to loosen it unless after twenty days, or about this much.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	 Then the hand of the sick one should be suspended to his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	 And let his neck be kept straight and guarded with your skill against excessive movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	 Make him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	 And know that this fracture is restored in thirty or thirty-two days; and it may be restored within twenty-eight days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	 Everything depends on the temperaments of the body and the qualities of strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	 Chapter on the Restoration of Fractures (Hand).
Caput XIIII.	 Chapter XIV.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	 Know that fracture rarely occurs in shaving hands or tying fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	 And it does not happen to him unless he is rubbed many times.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	 When there is a fracture of the foot or rubbing: then the sick one should sit on a square seat and a chair be placed opposite him at an equal height.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	 Then place his hand upon her extended [surface].
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	 The assistant should then extend the broken bones and the physician should equalize them until they are united with a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	 Then it is necessary that he places ointment and wool, unless there happens to be a hot abscess.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	 Then place the wooden probe on it according to the size of the location; and you have already wound it up in linen cloth.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	 If the break is in the lower part around the heel of the foot, then make a similar sphere from cloth; and command the sick man to bend over it with his broken foot; then tie it with a long cloth.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	 And let the probe be made of skin, in which there is softness, so that it can be applied to the body of the foot; and tie it as necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	 If the break is on the outside, then it is necessary: to place one probe on top and another under the foot; and keep your hand open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	 Then place a tourniquet as the hand is rolled; and extend it between the fingers with a ligature.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	 If there happens to be a break in any of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, equalize as necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	 Then tie with the foot; and if there are any, place a straight probe beneath it, smaller, so that the break is raised and not moved.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	 If the break is in the other fingers, such as the middle, index, auricle or ring finger, then equalize and tie it with the healthy digit that follows it; or tie them all along its continuation; and it is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	 Or place a smaller probe on top of it, as we said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	 And consider for yourself, and after this arrangement of hot abscesses; and confront with it what is necessary when anything happens from that, according to its narrative.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	 On the restoration of a hip fracture.
Caput XV.	 Title XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	 The thighbone is broken frequently and becomes visible to the senses; because it turns towards the inner and posterior parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 And its restoration is done by tightening a ligament above the fracture, and another ligament below it.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	 The patient stretches himself out on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	 Then stretch all the tendons on their respective sides according to equality; and this is when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	 If, however, the fracture is near the root of the hip, then place a tendon on the side of the wing, so that extension falls upward; and another ligament below it.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	 And similarly if the fracture is near the knee, then place a tendon close to the knee so that extension falls towards the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	 Then the doctor shapes the bone with both hands until it is returned to its natural form; and the bone unites by a good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	 Then it is necessary to place plaster and a ligature if there is no abscess in the limb.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	 If an abscess occurs in it: then leave it for some days until the abscess settles down, and then return to your treatment.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	 The ligature is to be thus.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	 It is necessary to wrap a strong bandage over the fracture, that is, a plaster; and double it twice or thrice; and there remains excess of it.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	 Then wrap the leg until it reaches the heel at the root of the ankle.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	 And insert a long thread between the hip and the leg near the knee towards the lower parts; and the ends of the thread come from the upper part of both sides.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	 Then roll over the leg and hip to remove the excess from another bandage.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	 Then place stars (metal studs) on the hip at the site of the fracture itself, and place one star from them on the leg bone.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	 Then fill in voids between the leg and hip with soft cloth, to make it equal (match) the compression bandage.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	 Then begin with a strong compression bandage from the middle over the site of the fracture with three or four turns.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	 And as you extend the binding from the site of the fracture, let your compression be smaller, softer, and more relaxed.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	 Then direct the strings towards the two ends, which you inserted between the hip and leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	 Tie three stars (metal studs) on each end.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	 Then move with the two ends of the strings downwards until you reach the ankle.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	 And tighten both the ends and the stars on either side, so that the binding is not dislodged from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	 Then leave the compression in place as long as necessary to avoid rot (gangrene), abscesses, swellings and similar conditions in the limb.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	 If something should happen from this.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	 Therefore approach it with its resolution and correct whatever may have occurred there completely, as we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	 If however, there is a splinter of bone protruding from the broken bone: then it is necessary that you level it if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	 And if not, fill in the area and remove it; care for the affected site remembering the previous instructions until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	 And when this hip fracture is compressed, as additional metal studs are added to it, as we have said in the help section for both arms and legs.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	 However, in healing this broken hip, no lame-making stiffness occurs.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	 And if it heals without the application of another leg, then the limb on which it is must always be lame.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And know that the hip is to be bound for fifty days, or a little more, or a little less; all of this depends on the diversity of temperaments and other dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	 On the restoration of the fracture of the knee-joint.
Caput XVI.	 Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	 Know that the fracture of the knee-joint happens rarely, but it often occurs due to rubbing.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	 But if a fracture should occur, then it is either a cleavage or an opening in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	 And this may be with an ulcer, and without an ulcer.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	 It stands upright on it entirely with sensation.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	 And its restoration is so that it should correspond to the parts of what was fractured with the fingers until it comes together and joins as much as possible through equality, ease, and construction.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	 Then apply a plaster made from rice flour or milled wheat flour with egg white; place a round stopper over it if necessary; and bind it on top with the appropriate bandage.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	 Then consider all the dispositions that we have mentioned in other fractures; such as hot abscesses and similar conditions; so that you confront every occurrence with what is suitable for it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	 Chapter on the restoration of a fracture of the leg.
Caput XVII.	 Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	 Know that in the leg there are two bones; one is large and called the tibia, the other small and called the fibula.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	 And it happens with both of them that the kind of fracture that occurs with two bones in the arm also occurs; and for this reason the restoration of it is similar to that of the arm and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	 If both bones are fractured at once, the leg becomes bent in all directions.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	If the bone is broken more delicately, the leg turns towards the front part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	 If the bone is broken coarsely, you will find it lower; and it belongs to those things which are not hidden from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	 Then administer extension, equality, and ligature of stars according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	 Nevertheless, it is necessary, if the fracture of the leg is a foul one, having much setting-hay: so that the extension is smaller, and more gentle with your alluvial treatment.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	 In the leg indeed there is something of an operation like that in the arm: and it is, that when you tie the stars, and complete your whole operation, then take two bands from pine wood, which are used in the making of solaria [a type of sandal] which is placed under tables; and they are made from the flat parts of the hand; and choose from them those with small thickness, and neither too small nor too thin; and let their length be according to the length of the leg from the knee downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	 Then fold over one cloth with two turns, according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	 Place one part of the leg on one side, and another part of the leg on the other side; and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	 Then tie the two bands at three places from both ends and in the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	 For when traction is forbidden, the leg inclines to the right and left, and stands firmly on both feet.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	 And now let a cradle be made from wood according to the length of the leg, and place the leg in it to keep it still.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	 It is indeed very necessary that you do that in a bone fracture when there is a wound specifically.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	 Then consider the leg every day, and care for it with the utmost diligence, either from swelling or inflammation, or from other things.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	 If anything from those happens, then oppose it with what is necessary, until it heals, if God wills it.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	 On the Fracture of Bones in the Foot and Fingers.
Caput XVIII.	 Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	 The calcaneus does not have a complete fracture.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	 The bones of the foot sometimes have a fracture, and it happens less frequently with the fingers; it does not happen to them unless there is rubbing in many positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	 If a fracture of the bones of the foot occurs and you see that those bones have risen above one another, then place the affected foot on the ground prepared as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	 Then stand up and place your foot on that which is raised by those bones; then press or tread it, or hold it evenly; and keep it in its place until it returns to its original position.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	 Then apply the plaster and woolen cloth on top; place a small table under the arch of the foot, having two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	 Then bind it with a suitable bandage when you have wrapped it with linen and whatever else is needed.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	 When three or four days have passed, then loosen the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	 For you will find the bones aligned, whether they are fractured or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	 Therefore, the treatment for them is as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	 If some fingers are fractured, then restore them, and align them as I have told you in the treatment of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	 Then place a splint along the length of your finger, and let it be wider by a little; then place this table under your foot that I told you about, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	 If what is fractured consists of two or more bones, then place a splint of suitable size over all the fingers, wrapped in linen; and bind the table to the underside of the foot; and let the table stand on one side of the arch of the foot outside the middle, so that it holds it with good support.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	 It is necessary for you to remember, so that you do not forget, everything that I have told you concerning the other fractures from the accidents that I mentioned; and apply it to every accident as needed.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	 On the fracture of a woman's jaw, and the shoulder bone, and a man's thigh.
Caput XIX.	 Chapter XIX.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	 When a woman's jaw is fractured, then make her sit squarely.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	 Then tilt her head towards the back of it slightly, and hold it back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	 Then the midwife shall fill the womb of [the patient] with cloth until it is filled; and let there be within the wound as if it were a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	 Then the woman is to be shaken, and the back of her gradually scraped off.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	 For that reason, the cloth comes out until it becomes before the opening of the wound as if it were a sphere, and the broken bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	 Then place a feather upon her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	 When [the woman] wishes to stir [the matter within her womb], she shall easily remove the cloth, then stir; and return it in the same way as you first introduced it; then return to the feather first.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	 Let that be done for seven days or thereabouts, for the bone itself is restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	 And if [you] wish, take the bladder of an ewe, and tighten a reed tube over its opening, and insert the entire bladder into her wound.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	 Then blow into the tube with force until the bladder inflates within the wound; for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	 Then it shall be filled again with cloth, and remain for some days as we have said, until it heals.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	 And when the bone of the man's or woman's breast is broken, then administer for its restoration and for the equation described above to the bone of Ankles.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	 And do not hide the intestines in such close fractures, which occur less frequently, especially if there is something of study or use involved.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	 And understand my book much, for the fracture itself shows you in many positions of restoration and narrowing [of the wound], and understand this.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	 In the man's arm when broken, take the throat of a goose; and insert the arm into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	 Then place a covering of cloth over the [broken] limb and wrap it, and let it be for three days or thereabouts; and it will heal if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	 On the restoration of a broken bone, when it is with a wound.
Caput XX.	 Title (Chapter):
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	 It is fitting for the one who suffers from a fracture accompanied by a wound, especially if it is large like the hip bone or the humerus, to hasten and call for the phlebotomist immediately: if you are informed of the conditions for bloodletting as we have stated.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	 If the wound is bleeding, then you should hasten for its amputation so that powder made from burnt eggshells may be applied on it; if there is no other present.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	 Then proceed to set the fracture on the same day and do not delay it unless an abscess occurs.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	 If however an abscess hot occurs, then postpone the setting of it until the ninth day, until the abscess subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	 Do not approach him on the third or fourth day, for you would cause harm to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	 If the broken bone is protruding through the skin, then it should be reduced and set with your hands with ease and minimal extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	 If the extension is not prepared and the bone cannot be set by your hands, then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And the tool is made of iron, the length of which is seven or eight fingers, and its width according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	 Therefore it is necessary for the physician to take three or four from them according to the amount required for the treatment of any type of fracture in every case.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	 It should be round and its thickness should be small so that it does not become doubled during the hour of the operation under pressure on it; it should have sharp ends with a margin at its extremities.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	 The upper part of it should be as thick as the middle up to the lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	 This is its shape.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	 It is necessary in this operation that the end of it be placed sharp and curved upon the edge of the projecting bone; and push him with it simultaneously, until when the bone returns and becomes equal to some approximation.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	 Make the ends of the fracture equal on both sides.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	 If the ends of the fracture are delicate and do not accept the tool well, then it is necessary that you cut the edge of the bone until the tool has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	 If you are not able to reduce them with it as we said, then cut it with it as suitable for it from the chisels which I mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in any way possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	 Then plane that which remains in the bone due to roughness and small layers.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	 When the bone is reduced and afterwards finds a weak place after its reduction causing a violent pain, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	 Make that.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	 For you give great help to the weak one when you complete the restoration which you do for the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	 Then immerse cloth in woad dyed water (woad is a type of dye used in the Middle Ages).
Et proprie si est in aestate.	 And properly if it is during summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	 And do not place vinegar or anything containing oil over the wound, so as not to cause decay and corruption at the same place.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	 Then administer starwort (an herb used for healing) during the hour of completion of the restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	 And let the wound heal closed; so that you cut with forceps the hole in the joints according to the size of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	 And beware with all caution, not to bind the wound with the fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	 For many times foolish physicians have done this; and they caused decay over the weak ones or death, or gangrene, that is, pus.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	 Your constriction should be soft, gentle, and divergent from other fracture constrictions.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	 If the wound is bad or large and there are some adverse circumstances as we have mentioned, and you find pain at the site suspended: then it is not appropriate to place stars on it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	 Make them inversions from hard cloth at the location of the stars, and bind it with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	 And when it is one day or two days later, and you see that the wound has begun to produce pus: then remove from above it the cloth that you put on with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	 Then administer linen, and ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds: such as the four-drugs ointment and similar ones.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	 It is appropriate for you to loosen the binding.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	 Consider the wound every day at morning and evening until it consolidates and heals.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	 It is necessary that the limb should be prepared in such a way that the pus runs out of it easily towards the lower parts.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	 If many days pass and the wound does not consolidate or the pus is not expelled from it: then you will know that there are small fractures of bones in that place.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	 Therefore, you should explore the wound with a probe.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	 How many of those small fractures are separated, remove them and extract them.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	 And those which are not separated and pierce the limb and cause pain, attempt to cut them and remove them in any way that is possible for you.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	 If a boil or abscess, that is, an ulcerous sore or another kind of corruption and putrefaction happens on the wound: then it is necessary to apply to each one of them with what is suitable for its treatment, whose treatment was mentioned in its chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from that where my speech should be stationary, and to whom you present your mind when a bone breaks, and protrudes upon the limb, such as the hip bone, and the shoulder blade, and similar large bones, it is, that you do not presume on its attraction, for often death occurs from it; indeed, leave it alone until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	 Perhaps it will fall by itself after twenty or thirty days.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	 Therefore, take care of the wound if it seems to you; and if not, leave it alone.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	 Chapter on the treatment of a knot in the tread of a fracture.
Caput XXI.	 Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	 Often this knot occurs in the tread of healing for a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	 Particularly, which is near the joints; and it becomes corrupted from this shape of the limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	 And perhaps it prevents the limb from its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	 Therefore, consider if the knot is recent; administer medications that are astringent to it, such as aloes, olibanum, myrrh, sarcocola, acacia, and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	 Thus, to receive some of these or all of them; and cook them with astringent wine, or egg white, or vinegar; and place them on the knot on a plaster, and bind them over it tightly with good thread.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	 And leave the binding, do not loosen it for many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	 Then loosen it, and again another one, until the knot is removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	 Or bind tightly over it a flat piece of lead.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	 For lead has the property of removing everything that is feared from the limbs.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	 If the knot has already turned into a stone and is bound and urgently calls for its removal; then bind it from above on its part, and cut away the excess projecting out; or file it with certain files until it is removed; and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	 "Concerning treatment when a limb is restored and remains delicate, not according to its natural state.
Caput XXII.	 "Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	 "When a bone fracture is restored and the limb that follows remains delicate and weak, then it is not done except for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	 "One of the reasons is an abundance of loosening of the ligament and its tying, not as required: or due to excessive tightness of the ligaments, preventing nourishment from reaching the limb: or due to an excess of superfluous embrocation at an inappropriate time: or due to a scarcity of blood in the body of the sick person and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	 "And treatment for this is to feed the sick person and make his body soft until blood increases in him.
Et administra balneum.	 "And administer a bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	 "And pour joy and gladness over him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	 "Then place pitch on the limb: so that it attracts much nourishment to itself.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	 "And apply embrocation to it with warm water until the nourishment heals and returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	 "Concerning treatment for fractured bones when they are restored twisted.
Caput XXIII.	 "Chapter XXIII."\]     Quando fractura est t
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	 "When a restored limb becomes twisted after healing of the fracture, and protrusion or nodulation of the broken bone occurs, deforming the form of the limb; yet the limb does not prohibit its natural operation: then it is not necessary to listen to the person who believes that the limb should be fractured again."\]     Sed si ossis fractio eius est ad modum lenta et incompleta, tunc oportet ut frangatur denuo.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	 And there were many foolish physicians and healers who performed that in our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	 This operation is highly to be blamed, leading to death or great fear, as it is certainly fatal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	 But if lameness and swelling are recent: then it is necessary to bathe with warm water in which have been boiled soothing herbs such as althea leaves and the root of althea, sweet clover, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	 Make for him an ointment with a soothing plaster, such as well-made dyachilon.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	 Or take the mucilage of the root of althea, grind it with chicken fat or sesame oil; and anoint with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	 Or take ripe figs, crush them with dove droppings and similar medications that are called to decrease concretion.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	 And sometimes the swelling is relieved by persistent, old-fashioned, and gentle friction which is done with moist hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	 Move the limb to all parts at every hour.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	 If rigidity has already occurred before, and it has become strong and has turned into a stone, and the need for treatment with iron has arisen: then it is necessary to cut off the superficial part of it, and to relieve the continuity of the bone; and to incise what surplus there is from the swelling or bone with fine incisors; and administer ease in it with diligence and care.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	 Chapter on Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	 Chapter XXIV.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	 Dislocation is the separation of some joints from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	 It forbids movement and distorts the shape of the limb.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	 And it causes pain to come upon the weak and very severe injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	 When a dislocation occurs, it is necessary to hasten towards its restoration; it must not be delayed at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	 If it is delayed, the place becomes rotten, and perhaps with it the reduction of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	 Therefore, it is not permissible to move (the affected part), nor should it be extended during its rotting hour.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	 Because it often causes a spasm, and painful injuries.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	 However, when that happens, then you should hasten to the phlebotomy of the sick person.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	 Then it is let go until the rotting subsides.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	 Then anoint the limb with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	 Then reduce it gently.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	 And treat all the limbs with that of which the memory comes back to its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	 I myself have already arranged the chapters on dislocations, even according to what preceded in the fracture, from the top part of the body down to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	 Chapter on the care of dislocations of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	 Chapter XXV.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	 The two Jaws scarcely dislocate unless rarely.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	 Dislocation of both [occurs] according to one of two modes.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	 For, they are moved away from their places slightly, and softened somewhat.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	 Or, they are dislocated completely, with an integral dislocation, until they soften up to the chest part, until the sick person runs out of salt and cannot hold it, nor can close his mouth, and his tongue is rolled up along with speech.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	 But when the dislocation is slight, then it returns by itself with a multiplicity of positions along with scarcity.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	 But if the dislocation is complete and integral: then it is necessary that its reduction be administered quickly, without delaying deeply; and there should be someone to hold the head of the sick person; and the doctor should insert his thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocated jaw, if the dislocation is from one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	 Or, he should insert two thumbs simultaneously, if the dislocation is from both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	 And the other fingers of his hands shall be outside, as required.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	 And command the sick person to clean his jaws, and purify them for eating in every part.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 The doctor commands the jaw, and pushes the jaw, until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	 If the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are simultaneously involved: then administer fumigation with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both becomes easy; do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	 When they return and are aligned, and the mouth of the sick person is closed, and they do not soften up: then place on them small cloths of fluff made from beeswax and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	 Then it shall be tied with ease using soft sutures.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	 And the sick man's sleep should be upon his back: and his head shall stand between two pillows, so that he does not move to the right or left: nor let him try, or be forced to chew something: rather, let food be placed before him in a gentle manner, until the pain is removed, and the jaw is bandaged: then let him eat whatever he wants, and it shall be given to him with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	 He shall not labor upon the operation of his mouth in eating and drinking, nor speak, until the jaw is bandaged and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	 If the reduction of the jaws becomes difficult when they dislocate at some hour and do not return to their places: then often fevers occur, and continuous vomiting: and perhaps the sick man's bowel is opened, and he may vomit bile.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	 Therefore, when you see this: then know that it is a fatal mishap, and he who experiences this usually dies within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	 Chapter on the reduction of dislocation of the neck (Furcula) and the extremity of the arm.
Caput XXVI.	 Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	 The neck (Furcula) is not dislocated from within the side due to its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	 It is dislocated sometimes towards the outside, and this can be felt.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	 The restoration [of the affected area] is such that the sick one lies down on his back and extends his arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	 Then make room with your palm-like pressure, for it will return by itself.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	 Then place the plaster on top of it, and sprinkle powder and bind it [the wound].
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	 However, the ends which follow the elbow should not be dislocated, except rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	 If it is dislocated on any day: then it should be reduced and set according to what has been said, and as you have prepared [the necessary tools].
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	 Then place the plaster on top of it, and powder and bind it.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	 And tell the sick one to adhere to tranquility and rest until he is healed.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	 And with this same treatment, the arm should be reduced when it is separated even from its place [original position].
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	 Chapter on the Reduction of Dislocation of the Arm.
Caput XXVII.	 Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	 Know that the arm is not dislocated unless in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	 One way is that it is dislocated towards the palm side to the lower part.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	 The second one is to dislocate it towards the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	 And perhaps it is dislocated towards the upper part of the humerus; and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	 And it is not dislocated toward the back, because of the splint.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	 And it is not dislocated towards the front, because of nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	 Indeed, it is mostly dislocated and goes out towards the lower part, turned like a thimble; particularly in those whose flesh is scanty.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	 Because it comes out quickly in them, and enters quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	 But in those whose flesh is abundant, it behaves otherwise, that is to say because it comes out with difficulty, and enters with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	 And perhaps some people have a blow or an accident, and the humerus is dislocated by a hot splint, and it is believed that this is because it has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	 Therefore, you must test it, until you are certain of its nature, and then proceed with its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	 A dislocation is known when it turns towards the lower part like a thimble; and distinguish between a dislocated humerus and a healthy one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	 For you will find a clear difference among them, and in the head of the humerus you will find a hollow, and under the thimble, when you touch the head of the humerus, it feels like an egg; and an injured person cannot bring his hand back to his ear nor move it with all its movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	 And similarly, if it is dislocated towards the chest or upwards; then you will find a clear touch, and it will not be hidden.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	 And this kind of dislocation has an easy reduction when it is recent, or if the child is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	 The reduction consists in raising the hand above.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	 Then place your thumbs under the thimble, and raise the joint with strength to its place; and the hand is raised, and it is stretched upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	 Then place her below, for he himself quickly returns.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	 If he does not return as we said, and there has been a dislocation from the beginning, then it is necessary that the sick man be bathed in warm water, and an embrocation that softens and soothes should be administered, just as if they decoct root of althea, fenugreek, and melilotus in water, and it should be administered.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	 Then the sick man shall lie on his back upon his back: and let there be placed under his spine a sphere and wool, which is equal in softness and tightness.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	 Then the physician shall place his heel upon the sphere, and push the head of the arm with force, and draw the hand of the sick person downward.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	 And another servant shall hold the head of the sick man, so that it is not moved downward; for he himself immediately returns.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	 And if you wish, bring him back in this manner: and it is to be such that you make the present man who is taller than the sick person stand at his side, and insert his arm beneath the spine of the sick person: and push the spine upward until the sick person is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	 And another servant shall draw the hand of the sick person downward towards his belly.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	 If the sick man is light: then it is necessary that he be suspended with something else in order to weigh him down; for the dislocation immediately returns.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	 And it is also brought back by another manner: and it is to be such that a long piece of wood is shaped on the ground, whose head is rounded in shape like a mitten, but not too heavy nor too delicate.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	 Then let there be placed beneath the sick man, after they have been put on top of his head, soft pieces of cloth; and the sick man shall stand along the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then extend his hand to its lower part and extend the body from another side with strength; for the joint returns to its place quickly.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	 If it is difficult to reduce it by all that has been said, then use this care: and there is the method of using a stick whose length is twice the size of an arm, and its width four digits, and its thickness two digits; having a round head to relieve the entrance into deep places, according to this shape.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	 Then tie soft cloth around the round head to avoid damaging the weak stick.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	 Then place it under the weak point, so that the hand or arm can be extended over the stick down to the lower part; and tie the stick to the helper and arm and end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	 Then place the arm on the step of the ladder according to its width, and extend the hand downwards, and let the rest of the body hang suspended from another side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	 For the joint enters quickly.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	 When its entrance is completed in any way possible; then it is necessary to place a sphere of equal size under the weak point from wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	 Then place a prepared plaster made from milled powder with balm and egg white over the entire shoulder, as it is turned above.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	 Then tie a suture below the weak point and roll the thread over the plaster above; and connect his hand to the neck of the same person and let it not be moved for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	 And it is necessary to place a light food until the limb recovers; because it is quicker in healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	 Then let him lie on a larger surface after seven or five days and rub gently with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	 If it becomes firm and does not become soft again, then he is now cured.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	 If the joint dislocates frequently due to moisture that occurs or because of another cause, then it is necessary to administer a cautery with three holes, as previously stated in the chapter on cautery.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	 If this is done completely and the ligament is dissolved after seven days and the joint does not heal, and the plaster and binding are applied but they do not hold and fall off and it cannot be lifted up to a higher place: then you know that the nerves which are at the head of the humerus have already been cut or stretched or softened. And you know that the joint will never heal in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	 For a dislocation that occurs towards the chest and breast or is reduced to the back, this is done with pushing and stretching with hands until it returns, and then the rest of the binding and care are administered until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	 If pain and slowness of movement occur after healing in the limb, then the sick person should use baths repeatedly until that pain is relieved, and it returns to its original state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	 Chapter on the treatment of shoulder dislocation.
Caput XXVIII.	 Chapter 28.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	 You should know that the shoulder joint dislocates with difficulty and also returns with difficulty; it can dislocate to all parts, but particularly in front or behind.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	 And this dislocation will not be hidden from you since it falls with sight and touch according to whatever form it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	 And when you join the dislocated shoulder with a healthy one, its abnormality becomes clear to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	 The joint will be hollowed out and the arm cannot be doubled nor can it touch its own humerus.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	 It is necessary to hurry and return the dislocation immediately before a hot abscess occurs.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	 If a boil occurs that is hot, its reduction becomes difficult; and perhaps it will not heal at all, especially when it is in the rear region.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	 For every kind of dislocation, it becomes worse in every aspect, and a more violent pain often accompanies it; and many times death comes with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	 And the restoration of it, when it can be reduced, is to extend the hand with both hands; and the arm should be stretched out, and the hands of the physician should be above the elbow and below it, and he pushes the dislocation together with the fingertips of his own hands or with the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	 Or if the dislocation is towards the front, then it returns in this way: by placing one hand on another until it strikes with the root of the palm the elbow that is dislocated.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	 If the dislocation does not obey in the reduction, then administer a powerful and strong extension; and it is to be extended by two assistants: and they should hold him also so that he is not moved during the extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	 Then the arm is turned to every side after it has been placed over the hand; a piece of cloth doubled and long or a broad bandage is wrapped around it.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	 And when the physician touches the dislocation with his hand, he binds it with oil; so that it will be among those things which assist in lubricity of the dislocation with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	 Then push the dislocation with a strong force until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	 After the reduction of it, it should be placed on a plaster containing styptic and drying with ox gall; and a decent ligature is tied around it.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	 The arm is suspended from the neck of the sick person; and let it be for several days.
Deinde soluatur.	 Then it is unbound.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	 If therefore the union is solidified in its place, then loosen the ligament from it, and let it be.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 And if you see the union not tight enough, then apply plaster and ligate it for some days, until it becomes firm.
Deinde solue ipsam.	 Then loosen it.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	 If however pain occurs to him after the reduction of the union, and the position is in motion: then administer humectation in bathing, and fine friction, and compression, until it heals, or place over the union ilium, that is, the fat of a ram's wool.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	 Then tie it up, and let it be on it day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	 Then remove it, and introduce him into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	 When he sweats, then rub the union with moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	 Then apply oil three times, before each bathing, until it becomes soft.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	 And if you wish, place over it cow dung, moistened, heated with butter, and tighten it over it.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	 Make that several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	 It becomes soft, and returns to its former position.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	 Chapter on the treatment of dislocations by Albucasis.
Caput XXIX.	 Chapter 29.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	 The hand of Mahassem is often dislocated, that is, the union that is between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	 The reduction of its dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	 On the contrary, other unions.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	 However, it is necessary that quickness be in the reduction of its dislocation at the hour when it is dislocated, before the place is removed; or a hot abscess occurs in it.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	 The reduction of its dislocation is that you place the weak hand of Mahassem on a table and stretch out the attendant's hand; and the physician places his palm over the protrusion of the union and pushes it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	 It is necessary to consider if the palm has already receded towards the hand's belly: then the weak one should place the back of his hand on the table for extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is proceeding towards the back of the hand, then let his hand be placed intrinsically on the table, that is, the inner part of his hand should be placed on the table, so that the physician's hand may fall upon the same projection of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	 If it immediately returns, that is good; but if not, then bind it with a plaster sitting upon the abscess; and leave it alone, do not touch it again.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	 For if it does not bear [the pressure], nor can you perform its reduction after the days have passed, yet the joint remains twisted according to its own crookedness; and nothing harms the weak one except what softens his hand, and he cannot bind anything: then know that the nerves have been severed or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	 Therefore, there is no skill in it except to bind with a cautery near to the dislocation.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	 And perhaps it brings nothing about [the healing].
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	 Since Almahassem does not return, then place a plaster upon him as I have said.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	 Then bind it and let it be for five days; afterwards it is to be loosened and let go, and the hand is to be exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	 If it is deprived of motion and something heavy happens to it: then soothe it with warm water, and occasionally rub it until it is softened.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	 Chapter on the Treatment of Finger Dislocations.
Caput XXX.	 Chapter XXX.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	 When a finger is dislocated from any of the parts or from the back of the palm or the belly of it: then stretch out the finger, and push the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	 Then sustain the head of the digit, and suspend it towards the side where it is dislocated, and release it for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	 Then extend it (the dislocated part), and hold it until it aligns with its normal position on that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	 When it becomes night, bind it according to the narrative; do not cease to loosen it during the day; exercise it with motion; and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	 Do this for some days until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	 And do likewise with the one in the hand if it is dislocated towards the abdomen; bind it to that part, and perform your first operation on it until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	 And do likewise with the one when it is dislocated in other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	 Section on treating a spondylolisthesis of the spine.
Caput XXXI.	 Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	 When a man has a dislocation of the backbone or neck, complete dislocation, or many vertebrae are removed from their places: then there is no cure in it, for death approaches the weak one.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	 And the sign of this is that the disease of the weak one departs without will, nor can he hold it; and softening occurs in some of his limbs, or two legs, or two arms, or one of them, or a vertebra is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	 For it is often removed, for it often happens that they are removed to the four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	 Therefore, what is removed towards the backside, is named 'Gibbosity'.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	 But the cure of it is that you consider whether 'Gibbosity' occurs from childhood; then there is no cure in it, nor is any healing from it at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	 But in that which occurs from an accident, or blow, or similar things, the ancients have said the methods of healing in a long discourse.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	 For which very few return with a favorable outcome.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	 I myself have already abbreviated from that one, for which he makes little exception due to my proximity; and in my explanation, I presented it differently than how they showed it, and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	 Therefore, I say that there is no skill nor healing from 'Gibbosity' which occurs from the front part.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	 And similarly with one which occurs on both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	 And it is not cured from those except the one which occurs in the back truly, as I say; and it is to be extended on his face over a platform almost equal to the wall; and to spread beneath him moist straw so that his chest may not be hurt.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	 Then place a straight stick fixed in the ground at the foot-end, around its head; and another stick around its other foot-end; and let a servant hold the stick, and it should not be fastened in the ground.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	 And let another servant hold the other (one).
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	 Then cover the head of the sick (man), and beneath his chin tie a tight bandage; extend the end of the bandage to the stick that is at his head, and bind it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	 Then tie another bandage above his ankles, and above his knees, and at the joints (of his legs).
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then gather all the bandages together, and bind them to the other stick that is at his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	 Then all the servants should extend the bandage to any part of the stick, and neither of the sticks should be moved from their positions where they are fixed; but they should not be fastened, as we said before.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	 And the doctor shall place his hands on the pelvis firmly until he returns; or he may place a board over it.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	 Then tie his feet together on the board until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	 If he does not return after this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	 And carve a hole in the wall which we mentioned near the sick (man), into which the end of the board enters.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	 Then place the middle of the board on the pelvis.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	 And let the doctor place his feet on the other end (of the board).
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	 And tie it firmly until the pelvis is dislocated and he returns to his place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	 Then, if you wish, work with the drill that moves by hand; and it is for you to carve two sticks into the ground at the head of the sick (man) on the last foot, whose length is an arm; and at his head on the last foot, two sticks.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	 And let the length be that which is between every stick and a palm's breadth; and now, a hole has been made everywhere where a tourniquet runs; and let all the sticks be firmly fixed to the ground very much, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	 A round stick is to be inserted; and there is a tourniquet in which a ligament is rolled in the holes of two sticks.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	 And at its end there is a hole, where the stick is fixed, whose length is a palm with that which is rolled; and likewise in two other sticks.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	 Then tie the ligaments which you tied on the chest of the sick person to the tourniquet that is at his head; and tie the ligaments which you tied on his legs to the tourniquet that is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	 Then let the attendant stand by each tourniquet who will turn his hand with a cloth, with which the tourniquet is turned; and the surgeon ties the ligaments (Spondile) as we said before.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	 This is the form of the tourniquet that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	 Then after Spondiles returns and the place is tied, then it is necessary that you put on an asafoetida plaster with egg white.
Deinde stuppam.	 Then starch (stuppa).
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	 Then place a star-shaped piece of wood on top of the plaster, whose width is three fingers or about that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	 And its length is the amount that will contain the hump (Gibbositas), and above the healthy part of Spondiles.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	 Then it is tied with the ligament we said before.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	 The sick person should be nourished with delicate food until he is healed.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	 If something remains as a protuberance in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary to administer medicines that soften and soothe, with the use of the tablets (tablet) that we said before for a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	 And now, it is administered on that sheet of lead.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	 When it happens protrusion at the last vertebra of the back: and it is thought to be dislocation, and that bone is what now projects out.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	 Therefore, it is not fitting for this medicine to be assumed without caution, perhaps it will cause death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	 Chapter on the treatment of a dislocated ankle.
Caput XXXII.	 Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	 Know that the joints of the ankle and shoulder do not occur unless it is a dislocation; nor does what happens to other joints by slight removal and concavity occur in them.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	 Indeed, the ankle joint is dislocated in four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 This is because it is dislocated forward and backward.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	 Most certainly, it is dislocated more towards the inside; and less towards the front and back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	 And the treatment of its dislocation towards the inside is that when you join the weak leg to a healthy one, it is longer; and the knee of the weak one projects more than the healthy one, and the weak one cannot double his foot at the knee; and there is a place following the knee which is pressed by a warm compress, because the head of the hip has already reached that place.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	 And the sign of its dislocation towards the outside is that there are symptoms opposite to these symptoms.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	 And the sign of its dislocation towards the front is that it extends the healthy leg abnormally; however, it does not double it without pain in the knee; and if it tries to walk on it, it cannot do so at the front; and urine retention occurs in it, and its knee is swollen, and during walking it is struck at the heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	 And the sign of its dislocation towards the back is that it does not extend the knee, nor can it double it before the thigh is doubled; and the leg is even shorter than the other; and the knee is softened, and the head of the hip is at that place.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	 Reduction of this dislocation is to consider then, if the dislocation is old, which has already become ancient with it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	 If you administer the reduction and it remains according to its position, then there is no cure at all in it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	 Therefore, it should not be presumed upon her completely.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	 In him whose dislocation is recent, and it belongs to one of the four kinds of dislocations: then proceed to this, that you desire a joint, and extend it to the interior and exterior, and move it right and left: forcibly, it may return, and it does not require other care.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	 If this does not return in this manner, then it is necessary to prepare a strong assistant and extend his leg from the lower part; either with his hands, or with a bandage that ties above his knee; and another assistant extends his hand upwards, so that he introduces his hands into the joints.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	 Then tie a soft bandage above the root of the hip, and hold the end of another bandage.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	 And the extension is either from the front part of the groin to the part of the neck, or from the back to the backbone.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	 And let the extension be one for all, until the weak one is lifted with his body from the ground and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	 And this is indeed the common type of extension among the four kinds.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	 If the dislocation returns with what I said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to do all that I will say about its own treatment.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 In the reduction of his [the dislocation], when it is to the insides, it is necessary for the weak one to lie on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	 Then put a bandage above the root of the hip, in that which is between the head of the hip and the place under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	 Then extend the ligament upward from the groin area to the higher part of the body, to the neck region.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	 Then let another strong servant take hold of his arm, and he shall reduce the large opening of the weak hip, and stretch it out by vigorous extension to the outside.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	 Now indeed it returns to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	 And this form of treatment is easier than the other forms, by which this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	 If however it is excused over you, and does not obey you for the entrance with this form of treatment at all: then it is necessary that two weak feet are tied together with the strong ligament, loosely, on top of both heels, and on top of both knees: and let the length of each be four times the size of a finger: and let the weak leg be stretched out more than twice the size of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	 Then the weak one is suspended above the head post (which should be in the house): and let its length from the ground be two forearms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	 Then command a strong youth to brace the head of the hip: and suspend another youth with the weak one: and another youth shall push, bracing the hip with strength, for the joining (of the bones) returns to its place quickly.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	 In the reduction of its own (the hip), when there is a dislocation towards the outside, it is necessary that the weak one lies on a flat surface, as we have said in the case with a hump.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	 And the ligament shall be tied above the leg of the weak one, and above its chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	 Then place two poles, one at his feet, and another at his head.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then place a third pole in the middle of the bed, firmly fixed: upon which wet cloths shall be rolled, so as not to hurt the weak one: and let the pole be between his hips, so as not to be pulled towards the lower parts during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	 Then let every servant go to his part, and the doctor adjusts the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	 If he submits to the reduction, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	 And if not, place it on the table and press it evenly, as we said in swellings, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	 However, it is necessary that the sick one lies on his healthy side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	 And when the dislocation is towards the front, then it is necessary to quickly extend the sick person's leg: and this is according to the same story on the table: and let the doctor place the palm of his right hand on the groin of the sick one.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	 Then bend him with your other hand, and with this bending place him extended to the lower parts towards the knee.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	 And if the dislocation is towards the back: then it is not necessary to extend the sick one towards the lower parts and be raised from the ground: rather it is necessary for him to be placed on a hard surface, as it should also be done if his ankle is dislocated towards the outside, according to what we said about his position on two ankles: and it is on his face and extended ligaments: according to what we said recently.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	 And it is necessary that pressure is applied with a table also to the place where the connection departs, when completion of reduction is done according to what is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 And the sign of his reduction is not hidden from you: and it is to extend two legs of the sick one: and when you see them even, and the sick one pulls his leg, and extends himself without resistance: then you will know that the limb has returned, according to what is necessary: then join the two pelvises, and apply a plaster, and tie it with bandages, that is, a wheel: so that the ankle does not move in any direction: and let the sick one rest for three or four days.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	 Then loosen the ligament, and apply the plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in condition, then you know that the dislocation is already fixed: therefore leave the patient to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	 If you see something softening: then return, and apply the plaster, and bind it according to your initial binding: and let it remain for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	 Then loosen it and make him walk slowly on both for some days until he recovers well.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	 Part of a Treatise on Knee Dislocations.
Caput XXXIII.	 Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	 The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	 It is dislocated towards the outer side, towards the inner side, and towards the lower side, that is, towards the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	 And it is not dislocated towards the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	 The sign of this dislocation is that you instruct the patient to apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	 If however it does not adhere to the hip: then you know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	 And the restoration of all modes of this dislocation is that you make the patient sit straight, so that he can now extend his leg if possible over it, and let his back rest against his face, and place his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	 Then make the knee adhere with your palms, and straighten them between your fingers over the knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	 Then apply both sides of the knee with your palm with force.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	 And another servant extends his foot until the knee returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	 The sign of its return is that the leg adheres with the hip gently, not laboriously.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	 Then apply it (the plaster), and make the leg adhere with the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	 Then bind them together with lint for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	 Then loosen it (the suture or bandage).
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	 And let not the sick person walk for some days until he is healed.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	 If he refuses to be reduced (reduced swelling), then administer a strong extension with ligatures as described in the treatment of hernia, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	 § On the Treatment of Dislocated Heel Bone (Calcaneus).
Caput XXXIIII.	 Chapter XXXIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	 The heel bone is sometimes displaced slightly and at other times it is completely dislocated.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	 Its dislocation may occur towards the inside or towards the outside (inward or outward).
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	 The sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel bone swollen, protruding towards the side to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	 Its treatment (for reduction) is easy; the procedure is to extend it with ease using hands and align it until it returns to its place.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	 When the heel bone is completely dislocated, it is necessary to make the sick person sit upright; and let a strong assistant hold him firmly from behind, in the middle of his back.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	 Then hold the foot with your right hand from above and the foot with your left hand below, at the level of the ankle (talus).
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	 Then draw the foot to you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	 Then with your left hand take hold of it by two joints.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	 Then stretch it out with your left hand and push the shinbone of the foot towards you with your right hand without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	 Do this twice as we have said.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	 Then push the shinbone of the foot against the leg joint for the third time and you pull on the ankle.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	 If therefore it returns to its former position either once or twice according to this method, and you see that the foot is equalized, then it is good. And if not, then repeat the procedure on him, because he will return (to normal).
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	 If the reduction is prevented by him while we are doing it as we have said, then make the weak person lie on his back on the ground and fix a peg firmly in the ground, so that he falls between his hips. And now you have wound a cloth around him to prevent him from being hurt (by the fall).
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	 Then let the attendant take hold of his hip. Afterwards, let another attendant stretch out the leg, either with his hands or with a strap that ties around the ankle.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	 Then all the attendants should stretch out towards the extension (of the leg). And let the peg be standing between the hips of the weak person, holding him so that his body is not drawn downward toward the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	 Then the doctor equalizes the dislocation with his hands, and another attendant holds the healthy leg towards the lower part.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	 For the dislocation returns quickly.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	 Whenever the dislocation returns and you are told of the health of its reduction, then apply an ointment and a poultice, tie them firmly with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with a strap.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	 And you must be careful and take care not to bind too tightly the nerves that are above the heel at the back, so as not to injure them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	 Then let him be released for two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	 If the ligament becomes soft, tighten it; then loosen it on the third or fourth day; and forbid the weak from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	 However, if he tries to walk before that time, there is no safety unless it is loosened over him again due to dislocation, and it will be ruined, and it will not receive healing afterwards.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	 If a hot boil occurs to him: then it is necessary that you administer to him the recipe mentioned earlier in another place for treatment and embrocation until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	 Chapter on dislocation of fingers and cure.
Caput XXXV.	 Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	 It is necessary that what is dislocated be adjusted with little extension without effort; and indeed this is easy, rather it is simple.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	 If dislocation is in some nodules of the foot heel, then it is necessary that the sick person makes his foot sit on a level with the ground or table, and stands as if walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	 Then you stand, and place your foot upon that which projects from those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	 Then press it with your foot with force until it returns and you see it adjusted and no longer projecting from its place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	 Then put a board under the sole of his foot which can hold the whole foot, with two feet on it.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	 Then bind it with a bandage suitable for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	 Then loosen it and let him rest from walking many days until it is bound and secured against dislocation.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	 On the types of dislocation with wound or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	 Chapter XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	 When something happens to it, and you try to cure it and restore it, death often occurs many times; therefore, one should not presume on its cure unless he is experienced in the art, compassionate, devout, patient, cautious, not bold, nor presumptuous: and that he uses only cooling medicines at first: and that he leaves the sick to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	 Unless you see or hope for healing from destruction with gentleness of illness, and where there is something that suggests hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	 Therefore, try the reduction immediately at the beginning, before a hot abscess occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	 If the limb returns as we desire, then administer a regime that checks an abscess: and care for the wound with what is suitable for it from dry ointments.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	 If dislocation occurs along with a fracture, and separated fragments of the socket occur, then try to remove them, and do as we said in simple diseases in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	 And be careful according to your ability, and guard yourself from entering on the road of fear: according to what I have previously said to you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	 For it is better for you before your Creator, and more enduring for your glory, and more beneficial to your body among them in your time.
