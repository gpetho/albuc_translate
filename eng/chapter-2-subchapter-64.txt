 CHAPTER SIXTY-FOUR.
On the treatment of hernia with varix.
 A varix is a twisted tumour resembling a cluster of grapes, with relaxation of the testicles, which makes movement and exercise and walking difficult for the patient.
The treatment of this condition is of uncertain outcome, akin to those conditions just spoken of.
Nevertheless we must describe the operation for this condition as it was performed by the Ancients.
So I begin by saying that you must have the patient sitting upon a high seat; then push down the suspensor of the testicles and take hold of the skin of the testicles with your fingers together with the blood-vessels near the penis; then let your assistant take hold instead of you and draw out strongly.
Then with a broad sharp scalpel make an oblique incision in the direction of the vessels so that the vessels are laid bare.
Then dissect on all sides in the same way as I told you for extracting the temporal vessels.
Then run through them a needle doubly threaded and tie at the spot where the varix begins and tie it again where the varix ends, then cut through the varix in the middle with an incision at right angles to the length of the body and draw out the turbid corrupt humidity that has gathered in it.
Then dress the wound with the wound dressings usual where you wish to encourage suppuration, so that the vessels nourishing the one testicle may perish; there is no harm in that.
But if all the vessels are varicose then you will have to remove one testicle with its vessels lest the testicle be deprived of nourishment through cutting into the vessels; for it will wither and be of no use.
