Chapter twenty-one on cauterizing toothache.
If the toothache is caused by cold or there are worms in it, and treatment with medicines is not effective, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with ghee or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with ghee is done by taking cow ghee and boiling it in an iron spoon or in a shell, then taking cotton and wrapping it around the tip of a probe, then dipping it in the boiling ghee and placing it quickly on the aching tooth, holding it until it cools, and repeating this several times until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
If you wish, you can dip wool or cotton in cold ghee and place it on the aching tooth and place the heated iron on top of it until the heat reaches the bottom of the tooth.
Cauterization with fire is done by using a copper or iron tube that is somewhat thick so that the heat of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then, heat the cauterizing iron, the image of which is shown, and place it on the tooth itself, holding your hand steady until the iron cools. Repeat this several times and the pain will go away, either that same day or the next.
After the cauterization, the patient should fill his mouth with good ghee, hold it for an hour, and then spit it out.
And this is the image of the cauterizing iron:
Cauterize with whichever end you wish and according to what is possible.
And this is a picture of the tube:
