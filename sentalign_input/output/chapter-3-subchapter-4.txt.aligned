On the Restoration of the Jaw when it is Broken.	On the repair of a broken lower jaw.	0.65690047
When the lower jaw is broken without a wound, if the fracture is only external and not split into two, and is bent inward, it is easily recognized.	When the lower jaw is broken and it is a fracture without an open wound, examine it.	0.65083826
If the fracture is on the right side, insert your left index finger into the patient’s mouth; similarly, if the fracture is on the left side, insert your right index finger; push the bulge of the fracture inward easily to the outside with your other hand on the outside of the bone; gently align it.	If it is merely an external fracture, not broken in two but sunken inwards, which is easily recognized, you should introduce the index of your left hand into the patient's mouth if it be a right-hand fracture; but your right index if it be a left-sided fracture; and with this, from within, push the concavity of the fracture gently outwards, with the other hand outside, regulating the correction.	0.8386652
If the jaw fracture is already split into two, administer extension of both parts in a straight line until it is possible to align them.	If the break in the jaw be total, into two, traction must be employed, in a straight line on both sides, until it can be set.	0.7865168
If the teeth are dislocated or disrupted, tighten those you hope will stay in place with a thread of gold, silver, or silk; then place cerate over the broken jaw, then place a folded cloth, and over the cloth a large, properly made splint, or a piece of sole the length of the jaw; bind it appropriately so it stays secure.	If any of the teeth be loosened or broken away, bind those that you hope may be preserved with a gold or silver or silken ligature; then put wax upon the fractured mandible, and upon that a doubled dressing, and upon the dressing a large and strong splint or a piece of shoe-sole leather, the length of the jaw; then over that bandage in such wise as you conveniently can and as will conduce to drawing it together so as not to loosen.	0.90482825
Instruct the patient to rest and keep calm, and provide them with liquid food.	Bid the patient hold himself quiet and still, and let his food be soft broths.	0.82561225
If you think the shape has altered in any way, untie it on the third day; then correct the alteration and apply plaster with flour, egg white, or sesame flour, after removing the cerate, and place cotton over the plaster.	If you think there is any change of form at all, hasten to loosen it on the third day; then correct the change and apply a plaster of mill-dust and egg-white, or of white flour, after you have removed the wax from it, applying soft tow over the plaster.	0.89729315
Once the plaster is set and the bone’s position is not altered, leave it in place until it is healed and the fracture is secured, which often happens within three weeks.	So long as the plaster sticks on it and the bone undergoes no change of state, let it be and do not loosen until it heals and the fracture mends, for often a fracture of this kind mends in three weeks.	0.86443114
If another abscess forms, apply the same treatments we mentioned for healing until it is completely healed.	If during that time an effusion occurs, employ those means of allaying this that we have often mentioned, until the swelling subsides.	0.5730047
If the fracture involves a wound, check if a piece of bone is separated or splintered, then delicately remove the splinters with appropriate instruments.	If the fracture be with an open wound, examine it, and if one or more splinters have been detached from the bone, gently remove the pieces of splinter with any suitable instrument.	0.82795036
If the wound opening is narrow, enlarge it with a phlebotomy instrument as needed.	If the opening of the wound be narrow, open it up with a scalpel as much as you need.	0.69767916
After removing the splinters, if nothing remains, suture the wound if it is wide; if not, apply a suitable plaster to heal it until it is fully healed.	When you have removed these pieces, letting no trace of them remain, suture the opening of the wound if it is wide; otherwise apply one of the ointments that are suitable for that purpose and will encourage the growth of flesh over the wound, until it heals.	0.7619076
