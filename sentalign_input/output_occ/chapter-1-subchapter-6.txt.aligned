On the Cauterization of Torticollis	Cauterization of the twisted mouth.	0.4260872
Torticollis which is cured with cauterization is only of the types caused by phlegm, as we have said in the sections on diseases.	The twisting of the mouth which is curable with the cautery is of that nature which arises from phlegm, as we have already noticed in the sections on sicknesses.	0.70100975
Avoid cauterization of the type that arises from dryness or from nerve spasm.	But cauterization is to be carefully avoided in that type which is due to dryness or spasm of the tendon.	0.71292174
When you treat that type of torticollis with cups, head purges, and other treatments, and it does not improve, then you must cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one near the root of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third near the junction of the two lips.	When this kind of deformity has been treated with electuaries, errhines, and gargles, and your treatment is ineffective, you should use three cauterizations: one at the root of the ear; the second a little below the temple; and the third at the junction of the lips.	0.7572373
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected part, because softening only occurs in the part that appears healthy.	Let your cauterization be on the opposite side to the affected side, for the relaxation will arise in the side which seems normal.	0.7587314
The method of cauterization is to cauterize with the cautery iron at the right of the uppermost part of the ear, a little above the horn of the head, and at the temple on the other side, the length of which is about the length of a thumb, and apply your hand with the cautery iron until it burns about half the thickness of the skin.	The form taken by the cauterization is that you burn him a little below the frontal prominence, on a level with the upper tip of the ear, and also on the temple the length of the thumb; carry the burning to a depth of about half the thickness of the skin.	0.7991519
This is the form of the cautery iron, and it is a type of surgical knife, the form of which is set out beforehand. However, it is more subtle when it is slightly like this; and the knife should be slightly thicker than usual.	The shape of the cautery. It is a variety of the bladed cautery such as has already been described, but is rather more slender as you see. Its blade should have a certain thickness.	0.7181638
Then treat the spot with the remedy mentioned earlier until it is healed.	Then dress the place with what we have mentioned till healed.	0.75861144
