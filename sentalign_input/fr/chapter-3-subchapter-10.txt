Of the fracture of the hip bone
It rarely happens that the hip bone is fractured, and if it happens, it is only a slight thinning at the head; and it fractures lengthwise, and bends inward, and the patient feels pain at the spot, and sharpness, and the fractured part swells.
And the restoration is that you place your hand on it, until you are on the fracture; and know what the fracture is and its shape; and if the fracture is at the head only, then set that fracture evenly, so that it is in its natural shape.
And if the fracture is lengthwise, or it bends inward, then have the patient lie on their stomach, until the restoration of that fracture is prepared.
And when you have set it evenly, then apply the poultice, then place a splint of wood or leather on it, and bind the fracture, so that it does not move; and fill the spot under the ribs, so that the bandage is even.
And instruct the patient to sleep on their healthy side, or on their back.
And if a hot abscess occurs there, do not touch it, until the hot abscess is soothed, and apply what we have mentioned before; and then return to the restoration, and bind it as necessary, if there are no bad accidents; and this is the method.
