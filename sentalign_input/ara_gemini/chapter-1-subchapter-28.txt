Chapter twenty-eight on treating liver swelling with cauterization.
If an abscess appears in the liver and you want to know whether that swelling is in the liver's parenchyma or in its membrane, then if it is in the parenchyma, the patient will feel heaviness and pain without sharpness.
And if it is in the liver's membrane, there will be intense sharpness with the pain.
And I have seen that its treatment has baffled physicians, so the patient should lie on his back.
Then mark the swollen area with ink.
Then heat the cautery iron in the fire, and it is the cautery iron that resembles the probe, and this is its image:
And cauterize it with a single cauterization until you burn all the skin.
And continue with the cauterization to the peritoneum until all the pus comes out.
Then treat it with the treatment of abscesses until it heals.
And this type of cauterization should not be used except by someone who has long training in the art of medicine and has treated these diseases with experience repeatedly.
Only then should he undertake such a procedure.
And leaving it (untreated) in my opinion is better.
