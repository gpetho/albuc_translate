Praefatio.	Preface.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have finished this for you, O Children, a book which is the last knowledge in medicine with its completion, and I have reached the end of it through its explanations and its declarations, it was my wish to complete it for you with this treatise which is a part of the operation, that is, chirugery with my hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Because the operation with the hand is laid low in our region and completely cut off: until perhaps science of it perishes, and its track is abolished: and they do not remain except brief descriptions in ancient books, which have changed their hands: and an error and hesitation happen to them until their intentions are closed, and the length of its will is elongated: It seemed good to me to enliven it with the life of this treatise in it according to the way of position and declaration and abbreviation: and to make it like the forms of the Cauteries and other instruments of work: when an addition is made to the declaration, and the operation of its being necessary is performed.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	However, the cause why this good craftsman did not find it with his hand in our time is: because medicine is long, and it is necessary for the author to exercise before that in the knowledge of anatomy which Galen narrated, until he knows the humors of the members, and their forms, and their connection, and their separation, and has knowledge of bones, and nerves, and tendons, and the number of them, and their exit, and the pulsatility and quietness, and the exits of their places:
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And therefore Hippocrates said that the name with the name is much, and with the work is little, and especially in the art of the hand:
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	But we have already spoken of that at the beginning of this book:
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Because he who is not knowledgeable of what I say about anatomy does not understand, but already falls into error, wherein men are slain: as I have seen many of them, who are formed from this science, and cast it aside without knowledge, and without experiment.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	That which is, because I have seen a stupid physician cut the abscess of a woman's neck, and some arteries were cut in her neck: therefore blood flowed from the woman until she died at his hands.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	And I have seen another physician, who presumed to extract a stone from a boy who had grown up, and the stone was large.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	Therefore he went to him, and extracted it with a small instrument.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	And the boy died on the third day.
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	Indeed I had called to extract it myself: and I saw from the greatness of the stone, and the weakness of the position, that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	And I have seen another physician, who received a stipe from a certain Duke of our land for medicine: and it happened to an eunuch black man, who was near the heel of his wrist, and he broke: and the physician, not knowing his own ignorance, struck the fracture with his thumb over the ulna with pulsars, and strong bows, and did not release the wound's expiration.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he released him according to his desire.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Later he released him for days, and warned him not to loosen the bandage: and he stood thus until the abscess of his foot was out, and his own leg, and he called for death.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	I am called to him: and I came to loosen the bandage: and peace followed, and he was freed from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	Indeed, corruption had already been confirmed in the member and I could not halt it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	When corruption ceased to walk in the member, it has now perished.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	And I saw another physician who had pierced an epidermoid cancer: the ulcer has worsened over days until his malice was fully revealed to the lord of it.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	What this means is that when the cancer is pure from the melancholic fluid, it does not need to be treated with iron at all, unless it is in a member that can tolerate it, so that the entirety of it can be amputated.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	And therefore, O Son, it is necessary for you to know that the operation is divided into two divisions: namely, the operation associated with safety, and the operation with which there is danger in many arrangements.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already stirred up the entirety of this book, in which the operation comes where there is terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Therefore, it is necessary for you to guard against this, and let it go: so that foolish people may not find it to speak, and to dishonor.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore, take the measure with anxiety and protection, and your weakness with ease and firmness, and use it as a better means of salvation and praiseworthy succession by the grace of God: and let go of difficult-to-heal terrifying afflictions, and remove your spirits from that which makes you fear, so that it may come upon you a doubt in your faith and comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For it is more remaining for your glory, and sublime in this world, and finally for your quantities.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	Galen has already said in some of his admonitions.
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat illness with evil: do not call physicians bad.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	However, this treatise is divided into three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter first.
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Chapter on cauterization with fire and sharp-edged medicine, divided into sections from the head to the feet, and descriptions of the tools and instruments of cauterization, and all that is necessary for the operation.
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter second.
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Chapter on sections and piercings, bloodletting and venting, and wounds: and the removal of arrows and similar, and all the chapter is divided into forms of instruments.
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter third.
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	Chapter on restoration, and dislocation, and curing of twisting, and similar: the chapter is divided from the head to the feet, and descriptions of the tools and instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	Glory to God alone.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Surgical Book of Albucasis.
Pars I.	Part I.
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	On the use of cauterization and its effects, and which complexions are suitable, and at what time, and if with iron or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	However, before that, it is necessary to say about the quality of the wounds and the effects of cauterization of his own: and in which complexion it will be shown.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I say that the speech about the quality of cauterization and its effects is a long and subtle one, knowledge, and a secret and hidden science.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Even many wise men have spoken about it, and they have disputed about it, and for me it is enough a little from their words, fearing the extension.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I say that cauterization is effective against all wounds, whether with matter or without matter, except for two wounds: the hot wound without matter and the dry wound without matter.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	However, in the hot and dry wound with matter, they differ.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some have said that cauterization is in the hot and dry wound with matter.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	However, others have said that cauterization is not suitable for the disease which is from heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat: and it is unsuitable to heal from a hot and dry disease with heat and dryness.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite has said that by cauterization a wound is made in all hot and dry disease that occurs in the bodies of humans: for when you compare the body of a man and its humors to the fire, you will find the body of a man cold.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	I myself say by his words: because I have already experienced this by experiment.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	Nevertheless, it does not belong for him to come upon that, unless he who has already proved it, and has been exercised in the chapter of cauterization, and has known the diversity of human complexions, and the disposition of diseases in themselves, and their causes, and accidents, and the space of time of theirs.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	However, there is no fear from the rest of the complexions: and especially in cold and humid diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For all physicians have come to them, and they have not differed in the wound with cauterization in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And you know, O sons, that by the secret of the curing with Cauterization with fire, and the goodness of it over the medicine burning with Cauterization is: for fire is simple, whose action does not affect anything except to the member which is cauterized, and does not hurt another member connected with it, unless it hurts a little.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	The action of burning surgeons in medicine is directed towards that which is extended from the limbs: and perhaps it causes difficulty in the treatment of difficult disease in a member, and perhaps it kills.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	However, fire, because of its own subtlety and the goodness of its substance, does not do this unless it is superfluous.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Indeed, we have learned this by experiment, because of the length of the servitude and study with the art, and the station above the truth of things: and for that reason I excuse the length of the speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if there were not, because it is not allowed for this book of mine to bring you the secret, hidden in fire, and the quality of its operation in bodies, by which it expels diseases that are demonstrated in the philosophical speech, which is disturbed by your minds.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And do you know, sons, that you yourself dissent in the time when it is fitting to make the cauterization, and you set a better time for the lesson.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	And I say that cauterization is fitting in every time, because the harm done by the time is swallowed up in the wound, which is attracted by the cauterization.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And above all, if the cauterization is made for necessary pains, which are hard, urgent, which do not endure delay: for that reason, because it is feared that a greater evil may happen than the small harm that is done by the time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And it will not fall into your sons' minds that this is not true, unless they are foolish and stupid physicians, namely that the diseases which are cured by cauterization are not always a return: and they set this as a consequence, and the thing is not as they think: for cauterization is not but in the place of medicine, which alters the complexion, and dries up the humors which are causes of the pains, therefore the pains happen.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	Indeed, cauterization benefits the patient's health, its own virtue, and the vigor of his dominion. It is possible that the illness leaves for a certain period of time according to the complexion of the weak, and the location of the patient's illness, and the virtue of his illness. And that it is prepared in the body of him from the aggregation of superfluities in him. And that it is sated with it in its acquisition from foods, and similar ones from like causes, unless an illness occurs, in which the cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A subtle illness in the member of a few superfluities and moistures, like the cauterization of teeth, for pain, and such like, is possible that it does not remain in that pain.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But that happens in few.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But that speech is a true saying: not to what they intend in it: for they believe that there is no cure which confers with the medicine, nor with another after the occasion of the cauterization.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the case is opposite to that, and the intention, that cauterization is the last of the medicines, is not, unless when we administer modes of cure in some illnesses, and they do not conform to the medicine: then we administer the cauterization at the end of the disease, and it conforms: then it falls out that cauterization is the last of the medicines, not according to the intention which wise and experienced physicians understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	But the ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than with iron: and they did not say this except for the equality of gold, and the sublimity of its own substance: and they said that it does not make a pus in the place of the cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	Indeed, that is not entirely true: for I have already proven that, and found that it does not make that in certain bodies without others.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cauterization, when used alone, is good, and better than when iron is used, as they say.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	However, when you use fire for cauterization on gold, it is not declared to you when it is heated according to the amount you wish, because of the redness of the gold: and when it approaches the cold, and if you add more heat to it, it melts in the fire and turns into layers.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Therefore, the artisan falls away from that occupation: and therefore cauterization is made with iron among us, more easily and nearer, due to the straightness to the operation.
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I have indeed ordered this chapter on cauterization, according to the chapter: and I have ordered them from the head down to the feet: so that they may be sought by those who wish to find out what is in it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	¶ About the method of cauterizing the head in a circular cut.
Caput II.	Head 2.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	This cauterization is applied to the mastery of moisture and coldness over the head: which are two causes of salt, and the multitude of fluids from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and the multitude of dreams, and pain of teeth, and pain of the throat: and generally all kinds of disease that happen from coldness, such as paralysis, and salt, epilepsy, and apoplexy, and similar ones from those diseases.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The method of cauterization is to apply it to the weak: so that it may be emptied in the beginning with the dissolved medicine of the head three or four nights, according to the strength of the infirm, and their age, and their habit.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then he commanded him to shave his head with a razor.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then make him sit down between your hands, squarely, so that he has already placed his own hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the palm of your hand over his nose, between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Therefore, if the middle finger of your hand touches it, mark the place with a sharp point.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then heat the olive-oil cauterization: whose form this is.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place it directly on the marked place with a sharp point, gradually drawing your hand together, and you will roll it over.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly pull back your hand, and look at the place.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see already that you can cut off the amount of the skull or the amount of the bone, then pull back your hand.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat your hand with iron itself, or with another that is frozen, until the bones that I told you about are seen.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take something from the salt, dissolve it in water, drink it yourself, and place it on the spot, and leave it there for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place the buttermilk drunk on top of it over the place, and leave it there until the scar burns out with fire.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with Tetrapharmacons ointment, until it is cured.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	Now they have said that as more of the gash remains open, pus is released: therefore it is better and more inflamed.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And some of them said that it should be cauterized to the bone, and hold the cauterization until it becomes thick with some density of bones.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then it is shaved after that which has been made thick from the bone, and then it is cured.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	When others say that it is necessary to cauterize up to the end, so that an impression of the iron is made on the lip, in such a way that the lip falls off, as if it were a bone: or when women use an instrument infused with certain alphabets, they think that vapors arise from this place of the head, and the gum becomes loose for a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then it is treated, until it is solidified.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	I do not recognize these two kinds of cauterization at all, except in some men according to their fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And to let it go, in my opinion, is better with the health of the patient.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	The head weakens from the solution of its own continuous nature, as we have testified in other parts of the body: and especially when the head is feeble and weak in nature: and the first kind of cauterization is indeed safer and better with me, and I use it: therefore, to operate with this in health.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	¶ About the mode of cauterizing the head in the pain of the whole head.
Caput III.	¶ The Head (III).
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When there is a chronic pain throughout the head, and it lasts in the feeble, and uses leeches, and needles, and head pills, and oils, and plasters:
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized with the iron we have mentioned, and nothing benefits it from these: then consider.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head is weak from a strong nature of creation, and it is not feeble, and it finds cold weather: then cauterize with another iron less than that.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize it over the whole of its own head with the iron, and do not pierce the skin, and do not cut through the quantity of bone which we have mentioned.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	He should cauterize himself with a single burn on the back of his head, in the place known as the 'vagina'. This is the place where the wind is produced, and he should cut away the hair of his face, and not neglect the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For he is weak because of this painful grief, and it differs from the pain of other head cauteries.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I say this: and it is necessary that this be the cauterization in its place: and it should be the cauterization whereby the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of his head with a softer cauterization, whereby the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is the form of him.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	¶ About the method of cauterization in migraine, both when the medicine is inflamed and when it is made of iron.
Caput IIII.	Head IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When pain and swelling occur in a part of the head, or it extends to the eye, and the face becomes moist with the application of medicines, and the rest of the treatment is given as I said in the divisions of illness, and it does not fit all of this: then the cauterization in him is of two kinds: either with hot medicine burning: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	But when the cauterization is with hot medicine burning, it is like this: take a tooth from another person, and encircle it, and cut off the ends of its sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then divide the place of pain when the phlebitis is wide, until there is a place under the skin where the tooth can be caught.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then insert it into the same place under the skin until it is hidden: then tie it around with a suitable string, and release it after fifteen hours, then extract the tooth, and remove the almond, and leave it for two or three days, or four: then place a submerged belly over the place, until the place produces pus: then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	If you wish to perform this with certain drugs that I have written about in the twelfth book of the Medicine, which are used for the purpose of causing abortion.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	Cauterization of it with iron is done in this way.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	The cauterization is made by fire, which has this form.
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called the Claudian: for its head-form is like that of a claw, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle there is a small prominence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then place it directly on the spot and hold your hand there: and you will grind the iron with great violence, as much as is necessary from the thickness of the skin, just as the middle part of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And scrape your hand with it, so that the artery below is not burned and the flow of blood is prevented.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then drink the poultice in salt water, and place it on the spot for three days, then place the poultice with honey, and afterwards care for it with ointment until it is cured.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if you wish, you can cauterize this half-head with the second point of the cauterization.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And be careful not to cut the artery in this half-head, properly speaking.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	¶ In the method of cauterizing in an old half-head.
Caput V.	¶ Head 5.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you are treating a half-head, with what I have said in the treatment preceding it, and with what I have said about divisions of diseases, and not with the cure: and you see from the disease that it is not enough for him that I have said with the first cauterization with medicine, or with cauterization with fire, then it is necessary to make the cauterization with the second point of the cauterization, until it becomes white after the signs on the spot of pain with the line, whose length is the middle of the digit, or as if this were: and place your hand on it, one by one, and tie it until you cut the artery, and peruse up to the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	Indeed, it is necessary for you to prevent the continuation of the jaw, which moves during chewing, from becoming inflamed on the side, or the nerve that moves it, from causing a spasm.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And this is for the care of the jaw, and as a precaution against the flow of the arterial blood, which has been severed.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	In the process of removal, there is fear, and especially for those who do not know what is being done, nor are willing, nor experienced: and they let the operation be with him at the beginning.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I remember with the regulation of the flow of blood from the artery according to its own mode, and in the place of this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see from the patient's illness, that the caustic is not sufficient for him, and you see a weak body enduring the caustic in the middle of the head, as we have mentioned, take care of the gum, until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you wish, apply the caustic that we said in the chapter of the removal of the artery with two hammers.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For this cauterization is better and more beneficial.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	§ About the method of cauterizing in pain of the ear.
Caput VI.	Chapter 6.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain in the ear comes from cold, and is cured with the dissolution of the ice, and the rest of the treatment that we have mentioned in the division, and the pain is not removed, then apply fire cauterization: and this is what is called the Punctum, whose form is as follows.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then make the punctures with it after its ignition around the ear, as it rotates: or around the entire circumference if the pain is in both at the same time.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And stretch the ear with the cauterization from the root of the ear almost immediately after you see the places that are on fire with the caustic: and the quantity of the cauterization should be ten punctures in the entire ear, and as it were that.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then take care of the place until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	¶ In method of cauterization in torture.
Caput VII.	Chapter 7.
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	Torture which is performed with cauterization, is none other than those species which happen from phlegm, according to what we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And he divided the species of cauterization which happens from dryness, and spasm of the nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you are treating this species of torture with ointments, and purgatives, and gargles, and your cure does not benefit, then it is necessary to cauterize the weak one with three cauterizations: one at the root of the ear, and another a little lower than at its time, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cauterization from the opposite side of the weak part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For softening does not happen, except in the part which appears to be healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of cauterization is, that it cauterizes itself with Cauterization in direct position at the upper part of the ear, under the horn of the head, a little: and another at its time: whose length is according to the length of the finger.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And put down your hand with the cauterization, until the quantity of the thickness of the skin is burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of cauterization, and it is a species from the penknife, whose form we have mentioned: verily it is not too thin, as you see: and it is necessary that the penknife be in it with too much bulk.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place when that which precedes has been done, until it is healed.

QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When apoplexy becomes old, and when you treat it as we said, and your treatment does not agree with it, and it does not have a fever, then cauterize it with four caustics on all the crown of its head, and a caustic in the middle of its head, as we said, and a caustic in the back of its head, according to what precedes: and the mode of cauterization should be according to what precedes.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	Even it is cauterized with a caustic over the top of the stomach's mouth, and it is the last of all.

Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then shave the weak head entirely, and put on top of its occiput the plaster described in the treatise on plasters: and put it on several times.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	For the plaster itself is the mode of cauterization: and make it according to the same order that we said there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If then it is cured by this, it is good.
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.

Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then rub the weak head: then cauterize it with cauterization in the middle of the head, and with cauterization over all the crown, and with cauterization over the posterior part of it, and three over the spine of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	However, if you need more than one cauterization for the mollification of the body, and the patient tolerates it well, and the disease is strong: then cauterize it with four cauterizations over the spine of the back, and the last one with cauterization until it burns most of its skin, and use your hand to peel it off.

Oportet ergo ut mundifices cerebrum eius in primis cum hyeris, et cum reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione: quando infirmus est magnus, aut est tolerans in accaeptione medicinarum.	Therefore, it is necessary to clean the head of his brain first with hot water and as said before with the rest of the care that I mentioned in division, when he is weak or tolerates in acceptance of the medicine.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	However, if the child is one who does not tolerate medicines, then a gargle and mastications are given to clean the head of his brain before that days with many good foods.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is superfluous humors that turn to melancholy, and the body is a moist one, then give it power to cleanse its brain according to what precedes in division: then shave the head of the infirm one, and afterward make a decent tortellum from linen, as a circle.

When the tears of the eyes are old and frequent: and they are over the veins, and the arteries which are in the manifest skin of the head: it is believed that this is from superfluous cold, and phlegmatic: then cauterize with the same cauterization that I will tell you about the delay of water descending, with cauterization in the middle of the head, and two cauteries over two times, and two cauteries in the hair under two bones.

Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum supra duo supercilia parum duobus cauteriis in omni parte: et elongentur a duobus timporibus: et sit longitudo omnis cauterii, secundum longitudines supercilii: et non ultimes manum tuam cum cauterio, imo secundum quantitatem quod aduritur tertia palpebrae.	And if you wish, cauterize it above the two eyebrows with two cauterizing irons in all parts: and they will elongate in two intervals: and the length of the cauterization should be according to the length of the eyebrows, and not finally your hand with the cauterizing iron, even according to the amount that becomes third eyelid.

Caput XVII.	Head XVII.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cauterizing iron in this is according to two methods: either with fire, or with a burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	In cauterization with fire, you should advise the patient beforehand to let go of his hairs, if he has them shaved, until they grow out and become longer.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	If, however, they prick him at his own point: then bind his eyes with thread, so that they may not move, until they are born.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they are born and turn, then place the weak head in the fold of your garment: then make a sign on the eyelids of his eyes with a candle, a sign that is according to the figure of the myrtle leaf: and let the beginning of the sign be near the hair.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place a drunken mouth on the aliment: or on the eye with a silk mucilage.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then burn the cauterization, whose form is this.
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize over the figure which you have gradually marked on many skin folds, until the surface of the skin is completely burned, which is like the figure of the myrtle leaf, in its entirety.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of your healing work is: if you see the eyelid of the eye already contracting, and the hair being plucked at the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then pluck out your hand: and let it be three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place a drunken mouth on the aliment with honey, until the scar is eradicated.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	If any hair remains after the hour, and the eyelid becomes soft: then repeat the cauterization on that place, as you have done at first.

Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	While he persisted in this which he found to be the sting, then let him release the medicine, and move it with your finger.

When the exit occurs, and you want to know if it is an apostemata in the flesh of the Epbetum, or in its tunic, then if it is in the flesh of the Epbetum, it causes a weak pain and stupor without acuity: and if it is in the tunic of the Epbetum, with pain there is acuity of the wound: and you see now that the fatigue of its cure has exhausted the physicians.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, it must be that the weak one lies down on its own pillow.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then the figure of the place of the apostemata with the cauterization, and then the hot iron that resembles the hand.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And apply the cauterization with that one iron until the whole skin is burned, and it touches the siphac, until all the pus escapes: then care for the cure of the exits until it is healed.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	It is not appropriate to use this cauterization method unless the student's interest in medical arts extends beyond this stage, and if the hands of those who participate in these ailments with experimentation do so repeatedly: for then they will dare to supervise such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	I would rather release it myself, as there is better for you at my place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	In the method of cauterization in pleurisy.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that cauterization with the roots of Aristolochia, applied to the cold pleurisy, according to this method.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is said that you should receive from the dry long roots of Aristolochia, one longer root, which is found in it, and it should be as large as the size of a finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil, and light it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cauterization in the middle of the joint where the neck is, and two cauterizations a little below it, towards the part that is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And by two cauterizations also in the part that is between the fifth and sixth ribs, leaning towards the posterior: and one cauterization in the middle of the chest, and one above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And by three cauterizations from the back: one in the part that is between two spoons: and two cauterizations on the two sides of the chest, with the lower one being between two spoons.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not appropriate to hold your hand with the cauterization, rather it should be in clear skin that smells.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And the ancients have already said that some people use cauterization from metal similar to this: and they light it, and insert it into the part that is between the ribs, until it reaches the apostema with it, and it exudes pus: as we said in the case of Epatis.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	In this perforation with cauterization, there is fear that either the weak one will die immediately, or it happens at the place of the fistula where there is no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	The method of cauterizing the spleat head (spleen) is described in section XXXII.
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you heal the sickness of the spleen, when you have said that from the cure in division of diseases, and not because your treatment is not agreeable to it, then cauterization in it is according to three methods, which are all right.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	One of them is that you make three cauterizations, or four lineations according to the length of the spleen according to the figure of the Ephesian cauteries, whose figure precedes.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let the quantity of every cauterization be equal to the size of the thumb, or more or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the method of cauterization that we have said in the Ephesian cauterization be equal.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not compress your hand with cauterization: and let the weak one be supple on its back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	Another method of cauterization is: that with two fires, which we have said in the chapter of dislocation of the shoulder: and let the eleua cut the skin that is in direct to the spleen, where the weak side of the left thigh becomes wet: and let your eleua be such that the cauterization falls according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then insert two burned sticks gently, until they pass through the skin from the other part: then withdraw the cauterization: and thus four cauterizations are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you wish to cauterize with a cauterization that has three sticks,
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then let you care for the cauterization after you have released it to emit pus for many days: for it is more agreeable than the rest that has preceded from the cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	In the method of cauterization in hydropiths.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The cauterization does not fall into Hydropiths, unless the points are properly punctured.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you are treating Hydropthic wounds according to the methods we have mentioned in division and the cure is not taking, then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauterizations around the umbilicus, and one on the stomach, another on the liver, and a third on the spleen, and two after the back between the spinae, and one in the direct direction of the chest, and another in the direct direction of the stomach: and the depth of the cauterization should be proportional to the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then allow the open cauterization to emit pus for a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not send away the patient too soon after the cauterization, because it is necessary for two intentions to gather around him: and he will hasten towards cure with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The shape of the cauterization when it is made in the belly should be a glove: according to which form precedes its own: and its form when it is made on the back should be an olive according to which form precedes it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	In the method of cauterization of feet and limbs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When the wounds are dressed in Hydropthic and filled with citrine water, it is necessary to cauterize on the back of the foot in the nail, which is between the auricle and the ring: and you should use your hand with the cauterization and do not twist it: then use your hand again: and do not touch it at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the citrine water will remain, and the cauterization should be in this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two burns on both legs all over, and make a cauterization at the end of the sword's handle; and make the cauterization according to the length of the leg, one under the knee, and one below it, about in the middle of the leg: and then make two cauterizations on all the thighs: and let the open cauterization remain without long care: so that some water remains from it: then care for it with the rest as I have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	¶ In the manner of cauterizing in the womb fluid.
Caput XXXV.	Caput XXXV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the womb fluid is melted and moistened, until the firming and digesting virtues in the stomach and intestines are weakened: and it is cared for according to the methods of curing, and is not healed: and you see the firm enduring the excessive virtue of the strong virtues, then cauterize it with a large cauterization over the stomach, according to what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with the circular cauterization, and four small cauterizations around the navel, with a small cauterization subtle: and a cauterization over the alcatin above the alhosos with a large one, or two small ones.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see the excessive moistures and the firm enduring it, then cauterize it with a cauterization over the pectoral muscle, and a cauterization over all of it: and perhaps add two small cauterizations near the large one in the stomach.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For this is a curing that does not err in its ingredient.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	¶ In the manner of cauterizing hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Caput XXXVI.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When in the anus there are old hemorrhoids many, or one, and they are of large humors, cold, or corrupted moistures, and are cured according to what I said in division, and is not a concurring curing: then cauterize it with three cauterizations over the lower spine of the back subtly triangular, and a cauterization under the navel as if two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If you think that the stomach of this animal is frozen, and its food does not digest, and you see its face swelling, then cauterize it over the stomach with a large cauterization iron, according to what precedes: also cauterize over the spleen, and another over the liver of the same animal, with the cauterization iron closed: then release the open cauterization for some time, and afterwards care for it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	¶ The method of cauterizing an abscess after its formation.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37.
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you are about to cut out an abscess, then use a hot cauterizing iron that is similar in size to the radius.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then insert the hot cauterizing iron into the abscess: and use your last hand until the cauterizing iron reaches the opening of the wound, through which the blood flows: do this once or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If the abscesses are many, then cauterize each one according to what we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then care for it, with the ointment that it gives them, until they heal.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize it with a large cauterizing iron over the scarlet fever, it is the most final in the treatment.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	¶ The method of cauterizing an anal fistula.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38.
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the weak patient does not obey the incision and operation that we have described in its place, and is afraid of it, perhaps it will heal with cauterization.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	When a fistula occurs in someone and becomes old, runs pus from it, and the corrupted moistures:
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	Therefore, it is better that you should probe it with a fine probe.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then know the depth of its penetration when you probe it.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then he used a cauterization iron, which is similar to a radish.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then he inserted the burning iron into the fistula and the amount by which it entered the closing.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And he repeated the cauterization over that, until all the corrupted bodies burned, once, or twice, or three times, according to the quantity required by you.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard you from the burning of the nerve, if it is there, or a large wound; or if the fistula approaches to the body of the vesicae, or to the body of the intestine, then guard you from all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place: and think that it is not penetrable.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if a seal is on the place, and the matter is abscised from it for a long time: then you know that it has healed perfectly.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if the matter does not abscise from it: then you know that it is penetrable, or the deep part of it has a corrupted opening, or as if this were one of them: whose remembrance will not remain in its own place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	¶ The method of cauterizing Rene's.
Caput XXXIX.	Head 39.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When a pain from cold or from the great dung occurs in Renus, and it weakens him because of that, then it is necessary to cauterize it over the alimentary canal over the same reins, with the cauterization over all the reins with the clauvise, whose remembrance precedes.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we will cauterize it a second time in the same alimentary canal.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Because three lines may come out.
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	Therefore, they will be more at the end of the operation.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	The method of cauterization for a pimple (or pustule).
Caput XL.	Head XL.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and softening occur in the pimple due to cold and moisture, until it cannot hold the urine, then cauterize it on the lower side of the skin above the pimple, where the hair begins to grow thick and dense, and from both sides of the hand: let the length of the cauterization be according to the size of the pollex node: and cauterize it with the inferior cauterization on the back of the hand, or with two cauterizations if necessary there: and let it be according to what precedes the clapper.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	The method of cauterization for the maturity spot.
Caput XLI.	Head XLI.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moisture occur in the maturity spot, preventing conception, and the menstruations are corrupted, and the provocation of them is delayed, and a pain occurs in it at the time of their approach, then it is necessary for it to be cauterized with three cauterizations around the umbilicus, as I said in the cauterization of the pimple, and with a cauterization above the greater tubercle of the shoulder, or with two cauterizations: and let the clapper be the cauterization.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	The method of cauterization for the anchyloma in dislocation.
Caput XLII.	Head XLII.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When moisture of the mucous membrane reaches the anchyloma, and causes its exit from its place: and the sign of it is that the crus is prolonged above another, when they are compared to each other: and the place of dislocation is found to be watery in it.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore it is necessary to cauterize the weak one with the same cauterization around the anchyloma: after which you see the signs when you encaustro in the circumference of the pus, as it revolves: and let it fall into the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	The cauterizing instrument whose form precedes in the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If this cauterizing instrument is not present for you, then cauterize it with three cauterizations, namely with a large olive oil cauterization: and let the depth of the cauterization be according to the thickness of the whole skin.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	§ Method of Cauterization in Sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter XLIII.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When there is pain in the eye due to cold and moisture, and that is caused by frost: and the weak one is treated with that, as we said in division, and the cure is not given and it becomes antiquated: then it is necessary to dissolve the weak one from the thick humors with pills bitter and stinking, or with artificial pills and such like.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize it.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	The method of cauterization in this case is according to two methods: either with the cauterizing instrument when the drugs are being applied, or with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	The cauterizing instrument with fire has many modes.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	One of which is, to cauterize over the cold eye with three triangular cauterizations, according to this form.
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And let them have a good or bad depth.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And there should be space between the whole cauterizing instrument and the thickness of the finger, and the cauterizing instrument should be olive-oil.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	However, when the cauterizing instrument is made in the middle over the cold eye of the patient.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Why are there four cauterizations?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you want to cauterize with a circle, whose form precedes in the cauterization of the dislocation of the eye, one: so that the circle contains the whole eye.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn the thickness of the entire skin.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cauterization in Sciatica, when the pain is adhering to the anchae on the same side, and does not extend to the thigh and calf.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If it extends to the thigh and calf, then cauterize it with two cauteries on the thigh, at the place where the weak one indicates, in which the pain is, and with your cauterization on the cauillam four fingers wide, on the slyest part perhaps: and let the cauterium be a hammer.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And the depth of the cauterization according to the thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the weak one indicates that the pain extends to near the toes, then cauterize it wherever the weak one indicates with the point of the cauterization, three, or four, or more, if he desires that.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if the weak one indicates that the pain is under the knee and thigh, then cauterize it there with a single hammer-cauterization.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And beware in all your cauterizations that you do not always burn the nerve or the great artery with the cauterization, and do not harm the weak one with it, or cause a contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	Indeed I have seen one and another of those who cauterized above the cauillam, and inflated the thigh, until a tumor followed the foot, and was completely perforated, and completely corrupted, the whole foot: then resolution of the water occurred, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If the pain is in two parts at once, cauterize both according to this method.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And wise men have said in the cauterization of the anchae, whose is this mode of cauterization.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Create a similar one made of silver, whose diameter is the midpoint of the palm: and it should be at the orifice of its own according to the size of the tip of the finger, or slightly less: and within that silver, there should be another silver.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And there should be a space between all the silver according to the quantity of the pollical node: and the silver should be open from two sides: and the height of them should be like a node, or two nodes: and make for them appropriate manubria of silver in the silver.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then let it be heated in the fire until it turns red and emits sparks. Then it should be placed on a fine pitcher, slightly inclined, on the healthy side of the body.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Therefore, let it be cauterized with three round cauteries in water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then release it after three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Afterwards, apply ointment with wax: and release the ulcer widely in many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Albucasis says that in this case of cauterization by fire, we have not used it much due to the fear of its appearance, and therefore, because we have found only a few who expect on top of it.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	Nevertheless, it is from good cauterizations that he who suffers finds a place for it with it.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	However, when the cauterization is with the medicines that are applied, as you will make two silver rings with holes, in which the door of its port comes down from air or iron, and the length of the side is equal to the height of the sides: and there should be two nodes in the height of them, or like themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And there should be a space between the two quantities of the size of the finger, and they should be open below and above: and it should be that they hold together according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then lay her on a sheet of linen, with the sick side down, lying on the sound side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And press your hand tightly over the sheet of linen.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles of warm water, which is heated with fire as much as possible, and hold it for the time of the hour: and the sick one will endure the mordication of it and its own burning, for he found the mordication like fire, until the mordication ceases.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then scrape your hand with the instrument and withdraw hot water from the wide part with sweet water, and then release it for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place on top of that butter, until the blackness of the burning is removed: and release it for some days, and the pus will come out from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For this is the last in the dressing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for that with ointments until it heals.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the house or cruse, make a statue in it that contains water, according to what you made on the wide part equally.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the method of hot water: and I have already written it in the treatise on the correction of physicians.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and unburned lime, and grind both, and put one part of each in a new bowl, whose bottom has a small hole, according to the amount that enters the radius: and put another empty bowl under it: and dip both the alkali and lime in sweet water with your thumb: then close the bowl with your good compression: and release the bowl until sharp water enters the lower part of the empty bowl.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then gather all the water and pour it on the other lime: and hold it until it returns.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	It will be then that the true and strong bandage of acupuncture, which is administered in many medical operations and in the cauterization of other parts of the body.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	For it accomplishes the action of its own fire.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And from the drugs themselves, which are used for cauterization, and as wide as tesis, and melted anacardium wax, and lime with soap, so that both are mixed together. ¶
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen indeed reportedly recounted, of a man from ancient times who was treated for pain in the ankle and sciatic nerve, and he praised the bandage as great. ¶
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said, because it is not needed for another treatment, and because it was cured with gut alone, unless he perhaps entered the bath that was led, and then left it already cured. ¶
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is said that it should be taken from the gut of a young woman: and if it is not found in a young woman, then it is dried, fresh: and it is applied much with some fat, and placed over the ankle, where the pain, or cramp, or in the thigh: and it is wrapped, and removed for three hours, or according to the amount that the weak person feels of the burning heat. ¶
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then insert it into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When the body of him becomes rough, insert it into the seat. ¶
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain recedes, and it is cured. ¶
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And you know that it is not necessary for anyone to use a cauterization with these drugs, unless after the evacuation of the body. ¶
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides who said that the feces of rabbits, when cauterized with it, nourishes the sciatic pain, and it is made as a bandage in this way. ¶
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	The wool is to be measured out, and it is to be soaked in old oil, and it is to be placed over the deep spot which is between the toe and the heel, and it is to be nearer the big toe than the little one.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take the dry dung of a goat, and burn it in the fire until it becomes charcoal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place it over the wool, and let it be, until it is extinguished.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat this.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	You shall not cease doing this, until the sense has passed through the middle of the bone to the hip, and the pain has ceased.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of cauterization is called the Vaccinium cauterization.

Caput XLIIII.	Head XLIII.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	When a pain occurs in the back from various causes, or by chance, or by impact, or excessive evacuation, and such things, from cold and wet infusion: and cauterization indeed does not happen, unless in this very form, which is made from cold and wet infusion.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Therefore, after the evacuation of the weak, with pills that are fetid and such like, it should be made over the back where the pain is, three lines according to the breadth of the treated part, after which signs are made with encaustic in every line five cauteries, or more according to the tolerance of the weak power of this part, and cauterization should be made with cauteriopuncti.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, cauterization should be made with three or four cauteries, or more, with the cauterio closed medially, according to this form.

Caput XLV.	Head XLV.
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	This type of illness often affects infants in childbirth.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of its onset in boys is: that it occurs upon a stricture in the ankle during evacuation, and motion; and I found in the last vertebra of the back and the nodes of his, which has already begun to emerge above the others.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When you see this, and you want to do this, then cauterize it with the cauterization that is a circle according to this form.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And let the cauterization catch all parts of the vertebra equally: and if you want to cauterize in the circumference of the vertebra with the cauterization point two lines, or three: and they should be points close to the emerging one.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of the place until it heals with that which I said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And be careful not to give the cauterization in spasm of the muscle that is made in the gangrene.

Caput XLVI.	Head 46.
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pain of the joints is caused by cold humors that are poured on any part of the body, then when the pain occurs in the feet, it is the custom of physicians to call this Podagra properly.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When Podagra is treated with cold causes of pain and the pains do not remain, then the cauterization removes them.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is that the cauterization is done on him after evacuation in the circumference of the joints of the feet, with many cauterizations: and the cauterization should be olive oil.

When painful sensations rise up to the knees or other wounds, and this happens frequently, then cauterize the whole knee with three or four cauteries, or from all sides, with the same cauterization as Claudius.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If more is needed of this cauterization, then cauterize it again.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not dip your hand in the cauterization, rather it is about the thickness of the skin alone.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If painful sensations rise up to the knees and back, then administer what I have said from the cauterization chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	If painful sensations are only in the hands, then make punctures around the focus, like the two lines that revolve.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If painful sensations remain in the fingers, then make punctures on all nodes with a single puncture, and on the thumb of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If painful sensations rise up to the elbows or hips after a day, then cauterize both from all sides.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not discard the weak one from good management, from the reception of the physician.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good regimen is made, and the phlegm is discarded, it will be healed with the help of God by this cauterization.

Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and make him hold his breath until he goes out, or shows the gut, or the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then reduce again your fingers, and the signs with caustic under the rupture on the sides of the eyes, with a sign whose end is similar to half a circle in the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then apply the caustic, which is in this form, until it turns white and comes out as flakes.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then reduce the intestine, or the colon to its connexion.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then place his hand over the place so that it does not escape from the intestine: and you have already opened between the weak thighs, and placed under it a pillow, and another on the crura of his other leg, and another on his chest which holds the hand.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the caustic over the sign with your hand holding the cauterium straight.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold it, until when you reach the mouth: or go with another if you do not succeed with this one up to the mouth.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And observe wisely from the exit of the intestine in the hour of your cauterization, lest you burn it, and may appear by this on the weak or through malice great death.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not reach the mouth with the cauterium, your operation will not be successful.

Et sit infirmus iacens super dorsum suum quadraginta diebus, donec sigilletur uulnus.	And let him be weak lying on his back for forty days, until the wound is scabbed over.
Et oportet, ut ponas nutrimentum eius longitudine temporis curationis eius, quod leniat uentrem eius: ut non exeat intestinum apud conamen et egestionem.	And it is necessary that you place food on his length of time of curing according to the length of his wound healing so that his belly does not escape from the connexion and excretion.

Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And it may be lessened by labor, and fullness of food and drink, and loud speaking.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when this regimen is used, it is cured wholly by the cure.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I say that the treatment of ruptures with incision in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When however ruptures happen in the other belly, and they are beginning, and you do not wish them to be added, then cauterize the rupture with a round cauterization of the same quantity: and this which hardens from then on shall be as the third of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then take care of it itself, according to what we have said: and it will not be added.
Et iam dixerunt quidam primi: ut cauterizetur Ruptura cum cauterio triangulato, secundum hanc formam.	And some have already said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cauterization, according to this form.
Postquam signatur cum encaustro, et ponitur linea quae est per latitudinem in latere superiori Rupturae, et linea altera ad inferius.	After it is set alight with the caustic, and a line is put across it which is along its width on the upper side of the rupture, and another line downwards.
Et depone manum tuam in medio cum cauterio clauili.	And place your hand in the middle with the caustic closed.
Sed cauterium primum est facilius et melius.	But the caustic is first easier and better.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	¶ About the method of cauterization in pain due to wound or percussion.

When it happens in some members by wound or percussion of pain: and he has endured the pain for a long time, and it does not consent to the cure with medicines: then it is necessary that it be cauterized with the point caustic.

And the caustic should be a cauterization for all members according to its size, and the parity of it, and its weakness, and its vigor, and its location of twisting, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If then it is cured by the first cauterization, it is good.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	If not, then proceed with the same cauterization.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	For these pains are of habit, and they ought to be changed from the member towards that which is nearest to it.

Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the kind of leprosy which is made for putrefaction of the phlegmatic and melancholic: since when you wish to cauterize it, consider it.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If then leprosy is sloughing, and you have treated it with that which we said in the division, and it has not gone down, nor yet: and you fear for the weak one, that corruption may comprehend all the complexion of it: then cauterize it on the head with five burns: one in the middle of the head, and another under it at the end of the hair, and two under the two horns, and one under the nail of the little finger.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And then your hand with cauterization almost, until it makes an impression in the mouth of a small print, and the cortices are dislocated from it: that the breath of the gross vapors may escape from it, and cauterize also on the spleen, according as it precedes.

But if leprosy has already spread over the weak one and appears clearly: then it is necessary to cauterize with those burns which we said in the head, and on the end of the nose, and two on the two maxillae, and two on the two spines of the neck, and six on the spine of the back, and one large on the hips and one above it, in the same hip: and two on the thighs, i.e. one on the whole thigh, and two on the knees, and two on the elbows, and two on the breast-bones of his own: and cauterize it on all the joints, from the joints of the fingers of his hands, and feet: and cauterize on all the heel of his feet, and the nails of his hands.

Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And when the caustic is applied to the os pectoralis, and another above the os stomachi, and another above the epar.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And you know that the more you add to the caustic, the more inflammation and the more consolidating it becomes.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And you know that the weak do not find pain in the caustic as the healthy do, because their body is already stunned.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it should be that the caustics are according to their size and thickness, according to the parts and seams: according to what precedes from the types of tools.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the caustic from the flour of plants with honey, and the rest of the treatment until it is healed.

When the ancient Albaras no longer contains anything of medical engineering: then cauterize over the deep cauterization as soon as possible, according to the degree of skin thickness, until the white removes and changes its color.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.

Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	But wise men said that it should be cauterized with the last cauterization in the middle.
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But I do not see that: for I fear that it will ulcerate, and I have already seen that several times.
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better to cauterize around it with a circle as we said, or with many cauterizations.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	¶ On the method of cauterization in adhesions.
Caput LIII.	Head LIV.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When someone has adhesions and it is slow to mature, or because of the excessive making of it, or because of the weakness of the old, when there are few drops of blood, or because of time, and you want to hasten the maturation of the adhesions: then cauterize around it with many small cauterizations.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then release it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hasten with the maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	If however you want to make a hole in it with the cauterization, then burn this one with the cauterization, whose form is this one.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it directly in the middle of the dressing, until it penetrates the skin: and let it be a cauterization from which a weak one follows, so that the course may be cleansed purely.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	§ Method of cauterization in corroding matter.
Caput LIIII.	Head LXXXIV. (This is likely a reference to the size or degree of the wound, not a patient's age or name.)
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	The corroding is only a decay in a walking member, and it corrodes itself, just as fire consumes dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	If then you see a corroding in the place where the cauterization can endure with fire, then much cauterization, small and large closures, according to which is suitable for that place where the decay is.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize it from all sides until you completely remove the decay, and nothing remains of it deeply.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then release it for three days, and place over the cauterized spots powdered sulfur with oil, until all escharas are removed, and all decay.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then take care of it with the unguents that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	If then you see that after three days healthy flesh is generated without decay, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then repeat the cauterization over the remaining parts of the decaying ones.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And the corroding is sometimes treated with sharp medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it rises at the place of the cauterization.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	Indeed, the cauterization with fire is more useful than the medicine: and I have already said that the cauterization of it with sharp medicine in division: take then it here when you need it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	§ Method of cauterization in boils and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter 57.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This affliction often occurs in the lower parts of the foot: it is a large, filtered thing that harms the foot.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	Indeed, there is a caustic in those parts according to two ways: the caustic with fire, and the caustic with hot water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	However, when it is with fire, it is like a feather made of flame: which is made of iron, according to the quantity that contains it, closed from all sides: and it has a fine edge.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then place the hot caustic on the closed part.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then roll the hand with the caustic around the closed part, until the caustic reaches the depth of the closed part: and let it remain for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then apply the plaster with ointment made of finely ground mustard, and salt: and let it be applied over the caustic at night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For it will be eradicated from its roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with the generated skin ointment, until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they do not heal, and many of them occur on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet: then apply the caustic with hot water to them: and it is like taking a canula from air, or iron, or from a feather: and place it over the closed part, or an althelul.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then draw out a small amount of hot water from the canula: hold your hand, and roll it with the compression of your hand, so that the edge of the canula is imprinted on the depth of the closed part, and it finds warm water to the root, to the depth: and it will wait weakly for a short time after the application of hot water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then let it go, for it will be uprooted along with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	Do it one after another until all of them are removed from the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then take care of them after they have been uprooted, with the ointment that generates flesh from the wound.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	¶ Method of Cauterization in Tremors.
Caput LVI.	Head 60.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When a tremor occurs in someone due to cold in the nerve, or due to a fever of the fourth kind, or otherwise: then it is necessary to cauterize it with four cauterizations, or five over the back of the spine, and over all the back, and in the chest of that person, and over the stomach of that person.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For the tremor ceases with the olive oil cauterization, and hastens the health of the illness of cold.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	¶ Method of Cauterization for Albathir.
Caput LVII.	Head 57.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When the foetid Albathir spots that are formed from the corrupt materials of the body are expelled from the body.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Therefore, it is necessary to first cauterize them when they appear, with the olive oil cauterization over all the head spots, with a fine myrtle stick, whose ends are burned with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or if the long root of the Aristolochia is used.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or if the cauterization with the lens is used.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they are cauterized for the removal of adenomas, in the beginning of their expulsion according to this method: and they do not increase: and it breaks down the surplus, making them, and they heal from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	Nevertheless, it should be done after the venesection with bloodletting.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	On the method of cauterization in the flow of blood from an artery into the thigh.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	It often happens that the flow of blood from an artery, which is incised on the thigh, occurs externally, or at the site of the incision, or at the site of the cauterization of the member, and similar to these, it is difficult to cut it off.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	When this happens to someone, then immediately with your hand on the arterial opening, and place your thumb on it: and tighten it much until the blood is pressed under your thumb, and nothing escapes from it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then place the small olive-oil cauterization on the fire, and a large number of them, and blow on them until they are burned.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take one of them, whether small or large, according to the thigh and the place where the artery is cut, and place the cauterization on the same vein, after which you remove your thumb quickly: and hold the cauterization until the blood is cut off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	If it is expelled with your thumb from the arterial opening, and the cauterization is extinguished, then take another cauterization quickly, from the cauterizations that are prepared in the fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	So do not stop doing this with one after another, until the blood is cut off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, and another evil may occur above it.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And you know that when the blood flows out of the artery, it is not possible to cut it off at that time: especially if the artery is large, unless with one-fourth of a drachm.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or if with cauterization, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	If there is no extraction, then there is no extraction.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	When it is extracted, its ends are contracted, and blood is cut off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or if it is sewn up with a strong thread.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or let them be applied to it according to the properties of the medicine that cuts off blood and is suitable for a tight constriction.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	However, if the administrator cuts off its blood with a ligature, and tightens it with cloth, or with the arrangement of things burning, and similar things, it does not conflict with him severely, except rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	If something like that happens to someone, and there is no present physician or medicine, then he should begin with placing the first digit of the index finger on the opening of the wound, as we have said, and a tight constriction, until the blood is squeezed out from the upper part of the wound, and above the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And the finger should not be removed, but continue to apply it to the cold water of the freezing ice, until the blood is frozen and hardened, and then cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And in the meantime, he should consider what he needs from the cauterization, or from the medicine.

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On Incision, Perforation, and Phlebotomy in wounds, and similar things.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	As we have said in Chapter One, all the ailments in which the fire of the cauterization and the medicine burning, and their occasions, causes, the instruments of cauterization, and the forms of cauterization are mentioned.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I have placed this chapter from the head to the foot.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I will proceed in this chapter in the same vein: so that it may be raised over the seeker of what is sought.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	Before I begin this chapter, it is necessary for you, my sons, to add that there is fear in this chapter concerning cauterization, which is not present in the first chapter on cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	Therefore, caution must be greater in this operation, as often blood comes out with it, which is the cause of fear among the wounds, incisions on the scalp, abscesses, wounds for extracting arrows, curing wounds, and extracting stones, and those similar to them. From all of which there is associated terror and fear, and death occurs in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	I warn you not to let that fall on you, for sometimes men with weaknesses in this art fall on you.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For among them is one who is angry with his own sickness and death is near to him because of his great anger, which he finds from his own weakness and the length of his malice.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when sickness comes, it is from fear of death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And among them is one who gives his servant to you and says to you with him, hoping for your health, and his sickness is dangerous.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore, it does not need to be that you consent to him who comes to you from them, of whose manner it is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And let our caution be greater than our greed and rapacity.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presume over anything from him, unless you have certain knowledge that verifies this to you among the successful succession.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And use your knowledge in the care of all your sick, by prophecy and indication to it that health is conveniently suitable.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	In that there is an helper to you in the acquisition of fame and glory, and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O sons, with His understanding, and He will not take away from you His guidance and inspiration, for it is in His hand.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I myself have divided this chapter into sections according to the order of the previous chapter on cauterization, from the ear to the feet, so that what you seek from it may be revealed to you and where you need it.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	¶ Regarding the treatment of water collected in the skulls of children.
Caput I.	Head I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	Know that this affliction often happens to children during childbirth: or when the mother tightens the head of the child without causing it to bleed.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever it happens due to a hidden cause which is unknown.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I myself have not seen this affliction in others except in children, and for all of them who came to me before they died, therefore it is fitting for me to interrupt the operation on her.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I myself have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and his head became magnificent throughout the day, until he could not sit on himself because of the magnitude of his head, and the moisture increased until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture indeed collects between the skin and the face, or it collects above the bones on the side of the face.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation on him, if there is moisture between the skin and the face, and the edema is small, then it is necessary to make a cut in the middle of the scalp in a horizontal direction: and the length of the fissure should be like two knots, until the moisture flows.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is a spumous shape.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	If then the moisture is more increased, and the edema is greater, then place them two fissures according to this shape.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	If moisture is under the bone, and its sign is that which you see open wounds of the head from all sides: and water is removed when you compress it with your hand to the inside, and it does not hide from you this: then it is necessary for you to find in the middle of the head three fissures, according to this manner.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after making the incision, remove all the moisture outside.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then string the fissures with pieces of cloth and silk.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then apply this with wine and oil up to the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then dissolve the ligament, and care for the wound with bandages, and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not let go of tying the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And drink a little moist food, until the member is strengthened and healed.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another mode of incision is, according to which you will see the magnitude of the posters and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For sometimes it is in the back, or in the heel, or on the right side, or on the left side.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	Therefore, ascend with the incision where you see the posters and the collection of water, and divide it according to what you can.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, do not rupture the artery, and let there be a flow of blood, and the weak one dies from that flow with the flow of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	¶ About the incision of the arteries that are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Head 2.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When there occurs to someone cataract to the eyes, or to the chest, and it becomes old and does not help the treatment of physicians: then the last treatment is in this, the incision of these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when you want to incise them, let the weak head of your own radiate.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then scrape the area with a rough cloth so the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then he weakly stretches his neck with any cloth of his own.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the pulse of the vein is.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the location of both is that which is behind the ears depressed: and it is rarely hidden, unless in some few people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then signs are made with wax over both: and cut through both with a sharp knife, incision being applied to the bone, and make it go around the circumference of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you wish, insert the knife under the artery, and cut it to the upper part with the incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And the length of the incision should be roughly two fingers joined.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the vein is cut, blood will flow out of the pulse-like ejection, which frequently jumps to the inside.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	However, if the artery does not appear by touch, then it is necessary to measure the distance from the ear with a space of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then signs are made with wax, and find until the bone.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And that which should be expelled from the blood is six grains, and perhaps you will expel more or less.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All of this according to the amount that appears to you from the weak vein and the fullness of the artery of it.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider to the thigh.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	Then if there remains something to the bone from the incision, then cut it so as not to cause a hot burn: then tie the thigh with threads from linen cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment until it is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	¶ About the extraction of arteries that are in time.
Caput III.	¶ Head 3.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When a man suffers from an old hemicrane, or an acute cataract due to the sharpness of sharp substances, and the heat in the fingers of the thumbs, or soda old, bitter, and similar to these: and is treated with the methods of medical treatment, and it does not agree with this: then we have learned in these diseases the extraction of arteries from the thumbs, or cauterization of these, as we have mentioned.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the method of the operation in the extraction of these is that it unravels the weak hairs that are in the thumbs, and directs to the apparent artery in the thumb.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	Indeed, it is shown to you from its own pulse, and is rarely hidden unless in a few men, or excessive coldness.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it is hidden from you, then it tightly grasps its own weak head with any of its own cloth: then it rubs the place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or it may rub the place with hot water until it appears to you with a clear appearance.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take a sponge, which we formed slightly before.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then it scrubs the skin with it, with ease, until the pustules reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then remove the wart with it, and pull it out to the upper part, until you pull it out from the skin, and make it come out of all the cloths that are under it.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If the artery is thin: then cover it with the end of the wart.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut off from it a piece according to the quantity by which its ends extend and contract, and there is no flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it is not cut off, and if it is not cut off, the blood does not rise greatly.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then take out the blood from the vein of the patient, up to three ounces.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large, then it should be tied in two places with threads twice as thick and strong as serice, or from the alopecia chord, so that it does not reach putrefaction before the consolidation of the wound, and a flow of blood occurs.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut over the excess between the two ties.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do this at that hour, or at another hour later.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with cauterization up to the mouth, with a kitchen cauterization tool: until the ends of its extremities, and it will stay in the same place of the operation.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And it is better to do this unless the patient has a fever or cold complexion.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For cauterization is from those that dry out wet things.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better to dry them.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And it is necessary after the extraction of the artery to fill the old cloth place: and they should be placed above on the same pillows made.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the solution is given with dry medicines that make flesh grow, and with linen, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If in the meantime while you are operating a flow of blood from the artery, then cut it off with cauterization, or until it fills the place with zegi: and tighten your hand until the blood is cut off.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	If nothing of these is present to you, then place your thumb above the place until the blood freezes.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And rub the place with cold water until the sharpness is quiet and tightens according to what is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And since that which is leucine and easier for the extraction of the artery is, to cauterize it with this cauterization tool having two kitchen knives: and the sharpness of the two knives should be similar to the magnetite.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	Indeed, they are much less sharp than two awls.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are sharp like two awls, then both coldness will follow: and they do not cause the flesh to be wounded.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	When there is a little grossness in them, the heat of fire is held by them, and the flesh is wounded carelessly: and therefore this work is better than all others, and more useful, and easier.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And let there be a space between two awls, the quantity of grossness of the fingers, after you have marked out two places with the encaustic: and lay them aside until they become hot to the mouth, and they will happen in two places: so that it may be elongated which is between the extremities of it.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For they do not become firm with this cauterization deeply.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of cauterization.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	Regarding the care of the course of sharp, frequent lachrymal drops from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Head IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When the tears are frequent and the course of them from the nose which is above the outside of the forehead of the head: and it does not fit anything of the care of medicine with other medicines, and you see the face of the weak one to be reddening, and he feels in his front a walk, as it is the walk of ants: and his eyes are drooping, moist, so that his hairs are already corroded by the corrosion: and his eyelids are hot from the sharpness of the tears: then the ancients used this care for this operation, and called it the care, with Ense.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is as you say, to make the weak one's hairs to be corroded which are in his front.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then make three incisions in the front, equally distant according to the length of the face: and let the length of the incision be almost two fingers, and the second one should be in the middle of the nose in the front, and the third according to the length almost as much as the movement of the thumb, and the third from the other side: and take care not to cut any arteries which are in the two sides: and elongate your hand from the continuation of the two jaws, and let there be a space of all the quantity of three fingers connected: and let there be for you a sponge cut in a frustum, or many dry cloths with which you will dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then insert the sharp end of a sponge of two kinds, whose next form is as follows:
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	After the incision made on the side of the temporal bone, until the second incision: and it will exfoliate the entire skin that is between the two incisions, when you smear with what is above the eye.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then do this also from the middle incision to the second one.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then remove this sharp sponge, and insert the other instrument into the first incision again, which is called the lancet, from one part gently, not sharply from the other part.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And place the sharp side of its flank against the exposed flesh with the skin, and the other side gently against the eye: and push it until it reaches the middle incision: and cut away all the moisture that comes down from the hair to the eyes, except for what is continuous with the incision up to the one that appears from the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then do this in the middle fissure until the other fissure.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And after it runs out of blood, express the equal quantity of coagulated blood from the points of the splinters.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then place linen strips in all the fissures, and put on top of them absorbent wool soaked in wine, or oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see if a hot blister does not occur.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day dissolve the bandage, and give a large infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for it with the basilic ointment, and the rest of the ointments used to heal it, until it is cured.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	¶ About the care of sharp lachrymal and catarrhal discharge to the eyes from the inner part of the head.
Caput V.	Chapter 5
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When a sharp cataract occurs, it is often and persistently attended by small, weak eyes, pale aspect, ulcerated eyelids, falling lashes, deep pain in the head, distressing, and followed by sneezing: then take from these symptoms the one that does not come from the matter of the cataract, unless it comes from many wives.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And this is a better remedy for them.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is best to have the patient shave his face.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then make a single incision in the middle of his forehead, or another perhaps further to the side, and start from the left temple to the right temple, making the cut until you reach the nose: then extend your hand from the wrists that are biting during mastication, until the nose is caught, and dry all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate the two incisions between the two old lips, or with linen threads.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then sew them up from above with small thread: and moisten the threads with wine and oil, so as not to cause an inflammation of the wound.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you have uncovered it, and see that inflammation is about to occur: then it is necessary to cauterize the nose, until flesh begins to be born in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then care for it with the regimen of exiccatus that makes flesh be born, as if you took two parts from the flour of wheat, and four parts from collophonia, and prepare an ointment from them, and apply it to the birth of the flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	¶ About the cure that falls into Aurem.
Caput VI.	Chapter Six.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	All that falls on the eye is of four kinds: either a mineral stone, or one similar to stone, such as iron and copper; or it is of plant origin, such as chestnut and sesame; or it is a flowable substance, such as water, vinegar, and their likes; or some animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When a stone falls on the eye, or a kind of stone not added to it, and does not grow in gold, expose the gold alone: if you see a stone, then distill something from olive oil or pitch into the gold.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction of it, and make it stir with a condiment, and stuff the nose with the coming sternutation, after you have placed in the circumference of the ear some fragments from the net or cloth, and extended the ear to the upper parts.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	For this treatment often goes out.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	If it does not go out, then administer the extraction of it with the Gest, that is, Pizigarolis subtle: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	If it goes out with the Gest, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction of it with a little bit of the blind's honey subtle, repeated several times.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If it does not go out by this, then make a tube of silver, and insert the end of the tube into the opening of the ear very much, and stuff what is in the circumference of the tube with softened oil with a cork, so that it does not drip but from the tube: then draw it out with your strong attraction.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	For this often goes out that we have told.
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	If it does not go out in this way, then take from the helkebat, or from the grain, that is, the prepared flour, with which they take the seeds, a small piece: and put it at the end of the radius after you have placed on it the proper seat: then insert it into the opening of the ear with ease, after you have dried the ear from the moisture.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	If then he does not depart with all those which I have mentioned, then immediately towards the cutting, before the heat of the post comes on, or spasm.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the mode of incision is such that the weak phlebitome is first taken from the head: and then draw it out from the blood according to its strength.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the weak one sit down between your hands, and turn his ear upwards, and find a small incision at the root of the ear near the fatty part of the lobe in the depressing place on his own: and let the incision be in the shape of the moon, until it is covered over by the stone: then take it away with it, which is possible for you from your instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then make the incision with your sharp knife, and take care of it until it is healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If the falling in the ear is from one large grain which grows and swells: then give him the extraction of that.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	If he does not obey you to the end: then take a thin sponge, fine and of this shape.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And give it with it the abscission of that kind from the grains which fall in the ear, and do not make this when you think that the grain is already moistened by the moisture of the ear, until you put it on many chips: then take it away with tweezers, or with a gentle touch, or with suction as I have said, for the extraction of his abscess is watery.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	But if water is entering into the ear, it is necessary that the weak one uses his sternutation with the condyle at first: and he has filled his own ear with some old cotton: and he is lying on that ear which has the water.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If then he departs through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	If not: then take many stones, according to the length of the finger, thin ones, lenitive, and heat them with fire rather briefly, and insert one of the weaker ones into the ear of that same animal: and let it bite on one of its feet, and strike with a stone other than that stone upon the stone which is in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	Therefore, he would not cease doing this with stones and stones, until the entire water has flowed out.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And the water has already flowed out, so take one from parpyro, or from the jaw, and insert the end of it into the ear: and light the other end with fire until it burns the most of it.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then take another jaw, and do this many times, until the entire water has flowed out: and pull out the same one with the cannula according to what was said earlier in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction of the animal that was inserted into it, if it is a small body, like a flea, and another similar one, take care of it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body that appears to the senses: then administer the extraction of its with your hand, and stitches: and this is easier for all that are held in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction of the ears generated in the ear, when you care for it with what I said in the division, and in the treatment of distillations, and not your care is intertwined: then it is necessary to look at the ear in the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If therefore something appears to you from the ears: then pull it out with your hand, or with fine stitches.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If however something does not appear to you from the ears: then take the cannula whose form is this, with a strict lower part and a wide upper part: and insert the subtle end of it into the ear according to the quantity that the weak one can bear: and then suck with it a strong suction.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Perform this many times until all worms come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	However, if they do not obey you to the end, then wrap the cannula around the plug as I said on the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	If they do not come out with what I said: then administer the distillations that the ancients have already tried for the expulsion of worms: and you will find this in the book on distillations.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And may your flow be like when I pour olive oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument whose form is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see, make it like you see it, either of silver or air, lower and tighter, in which there is a small hole above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	It should be that what is in the connection of the cannula, be made of silver.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you will, take the radium, and wrap the end of the cotton around it in a suitable way: then press out the oil, or grease, or whatever you want from these medicines into the cannula, and it should be in the ear: then insert the radium with the cotton wrapped around it, and expel it with your compressed but gentle hand until the oil is pushed through the connection heard, and feels weak inside: and that which is poured into the ear should be already hot with fire almost: and be careful not to put something cold in it, because medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	¶ About the care of the occurrences of silvering.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	Sometimes certain infants come out of the wombs of their mothers unperforated.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And it also happens to some people, poverty in the ear of the ear, or flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this poverty sometimes happens in a deep hole of the ear, which does not follow habit: and sometimes it happens to the outer opening, and follows it.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	That which happens in the deep ear, and which is not comprehended by sight, is difficult to treat in many ways.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which follows, use the weak ear in the sun, and look at it: then if you see an apparent opacification, open it with a soft soap of this kind, whose form is as follows: its extremity is where there is some small latitude, whose acute part is a part of it; and the rest of the soap is of two soft sides: so that it will not hurt the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If the opacification is from flesh in the ear: then hold it with a thin shave, and cut it with ease of the strong one, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	If the opacification is in the deep ear: then take a thin, soft heating substance, and heat it slightly: then insert it into the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If you feel an opacification with that which the weak one finds with age in hearing, try to open it with ease: and be careful not to wound the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then place the linen according to the size of the hole you have made in the Egyptian ointment: do this for a few days until you are sure about the healing of the wound.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take the linen and pour it into hot water, and rub the ground alum on top of it, and use it yourself.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	If you see the ear already swelling: then it is necessary to take out the linen and let it be with another linen that has been soaked in ointment made with hot wax, until the swelling is hot: then care for it until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If blood flow occurs: then submerge a sponge, or pieces of cloth in cold water, and place your ear over it: and use the remaining treatment, which the aforementioned book of distillations advises for closing the said blood flow.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	¶ On the care of Althelia's eyes.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These Altheli that occur in the eyes, sometimes they are moist and sometimes they are dry.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore it is necessary to hold them with tweezers, or with a nail, and to scrape them off with soap from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place it on the shaved areas.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If then blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a fine-pointed cauterizing iron.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And cauterizing them is better after the incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For many of them return when there remains something from their roots.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots burn and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	¶ On the care of Grandin's eyes.

Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Many things happen in the eyes that resemble Grandin in his strength, and in his hardness, and for that reason it is called Grando: it is an aggregation of thick moisture on the upper eyelid, and on the lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Therefore the operation on them is that you consider now, if it is Grando proceeding from it, which appears on the eyelid, and they are moved to all parts, and its matter is easy.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Therefore find a slit on it across its width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then exfoliate it from all sides with ease until it oozes.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then suspend it with a nail, and cauterize it.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If, however, the abscess is not prepared for you beforehand, unless you penetrate the eyelid with the incision almost immediately after it, it will harm that patient in some way.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If the incision is large: then gather that with the suture: and take care of it until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is small, it will not harm you from it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	A ointment, however, will restore it and make it supple.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if the grain is turned towards the inner part of the ear, and passes through the intrinsic surface of the eyelid, then the eyelid, and suspend the grain with a gilded needle: besides which you need an incision, and press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	If the eyelid is extended by the incision, it will not harm anything.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after the gilded grain incision with salt water: and take care of the place where it becomes supple, until the weak one is healed.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	¶ About the care of Axinath's eyelids.
Caput X.	Chapter X.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axinath is a wax that is generated in the upper eyelids' furs: and it happens most of all to children: and it grieves their eyes, and cataracts happen to them in the morning, and they cannot see the sun's light, because the tears are directed towards them, and for this reason they should lie down on their faces at all times, and sleep on them, and their eyelids are always wet, because the inflation has already occurred: and the apparent size of Axinath is indeed in the eye, and when you take the place with your fingers, you feel Axinath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of its operation is to have the weak head of his own in your groove.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a linen cloth and prepare a hair in it, and make a circle from it according to the amount contained in Axrinath from all sides.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then place it on top of it, and press with your fingers from all sides so that Axrinath is aggregated in the middle of the circle.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of its moisture with sandpaper, when it is incident, cracks through the breadth, and there should not be a crack larger than that which is made in phlebotomy in the deep.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or it may be that you find the entire skin, until the inflammation reaches Axrinath, because many times Axrinath comes out of the fissure according to the shape of white wool.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Then take it out with the cloth that you have inserted between your fingers to the outside: and turn your hand to the right and left until it is swept away: and be careful not to add in the crack so that there is no inflammation with sandpaper to the eye, and hurt it.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	However, if Axrinath does not appear to you at the beginning of the crack, add a little with ease in the crack until Axrinath comes out.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then take it out as I said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then immerse the cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the place, and tie it with threads.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And from men there are those who pour salt on the crack, and place it in the liquid that remains from that moisture.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	However, if an aposteme is burn occurs at the location, then take care of it with sedative ointments until it is healed.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	¶ About the ways of Ataxmia eyes, that is, when the eyelid is made soft the eye, where it should not be raised like this.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs are added to the eyelids before they have reached their full growth under the natural eyelashes, and are excessive: then they are harmful to the eye, and cause various kinds of diseases such as excessive tearing, mollification of the eyelids, and cataract, until this becomes the cause of destruction of the eye.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And indeed, the treatment of the eyes is done according to four methods.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or by cauterization with fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or according to the sharp medicine, as stated in the chapter of cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or the treatment of the eyes is done by incision and suture.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or by cannulas, as I will say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary to place the weak head in your groove.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If then it is turned, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert a needle into it, in which the thread of the eyelid is located from the lower part, and let the needle penetrate the thread with a thin wire above, and let it be near the hairs themselves, that is, near the margin of the eyelid where the hairs grow: and then pull the thread with the eye and turn the eyelid with your right hand.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hairs, with the sudation incident on the tear from the larger to the smaller tear.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then pull out the thread, and place under the eyelid a small piece of cloth or linen, and then mark on the eyelid with a wax figure like the leaf of the myrtle.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it should be made according to the figure of the eyelid according to its size and thickness: for this has already diversified among humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	It is from him who indicates that it should be of great quantity, according to the quantity which is softened from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then when you find scours on two lines which you have marked, and begin with the greater tears up to the lesser tears, and there should be a fissure near the natural hairs, like the breadth of the ribs, so is the grossness of the radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert an eyelid into one of the two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape off the entire one.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then gather the two lips with the suture, with a needle and fine thread: and wipe away the blood, and make it adhere that which superfluits from the ends of the two eyebrows, with which some things may be touched, if you wish to do this; and if not, do not worry.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then release the suture and thread up to three days, or four: then take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, release the flap without suture, and take care of it with it, that it may dry and contract.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid swells at the sigil of the wound and its aggregation, but it will be better in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	This manner of treating Ataxir they learned from the ancients.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	Indeed, there is anxiety about the weakest, and it is from good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another mode is in Ataxir also: and it is that the signs are figurations on the eyelid, which is like the figure of the myrtle leaf, as we have said.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then swell the eyelid with three eyelids separated or aggregated according to this form which follows, and then cut off that which superfluits with holes equal to this form, according to this form.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	If it is not possible for you to hold an alligator and it does not fit: then take an acum and place it in the place where the filum is, and insert the acum into the middle of the figure: and insert another filum, which is slightly larger than the lachrymal, and a second filum which is slightly smaller than the lachrymal: and gather the threads between your fingers with equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then smooth out your hand with equal pressure: and smooth out the skin over which the cut was made, as we have described.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather the two lips of the wound with the suture: and care for it until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	If however an aphthous sore occurs at your incision or your cut: care for this aphthous sore with the pus, and those similar, which are settling down, with ointment.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And sometimes it happens that the eyelids also turn the hair of his eyes.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	Therefore it is necessary to use what we have said in the incision, but the suture is more artificial for both of them.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	¶ About the care of Ataxir with dogs.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And it is that you cut the eyelid, and separate the fissure which is swollen, according to what we have described.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then make two canes or two thin woods artificially: the length of which should be according to the length of the eyelid, and the width of its part should be smaller than the width of the suture: and you have already reached the extremities of both parts where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then gather the two with equal pressure over that which flows out of the eyelid of the eye, and string two canes from the two parts which are strongly closed, and let it be for a few days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	For the skin is strangled, and it becomes thin, and putrid, until it falls off by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If then it is slow, then cut it with furrows.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then attend to it, until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When then it is closed, anoint the eyelid: and they shall not prick the hairs.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	And this is the form of two candles, which the face is made according to this figure, and the quantity in length and breadth.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	§ About the burning of the hairs that prick in the eye with a needle.
Caput XII.	Head XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	The operation in this is, to take a fine thread, and to thrust it into it with a fine needle, gently.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then gather the extremities thereof, and the nodes of both knots with fine needles: and the length of the threads shall be a thumb's breadth.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then compose another fine thread under it, and if you will, the extremities of those threads.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then lay his weak head near the sun, and it shall be near the earth, because it is a subtle or small operation.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then thrust the needle with the threads into the root of the eyelid, and make it pierce the eyelid quickly, until it comes out above the natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then draw the thread up to the knots: and thrust the thread into the knots: if it be one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then draw your hand with it, until the hair with the knots comes out with the natural hair of the eyelid.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If then the knots are drawn out, and the hair does not come out with them: draw the knots towards the lower part, with the thread which you have composed in it, until the knot comes out of the upper opening, and see it by the eye: then draw the knot and the thread: and take out both, and close the eye: and let it be closed for two or three days, until the hair grows in its place, and the flesh is born over it.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then associate it with a long hair from natural hair, and pluck it while holding it. Or release it until it stretches after some time, and then pluck it then.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	This is a description of a condition that affects the upper eyelid, which was a common issue in medieval times. The text does not provide further details on the treatment or symptoms of this condition.
Caput XIII.	This is likely a reference to Chapter 13 of a medical textbook or treatise. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine the specific content of this chapter.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this condition occurs in the eye, it is called "Leporina." This term may have been used to describe a specific type of eyelid inflammation or swelling. However, without more context, it is difficult to determine the exact nature of this condition.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	This condition can be either natural or accidental. This suggests that the cause of the condition may be unknown or multifactorial, and that it may be related to both genetic and environmental factors.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	Therefore, this condition is accidental and arises from the consolidation of wounds, or sections, or cauterization, and similar procedures. This suggests that the condition may be caused by injury or trauma to the eyelid, and that it may be treated with surgical procedures such as cauterization or excision of affected tissue.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	The method of treatment for this condition is to find the consolidated tissue and separate the lips of the eyelid, and then place a piece of linen between them and tie it tightly until it heals. This suggests that the condition may be treated with a simple incision and suturing procedure to allow the affected tissue to heal and recover.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	It is not necessary to use things that dry or constrict in the treatment of this condition, as they may make the condition worse. Instead, use things that soothe and soften, such as Greek barley: mix it with water, in which althea is cooked, and linseed oil: and apply a ointment made from oils, such as olive oil: and cover with the bandage and care for it with it. This suggests that the use of harsh or drying agents in the treatment of this condition may be harmful and that more gentle or soothing treatments may be more effective.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	Your resource for the treatment of this condition is to try everything with ingenuity, so that it does not consolidate according to its original form. This suggests that the condition may be treated with a variety of methods and techniques, and that the specific approach may depend on the individual characteristics of the patient and the nature of the condition.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	This very operation that I mentioned is not anything other than a certain correction of Alxatratus, so as not to leave the shape of the place according to what it was entirely.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	Regarding the care of Alxatratus which is done on the inner eyelid, and it is a wrinkle or contraction upwards to the right and left.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIII.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This Alxatratus which is done below is what is truly called Alxatratus.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is natural and accidental.
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	And the accidental one is made from the elbow, or a fissure, or cauterization, and similar to these.
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And one of the operations in it is, to take a needle, in which there is a thread double, and anoint it with the skin, and make it penetrate from the left eye to the right eye, until the thread enters into the two extremities of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the skin with the needle, and cut it with a slightly wet edge.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If then the figure of the eyelid returns according to what should be, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take the radium, and place it in the fissure, and turn the eyelid with it: and find two fissures on the inner side of the eyelid, and they are the extremities of the two angles of the incision, until they come together and make an angle: until when they gather together, make this figure, and it is the Greek letter gamma.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then remove that skin by the amount of the sharp side of its bottom, from the part that follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then gather the separated parts: and sew it with linen thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with those, as we said, from the drugs that make things softer and laxatives, until they become well.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if an abscess occurs from a fissure, and suture, or cauterization: then it is necessary to flatten the fissure under the eyelashes, even according to what precedes.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate between the two lips with a laxative, as we said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the main point of care for an abscess when it is above or below, is to rush into it operation, according to how it is prepared from the form of Alxatrati.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	Indeed, it is of many forms: and the skilled artificer prepares the ingenuity with whatever mode is possible for him, until he makes the figure return to the natural form, or almost to it, and himself also weakens, according to what suits him from the operation and instruments in many dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	¶ About the adhesion of the eyelid to the eye with conjunctiva or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter 15.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	At times this consolidation occurs in many men, so that the upper eyelid consolidates with white of the eye and prevents it from undergoing its natural operations.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	Therefore it is necessary that you introduce the end of the finger under the eyelid and lift it up: or extend it with a blade: then incise the adhesion with soft suet, which is not with the sharpness of the blade's suet, but is almost blunt: so that the weak one does not suffer from the operation, and removes the suet, and hurts the eye with its sharpness: and your incision should be as if you were removing this adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns according to its natural form, and heals the adhesion entirely.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Place then salted water into the eye, after washing it with water: or distill the water from the salted water, from the salt made from the olive oil, with the water dissolved from the zinc.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate the eyelid and eye with linen, and place a cloth soaked in almond oil over it: and use it daily for three days, until it becomes hard, until it heals.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	¶ Regarding the cutting of a toe nail and the protrusion of the flesh from the eye:
Caput XVI.	Head XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	Know that a toe nail is in two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nervous: and it is like the hard oil of saffron, thin.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, like the cold humidity of white snow: which when it touches the skin, or when it is dipped in a knife, or an iron wire, it is cut off, and the wire does not stick in it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both kinds do not begin unless from the greater water, until it gradually comes, until it covers the eye, and prevents the light, and the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operating on this is: to lay his weak head in your groove.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and separate the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then close the toe nail with a few wires, and extend it to the upper part.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take a needle, and insert it into the toe nail with a horsehair or a rope: and let the thread be strong, and slightly cut the two ends of the needle, and thrust it into the middle of the toe nail: and let it go through with the point of the needle, and tie it with a thread around the toe nail, and extend it to the upper part: and pluck out with your hair the side of the toe nail that follows the pupil, as if you were pulling it up to the end of the toe.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then incise the remaining part in the root of the lacrimal bone with fine sand and/or with small furrows: and release the natural flesh of the lacrimal gland so that it does not occur due to the continuous flow of tears from its incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And when it extends the nail with a hoof: or with thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scrape it with gentle sand, of which this is the form.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And be careful not to touch the sand with the skin, lest a rupture occur in it and the pupil be perforated.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, apply something salty to the eye, or from made lemon juice, and release it until the next day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of it with what is necessary, until it recovers.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	If the hoof is not hard and you cannot insert anything into it with a knife, nor does it have a hoof, then this kind of hoof is carefully cared for with medicines and recovers as we have said in the division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	If you want to incise it, then open the weak eye, and take fine sand, gentle, weak, according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scrape the hoof down with the rasor, with gentleness.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	If you see that it is being shaved and cut, and is pressing on it with the razor, then distill from your hour in the eye from made lemon juice, or from red lemon juice, or crushed salt: and wet the eye until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat this operation until the whole of it is removed.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless the opposite is good for your eye, hot apostema: then release it and take care of the apostema until it recovers.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on the same part with reason, until it heals.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	Eminence of the eye's flesh, if it causes harm to the eye with great damage, it is suspended with a needle, and a cut is made from that part of it: and not least, the incision, so as there may be no course of tears.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then a drop of red blood or made from zinc is applied until it heals.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	¶ About the Alguardenic incision, and the flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	Sometimes a red flesh is born in the eyes of certain humans, whether composed or placed, until it reaches the pupil, or approaches, or draws up over the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outside: and resembles the rose of balsamic.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation is also made on it, so that the weak head of its own is placed in your groove.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open the eyes of its own, and sew that whole flesh with appropriate needles to that: and hold it with one forceps or grasp.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then make a cut in the flesh at first, until the whole of it is cut with the incisor.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And beware of the eye, so as not to hurt it during the operation: and your cut should be the one you make, or with sandpaper, which we mentioned in the incision of the nail: or with notches, according to which form it will have after this knot.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your cut is complete and the Alguardenic is removed, then fill the eye with ground salt: or distill red blood or similar from medicines that are cracked: and place a piece of cotton with an egg on the deformed eye: so as to secure it from hot blisters.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If there remains from another wound something, and the hot blood dominates over you, and you fear the heat of the wound: then let go of the eye, and care for it with what soothes the heat of the wound.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then follow up with it again during the operation until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And similarly, do with the flesh added that happens in the eye from this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that all weak eyes from one kind or another be cured by operating with iron: and do not insert your hand into any of these operations until you see that this member is enduring that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	¶ About collecting Sebel from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Sebel are red warts that are tied over the eye, and prevent its own operation: and weaken the eye with the passage of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore, it is necessary for you at first to consider whether the eye in which there are warts is strong and there is no disease in it other than the warts: then collect the warts of that eye.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is necessary that you place the weak one last, so that its head is in your groove.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then suspend the eyelids with a single or double ring, according to your prudence: and let the ring be subtle for duplication, according to this form, or let there be two rings that are graduated in the body, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then tie them with fine threads of the eyelids with subtlety, and wipe away the blood hour after hour until you see that these eyelids are withdrawing from the eye, and they become relaxed: and be careful not to hurt the eye with the rough ends.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be firm in your operation with courage: so that you do not fail except these eyelids.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	When you have completed your application, then distill it into the eye of the green ivory, or red: so that its own sharpness may consume what remains of the original.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If, however, it is not possible for you to collect the whole of that at once, then apply the plaster to the eye with it, which soothes the pain of the eye: and allow it to remain for a few days, until the pain of the wound has subsided: and secure it from the heat of the applied plaster: and then repeat over it according to the same mode, until it is cured.
Et haec est forma forficis.	This is the form of the thorn.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	¶ Regarding the reduction of Arissis to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	The physicians call this the Arissis fistula, which they treat either by cauterization or by burning with sharp-edged medicaments, according to what is related in its narrative.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	And if it does not heal, then there is no skill in it: unless you find on the edge of the wound, and remove all the moisture and pus that is in it, until the bone is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When the bone is exposed, and you see corruption or blackening in it, then scrape it with the instrument whose form is this.
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called the "Scraping of the Scalp.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of iron, and let its head be round like a berry, which is pierced with the point of the thumb, or with the point of the lancet, in a very fine piercing: and place it on the place of the corrupted bone.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then turn it between your fingers, and press your hand a little, until you know that the corruption has been scraped off: and do this several times.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the place with the dressed stimulating ointments.
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If then the wound is healed and flesh has been formed, and the discharge of pus ceases: and if it remains for forty days and there is no return of the swelling, no suppuration, and no accident happens in it: then you know that he is cured.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	And if not, then there is no genius in it, except to reduce the fistula to the nostril, according to this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is that you detach from the bone secondly with iron, or with sharp medicine: and when the bone is detected, then take the terebinthum according to this form, it should be the red, triangular one: and the wood of it should be a pyramid extinguished up to its end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then place this on the bone itself: and it should be near the tearful: and extend your hand a little from the eye.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then roll your hand with the terebinthum until it penetrates the bone, and it will feel weak: by this that you find the moisture to issue from it when you hold your hand over your own nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore, then restore the place with stiptic medicines burning, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	And when flesh is formed and the place is hardened: then the matter that was poured out to the outside returns to the nose: it is therefore lighter over the weak one.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	¶ Regarding the reduction of the prominence of the Eye.
Caput XX.	Chapter 20.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye is prominent with all its bulk, and there is no hurt in use, nor diminution: then it is necessary to loosen the weak one: then draw out the blood: afterwards put on wet dressings without scarification, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then place a liniment made from acacia, aloe, frankincense, and sarsaparilla over the eye.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then pull down the eyelid over the plaster with many pins.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the mode of the pins is: take many thin linen cloths, and double each one four times, then use as many as you wish from them on the eye, then place them one over the other according to the size of the eye, and then tighten them with a strong bandage.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And repeat the incisions without scarring with wet gauze.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the incisions and let the eyelid tightened for one day and night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	However, if the bandage is again softened, then it should be tightened greatly: then remove the bandage as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If then you see the eye already red with a soft bandage, it is good: and if not, then repeat the plaster, the pins, the tightening, and the incisions until it heals.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	§ On the incision of the eye covering.
Caput XXI.	Head 21.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	When a rupture occurs in the eye covering, then it should be cut off and comes out of the eyelid as a grain of wheat, and disfigures the appearance of man because of this, and it is supposed to be sewn in: then the operation is done in this way, according to what I will describe: and it is, that you thrust an acorn into the root of the wheat from the lower part to the upper part.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then thrust another acorn into the part where there is a thread that is double the size of the tear duct, and make it penetrate: and remove the first according to its position.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then cut out the part where there is a thread that is double the size of the wheat, and sew it to the part of the wheat around the acorn, and tighten it greatly.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then extract the eye socket and place a sponge soaked in warm water on top of it, then release it until the thread falls with the king.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then care for the eye with it, so that it strengthens it until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when it is tightened by the king around all parts with a circle on cloth, until it adds the eye a great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it is polished with fine sandpaper, which reaches deep into the eye, and moistens the albino, and the eye goes down and enters immediately: then tighten it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	¶ Regarding the treatment of Alcomnati.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This disease known as Alcomnati is not, unless it is sickness, which is gathered in the eye, similar to descending water, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the method of operating on it is, as you make the weak sit on a prepared seat, or directed.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take the head of its parts with your hands, and move it until you see healthy healing to the lower eyes of yours.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then it is made, and does not go down, and the light is released: and the weak sees as before: and if it does not go down lower, you know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	But if the descent of the sickness with what we said is not prepared, then make the weak sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take fine sandpaper and find with it above the cloth cornea, almost at the end of the junction with the cornea tissue in the crown, until the sickness goes down.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	And when it goes down, then distill hot water into the eye in which you mixed honey: or in water in which you already boiled Greek mustard and honey: then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	Section on the treatment of water that has descended into the eye, or cataract.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	I have already mentioned the types of water in division, and which are suitable for perforating the mouth, declare and explain them, then take this same according to its health.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then it is necessary for you to make the infirm sit down with his feet square between your hands, opposite the light, near the sun: and tie the sound eye of him, and string it: then pull the eyelid of his eye with your right hand, if the eye in which there is water is the left eye, or with your left hand if the eye is on the right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take with your right hand a maggot, if the eye is on the left: or with your left hand if the eye is on the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then place the end of the maggot near the corona by the size of the radius in the white eye that is apparent due to lachrymal: then push the maggot with force: and you will roll your hand with it, until it penetrates into the cornea of the eye: and you will feel that the maggot has now become effective for the vacuum.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary for the measurement of the maggot to be deep, the space from the pupil to the end of the black: and this is the corona of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You will see it in the very pupil of the vision of the eye, due to the clarity of the cornea layer.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then place the maggot up to the place where there is water.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press it down with your thumb one after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If then the water descends immediately, then the infirm will see this above what opens his eye at once, and the maggot in his eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then you will rest for a while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If then water descends, then place it secondly, except that it goes out through the magdula.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When then it is made, and does not rise: then take out the magdula with ease: and you turn your hand slightly.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve something from clear-colored stone-gem in water: and wash out the eye with it when it is tired.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then place the entire stop outside the eye, or a linen cloth smeared with rose oil, and a healthy eye: and tie it with the stop.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we, and those who are of our time, place cream over it with egg-white.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	What if it does not obey you to enter into the eye because of its hardness, for it is from a man whose eye is hard: then it is necessary to take saponaceous soap, which is called Alberid, whose form this is.
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Therefore when you join it with the same thing only, and not always with your hand in the hole: and it is not otherwise but to make a veil for a subtle magdula place.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the magdula, according to what we have said.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And at the end of your work, prepare a feeble sleeper in a fit state, who sleeps on his back in a dark house: and forbid all movements, and from shaking: and place the food of him by which his nature is soothed: and neither his right nor left hand will move.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let the bandage be according to its own arrangement until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then dissolve it in that dark house, and try the use of him: and make it see the thing.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligament up to the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary for him to do this at the time of treatment, or immediately after the incision: rather, he should leave it until later: for water rises quickly and forcefully through a weak stomach.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	If, however, an apoplexy occurs with a hot attack: then it is necessary to reduce the eye before the seventh day: and then to rectify it with what soothes the apoplexy until it is sated, and then to remove that viscus from his mouth, and place it on his face, where he is to be nursed for several days in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then he should gradually leave the house, and be admitted into his own cases.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And you know that the student is not excused from seeing a few times in the salve: for then he dares to supervise the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And already some of them have come to us who are from Alairach, who said that it was made in Alairach Mudan, where water is found.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	Indeed I have not seen anyone in your land who made this: nor have I read it in any of the old books: and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the forms of the species, as one stands above them who does not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made of pure air: and let their extremities be like this same triangular one, with an acute edge.
Formae magda.	Species of the magd.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	About the care of the flesh of the newborn in the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	When sometimes the flesh of the newborn is born in the nose, from which something is found that resembles the scorpion of many feet: and from this there is cancerous flesh, pavement, white color: and from this there is flesh that is not black color.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In this, therefore, of these flesh, which is not deceitful, nor cancerous, it is fitting that the infirm should be seated with its face opposite to yours, and have its nose opened, and a thorn removed from those flesh. Then take them to the outside, and cut off what you have taken with your nails, softly and sharply with one edge, until you know that all of it has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	If anything remains of it whose removal is not possible: then smooth that with one of the soft instruments, until nothing remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If, however, blood dominates you, or a hot blister occurs: then place it opposite as is appropriate: if it is from evil blisters, then immediately cauterize it, until the blood is removed, and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then it should be thrown into the nose after cutting, with vinegar and water, or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If, however, it opens the nose, and moisture proceeds from it to the palate, then you know that it is now healthy.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If, however, moisture does not penetrate, according to what is appropriate, then you know that there is flesh inside the nose, which does not become wet with the incision of the instrument.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then it is appropriate that you insert a thread of linen, which has some grossness, and nodes in it: and place the quantity of the finger between all the nodes: and let an infirm person hold the extremity of one thread in the nose with the radio, or with what is possible for him after he has made it similar to the other: and draw out the odorous one, until it reaches the cessation, and goes over the throat of it.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	Indeed, many children indeed resemble this Attomus in schools: and it is a matter easy for him who wishes it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the child's finger, one end that is going over the nose, and the other that remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then and also tie a string around the flesh with the nodes that are in the finger.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Do this until you know that the flesh is already with the nodes of the finger.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then pull out the thread: and put it into the nose after washing the blood linen which you drank in Egyptian ointment: do this for three days, or more, until the ointment has eaten up all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put the end of the thing into the nose a lead tube, for some days until it is cured.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however it requires care that dries up, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For the head wash, with which olives and other remedies are distilled, and those that are put into the nose: make it of silver or air: which is similar to a small lamp, open like a conch, and its opening is also like that.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you want to make a closed tube like a cane.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the conch of the instrument for head washing should be full and detected: which has a handle in the end thereof, with which you hold it, when you heat in it oil, or what you want to extract from burning things, and fluid substances.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	¶ About the care of Thelul's nose.
Caput XXV.	Head 25.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Many growths are born at the end of Thelul's nose, and they grow and increase with the days until a good appearance is made of it.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	Because of this, it is necessary to appear at the beginning of its appearance and remove all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then place over the place, or cauterization, or the medicine that is burning at its place.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If then the cut is delayed until it becomes prominent, then consider it, if it is made of stone, hard, reddish in color, few senses: then you do not touch it with iron: because it is a cicatrix of cancerous origin.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	Indeed you often see that the monastic cicatrix cuts, and it happens from it great malice to him who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the cicatrix is a gentle touch, not reddish in color, and you see that a cut is possible in all of it, then remove the weak one, and cut it without fear, without pain: and care for the place from which it extracts and constricts, until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	Regarding the closure of the nose, lips, and ears.
Caput XXVI.	Head 26.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You know that when a separation of continuity occurs in one of these cartilages, it does not benefit much from the operation, unless in some people.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore when something happens to someone from it, you should consider whether it is a recent wound with its own blood: and then gather the pain of the wounds with the suture: then care for it until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the separation of continuity in the lips has already occurred, and every part is made healthy: then it is necessary to remove all parts from their visible skin, until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then gather the two lips with the suture, and tie it, and cover the blood of the dragon with a powdered ointment, and place a piece of the pulverized ointment on the emplastrix diafinicon above the pus, and on the emplastrix of another person who has been consolidated: and release the tied lips after two or three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then dissolve it again, and mix the medicine: and let it be given until the threads are separated from each other by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with ointment, until it is healed.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	However, the method of the suture is to gather the continuous solution, or with a cushion, as we have described in the ventilation suture: or gather the solution with a thread, as I wanted to show you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	¶ On the extraction of gummata of the lips.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 25.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Indeed, many people have hard gums in the interior of their lips, similar to small thorns of plants: and some of them are smaller, and some are larger.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, it is necessary to make a cut in the lip, and wrap around all the gums of it, and hang it with a thread, and cut it from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place with a piece of gut after the cut is made, until the blood is separated.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then apply vinegar, and keep the place with it, where there is stitching, until the wounds are healed.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	¶ On the cut of the flesh above the gum.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter 28.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	Often a flesh is cut above the gum, which the ancients call abuluss.
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	Therefore, it is necessary to hang it with a thread, or to hold it with pincers, and cut it at the root of it, and let the healthy run away, or the blood.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then place on top of the place a piece of cut gut, or other stitching plasters, and dry them.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	That if the flesh returns to it after healing, because it often returns, then cut it again, and cauterize it: for it does not return after cauterization.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	The reason for teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter 29.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When the teeth are gathered on their surfaces from the inner and outer parts, and between the gums, sharp, rough, and sometimes blackened, and then become smooth and white, and yellowish, until the corruptness of that part reaches the gum, and then the teeth become ugly.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	Therefore it is necessary that you make the weak one sit down between your hands, and the head of it in your belly, and rub the molar and tooth, in which appear the barks, and such like sand: until nothing remains of them, and also do similarly with blackness, and whiteness, and yellowness, and others, until they become clean.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If then that which was at the beginning of the reason is removed, it is good: and if not, then you shall repeat the reason on the next day, the second, and the third, until at last the desire in him that you wish comes.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And you know that the tooth requires different forms and many figures of razors, according to which it is prepared by your operation: for the one which shaves the tooth from the lower part, is not the same as the one which shaves between the teeth, according to other forms.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of razors are prepared at hand, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	¶ About the extraction of tooth pain.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that you cure the tooth from its pain with all ingenuity, and then in its excision.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For it is not that the tooth supplies the body when it is extracted: because it is a substance that is high: until when there is no excuse for its excision, then it is necessary when you think to make the weak one extract it, so that it may be firm, and it may be certified to you the tooth painful.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For many reasons, the weak pain deceives the feeble-minded, and thinks that it is in the tooth of the gum and removes it: then the pain does not leave until the weak tooth is removed.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	We have already seen this from the operation of bloodletting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When the tooth itself is certified as painful to you, then it is necessary to scarify around the tooth with soot, in which there is some virtue, until the gum is loosened from all sides: then move it with your fingers or with the smallest pincers at first gently, until you stir it up.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place the large forceps good and firmly in that place, and the weak head between your thighs: which you have held well, so that it does not move: then pull the tooth according to its right direction, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If it does not come out, then take one of their instruments and introduce it under it from all sides with ease, and stir up its motion, as you have done at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	But if the tooth is perforated or corroded, then it is necessary to fill that hole with a piece of cloth: and tie it up with the fine ends of the ribbons, so that it does not break in the tightening of your forceps over it.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And you should be very careful with the scarring around the gum from all sides.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And watch your strength, so as not to break it, and there remains a part of it, and returns to the weakness of that malice which is the greater pain of its first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And be careful not to do this that unskilled bloodletters do in their haste and the bravery of their removal, beyond what we have mentioned.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	Many times they cause great injuries to the bodies of men, whose wounds are the most difficult to heal, and all the roots of which remain, or some of them: or such as remove it with some of the bones of the jaw: as we have often testified.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then follow the application of wine after its removal, or with vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	If blood flows from the wounds (for it often happens), then mix something from the zegi with the blood, and fill that place: and if not, cauterize the wound so that the zegi does not harm you.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The forms of the sharp-pointed hooves by which the tooth moves should be long at both ends, short in the middle, thick, so that they do not double when they press on the tooth: they should be like the hooves of oxen, until when you tighten them with them, they do not bend towards themselves, nor double: thin at both ends, and they should be made of iron or of the nail, or of such as are fit for the ends: and in their ends there should be teeth, some of which go into some, and tighten by a suitable constriction.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And sometimes they become like the end of the jaw of a bird called the cuckoo, and are strong in constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	¶ About the removal of the tooth, and the extraction of the bones of the lower jaw that have been broken off.
Caput XXXI.	Caput XXXI.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When something remains at the removal of the tooth which is broken off, then it is necessary to put over the place a poultice with honey once or twice a day until the place becomes soft: and then insert into it an iron or a nail, or such as are fit for the ends: whose ends are like the end of the jaw of a bird called the cuckoo.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	This is the form of the claw.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	Their extremities are made like a nail that has been cut: or like an aliskife.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If then it does not submit to your will at the end with these claws, you must then make a cut above the root, and remove the entire flesh, and insert the instrument called the small traction forceps, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	The ends should be short, rather large: and it should not be swollen, so as not to break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If then it goes out through the root with this, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to use other instruments of this form along with them.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The first end is triangular in shape, with some swelling in it.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The second end is triangular in shape, with a fine point.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	It can also be treated with this instrument that has two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with other instruments and tools that preceded in the nature of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	It can also be a swelling similar to the large uncino, with a triangular shape at the end, with some swelling, so as not to break: and it should not be swollen.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And you know that dental instruments are many: and likewise other instruments are not counted, and the wise artificer has found by himself the instrument, according to which it itself signifies the operation and the ailments themselves.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	For from the diseases it is made for which the ancients did not mention the instrument, due to the diversity of their types.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If then the bone breaks from the jaw, or from other bones of the face, or putrefies: then examine on it in the place where it is with that which suits it from the instruments and claws that I have said in the extraction of the root, and treat with it as you go along, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	As you gradually increase the size of something, it should be gently held or grasped by that part of the mouth until it emerges from the mouth, and then restore the place with appropriate medicines for this.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	However, if there is small bone putridity, then scrape it out of its own putrefaction, and care for it until it heals.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Regarding the cutting of prominent teeth above others.
Caput XXXII.	Head 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When teeth are prominent and do not follow their natural course, a monstrous form is formed: and especially when this happens in women and girls, that is, virgins.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore, you should consider this.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if the tooth is born after another tooth and is not placed or its cutting is possible, or its filing, then remove it: and if it is connected with another tooth, then cut it off with this instrument, which is of this form.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	This is a small face, and it is made from iron with sharp pointed ends.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And your cutting should be such that you cut into many days, and because of the hardness of the teeth, and so as not to disturb another tooth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	However, if the tooth is prominently exposed to its filing, then file it with a file of this form.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	The whole should be of iron, and the handle of the punch should be as small as the point of the spicules, with which the tooth is filed gradually over many days with ease, so as not to disturb the tooth, and fall off: then smooth it down, and finally scrape it off with some rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If the tooth from which a part breaks off and harms the tongue is, then it should be filed so that its filing also removes the roughness of that fragment, and makes it even: and it will flatten and not hurt the tongue, nor corrupt the speech.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	On the representation of the tooth with golden sons.
Caput XXXIII.	Chapter 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When an injury occurs to the anterior teeth due to a blow or accident, and the weak cannot hold onto it to prevent it from falling: and they are cared for with stimulant medicines, and the cure is not avoided: then the wisdom is that they should be fastened with a golden wire: because silver becomes shiny and rots after days, but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And the wire should be of medium thickness and size according to the amount that can be held between the teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the form of the representation is to take the wire, and insert it twice between two healthy teeth: then you should twist with two ends of the wire between the moving teeth, whether one or more, until inflammation with a cloth up to the other part of the sound tooth.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the twisting up to the part where you fell: and hold your hand with subtlety and wisdom, until it is not removed at all: and your binding should be such that when you fasten the wire at the roots of the teeth, it will not fall apart.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut off the excess ends of the wire with a knife: and gather them up, and turn them together with your hand: and hide them between the sound tooth and the moving tooth, so that they do not hurt the tongue: and then let it remain tight as long as it remains.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	But if it is loosened or falls off, fasten them with another wire, and let it remain tight for the whole time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the form of the tooth, and the representation of the two sound teeth and the two moving teeth, as you see.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes it happens that one tooth comes out, or two after a blow or accident in its place, and remains as we have described, and remains: and this is done only by the craftsman, wise, and experienced.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	When the bone spur once fits into the joint: it takes the form of a tooth and is placed in its place, from which the tooth is fastened and drawn tight, as I have said: and it remains, and serves for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Regarding the incision of the ligament that occurs under the tongue, and prevents speech.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XLII.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	When the ligament that occurs under the tongue is either natural, as it is when man is born, or accidental, from the bone that has already solidified.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation is to open the weak bones of his head in the groove of your groove, and to loosen his tongue: then incise this nerve-like ligament through its breadth, until it is freed from the retention of its own.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is any hard and knotty thing, and it is from the solidification of the bone: then pull out this knot, and find it by its breadth, until you incise the ligament, and the knot is loosened.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And be careful not to make a fissure in the deep flesh, and incise the artery there, and blood may flow out.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then you should rinse the wound with warm water, or with vinegar, or with cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then place a linen bandage under the tongue that will hold firm all night long, so that it does not strengthen afterward.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	If blood flows out, then place a poultice of ground barley over the place.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it does not stop the blood, then cauterize the place with a sharp caustic that is suitable for this: then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	Extraction of Ranula under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter 35.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	Whenever an aposteme occurs under the tongue, which resembles a small ranula, preventing the tongue from performing its natural function, and perhaps it becomes so swollen that it fills the mouth.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation is to open the mouth of the weak person before the sun: and consider the aposteme.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	If you see a dark or black, hard substance without the weak sense of the patient, then do not touch it, as it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it is inclined to whiteness with moisture, then insert the thumb into it and cut it with a soft soap, and free it from all sides.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If blood does not come out of your mouth during the operation, then place something finely ground on it until the blood is absorbed, and then return to your operation and take it out with the rest of its complement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then wash it with vinegar and salt, and take care of it further according to the situation, until it heals.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	Cure of two breasts.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	Whenever two breasts occur in the throat, that is, glands that resemble cotton, which occur in the deformed: and they are called two Amigdalae: when you care for them with what I said in division and they do not heal, then consider.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If the aposteme is hard, dark, and few senses, then do not touch it with iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if it is red in color and the root of it is thick, then do not touch it with iron, even fearing the flow of blood, I mean let it go, until it matures.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	Then you will either pierce it yourself: or it will break by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	If it is of a white color, round, and its root is fine: then it should be cut.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation should be made in it, as you consider before its own operation, if the hot aposteme is quietly completed, or if it is about to diminish by some reduction: then let the weak one sit before the sun, and the head of it should be in your groove: and open its mouth, and take it with your hands, and cut its tongue downwards with the instrument whose form this is.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver or air, which is as fine as a dagger.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When you cut its tongue with it, and the aposteme is shown to you, and it falls on top of your used one: then take a garter, and wind it around the breast, and pull it out as far as you can, beyond what you take with it from the shirt.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with the instrument whose form follows this one.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It will resemble thorns: but the ends of them are sharp, so that the orifice of each of them is in the direct acute angle of the other: therefore take care that it is made of iron, or alfuled which drinks up.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this instrument is not present, then cut it with the spatula whose form is this one.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	It should be sharp on one side, and not on the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut the first breast, cut the second one in the same way as the first one.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then after the cut, gargle the weak one with cold water, or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If blood flows to it, gargle with water in which the bullits of the cortices are boiled, or myrtle leaves and such like from stiptics, until the blood flow stops: then take care of it until it is healed.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	When certain stones are born in the throat, other than the two amber ones.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Therefore, it should be cut according to what I said about the incision of two amber ones equally.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I indeed had already treated a woman who had given birth to a stone between the gullet that was drawn towards the throat, which was nearly closed by the gullet: and the woman was breathing through a narrow opening, and had forbidden him food and drink: and she had almost reached death, if it had lasted one day, or two days.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the stone rose so much that it emitted two branches, until they came out through the two nostrils.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	I therefore acted promptly and fixed one of them firmly.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I drew it out, and a large portion came out of it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off where I could comprehend from the nostril opening.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I made that which came out of the other nostril opening.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth and pressed her tongue: and then fixed the pin in it: then I cut out a portion from it, and it did not run out but only a little blood: the woman's throat was therefore freed, and she began to drink water immediately, and then took from the food.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	Therefore, I did not cease to cut into that stone for a long time: and the stone was in the place where I was cutting it, until it had become too long and with this one.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I therefore made an incision and cauterized the stone between the gullet.
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	It stood still after the addition: then I walked on from that part, and do not know what God did with it after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	Translation: "Regarding the incision of the ulcer.
Caput XXXVII.	Translation: "Chapter 37.
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	Translation: "When catarrh descends to the ulcer, and incises it, and is long: then it is called a vertical incision. And if it is in the lower part, which is fatty and round, then it is called a boil.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	Translation: "When the treatment is made with what I mentioned in the division, and it does not agree with the cure: and you see that the incision is hot and has left it, and is fine: then it is necessary to make a new incision.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	Translation: "And what is collected from it, which is round and does not have a length, and is bloody, or of a yellow or black color, and does not have a sense: then it is necessary to remove that incision.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	Translation: "For there is fear in the weakest part.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Translation: "Therefore, when you see it according to the way I said from whiteness and its length, make it sit on the weak part before the sun: and press the tongue of it with the instrument which precedes the narration, then take a thread in the ulcer, and draw it down: and cut it with one of the two instruments I mentioned in the incision of two clavicles.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	Translation: "And it is necessary to cut from it unless that which is added above the natural end without addition.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	Translation: "For if you cut from it more than that, you will harm the tongue and the speech.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Translation: "Then after the incision, use the one that we mentioned in the incision of two clavicles: and take care of it until it is healed.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	Translation: "But if the weak is afraid of the incision, then it is necessary to use your skill in cauterization without fear and gently.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	The method of cauterization is not used in this case unless with sharp water: and it is that you place the weak head in your intestine.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned earlier.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take the water I told you about from the cauterization chapter, and with the unextinguished foot of the calf, confine it with it, not thick, nor thin, and fill out this form of the instrument whose shape is this.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	The extremity where it is placed should be as the connection of the radius of the cochlea.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on top of it: and the weak one should be lying on its side, so that saliva from its mouth flows out naturally from the medicine, so that nothing falls from it into its throat and harms it.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And then take it from the first part of it in the middle of the hour, so that you can see it already faded and settled by the medicine's bitterness.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you want to take the gut, and place it on the extremity of the radius, and pour the gut with the medicine, and insert the radius with the gut into the cannula from below, until the gut adheres to the side.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Do this many times, until you find out what you want from cauterization.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then let it go: for it itself will burn and fall after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	If you need to take the medicine again, take it again: and after cauterization, wipe around the wound with the gut drunk with butter, and cleanse with it what is around it from the medicine: and rinse with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	When it is external and there is an abscess, and when it is internal and there is a gargle, until it is healed.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	Therefore, this method of treatment is more beneficial than an incision and less frightening.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And when the ulcer is treated along with it that which is more subtle than cauterization and incision, it is treated with suffocation, according to this method.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take calamite, hyssop, origanum, rue, sage, chamomile, and burdock, and similar herbs of these: and gather them all, or some of them in a pot, and put them in vinegar, and let them boil: and the pot be cleansed with cleanliness: and let the hole in the pot be over which the instrument of the sharp knife be composed according to this manner.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver or of iron: and the end that is extremity, where the gold is, be inserted into the weak tooth, until the vapour ascends to the ulcer over the hole, until the ulcer becomes much obscured.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then go over the same place many times, until it is consumed.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And be careful not to do this treatment at the beginning of the attack with abscesses.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	For plasters are added to the abscess, and it is not appropriate to do this unless you are at the decline of the hot abscess.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	If this instrument is not present to you, then take the vinegar and put the end of the bark in it: so that the weak tooth may not be burned: for the bark of the oui prevents the vapour from burning the tooth: and this is good for the cure of health.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	¶ About the extraction of thorns and bones from the mouth.
Caput XXXVIII.	Head 38.
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	Many things stick in the throat, either a fish bone, or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Therefore, it should be removed that which appears on it over which it falls, after having placed the tongue with the instrument at the sun, and it will be declared to you what is in the throat.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make a human being before the food is digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	Perhaps the thing attached by vomiting will escape.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or perhaps the weak one swallows the dry piece of the root, or the root of the lettuce, or swallows a small piece of dry bread: or takes a dry piece of marine seaweed soft, and then ties it in a thread and swallows it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	When therefore it becomes wet at the place where the bones or the teeth are, and it is withdrawn, then it will go out.
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If it does not go out with that which I said, then use the instrument from the second leg according to this form.
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	It should be larger than the radius but with a slight curve at its end, so that it can easily insert into its own throat with facility, and it should have its own head elevated upward.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let it be careful of its own epiglottis so that it does not happen to it a fit, and it pushes with it the tongue or the bone or inserts it itself with its own hand.
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	Indeed, if the weak one inserts it, this is better: because of its knowledge of the location of the thing attached: and it pushes down or pulls up with its own hand using the instrument, all of it according to the quantity that is prepared for it until it goes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	¶ About the extraction of bloodletting.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter XXXIX.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When treating a blood-letting wound with the remedy I mentioned during division and not curing it, consider its effects on the weakened mouth before the sun, whether at noon or after speaking its language with the instrument I will show you.
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If your habit falls upon the blood-letting wound, remove it with a small beard, or with a gentle gesture.
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If that is not possible with them: then take a cannula with a sharp point, and insert it into the weakened throat as far as the throat: then insert a heated iron into the cannula's opening.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this often: and let the weakened one avoid water all day long.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let them drink a full glass of cold water, and open their mouth into it: and wash their mouth with it, and do not swallow anything from it: and repeat this process once an hour after another with their own hand.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For the blood-letting wound will fall when it tastes the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	If it does not follow what we have described, then smoke the weakened one with incense, or with ashes using the instrument I will show you in smoking.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this often, for it will fall.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in smoking is to take a pot, in which the old woman's prunes are with fire: and the pot should be covered with a cover, in whose middle there is a hole: and the end of the instrument is placed in that hole.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then let them blow the smoke, and have the weakened one open their mouth at the end of the cannula, and close it so that it does not fall out of the smoking until you know that the smoking has already reached the blood-letting wound.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	The bloodletting immediately yields.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not yield, then repeat the fumigation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And the weak one endures the thirst, and eats salt, and honey, and does not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore, it is necessary to go out with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument with which bloodletting is taken out of the stomach, when it yields above the used one.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is like claws, as you see: unless because this thirst which is inserted into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And the end of it is similar to the beak of the owl, which is called the "gallinago," in which there is rough fingers: when it grasps something, it does not let it go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	¶ About the opening of the Aposteme, and their section, and care in general.
Caput XL.	Chapter 40.
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	The species of the Aposteme are many, of various kinds, according to which rememoration they come, that is, one and one in this book: and they are diverse in their perforation and section of them from two ways.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	One of them is of the kind of Aposteme itself, and that which comprehends from moisture.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second mode is for the places where it happens to the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For the Aposteme that happens in the head is another from the Aposteme that happens in the anus: and the Aposteme that happens in a fleshy place is another from the Aposteme that happens in joints: and each of them is judged according to its operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And from the Aposteme there are those which it is not fit that they should be perforated, unless after the maturation of the sore in them, and the complement of it: and from them there are those which it is necessary that they should be perforated, while they are raw, and do not mature according to the complement.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	As the appointed ones who are nearby with joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	Because when an appointed one happens near the joint, and it is prolonged to be there, until it putrefies that which is in its surrounding, perhaps the ligaments or nerves of his joint are corrupted, therefore the cause of the contraction of his member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or is the appointed one at the main member: for if you delay the piercing of it, until it is ripe, it will hurt either him or through that principal member.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or is near another, therefore the member itself is not ripe: and it is not fitting that you pierce a putrefied one, not fully digested, unless it is near another, so that it does not putrefy deep, and extends to the inner parts of it, and a fistula is made, or in the end of it, which is not cured.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the hour of the piercing of the appointed one, which is ripe according to the complement: and it is near sedation of the pain, recession of the fever, and diminution of the rubedness, and pulsation of the head apostema, and the rest of the signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	And it is necessary that you make the same piercing in the lower part of the appointed one, and more prominent eminence: and the piercing should be wanding in the length of the body, if the appointed ones are in parts of hands and feet, and of fingers, and of strings, and of strings, and of nerves, and of arteries, and at the last in all equal places where there is no reflexion.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	In those that reflect, wand with the piercing according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	When the appointed one is in flesh: then it is better that you let pass the piercing of it, until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to the complement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	Since you pierce it before that, the course will be prolonged for a long time from it, and there will be many fouls and bitterness, and perhaps its lips will become hardened, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some piercings are made according to the body's breadth at the time of need: or according to that which the member requires.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	It is necessary to make the piercings in the pubic region with a small perforation, and in the larger ones with a large perforation: or make many sections according to the size of the piercing.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And they are from the piercings where it is necessary to cut the skin: and it is applied when the skin is already like a cloth, and it is applied at the end when it is already dead: just as that which happens in many cases, such as the nipples, and the bubons.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And from them there are those that are cut with a section having three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And from them there is one, according to which it is applied like the figure of the myrtle leaf.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	Just as the pubic piercings.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And from them there are those in which a round section and a lunar section are applied: and similar ones are made from these sections.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	However, if it does not have a head, like the surface piercings, it is necessary to pierce it with a superficial perforation, or only flat.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	And it is necessary when the piercing is large, and it has already collected a lot of healthy tissue, and it pierces it, so that not too much pus is taken out at once: in fact, take out that part of it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then fill the piercing up to another day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then take out some pus again.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Perform this frequently according to the gradation, until it goes out: especially if the person is weak in bodily strength, or a pregnant woman, or a young child, or an old man with decrepit bones: for the animal spirit, being resolved from one animal to another on going out through the sore, may perhaps cause the death of the weak one, and you may not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore, this chapter requires great caution.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	And then, after your perforation, which you made with the apostemata for this purpose, it is necessary to cleanse the wound: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If then the wound is small from the apostemata, or if it is a flat section, then apply a linen bandage, or an old hat.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if the wound is large, and there are many perforations, then it is necessary to insert a bandage into all the fissures until they become moist.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if in the wound you have cut away a part of the skin, or have cauterized it around: then it is necessary to fill it with an old hat, or as when the cloth is tied, or when the hair of linen is combed without moisture: and tie it up until the third day.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take it out, and care for it with the ointment, until it is cured.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	But if blood flows in your operation, then apply cold water and vinegar, after the cloth has absorbed it: and place it over the place where the blood flow is great.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	But if the flow of blood persists, then it is necessary to give a regimen and treatment, and plasters, which I have mentioned in many places of this our books, and by division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	But if it is in the winter season, and the wound is of many nerves: then it is necessary to apply plasters with wine, and hot oil: and place them over the places.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	If it is summer and the area is fleshy: then you should put poultices made with water and oil, or wine and oil, and all of this should be cold.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	When the third day comes, as we have said, then you should dissolve the style, cleanse it, and administer to its treatment what is suitable for it until it recovers.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the knowledge of the surgery of the style generally.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	According to the second division, as I have said about every style, how it is to be used for its treatment, specifically in this case.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	¶ About the section of the style that happens on the scalp.
Caput XLI.	Head 41.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Styles that happen on the scalp are small and come from the species of Nodulus, which are found in the clothes made of these shells, which are like the husks of grapes.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their species is many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Among them are fat ones: and among them are those that contain like moisture as of the limbs: and among them are those that contain like the moisture of flints and pellitory: and such as these, and among them are those that are hard like stones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the whole section, and there is no fear of its extraction, while it does not cause any contrariety in the artery at its own section.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their section is as you will find it with the instrument which comes after this, called the Intromissive, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	For if it is that which contains moisture, then you should dry it in the section according to the length of the surface section, in this form.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And begin with the section from line b to line g. And when the moisture is evacuated, then you scrape off the chalk which contains that moisture, and do not let anything pass through it.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	Many times it returns, if something remains from it.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then immerse the stomach in Egyptian ointment, if it is present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill the belly with it, and let it go until the next day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For it will itself corrode that remains from the box.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then go over the stomach with Egyptian ointment a second and third time, and if you need it, until you trust that nothing will remain from the box, then care for the belly with the ointment until it is healed.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	If the aposteme contains a red node, then cut it according to this form, with a cross-shaped section: and pull out the hairs between the two sections of the section, and rub it all over: and trust in your virtue in extracting the tunic that contains it.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If the artery causes you contrariness, then do what I will tell you after.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And similarly, do in the aposteme if it is of stone, according to the section and care that I mentioned earlier.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the section over the stone aposteme is easier: because it is few in blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some of these aposteme in the head of certain men, where there is no moisture at all.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	That is: because I followed over the aposteme in the head of a young woman, and found an aposteme like a hard, solid, rough, white stone, which could not be broken: and if it is pricked with anything while being pulled out, it wounds itself.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	In others however, accidents in the head of the aposteme, except for these aposteme that happen in the heads of children, and among the roots of gold, the section of all of them is a superficial section.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	Either cut off their nails from below, always from the lower part of their nails, so that the course of the sanies might flow downwards.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then attend to it with caution, as it may harm them in their treatment.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	§ Section on the Stripped Throat in the Neck.
Caput XLII.	Chapter 42.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These abscesses often occur in the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes in other parts of the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And those that occur above them in the neck are few, and many; they are caused by the cold: and every Strophula of them is within the patient's own clothing, just as is the case with nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have said.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the species of these abscesses are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	For they are made up of stone: and some of them are dry: and some of them are malignant, and do not obey treatment.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In that which appears to be a good abscess in the skin, of which the color of the skin is manifestly close to it, and moves over all parts, and is not annexed to the neck muscles, nor to the jaw, nor to the artery, nor is deep: it is necessary to cut it out superficially from the upper part down to the lower part of the body, along line b. to line g., and scrape it off from all parts: and extend two lips of the skin with the beard, or with many beards, if you desire that, as we said in the abscesses of the head, and draw it out a little at a time.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And it is over the cauterant, so that it does not come into contact with the mind, or the nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And it should be rough but not sharp: so that it does not add to your hand when you make the incision, or disturb the weak, and you cut where you do not need to.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If you happen to injure a vein, an artery, or prevent yourself from performing the operation, then place the cut end of a piece of reed in the vulna, or some children who cut blood vessels, and tie the vulna, and let it go until the sharpness of the splinters has subsided and the vulna has become soft, or begins to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	For blood is now flowing, then return to your operation, until you have completed it.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then, with your finger, inquire if anything remains of the Strophuli among the others: then cut those, and clean them.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If the wen in the root of the Strophula is large, then it is necessary not to cut that Strophula from its root: rather, it is necessary to bind it with a strong thread doubled, and let it go until it falls on its own without causing any harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the old vulna with the Egyptian ointment that you have already submerged.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of it yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the entire Strophula is cut, then it is necessary to gather the two lips of the wound together, and stitch them immediately, after which you should see that there is no surplus.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If you see that there is surplus due to the size of the Strophula, then it is necessary to consider cutting its root and taking it out, and apply the stitch I mentioned.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And if it contains humidity from the Strophula, make a superficial puncture in it: so that you can see the place of its maturity for you: and place the puncture below the body as I said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then apply the hair after the puncture with ointment, and similar to it, so that what remains of corruption may rot until you see the vulna already clean: then take care of it with the ointment generated by the flesh, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	Sectioning the Epiglottis near the stoma in the throat.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The ancients performed this sectioning on the epiglottis, and I have not found anyone in our land who has done this. This is a record of their speech.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	However, in those who have synchondrosis, it is necessary to avoid sectioning the epiglottis: because if there is no inflammation through this, it is because all the veins and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	However, in those who have hot synchondrosis in the mouth, or throat, or both, when there is no inflammation in the arytenoid cartilages, it is necessary to use sectioning of the epiglottis to avoid destruction that comes from prefecture.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we want to do this, it is necessary to make a small incision in the epiglottis under three circles of the epiglottis, or four, using a circular motion in the area that is between the two circles, not in the cartilage: and this is a suitable place for sectioning, because it is fatty and the blood vessels are far from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the physician is timid, then it is necessary to extend the skin of the throat with a retractor.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he finds the skin, until he becomes wet with the air: he avoids the blood vessels, if he sees anything in them.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he sews the sifac that we have described: and this signifies above the cut in the bronchus, when it comes out of it with that which is broken off, and by abscission of the tongue.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And release the groin at some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When therefore the hour comes that you fear prefecture, gather together the two lips of the skin wound, and take it alone without the cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then administer medicines that bring forth the flesh until it is healed.
Inquit Albucasis.	Albucasis said.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	The sum of this discourse, which we have related, is not an explanation, unless they understand that some of these apostemata have already weakened the infirm gullet: and the weak one has risen above death, and desires to be separated from the pain of its death: they apply to cut the epiglottis, so that the weak one may breathe above the place of the wound with a certain breathing, and be saved from death: and for this reason they were commanded to leave the open wound unstitched, until the malice of the disease has consumed it, and the malice of the disease is three days old, and almost itself: then, therefore, they were commanded to close the open wound and care for it, until it is healed.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I saw through me, that one maid received a sword and sent it with her throat, and it fell with her into the part of the lung's canal.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to care for it, and I found it hissing, as is the hiss of the dead.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	Therefore, I removed the wound from the gut, and found blood that had issued from the small wound.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	Therefore, I was confident that it had not closed the wound, nor cured it: and the air was escaping from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	Therefore, I quickly applied to it and cared for it, until it is healed: and nothing happens to the maid, unless there is a rushing in the throat: and she returned after days to a better disposition of herself.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	Therefore, I say that there is no fear in the section of the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	¶ About the Section of Gut Hernia.
Caput XLIIII.	Head XLIII.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This Hernia of the Neck is a large ailment, according to the color of the body: and it is very common in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it occurs in two ways: either it is natural, or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly not in the natural case.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	The accidental one is according to two modes: one of which is similar to small pendulous tumors.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	The other mode is similar to the hernia that occurs from the nodulation of the artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And there is fear itself, and it is not proper to make an assumption about it with iron, unless it is in the small one: and you examine it yourself, and investigate it when you insert.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If then you find it similar to the small pendulous tumor, and it is not suspended with any strings: then dry it, as is done with the nodules: and remove it along with whatever is contained in the purse, if it is in the purse: and if not, then examine the whole of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the place with what is necessary for healing until it is cured.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	§ On the Section of the Species of Nodules.
Caput XLV.	Head XLV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many species of nodules, and I have already mentioned all the species of these in division: and it is necessary to point out the difference between the nodule and the exit: as there is a doubt about it.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say that when the exit is heat, and fever, and severe pains, until the ebullition of the superfluous boiling is extinguished, and the putridity is completed: then the fever and heat are quiet.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	But when the nodule is not heat, nor fever, nor pain, and it contains them in the purse of sifachin which is their own sack, and it is according to the color of the body: and it is like the chestnut, and it is like the hatchet, and it is greater and smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	They are of two kinds: either they are fatty, or they retain moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	The colors of moisture are many, as I said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore, when dealing with swelling for treatment of Nodi, you should first try it out and then look into the instrument called Intromissive, according to its form in the chapter that follows this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of inspection is as follows for all Nodi: take this instrument and insert it into a moister place that you find in the apostemate: and then rotate your fingers with it gradually, until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then take the last hand of yours according to the measure of the apostemate's size.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then take out the Intromissive and look at what goes into the wound.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If it runs out with moisture of any color, then cut it off at the surface section, according to what I said in the others apostemates.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if it does not run out with moisture in the wound of the Intromissive, then you know that it is fatty. Then cut off the section with a cross-shaped form, according to the form I showed you: and suspend it with thongs, and exfoliate the skin from all parts with ease: and guard the kistin if you can, so as to take out the healthy one with the Nodi.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	But if the kistin is broken at the operation and it is not possible to take out the healthy one, often this happens, then take it piece by piece until nothing remains of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if a little remains of it, or much, the Nodi return according to the most.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	If it does not heal you, and there remains a little of it: then fill the wound at the completion of your operation with some sharp-edged children's thorns, and tie them up, and put above it the hot apostemate, and care for it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If then the knot is large, then its two lips, and care for it with it that it perishes.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If then the contrary evil is a small one, or not small: then at once, and fill the place with a sharp point, and release it tightly for two days, or three, until the wound putrefies, and rests in the ebb of the blood: then return to incise the remainder of that knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	¶ About foreign instruments for cutting and perforating.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter 46.
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	Of these there are three kinds: and they are of three species.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	For these are large, and one is medium, and one is small.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let them be made of steel quadrants, with sharp ends, so that they may quickly enter the apostemates.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	And these are the forms of instruments for exploration and no, that is, for perforating: and one of them is called borer, that is, a piercer: and they are of three species.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	For these are large, and one is medium, and one is small.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They come together, so that they may explore through them the apostemates, and exits, and fistulas, and bones from which it is between them.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are round, thin, soft, like a large needle, which sit on carpets, either of citrine, or of air, or of iron, or of silver.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And the better of these are those which are made of citrine.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And they are also instruments of lead black, which come together so that they may explore the fistulas, whose reflectivity is such that they reflect with the lenity of their own reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	There are indeed three kinds again.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For they are either long, or medium, or short, according to the size of the fistula and its stricture.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	The form of the ninth, and they are many kinds.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For there are among them simple ones, that is, those of a single stricture: and they are three kinds as you see, the Great, the Medium, and the Small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And there are among them the blind of the ninth: and they are three kinds.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And there are among them the ones with two strictures: and they are three kinds: and there are also those with three strictures: and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the forms of the scalpel blades, by which the roots of the thorns, and the spines are cut off and stripped: and they are three kinds: for there are among them a great, a medium, and a small one.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities by which the section is made are sharp, while their other extremities are not sharp: and they are not placed thus, except when with them there is a stimulus for the stripping of the thorns in fear of the incision, or of the nerve: and so that it may heal by these, and find tranquility rather than what it finds at the stripping of the spines.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are the Mada, and they are of three kinds.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made of metal, and they are like the Rhodium, when alcohol is made: and at the wide end there is a hidden point of Spatumilis: and it runs to the inside and the outside, whenever you wish, just as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The form of the Spatumilis which is hidden between the fingers at the time of the spine stripping: and they do not perceive it with the weak: and they are three kinds, a great, a medium, and a small one.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The three kinds of winds that are cut off with blood flow are: the large, medium, and small ones.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	May they be made from air or saffron, round, and of about the same length as you see, and they should be fine.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these kinds of winds be at your disposal: the large and small ones, so that you can cut off blood flow with them in case of need, and then when there is no medicine present.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, you will not use them in all parts of the body for blood cutting, and you will only use them in places where there is flesh: such as the thighs, hips, shoulders, breasts, mammary glands, and vaginas, and urethras, and groins, and similar parts, from the thighs of flesh, moist.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And sometimes they become small instruments of the same kind as the fistulas of the flesh, according to their shape: which cut off blood when it flows from the site of phlebotomy, or at the incision of the vein, or artery: and sometimes they become round according to this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	¶ About the care of human breasts that resemble those of women.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter 47.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	Sometimes the breasts of some men swell up when they reach the complement of sleep (that is, when they start to pollute in sleep) until they are like the breasts of women: and they remain infected with the poison.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Therefore, if he abhors this, it is necessary to apply the moon's section to the breasts according to this shape from the line b to the line g, and then to rub off the grease entirely.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Afterwards, fill the wound with medicated gut.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather the two lips of the wound with the suture, and care for it until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If the nipple leans towards the lower parts and becomes soft due to its size, like in women: then it should be divided into two equal parts on the upper sides, each containing a lunar figure, of which one is contained within the other at the edges of both, until the larger line encompasses the smaller, according to this form from line b to line g. Then scrape off the skin that lies between the two lips and remove the moisture, and apply what I have mentioned about the suture and buttons, which is necessary for the cure, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If the incision does not cover the part that needs to be cut because of weakness or due to the flow of blood: then it should be filled with a wound ointment under the scalp, and released until the remaining part is cut by dryness.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	¶ Regarding the puncture of the stitch, which happens under the Titillus.
Caput XLVIII.	Head 48.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These stitches that happen under the Titillus are hard species of Strophulus, which contain buttons, and some of them have moisture.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Therefore, those that have moisture among them should be cleaned with the lunar figure according to this form, from line b to line g, when the entire part that is in the puncture from the wound has been discharged, then fill it with the old ointment under the scalp, and release it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the dressing is removed and the wound is cared for with a suitable ointment until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the abscess is of the nature of the Strophula thorn, then cut down upon it as we have said in the section on Strophulas, equally.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	However, if the finger is extended in this way to let out the pus, then apply cauterization in that place as we have said in that which has been said about that which was previously mentioned.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	¶ Regarding the section of the abscess that occurs due to the artery and vein.
Caput XLIX.	Head 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When the artery is torn and the skin that is above it consolidates, a great abscess often occurs thereafter: and so does the vein also, as does the inflammation in that abscess.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it is known that the abscess and inflammation are due to the artery and vein are: for when the abscess is due to the artery, it is long, gathered in the deep part of the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel as if there is a cracking in it.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And that which is due to the vein is round in the manifest part of the body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the section above this abscess is an error, and particularly that which is under the scales, and in the groins, and in the neck, and in many parts of the body: and it is a great pain.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, it should be neglected with iron, and that even if it is in the extremities or at the head, it should be neglected.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	Therefore, above that which is from the inflammation of the artery's opening, find in the skin section in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with the rings, then the artery: and free it from the clothes, until it is exposed.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert the knife under it, and make it penetrate to the other side, and tie the artery with double thread in two places, according to what I taught you in the extraction of two arteries that are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then press the place which is between the two ligatures with sand, until all the blood that is in it comes out, and dissolves the aposteme.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then apply the dressing which generates pus, until the ligatures fall: then cure it with suitable ointments until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If it is an aposteme due to the section of the vein, then it is necessary for you to hold your hand with which you can possibly take out the aposteme with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert the knife under the place where you held with your hand, and make it penetrate: and there should be a double thread in it, until it is taken out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then tie the aposteme with the same good ligature: according to what I told you in the good gauze ligature, with two parts from two ends of the thread.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If however you fear that the thread will be taken out, then insert the knife another one with another thread completely at the incision of the needle: press, and tie your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then cut the aposteme in the middle of it, until when it comes out that is in it: then cut the excess skin, and let what is tied out from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put on top of it a little ointment which you dipped in the wine.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then apply the dressing which is made with laver and ointments until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.
Caput L.	Caput L. (This is the Latin term for "Chapter L".)
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportit ut inuadatur cum ferro.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Fortasse enim accidet contractio.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Et si ergo est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uolnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanatur.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.
Caput LI.	Caput LI. (This is the Latin term for "Chapter LI".)
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	The root is fine and delicate, and their head is coarse and their lips are crossed.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And it is small from them, and it is from them that the beauty is exaggerated.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	Indeed, I have already seen a man, and within his belly were two thyme leaves, which were more than similar foods: there was no difference between them, white and small roots, and their lips moved, and they were moist throughout.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	Therefore I touched it and found in the weight of one almost 18 and 8 ounces and in the other almost 6 ounces. The operation in their incision is, as you see now, if the humid is weak, and the color of the thyme leaves is white, moist, and delicate root: then touch it with a slightly damp sponge side, and let your cauteries be present in the fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For much blood is expelled at the cutting of this section: therefore if you do not bleed, then cauterize it.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	If you see a weak and timid man after the cutting with iron, then take a thread from the plumb made in accordance with what I have said, and string it with it, which is called athelul: whose mode I have mentioned, and release it for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the plumbing of the plumb.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	You do not stop stringing the plumb until it is no longer pressed into the thyme leaves, until it is cut off, and falls without effort.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	If however the thyme leaves are coarse and rooted, then there is some fear and weakness in the cutting of this section: especially in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	Nevertheless, it may be possible to touch the middle of it.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize it, so that it does not return.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of it itself, until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And beware lest you presume to touch the spot that is of a wheat color, few senses, unpleasant appearance: for it is in reality a cancerous growth, and I am speaking after reflection on Cancer after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	¶ On the care of the prominence of the umbilicus.
Caput LII.	Head LXXII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	It is caused by many causes in the umbilicus.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from fissures of the umbilicus that are above the ventrum, and it exits through the althub, or the intestine, according to which happens in the others ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from blood that flows out of the vein, or from the artery, according to which was first mentioned.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from the congestion of the ventrum in it.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If however it is due to the fissure of the umbilicus and the exit of thirbi, then the color is similar to that of the body's color, and it is soft, without pain, and appears with various sites.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the exit of the intestine, then the site of it is with that which we have mentioned, with a more pronounced diversity.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When therefore you press it with your fingers, it is hidden: then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound at that time: and it is greatly magnified among the introduction of the bath and the labor of the weary.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If however it is due to moisture, it is soft, and it is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is it contracted, nor is it added.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	What if it is due to blood, then with these signs appears the apostema to blackness from the clitoris.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If however it is due to the flesh that is born, then it is apostema gray, heavy, hard, and appears according to the quantity of one.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If indeed it is due to its wetness, then its touch is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in that case is, as you consider, if the prominence of the umbilicus is due to blood in the Artery, or Vein, or wetness: then it is necessary for you to prevent its treatment.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For there is fear and weakness, as I told you in the chapter where I said that abscesses are due to the Artery and Vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	If the prominence of the umbilicus is due to the intestine or gut: then it is necessary for you to precede the weak one, until he holds his thirst and stands firm extended.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then signs with the encaustic around the whole umbilicus.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then order him to rise up between your hands on his back.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then surround it with a mixture of soap on the place where you marked with the encaustic.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the abscess to the upper part, with a large uncino.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then tie it around the strong part with thread, or with a cord of silk, and make the knot firm: and let the node of the ligature be in the flesh.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the abscess extended above the ligament.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If then you find it already taken out from the ligament: then take out the node by the flesh, and insert your finger indicated, and press the intestine into the interior of the belly: and if you find the gut: then take it with a uncino and cut off its excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If however the opposite is to you the Artery or Vein: then surround it much.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles and insert two strong threads into them: and insert two needles in the circumference which you made around the abscess in the form of a cross, which you make penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tie the aposteme in four places on the needle: and if you will, take away the needle, and leave the place, until the stretched flesh putrefies: and it will fall of its own accord: or it may fall when it is made thin and putrid.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with the ointment until it is cured.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the protuberance of the umbilicus is from the fatty flesh in it, or from moisture: then it is necessary to cut the aposteme as I have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And draw out the blood, or the moisture that I find in it.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then take care of it with the ointment until the place is healed.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	¶ Regarding the treatment of cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter 35.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	I have already spoken of the division of the species of cancer, and how it is useful for its treatment with remedies: and it must be taken into account when treating it with iron so that it does not ulcerate: and I have said that cancer generated in the womb, and the caution against its treatment.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that when cancer is in a place where its removal is possible, just as the cancer which is in the breasts, or in the thigh, and such like, from the situated members to extract the whole of it: especially when it is beginning male.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	But when it becomes old and large, it does not need to be near it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	I myself could not cure anyone from it: nor did I see anyone before me who had been cured of it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it when it is situated as I have said, is as I have already mentioned, and dissolves the weakness from black vomit repeatedly.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then if you find a phlebitis with the apparent fullness:
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then make the patient ready for the preparation, in which the operation will take place.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then excise the warts that are close to him.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Afterwards, remove the entire growth from all sides according to the incision, until nothing remains of its roots: and let blood flow freely, and do not cut it off rashly, but clearly mark the limits, and wipe away the bloody fluid with your own hand, or with whatever is available near the instrument.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	However, if the flow of thick blood from the incision of the artery or vein occurs against your will, then cauterize the wound until the blood is exhausted.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with the rest of the treatment, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	¶ Regarding the treatment of hydrops.
Caput LIIII.	Head 135.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already described the division of species hydrops, and how the aggregation of water occurs, as well as the signs of all kinds and the treatment of it with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And those that are treated with iron are not except for the single species of aculeatus, and do not approach with iron the species of timpanite, nor the nearly mortal species of hyposarcia, because it is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this species of hydrops timpanite with medicines and your treatment did not include it, then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	For if the patient has already been weakened by the illness, or if there is another infirmity with it, such as tussis or watery discharge, and similar to these: then be careful not to treat it with iron, because that is the fear.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	However, if you see an infirmity of excessive vigor, there is not only illness with it apart from hydrops, and it is not a child nor an old man: then the mode of the operation in him is, that you remove the infirm one standing between your hands, and the minister after it presses his breath on its inferior part of the beard.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then receive a sponge-like spongy one, according to this form.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Let it have two sharp parts, long, and sharp at both ends, like a sponge-like one.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	However, there should be a slight thinness in it, so that you do not pierce through it with the operation up to the intestine, and hurt it.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the generation of Hydriosis is from the intestines, then it is necessary to extend it with the cut at the umbilicus, in a quantity of three fingers, downwards in direct ratio above the chest.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	If indeed, the generation of Hydriosis is due to the suffering of the breast: then your cut should be left at the umbilicus, in three fingers.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of this is due to the spleen: then the cut should be made on the right side: and it is not necessary that the cut should also be on the right side over which you want to place the weak one, so that superfluities do not run to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then perforate with the tool the entire cut.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then insert into that cut, and scrape with your hand the Spatumili between the cut and the skin, and scrape it as if you were scraping off the nail: and the quantity to be scraped should be equal to the quantity of the nail, or about this.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then scrape until the Spatumili reaches the empty place: and it is the place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then extract it, and insert into the hole of the instrument, which is this form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	And it is like a cannula: made of silver, or of air, or of aurichalco, and of linen, tersum: which on the bottom side has a small hole, and on its sides have three holes, two from one part, and one from another part: and the end of it is cut, according to the mode of the knife, as you see: in the top end there is an armillary sphere.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	When the instrument is wet with water, then it immediately sinks into the water, therefore it absorbs half an hour's quantity of water.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	Because if you absorb more water than is proper, in an hour it may happen that the weak one dies by a resolution of its animal spirit: or it happens to him that he has a syncope which approaches to death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	Indeed, the absorption of water is according to the vitality of the animal, and according to what you understand, the weakness of its pulse and its goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then take out the instrument, and keep the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	That is, because it holds immediately due to the skin which holds the opening that is on the face: of which I will tell you, in order to perforate it according to that mode.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument on the other day, if you see the weak one enduring that: and also take out a smaller quantity of water.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do this several days without fear, and guard yourself from error: until there remains but a little water.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you fear for the weak one and release much water from it: then take care of it with hot sand, and much sweat in the bath and sun, and expect over the time: and take care of it with the medicines which have been extinguished, until it is healed: and cauterize over the stomach, and the spleen, and the liver, after the water has been extracted: according to what I will tell you which precedes.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	¶ Regarding the care of children who are born in places where their urinary openings have not been made:
Caput LV.	Head 50.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any child leaves its mother's womb, and the head of the child is not perforated, or the opening is narrowed, or it is not in its proper place:
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	It is therefore necessary to provide assistance immediately after the hole is made, with a solution of salt and water, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then place a fine wire in the hole from lead, and tie it: and keep it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When you wish to urinate, remove it, and mix.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce it again.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not place the lead, it is possible that the urine which comes to the place will not allow it to be closed.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	However, the one whose hole is narrow, is treated with lead, as I said, for many days, until it is enlarged.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	However, those in which the hole is not in its place, are harmed.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	What is, that the hole is made at the end of the female child's head: therefore it cannot mix with the front, until she lifts herself by her own hand to the upper part.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	Nor is it for her generation, therefore, because the seed cannot come to the womb according to the rightness: and it is a painful disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of the operation in that is, that it is laid weak on its back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the head of that female child with your left hand, and cut the head of the female child's head from its place, with a sharp edge, or with sharp salt: as is the cut of a razor, or as you do with rods something similar to the middle of the head of a female child: and let the hole fall in the middle according to what is necessary.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And be careful for you at your operation with the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	For it often happens that.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Therefore place it with it that cuts the blood, and take care of the wound, until it is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Of Albugines that happen in the prepuce and head of the penis, blackness, corruption, nigrescence, and adhesion.
Caput LVI.	Head LVI.
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These Albugines often happen in the female genitalia, and it is a prominent unsightly flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from this another is malicious, and another not malicious.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, non-malicious it is necessary to hang with a fine uncinate, and cut it off, until it is washed in its entirety.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then place above it a submerged gut in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it afterwards with the ointment dysentery, until it is healed.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	And if the Albugine is malicious, of a unpleasant color, then it is necessary to apply cauterization to it after its incision and its section.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	And if the Albugine is in the prepuce of a virgin, not circumcised, and it is a part of the Albugine between the prepuce and its own outside: then it is necessary to remove the Albugine that is inside first, until it is solid, then care for it externally, because when you care for it at the same time, the prepuce does not become erect.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And they also happen in the testicles, and in the prepuce blackness and corruption.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, it is necessary to cauterize the whole that is already blackened and that you want to corrode, or already corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then a line over it afterwards with the ointment that has already been ground with flour of barley and the wool of the goat.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If, however, there occurs a flux of blood, then apply the cauterant with the moon-shaped cauterant at that time, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	The cauterant is indeed applied in two ways, namely to the flux of blood, and when the moon is cut off.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the female genitalia are cut off completely in an hour, then it is necessary to insert a cannula from the thigh into the meat, so that it may be applied weakly above it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	In the case of the prepuce of the male genitalia, and this adhesion does not occur unless the prepuce is healthy, and circumcision is not required thereupon; and sometimes it occurs due to the moon, or an aphthous sore: therefore, it is necessary to remove it with a soft pumice stone, until the ligament is loosened, and the entire genitalia are freed from it.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish this precisely, then it is necessary to remove something from the male genitalia, and from the prepuce.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	This is because when the prepuce is small, it may be pierced through its own subtlety carelessly.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the prepuce from the male genitalia with a fine linen cloth that has already been made in cold water, so that it does not stick again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then it is dressed with wine-soaked bandages, until it is consolidated.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	¶ About the cleaning of infants and the care for errors that may occur in them.
Caput LVII.	Chapter 57.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a solution of the continuity, as the other wounds: but nevertheless, when it is of our operation, our will, and its use is proper in boys, it is necessary to mark in it a better sign, and a more blessed one, bringing salvation.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say then that the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books, because they do not use it in their laws, and it is only something that we have acquired by experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	That is, because I found that a greater part of artisans and phlebotomists use mutilation with a knife, and with needles, and with cuts: and they use the same for healing, and with thread, and with incisions with the nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	And I have indeed proved all of these methods, and I do not find a better cleaning with needles, and with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For in mutilation with the knife, the skin often escapes.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	For the skin of the prepuce has two layers: therefore perhaps the upper layer of the skin is cut, and the lower layer of the skin is the frenulum: it is thought that an incision should be made for the other to occur, and pain will be felt.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And since the cleaning that is made by the use of needles, that is, the thumb, which surgeons use, does not secure the incision of the male member: because perhaps it will enter into its hole.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	In cleaning however, when using the nail, perhaps iron is drawn out, and corrupts your operation: and the skin of children is naturally thin, and is often born in this way, so that they do not need cleaning: and I have already seen this.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	However, cleaning with needles and with thread is a good experiment for me: because the needles are proportional to the incisions: therefore, since the sharpness which is above is like the sharpness which is below,
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	For when you place your hand, the two sharpness are proportioned, and incise according to the operation in one time: and a compression is made in a similar figure, containing the skin of the female from all parts, whereby there is no error at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	The method of the operation is thus: you make the boy believe that you are not doing it unless you tie the thread only in his vein: and then you let him go until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him happy and glad always as much as possible, because he has received understanding.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your prepared hands, and do not let him sit: and hide the instruments in your sleeve, or under your foot, so that he does not see anything at all, nor any of the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then insert your hand into his vein, and blow into the skin, and pull it up until the virgin's head goes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then cleanse it from that which is gathered in it with dirt.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then tie the place marked with a thread double.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Afterwards, tie the lower part of that ligament as much as possible.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold it with your index finger, and the place of the lower ligament with good pressure, and cut between the two ligaments.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then lift up the skin upwards quickly, and pull out the head of the virgin.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood run slowly (for it is better), and put the boy on top of it: and on the boy put a cloth in which the expanded mouse was rolled, decocted in rose water, beaten with fresh rose oil good: and put him on it until another day: and take care of him with the rest of the cure, until he is healed.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The form of the forceps for cleaning is like this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	Let the two ends be sloppy and incising: so that he does not go out of the branch: and let the length of the two sharp points be equal to the length of the two handles.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	I erroneously fell while being purified: for perhaps the internal skin has entirely escaped, or a part of it at the incision.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore, it is necessary to extend it from your hour with your nail before the stitching site: and incise it according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract it with a razor, and incise it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If after three days more than three have passed, and there remains what is under the nail swollen, stitched: then release it until the hot suture is set, and exfoliate it with ease, and incise it according to what is prepared for you: and take care of your hair nail.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For it will not hurt it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	Therefore, care for it with that which consolidates the foreskin from the boils which we have mentioned in the treatise on boils: and if it is incised from above according to the measure, and it flows upwards, it will not hurt it either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Therefore, care for it with that which we have said until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	Regarding the extraction of the retained virginity.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter 58.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	The retention of urine in the uterus is made from the formation caused by a powder made from stone, or frozen blood, or pus, or flesh born, and such as we have mentioned from those which we have said about the methods of treatment in division.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if it does not dissolve the virginity, and you see the retention of it to be due to the stone which is already in the uterine neck: then it is necessary for it to be weak under its own thighs.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then they will be placed on the back of its feet, and the vein of its own will be extended from the upper part of its back, and it will be tied as tightly as possible to its weak thirst.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	It is then considered when the neck of the hollow is used for the expulsion of a stone towards the back: therefore, the vesica is released.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it does not open when we say that, and there is something above the weakest point: then it is necessary to make the extraction of this with the instrument called siringa, which is a silver wire, subtle, thin, like a quill, sharp as the radii in fineness, long like the palm of one and a half fingers, and there is a subtle cannula at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the way of the exit of Vrina through itself is, to take a double thread, and tie it at the extremity of the wool or thread, or good bandage: and insert the end of the thread in the lower part of the siringa: and cut if there is anything left of the wool, verily insert into the cannula with force, as you would.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then insert the siringa with oil, or with butter, and with albume: and make the weak point sit on its seat, and make the hollow uesicam, and its own vagina with oils, and the woman with oily oils and hot water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then insert the siringa into the woman with facility, until it reaches the root of the woman.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double it above at the part of the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the siringa into itself until it reaches the Vesica, and it will feel that it has passed through the weak one for the vacuum: and this is not done in this order unless the meatus through which it goes is in the tortuosity.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread with wool gradually.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For Vrina follows the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then pull it out, and make Vrina run through the woman's urine: and then insert the siringa again, and do not stop doing this until the Vesica ejaculates and finds a weak relaxation.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	On the quality of hypodermic injection and its use with Clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter 196.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When an ulceration occurs in hypodermic injection, or blood congeals in it, or pus forms in it, and you wish to distill water and medications into it: then make with the instrument called Clepsydra, and this is its form.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	For it is hollow, that is, closed.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And in it there are three openings, two on one side and one on the other, as you see.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the place where the force is applied, in which the thing that impels it is located, should be according to the quantity that contains it without addition, until when it is drawn with something, it attracts from humidity: and when it is forced, it expels it to a distance: according to what Clepsydra does, which pushes out naphtha, that is, Greek fire in the battles of Mars.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	When therefore you wish to draw humidity from hypodermic injection, insert the extremity of Clepsydra into the humidity, and draw with it what impels to the upper part, for humidity is drawn into the closure of Clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then insert the extremity of it into the virgin, according to what we have mentioned in the pouch.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then force the humidity with it, for that humidity will be conveyed to the hypodermic injection immediately, so that it feels it weak.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	The form of the fine clister is by which hypodermic injection is made.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Make of silver or golden alloy: whose head is higher than the small alcahm, and under which there is a sink in which the ligament falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take flesh from sheep and put moisture on it to cleanse the wound.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie it with two strong sinuses with a thread doubled, and slightly heat the moisture over fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the cleansed end of the clister into the wound, then gently pull your hand over the flesh with appropriate tightness until it feels weak due to the moisture permeating the wound.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If the wound is not present to you, then take a piece of parchment, and make a circle from it, and pierce it through its entire roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then force the thread firmly into those holes, as they rotate.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then gather the circle like the frustum: after you place it on that which you want to extract from the moistures, oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it in the instrument: and make as you did with the wound when expressing from your hand until the moisture reaches the flesh.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	¶ On extracting a stone.
Caput LX.	Head 60.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	I have already mentioned the division of the species of a stone and its treatment with medicines, and I said the difference between the stone generated in the kidneys and flesh, and the signs of its whole: and I said the stone that falls when cut and sectioned: and this is the true stone generated in flesh: and he who is figured in the wound: and I am telling you this with a clear and brief explanation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I say then, that the stone generated in flesh happens most often in children.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	And from its signs it is apparent that urine escapes from the flesh similar to water in its subtlety: and there appears in it white sand, and the weak wound rubs against it, and labors with it, and often hangs down.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it is raised up, and it goes forth with him, the old one in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And it is easy to cure boys, from that time until they reach fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in the old.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	However, in the young, it is medium, in that which is between: and the one whose stone is greater, the cure is easier: and if it is younger, it is more easily cured.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	When then we are about to cure, it is necessary in the first place that we purify the weak with clysters, so that all the dung which is in his intestines is taken out: for he sometimes prohibits the introduction of stones during the examination.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then the weak one takes it with his feet, and he stirs it up, and moves it towards the lower parts: so that the stone may descend to the deepest part of the bladder, or it may rise from the high place several times.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then make him sit between your hands prepared, and his hand be under the belly of himself, so that a total bladder may be made to bend down towards the lower parts.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine him, and touch him externally.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If then you find the stone in space, then immediately with sectioning on top of it.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	But if it does not fall entirely under your touch, then it is necessary that you wipe your finger with oil from the left hand, if the boy is weak: or with the middle finger if he is a grown-up and complete: and you introduce it into his anus, and examine the stone until it is under your thumb: and then turn him gradually to the neck of the bladder.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press on it with your finger, and turn him away from the place towards which you wish to section: and command the attendant to make a bladder with his hand, and command others to extend his left hand to the upper parts: and his other hand, to remove the skin which is under the testicles in the part of the place where the section is.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the sponge, which is inclined, and its form is like this.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find within it what is between the anus and testicles, and not in the middle, on the left side: and let this be a section through the stone, and your thumb be in the anus: and let the section be transferred, so that it be an external wide section, and an internal strict one, according to the quantity that is possible for the stone to pass out of it, not greater.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps the thumb will cover the stone at the section, and it will exit without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you know that from the stone from which are the angles and edges, why it is difficult to exit because of this.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And it is soft, like a gland, and round, and it makes the exit of it easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	Therefore, from which are the angles and edges, add to the fissure.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not exit in that way, then it is necessary to have engines on top of it, or to string above it with your fingers, whose ends are like the moon, which strings over the stone and does not tear away from it: or to insert a subtle instrument under it with sharp ends.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If you cannot do so above, then make the opening larger somewhat.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	If something is stuck in your blood, cut it off with a knife.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If the stone is larger than one, then push the largest to the mouth of the urethra.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then incline over it.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Afterwards, push the smaller one after that: and do the same if there are two of them.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	If the larger one is hard, then ignorance is that it goes over the large section.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	For it happens in the infirm one of two things, either to die, or to have a constant flow of urine, because it does not solidify at all in the place.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	The true administration of the expulsion of it, until it goes out: or the ingenuity in the fracture of it with the furrows, until it is taken out piece by piece.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have completed your operation, then fill the guttae with aloe, and dragon's blood: and bind it, and place above it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or rose-oil and cold water: so that the apostema may become warm.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then raise the weak part over its neck, and do not dissolve the bandage until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have loosened it, wash the place with water and oil many times.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with ointment of daffodil and ointment of basil, until it is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	If however, a hot apostema is added to the guttae, and burning, and similar symptoms appear, as if blood congeals in the urethra, and urination is forbidden: and it is known that this occurs with the exit of blood with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Therefore, insert your thumb into the guttae, and take out the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if it remains, call for corrosion of the urethra, and putrefaction of it.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then clean the guttae with vinegar, and water, and salt: and place all kinds of ointment that is suitable for treatment, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And it will be necessary to have the legs crossed, and the belly gathered up, during the entire period of treatment, so that the drugs laid on the spot can be easily reached.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If the stone is smaller, and is in the female urethra, and causes it to be formed, and prevents urination: then care for it with what I have said before about urinating before the operation.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	Many times you will excuse yourself from this treatment due to this curing, for I have already proved that.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And this is, as you take the hammer made of heavier iron, whose form is a triangular extremity, sharp, fixed in wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take the thread and tie it with her to the stone so that she will not return to the wound.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert iron with the perforator into the female with ease, until the perforator reaches the same stone: and turn the perforator with your hand in the same stone slightly: and you will make the perforation of her, until she penetrates from the other side.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	Urine is released immediately.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand over the remaining part of the stone from the female's exterior side.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	It will break itself, and it will go out with urine, and the weak one will be cured.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	If this treatment is not prepared for you because of something that prevents it from that: then tie the thread under the stone, and another thread above the stone.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then scrape over the stone on the same female between the two tied threads.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then pull it out.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	After that, loosen the tie, and make the frozen blood unfrozen, which is made in the wound.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie the thread under the stone unless it does not return to the wound: and another tie is needed above the stone, unless when the thread is loosened after the stone is removed, it returns to the skin at its place, and covers the wound. And for this you need to tie the thread above when you loosen the thread, so that it lifts the skin to the upper part, so that it returns to the complement of your skin, and covers the wound, as we said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	On the Extraction of Crystals from Women's Stones.
Caput LXI.	Chapter 61.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	It is not often found in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	However, if it occurs in someone of them, then the treatment is difficult and it is forbidden due to many modes.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	Their nature is: that a woman may perhaps be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is, because you do not find a woman who accuses herself to the physician when she is chaste, or from those who have children.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is, because you do not find a woman who is well versed in this art, particularly the operation with her hand.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	The fourth is the distance from the place of the stone: therefore she requires a deep section, and there is fear in that place.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	If the need prompts you to that, then it is fitting that you take a woman physician who is well versed: and she is not often found.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If you yourself do it, then seek a pure, subtle, and present woman physician who is well versed in women's affairs, or a woman who reveals part of the art: then make her present, and especially her, to do all that you advise her about the stone from the investigation.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	In the first place, that is, to see if the woman is a virgin: then it is fitting that she insert her finger into her anus, and seek the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	If then she finds it, grasp it with her own finger, and then advise the midwife to insert her finger into the infirm female part, and seek over the stone, after placing her left hand on the infirm part, and compress it well.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	If then she finds the stone, then it is fitting that she gently move it from the orifice of the infirm part downwards with all her strength, until she arrives at the root of the thigh with it.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then he cuts on it at the midpoint of the upper part of the hip bone, from whichever side he prepares it for him, and he feels the stone in that part: and his finger does not remove from the stone, it constricts around it: and this is a small section in the beginning.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he inserts the rod on that section.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	If he then feels the stone, then add to the section in proportion to the amount of stone that it recedes from there.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And you know that the species of the stone are many.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	From these there is a small, large, gentle and harsh, long, and round one having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	Therefore, you know the species of this by that which you wish to point out on it.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If he then does not bleed you, then add to the place of the zig, and hold it for an hour until the blood is abscessed.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then return to your operation, until the stone has descended: and do, as you prepare for the extraction of the stone with the instruments I mentioned in the removal of the stone, so assist with them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	That if you do not bleed you from the blood vessel which is cut: then place the child on the place, and tie it with a string of pulleys suitable to it: and do not forget this: and let go of the stone, and do not take it outside.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	Perhaps the weak woman will die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then care for the hip bone.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When the sharpness of the blood is sated after days, and the place becomes putrid, then return to your operation, until the stone has descended.

Caput LXII.	Chapter 67.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	The moisture is not a bone, unless the aggregation of moisture in the white part of the scrotum, which is under the testicle, and is called the scrotum.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And sometimes it is in its own scrotal pouch, which nature has prepared for it in the part of the epididymis, until it thinks that it is another semen, and is the skin of the testicle between the white part of the scrotum, which we have called the scrotum, and this does not happen except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this branch is from the weakness that happens to the testicles, therefore this material is poured onto them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And sometimes it happens by striking on the testicles.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture has many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or it is the color of its moisture to yellowness, or it is reddish-brown, or it is fecal, black, or it is white and clear, and this is the one that is more.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which he knows where the aggregation of water is, are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the white part of the scrotum, which we have called the scrotum, then the apothegm is round in length almost like a figure of the epididymis: and the testicle does not appear because the moisture contains it from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if the moisture is in its own scrotal pouch, then the apothegm is round with the part of the epididymis, and therefore man looks at it because it is another semen.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white part of the scrotum, then it falls under the sense.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When then you want to know the color of the moisture, then try the color of the moisture in the apothegm when it is introduced with a square-shaped instrument, whose form precedes.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Accordingly, as regards the act of insertion, judge what is between itself.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When we come to treat with iron, it is necessary then to precede the weak one with a vein, if possible, for it to bleed, and you will see the body of that person full.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then the wound will be covered over on its back above a small high thing, and place under it many cloths.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then seat yourself on the left side of him, and command the assistant to sit on his right hand, who will extend the penis of that person to one half of the two layers of skin of the testicles, and to a part of the mouth.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a flat sponge, and clean the skin of the testicles from the middle along the length, as close as possible to the nipple: and make the cut between the lines that divide the skin of the testicles, until it comes to the white line that encompasses it, and examine it and observe it, or cause it to depart from this so that it departs from itself: and let your excoriation be such as leaves the part that hangs with the seed more: and scrutinize it subtly according to the amount that you can.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then make a large hole in the full bladder with a needle, and draw out all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate the two sections of the cut with hairs, and extend the bladder to the upper part, and do not touch the skin of the testicles that it comprehends: and incise the bladder as you can possible incise it, or with its totality, or particularly the side of that subtle one.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	For if you do not desire to examine it, there is no security in its incision that the water will not remain.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	If however, the water comes out from outside of its skin at the time of your operation: then when you have completed the cut, bring it back.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then gather the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a suture.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then care for it as the others wounds until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	If I find a black corrupted one from another, then it is necessary to tie the wounds that are suspenders, fearing the flow of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then excise the testicle with the suspenders, and extract the wound: then care for that as we have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	If water is gathered in two parts, then you know that they are two branches: then cut another part according to what you have done in the other equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it equals you, that the operation is one, then do: then wipe the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And then insert into the submerged sections of wool in oil, or in rose oil: and put another piece of dirty wool which you have submerged in wine and oil on top of the two testicles, and wonder at the flow of blood: and put over them double dupes of linen, and they are thin: and tie them over with a tie that is having six according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then they are two sheets, and they are tied, and they fill the carminata according to this likeness: and let the extremities which it is put on from the neck, or wet wool: and gather with a tie in the shoulder of the arms: and one extremity takes up until the back, and the second takes up to the part of the chest: and two extremities over two thighs below, and two extremities another one over two legs, and they gather the tie all in the shoulders of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And when artificially this branch is healed with the cauterie at the place of section with iron: and it is, that you take a thin sword cauterie, and go away with it the skin of the testicles: and it is burnt, according to what we have said: until when it is taken off white containing water: then take the cauterie, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	The Greek letters are similarized.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then, when it is pierced with it, and it is ignited, until the total moisture escapes.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend the sifac with twine, and scrape with a fine cauterizing fire, and cut it according to what is possible for you, until all of it is removed.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And take care not to let the fire touch it.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And you know that this operation is milder, and longer from the flow of blood, and better than the operation by section.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	If, by any means, the operation causes you harm in the hour of sectioning, or in the heat of cauterization, or in the flow of blood, or something else: then it is necessary to cure what harms you from that with which it is suitable to cure you, according to what was said before.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	If, however, the weak one is timid and does not expect this operation because of the horror of it: then administer the piercing according to what I say here, and it will be.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When it is certain to you that I say here about the meanings, that the root is watery: then it is necessary for you to make the weak one sit on the raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then, pierce the cauterization in the lower part of his body with a flat sponge: and place the piercing according to the length of the body, and let there be a wide opening, until the whole water runs out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then place it over the seat of the bowels, and tie it up, and let it be released so that the remaining water runs out: then take care of it until it heals the wound.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	If, however, the exit of water is in the hour that you pierced it: and this is not because the white linen makes contrariety in the wound opening, and prevents the exit of water: then it is necessary to insert a finger into the wound, or an instrument with which water is drawn from the hydropic ointment, whose form precedes: or add to the operation of the wound briefly.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	You know that water returns and is gathered after six months, or about that time.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	When it is gathered, then it will pass according to the same manner, and the weak days will pass over.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	Regarding the care of Ramicis flesh.
Caput LXIII.	Head LXIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	You know that in the section above this Ramicis, there is a cause of fear leading to harm in many arrangements.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore, it seems to me its release from this for health.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am remembering the operation in this and the species of stitches.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say that many things happen to stitches in bodies from which the testicles are composed: and this is from many causes, namely.
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from the sharp or acid excess which is poured over the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from the blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the color of the stitch is according to the color of the body, and it does not find pain in it, and it is a deep stitch.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stone stitch, whose color is black, and there is no sense in it.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And sometimes it happens from the nodulation of the arteries and their inflammation, as has already been mentioned in its remembrance: or from the inflammation of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	Which is then known from the arrangement of the stitch when you compress it with your fingers.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it does not need to touch it absolutely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	However, that which is made from the inflammation of the veins does not spread out when compressed with your fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is possible that a section will be made above this species, and above other flesh, and it is that the skin of the testicles separates.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend the thumb to the upward direction, and extract it with the white gauze: and free the suspender from the wound, and tie the bandage: and incise the suspender after you have freed it from all parts of the wound.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If then the thumb is consolidated with these new flesh, then it is necessary to pull out the thumb, and cut it off.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if the adhesion is between something from the gauze, or within the bandage: then it is necessary to free the entire adhesion, and cut it off with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	However, if there is new flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind: then it is necessary to cut off the entire thing, and extract the thumb, as I have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When therefore your operation is completed, then dip the wound in the oiled rose-colored oil and linen, and then care for it with the rest of the treatment until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	¶ About the care of rabbits, which is with grape vine.
Caput LXIIII.	Head LXIV.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	Ulcer is wrapped in a certain rolling, like blisters, with the softening of the testicles: and it becomes difficult for the upper movement and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the treatment of this ailment is from fear, because of that which precedes the reminder.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	For it is true that we should say the operation in it according to what they have done in the first place.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say then that it is necessary for you to make the weak one sit on the raised seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then press the suspender of the testicles towards the lower part.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testicles with your fingers, with the linen which is near the woman: and hold it with another assistant, and extend it with strong extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then make an incision with a sharp blade, along the transverse section, until the waters are revealed.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrub from all sides, as I told you in the extraction of arteries which are in time.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then tie the thread in it where the thread is doubled, and tie it again in the first places where the watches occur: and tie it again in the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then dry it in the middle of the straight section according to the length of the body, and extract what is collected from the moist and corrupted feces.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then care for the thigh with the care of the other wounds, in which you wish to generate healthy ones, so that the waters which nourish one testicle may fall.
Non est enim malum per illud.	For it is not evil for this reason.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if the waters occur in all the waters, then it is necessary to extract them for this reason, testicles with waters: so that the nutrient not be deprived of it through the incision, and it may not wasted away, or die, and it may not be impure with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	¶ About the care of the Ramic intestines.
Caput LXV.	Chapter 57.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The end of this Ramic is from the section which happens in a wide extension over the belly towards the groin from the thin belly.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Therefore, the intestines descend from that rupture to one testicle.
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this rupture is either from the sifach, or from its extension.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two kinds of ruptures occur from many causes: either from percussion, or a sudden fall, or a loud noise, or the emission of a bad smell, and such like.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign when it is from the extension of the sifach.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	This is the gradual onset of a slow process over a long period of time, and it does not happen suddenly. It is an aposteme equal in depth, because the sifach encompasses the intestine.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of this is when it is seen from the section of the sifach, because it causes sudden pain to begin from its beginning: and it is a deep aposteme, appearing on the skin near by: and this is due to the exit of the intestine, and the course of its movement towards the sifach.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And sometimes it emerges with the intestine zirbum: and this is called the intestinal ramix, and the zirbia: and sometimes it happens with moisture.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And sometimes it runs in the intestine feces, and is retained there: and this is with it a danger for the weak: because it causes sudden pain, and especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And in the treatment of the kinds of this disease when iron is feared, therefore it is necessary to avoid this case in it.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the mode of the operation is to pull on the weak one, so that the intestine is returned by its own hand to the interior of its union, if it obeys the return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then it will be raised over its neck with your hands, and you will spread its legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then extend the skin that follows the skin to the upper parts, and shave the skin of the testicles entirely along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then tie two stitches in the two sections, according to which you need to open the section with them: and the section should be according to the quantity that is possible, so that it may slip out of it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the sifach, and that which is under the skin of the testicles, until it is firm from all parts: then insert your thumb nail into the one that follows the testicle, into the one that is between the album sifach, which is under the skin of the cheek, and between the sifachs, and absolutely adhere to it which is in the posterior part of the cheek.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then I apply my right hand to the inner surface of the testicles: and when I extend the white thread upwards, with my left hand: and I squeeze the blood with the thread to the part of the section: and I ask the attendant to extend the blood to the top: and you will loosen the adhesion which is behind the complete solution.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And ask your fingers to make sure nothing from the intestine is stuck in the hard white thread.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If I find something in it, then push it towards the lower vent.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take the acumens where the thick thread is made, and insert it into the last sifach, that is, the tunic that follows the section on the inner surface of the testicles: then cut the extremities that project outwards until they are four threads.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then make some of them over on top of others with a figure like a cross: and tie them with the alsifach, because it is under the surface of the testicles a strong ligament, so that nothing from the waters that nourish them can be sent to them: so as not to cause an apostema hot.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place the second ligament again, according to the first one, farther away from it with two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And then release the two ligaments from the sifach under the surface of the testicles in proportion to the size of the finger: and cut the rest according to the roundness, and take out the blood from it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then clean the lower part of the section of the skin through which the blood and sanies run, as we have mentioned earlier.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then apply wool that is dipped in oil, and place it on the inner thigh: and apply the ligament that we have mentioned.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	When the white alum is cauterized, after making the incision, I fear the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	Indeed, this often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And release the ligament, until it falls on its own.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	If, however, the case is delayed, then embrocate it with hot water: and place that which I mentioned on top of it until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then care for the elbow with the remaining wound care, until it is cared for.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	§ On the Watery Ram.
Caput LXVI.	Head 66.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this ram, no one is seen who dared to apply iron over its care.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And at first they said that it is done as we have related in the watery ram which is with wine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, to apply wax after the section on it with ease below: then dry in the middle, and care for the end that opens it, until they fall open: and care for the elbow, according to what we said, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	§ On the dislocation which happens in the groins.
Caput LXVII.	Head 67.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When a rupture occurs in the groins, as we have said, and the place is considered, and nothing has come down from the testicles into the intestines: and if it does come down, it is little, and returns in all hours: but if it prolongs that time, a fissure is added to the white alum, until the intestines come down into the white alum.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this happens from the extension of the white alum, which we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because it is extended the white alum: then it is softened, and the place is apostematized, and it is considered.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And its care is with cauterization, as we have mentioned in its previous narration.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	When it comes to treating with iron, it should be done according to this manner: and it is that the weak lies on its back with its hands on either side of it.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then make the site of the rupture, which is postero-lateral, and is elevated, with a section parallel to its length, according to the size of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tie the strings of the alifak and those which are under the edge, until when the white sifak that follows it is tightened.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take the needle and place it over the elevated part of the sifak, and press it down to the depth of the vein.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then tie two parts of the elevated part at the ends of the needle's radius, and connect them with a knot of one of them with the other: then pull out the ends of the needle.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not cut the alifak at all, nor stretch the vein, nor anything else like I made you know in the treatment of intestinal ramifications.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then treat that wound according to the treatment of the wound.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you then insert the thread, clean it and restore the skin, until it is cured.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	The alifak should be contracted and not added to the elevation of the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the cauterium is better in this place: because it is nearer to health.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	¶ About the softening of the testicular skin.
Caput LXVIII.	Caput LXVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is often softened in some men, because the flesh that is between them is also softened, and its appearance becomes ugly.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for him who is asked to treat it, to make the weak lie on its back and to press the entire softened skin that has been softened over the natural skin.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then he gathers the two lips with the suture: and if you wish, first remove the excess of the softened skin from three or four sutures, or four, and then make a firm suture.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then he makes an incision between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then he attends to the healing of the remaining wounds until they heal and the threads fall off.
¶ De Castratione.	¶ On Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Head LXIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Knows that castration is forbidden by our law: and for this reason I would not remember it in the book of this: and it is not necessary to remember it unless for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One is, that it should be known by the physician when he is asked about it, and to know the treatment of the one who undergoes it.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other reason is, that we often require castration of certain animals for our purposes, such as sheep, horses, and goats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say, that castration is done in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Either by attrition.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by cutting and sectioning.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In those that are made by attrition, the operation is: that we make the animal sit in hot water, until the testicles of it are softened and relaxed, and hang down: then we grasp them with your hand, until they are resolved and do not appear under touch.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	In castration by cutting and sectioning, it is necessary to hold the animal and press the skin of its testicles with your left hand.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspender, and dry it over the entire cut once, until the two wounds have come out: then make an incision after you have cleaned it, neither letting anything else hang on it, than the thin sifac which is under the wound.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	This method of castration is better because it is done by attrition: for attrition may leave something in the testicles, therefore the animal desires copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the thigh, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	¶ On the care of the hermaphrodite in two ways.
Caput LXX.	Head LXX.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	The hermaphrodite from the thigh is in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	Their thigh is a hermaphrodite because it appears in it that it follows the space, or in the skin of the testicles, in which there is between two testicles, a figure like a woman's vulva, in which there are hairs: and sometimes it urinates from that which is in the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	However, in women it is a single species, and it is a woman's vulva above the thigh like the testicles altogether, prominent to the outside: of which one is like the priapic penis, and two like two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the treatment of the three species, two from the thighs, and one from the woman's vulva, is because it is necessary to add flesh to them, until they escape from their impression.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then take care of them with the curing of other wounds.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	However, in the second species of men, from which urine issues which is in the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor is its cure at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	¶ On the incision of the Tentacle and the fleshy part of the woman's vulva.
Caput LXXI.	Head LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	Perhaps the Tentacle is added over the natural thing, until it becomes ugly and unpleasant to look at: and sometimes it is magnified in some women so much that it expands like the thighs, and reaches to copulation.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	It is therefore necessary that you hold the excess of the fever with your hand, or with a razor, and make an incision: and not least of all in the incision, particularly in the deep root: so that there may be no flow of blood.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound itself until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	However, flesh that is born in the womb of the matrix is flesh which is born in the womb of the mother, until it fills its place: and perhaps it goes out towards the outside according to the likeness of the tail: and for this reason some call the first stage of the wound caudata.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	Therefore, you should cut it as you cut the fever, and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	¶ Regarding the care of the wound which is not perforated in a woman.
Caput LXXII.	Head LXXII.
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	Alratica is, that it is a wound which is not perforated in a woman, or is a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And it is either natural, or accidental.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	It is accidental from the disease that precedes it: and it itself is either made from the flesh which is born added, or from subtle silk, or from spun: and it is either in the deep womb, or in its sides, or in the upper part of it, or in the lower part of it: and it prevents coitus and impregnation, and partu, and perhaps it prevents menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the knowledge of it is made by the appearance of the midwife, if the poverty is apparent nearby.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	If however it is not apparent, then seek it with your fingers, or with your elbow.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If however poverty is from subtle silk, and it is near two lips: then immediately, and break it.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	It is, as you place over two lips two pieces of papyrus.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then place your fingers of both hands simultaneously, and the woman should be on her back with her knees extended.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend the two lips with strength until the thin silk is broken and the hairy skin is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take wool and drink it in oil, and place it on the spot: and let the woman wear it all day so that the place does not harden with another kind of moisture.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	However, if the silk is thick, then it should be cut with a sharp knife along the edge of a leaf of myrtle similar in size.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	However, if the hairy skin is from the flesh of a living animal, then suspend it with strings, and cut it: and there should be with you medicines that flow without biting the blood, such as acacia, and the blood of the dragon, and thus combined with the vein of the thumb.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then administer a catheter from the lead amply, so that the thumb does not harden quickly, hold it for some days: and administer gauze from dry linen, then treat the remaining treatment, until it heals.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when some flesh of other animals is born, it should be cut according to this method: while there is no cancerous growth in the cancerous one that is in the womb, there should be no opposition with iron at all.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	¶ About the care of hemorrhoids, Athehelil, and both red spots in women's thighs.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter 73.
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Indeed, hemorrhoids are the opening of the uterine veins, until much blood flows from them frequently.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When therefore they increase, they become hemorrhoids: and I have already spoken about the species of these, and their signs, and I will now say which receive treatment from them and which do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I declare that the hemorrhoids which are in the opening of the womb, and are not visible to the senses, then there is no cure for him with iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	Which however among them are in the opening of the womb over which sense falls, are those that are treated.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is therefore necessary to let a woman go into a cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend the hemlock cloth with hooks, or with a rough cloth, and cut them off from their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then apply the pulverized powder over them near the blood flow of one of the cut pieces without bleeding: like the acacia, and the dragon's blood, and the thus, and similar to them.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then let her feet be pulled towards the wall for one hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Afterwards, put her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If she persisted in the blood flow, then make her sit in a sumach decoction, and the bark of the gooseberry, and the gall, and similar to them.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take flour of barley, and mix it with honey and vinegar, and make a plaster with that on her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If then the blood is cut off with it, that is good: and if not, let her apply her breasts to the skin, and the milk, without scarring.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take wool, and dip it in the juice of the tar, or the juice of arnoglossum, or the juice of the almond leaf, that is, the thistle, and make it stick to the skin.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When then the wound is quiet, take care of the place with ointments until it heals.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	However, the red one is similar to the heads of the alhaasse, and has a sharp appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary then that you act upon what appears from it, according to what I said earlier: and take care of it until it heals.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Regarding the perforation of the Exitus which occurs in the matrix.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter 174.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Many types of erosions may occur in the matrix, such as cancer, stone-like erosion, ulcers, inflamed, cutaneous, herpes, abscesses, hemorrhoids, fistulas, and warts, and callosities.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And as I have already said all these diseases and their kinds, signs, and treatments in division, it is necessary to tell you in this treatise about hot erosion that occurs in the matrix, when it is from erosions that are gathered from healthy parts, and you want to know how its opening is made with iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	It is necessary then that you consider.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the erosions is sharp with its own touch, and flame, and fever: and you see it turn red: if it falls on it, then do not hurry with the perforation of it: and take care of it with it, as it rises above maturation, until when it becomes quiet, the sharpness of the accident disappears.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you make the woman sit on the seat which has two chairs, and is reclined, or is placed on her back, and brings her feet to the lower part of the ventricle: and her hips should be expanded, and she should place her arms under her knees, and lie down with both ligaments convenient for it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit on the left side, and administer the instrument with which the matrix opening is opened.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form comes to them that are behind.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary when you are to administer this instrument that you make it like the deep groove of a woman's radio: so that what comes in through the instrument is not more than the depth of the groove, and does not hurt the weak one.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	However, if the instrument is greater than the depth, then it is necessary to put pills on the top of the deep groove: so that the introduction of the instrument's whole is prevented into the deep groove: and it is necessary that the pill run in the instrument from the upper side: and that it holds the instrument, and that it rolls the pill until the deep groove is opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When the Exitus appears, and is touched with the hand, and it is soft and smooth: then it is necessary that it be left in its own head with a wide slice of soap.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When the sanies are discharged, then it is necessary that you put in the vulva of a linen submerged in rose oil: or in virgin oil, in which there is some stipticity: and put the linen in, and take out the section from the deep groove.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And put outside on the mattress, and on the clean wool that is submerged in water, in which the bullfats are of the lower class.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then it is dressed after two days with the ointment that is suitable for this, until it is healed.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And sometimes the mattress and vulva are washed so that they are cleansed with water and honey: then with water in which the root of the lily or long Aristolochia: then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	That if the vulva is hidden inside the mattress, then it is necessary that you prevent the care of its iron with care, even the care itself with what I said in division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Doctrines of Midwifery, how they treat fetuses from birth, according to a non-natural figure.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 78.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the midwife to recognize the first figure of the natural childbirth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	When you see a woman being compressed towards the lower parts and she desires to smell the air above her, and she blows over that which is above her, which is on the same level as the birth, and she hurries the exit of the embryo: then you know that this childbirth is according to a natural figure, and its exit is from the head of it, and afterwards with it. Or, if suspended, or hanging from the umbilicus.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When you see these signs, then it is necessary to compress its belly, so that the embryo may come out quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it comes down to its head, the rest comes with it, and it is washed clean of these superfluities by good cleansing.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But if it is beyond this childbirth, it is unnatural and shameful.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For sometimes the embryo comes out of its feet, and it comes out of the body of it before the head of it, and the feet and hands of it, and one foot: or the head of it and the hand of it: or the forehead of it and the hand of it: or it comes out by the belly: and perhaps it turns over on its chest, and such like from unnatural figures.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	Therefore it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and subtle in all these things, and to guard against error and deception. And I am showing you all the figures from them, and what intelligence is in them, and what it means by that, and how it stands over it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the embryo comes out of its head by its natural exit, and it stands over the woman, and it is difficult for it to have a child, and you see its virtue already weakened: then let it sit on its seat, or women hold it: and if it is weak with foenugraeco decocted, and with oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the midwife inserts her hand into the patient's vagina, finds the presenting part with it, and seizes it with her thumb, until the fluid that is in it has dried up due to dryness: and presses on the woman's abdomen until the fetus descends.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If the fetus does not descend, then it is necessary that the woman be anointed with Greek mucilage with olive oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then press on him to swallow it: and make it stupefy him with condiments, and hold his mouth and nostrils for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will soon pass.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If both hands of the fetus come out first, then it is necessary to gently reduce them with some difficulty.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If she does not obey during the introduction, then place the woman on a bed, and raise her feet: then press the bed on the ground: and hold her so that she does not fall during the shock.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then cut off the hands, and extract the remaining fetus: and tie the hand of the fetus with a cloth, and take it out with equality: for it will also come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the embryo from its foot.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out of its feet, then it is necessary to push them up: then turn the fetus slightly: and finally hold it.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then take one of its feet, and extend it slightly.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they come out until the thighs, then press on him to swallow it, and make it stupefy him with condiments: for he will come out if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if he does not come out with him as we have told you, then gently reduce the fetus slightly until you place it according to the natural figure.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	He will then go out easily.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If anything is forbidden to go with him, take some highly alkali ointment, and then some bitter oil, and some dissolved gum: mix them all in the mortar by good percussion, and then apply a line of it to the woman's vulva, and below her ventricle.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then make her sit in warm water until she gets drowsy.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When you see that the lower parts of her are already heated, then apply some myrrh to it, and put it on.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When she has held the ointment for an hour, then make her sit on a seat.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make her snort: and draw up her nose and mouth, and press on the lower part of her ventricle by easy pressure.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fire will go out immediately.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	Exit of the fetus on the thighs and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When she goes out according to this form, then let her insert her hand slowly into it.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman will lie down on her neck, and her feet should hang down, and she should lie down on the bed, and fold her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then press on her ventricle by easy pressure.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then take out what is under her feet from the clot, until it is ready in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	If the fetus does not go out, then take her feet and move them with a strong movement.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then press on what is above the drowsiness by easy pressure, until the fetus goes up to the upper part.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then let her insert her hand slowly, and press on the fetus, and tell the woman to hold it until the fetus goes out.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	The exit of the fetus hanging freely from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	It is ingeniously reduced in its hand.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	However, if it cannot be reduced, then make the woman walk, and let her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If however she cannot walk, then make her lie down on the bed: and strike her thighs with a violent blow.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then apply the liniment you have prepared from mucilages that you have.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	If however she accepts it, then make her sit on the seat.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then carefully reduce her hand, and evenly grasp the fetus according to its natural figure, and make her compress herself, and tell her to hold tight until she exits.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The exit of the fetus over its own neck, with its hands expanded, and its face towards the back of her mother's.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the midwife hold onto the hand of the fetus, then gently roll it, and ease it with facility.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is eased, then place on top of its navel that we have mentioned from oil and mucilages.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then tell her to move gently.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done that, then make her sit on the seat, and tell her to lean towards the right side.

¶ Exitus foetus praeparati super latus.	The exit of the fetus prepared on the side.
Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it descends to the mother's opening according to this method with the second, then cut the second with your nail, until it is dry from moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	If however it is hung over the face of the fetus and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it may not be held, and it may die.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.	Then push the fetus inside, until you place it according to what is appropriate: and tell the woman to clasp herself several times: for he himself will go out by the left side.
¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	Exit of twins or of many fetuses.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You know that twins are born frequently: and sometimes three, and four.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	However, that is extraordinary and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five is indeed beyond nature and do not live together: and they contain them, however many there may be, in one first: and they are separated by the finger, distinguishing between them tied in the umbilicum of each of them.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes they go out like the one fetus goes out naturally, easily: and they go out by an unpraised exit, as we have said.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some of them are difficult at the time of parturition and go to the place we mentioned by figures, then care for them as we have said: and let it be due to the subtle thief, and do what it does with facility and tardiness, and act according to every figure with the one who is prepared for him from his ingenuity to salvation.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Remembrance of this which is formed in the womb from embryos, and are aborted.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	Sometimes it is formed in the womb of one, and two, and three, and four, and five, and six, and seven, and eight, and more than ten: and I have already heard from a woman who aborted seven, and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That is done by the measurement of the glorious wise man.
Hoc ergo totum oportet ut sit in scientia Obstetricis.	Therefore, this entire thing ought to be in the knowledge of the Midwife.
Fortasse enim perueniet ad eam simile illius: opponat ergo ei cum illo quod oportet	Perhaps it will be eager for that similar one: and therefore lays it against that one what is appropriate.
¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	Chapter on the Extraction of a Dead Foetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter 76.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you are treating a dead fetus, as I mentioned earlier in the division regarding medication, and it does not leave, and you force it to be operated on with your hand, then it is necessary to consider this.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If the woman is of sound constitution and has not been affected by any of the accidents that are feared to cause her miscarriage, then it is necessary for the woman to be laid on a bed, on her back, with her head lowered, and her legs raised. The attendant should hold her from two sides or lie her down on the bed so that her body is not withdrawn during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the woman's mouth with oily, high-quality oils, such as beeswax and flax seeds.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the midwife should anoint her hands with these oils and beeswax, and then insert it into the woman's mouth with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she will look for the place where she will make the knots from the fetus, and a suitable place for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Therefore, consider now if the fetus is prepared to descend on its own head, then make knots in its eyes, or in its neck, or in its mouth, or in its palate, or under its beard, or in its shoulder, or in nearby costal regions, and under the hip bones.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If the descent is on its feet, then in the chest and in the ribs of its middle.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is necessary for her to hold the knot with her right hand: and she should place the fetus between the left fingers of her hand: and she will insert it with her hand with ease, and make a knot in one of those places that I mentioned, until it reaches the womb.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then he shapes another bristle opposite it, or a third one if needed, so that the contraction is equal and does not extend to a part.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then it is extended with an equal extension, and not just along the straight line, but it should also move to all parts so that its exit is as desired, just as happens when a tooth is removed during its extraction.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is necessary for there to be something in that part so that the extension is softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	If that part is held on, then it is necessary for the midwife to apply some oily fingers to it and to insert them from the side so that they rotate with the one being held.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If the part of the fetus is about to come out, then the bristles should be shifted to another place that is higher up: do this until the whole fetus has come out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If the hand is about to come out before the other, and it cannot be reduced because of its constringence: then it is necessary for the cloth to be wrapped around it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then remove it when it starts to come out completely, either by cutting it or in the joint of the finger, or in the elbow: and it is necessary for you to do the same with the other hand, and in two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If the head of the fetus is large, or there is a constringence in its coming out, or water is aggregated in its head: then it is necessary for the midwife to insert between her fingers the Spatumile spindle, and to find the head with it and to draw out the water: or she may break it with the instrument called Almisdac, whose form comes with the forms of the other instruments in the head that follows.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Similarly, if the fetus is large-headed in nature, then it is necessary for her to push with the amniotic fluid: or she may take it out with the misdach, as I have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then he takes the bones with his forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If he goes out the head, and bends at the shoulder: then it is found, until the moisture that is in the chest is expended.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	But if he does not bend, nor yield to the exit: then he will break the head piecewise, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	If it is below the chest, or there is moisture in it: then it is necessary to pierce it, until the moisture flows out of it.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	But if the fetus is above its own feet: then the attraction of it is easy, and the direction of it to the bone of the mother is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	But if it is bent at the chest, or the breast: then it is necessary to take it out with the cloth that you have covered over your hand: and find the chest, or the breast, until the moisture that is in them flows out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	But if the remaining parts are removed, and the head returns: then the midwife inserts her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	Then if the bone of the mother is open: then she inserts her hand into the bone of the mother, and seeks with it the head, and draws it out with her fingers up to the bone of the mother: then she inserts a nail, or two nails, and draws it out with it.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	But if the bone of the mother is bent, because of the heat that occurs to it: then it does not need to labor over it, but rather it needs at that time to administer an effusion of moist things, such as ointment: and apply the ointment: and she should sit in warm water that softens and moistens.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	But if the fetus is above its own side: then it is possible for it to be equal: then the thing that I said in the fetus of the son is administered.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If that is not possible, then it is fractured in pieces and extracted.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And it is necessary to not let anything escape from the inside at all.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	When you have completed your operation, then administer what I said about hot apostemats which occur in the womb.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If there is a flow of blood, then it should descend into warm applications, and the remainder of the treatment should be given.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I myself have already seen a woman, in whose womb the fetus had died, and then she was impregnated on top of that, and later another fetus died as well.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	It happens to her after a long time, an apostemat in her belly button, which has swelled, until it is opened, and she begins to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	I am called to her treatment, and I have been treated for a long time: and the wound is not closed.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	I then applied some strong attracting ointments over it: and the bone came out of its place.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then there passed some days, and another bone came out.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	I was amazed then, because there is no bone in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I thought that they were from the bones of the dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	I then found the bone and extracted many bones from the woman who was in better positions at the time: and she has already done so for a long time, and sends out a little pus from its place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I did not hold this foreign thing firmly, unless there is knowledge in it, and an aid to the doctor who performs the treatment with his hand from the cure.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	About the necessary forms of instruments in the extraction of the fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter 77.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	This is the form of the stricture, where the books are equalized by two equal knots at the two ends of two logs.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However, this Vertigo should be made to be more slender for the stricture: and it should be made either from ebony or from the wood of the bosse.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the thickness of all woods should be almost like two fingers: and the margin of each of them is almost one finger, and the length of each of them is a palm and half, and in the middle of the two woods there are two additions of the same kind of wood, which have already been firmly fixed in both, whose length is half a palm and a little less, and the width of each of them is almost two fingers or less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the womb, so that it opens with them when you turn over the two Vertigoes.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	The form of the Vertigo that opens the womb.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form similar to this, but more slender and leaner.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	It should be made from ebony or bosse wood, according to the likeness of the hammer.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at the end of it there should be two additions, as you see here above: and the length of all the addition is almost a palm: and the width of each of them is two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	And when you wish to open the womb with it, then make the woman sit on the bed, with her feet hanging down, and open that which is between her thighs.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then insert these two additions joined together into the womb: and you are holding the end of the instrument below between her thighs.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument, as you do with hammers, equally according to the quantity that you want to open of the womb from the mouth, until the midwife does what she wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	The form of vertigo is different from what the ancients have said, the form of impelling force by which the fetus is impelled.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	The form of Almidace, by which the great head is cut: and it resembles a saw, with teeth at the end, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And sometimes it is made to close, like the teeth of this form, as you see, which are like the teeth of a saw, by which it is cut and ground.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	The form of Almidace by which the small head is cut.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	The form of Uncinus has one spine.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	The form of Uncinus has two spines.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The form of a saw, with teeth like a saw, by which the fetal head is cut.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The form of Spatumilis has two ends for cutting off the head.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The form of two Spatumilis, also of slats.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	This instrument is used for all operations, and the more varied their species, and the better prepared they are at the artisan's disposal, the more suitable it is for its operation, and the higher among men, due to its quantity.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Therefore, do not despise any of these instruments, as it may be prepared at your disposal.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	It is inexcusable for the need of these instruments.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	¶ On the extraction of the second child.
Caput LXXVIII.	Head LXXVIII.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the second child is held during childbirth, then it is necessary to apply strong remedies to keep its hunger.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then make it sneeze with condiments: and tightly hold your hand on its mouth, and the nostrils of its own.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If then it goes out through this, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take the cauldron, and perforate it in the cover: and put into it herbs unfolding the mouths of the matricaries, such as calamus, rue, and anemonium, and camomile, and sage, and linen hemp, and centaury: take all these herbs, or some of them, and submerge them with water, and place them over the fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then place a dish of barley over the cover of the cauldron, and another end in the mouth of the matricary: and hold it until it becomes saturated with the moisture of the matricary.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make it hiss, as I have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	The second part will be easier.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If however it remains after this treatment and does not go away: then advise the obstetrician to dip her hand in oil of sweet almonds, or a strong tincture of mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then she should introduce it into the uterus and seek with it the second part.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When she finds it, then take it up and extend it a little at a time.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	If however it is annexed to the deep matricary, then she should introduce her hand according to what we have said until she finds the second part and withdraws it a little at a time so that the matrix does not fall on the strong attraction: in fact, it should be turned with ease to the right and left side: then add to the quantity of attraction.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	The matricary obeys at this point and is loosened and drawn away from the adhesion.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the mouth of the matricary is contracted as we have already mentioned: treat it with steam and the medicine of the cauldron with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	If, however, he does not proceed with the others that we have mentioned, then be careful not to tire himself out over this in the course of the repeated extractions.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	Indeed, it should be that whatever is inserted into the tooth of the mother, it should be placed in the woman's house.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then apply it with the ointment of Tetrapharmacian.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For it will decay it after days, and it will dissolve, and it will be withdrawn.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	Indeed, when it decays, it should be leeched with that bad smell to the stomach and head, and it will hurt the weak one.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, it should be that the suffumigations suitable for that are administered.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	However, some of the ancient ones have already found a suffumigation of nasturtium and wine vinegar.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of the instrument by which it is suffumed, a woman at the retention of Secondus and during menstruation.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made from the inside of a cataplasm, or from honey: and let its wide end be placed over the fire: and the suffumigation should be placed over the prunes: hold it until the suffumigation is consumed: and then another one.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	¶ About the treatment of Ani not pierced.
Caput LXXIX.	Head LXXIX.
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born, and their heads, Ani of them which is not pierced, which the poor woman has already made small with a needle.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	Therefore, it should be that the midwife pierces it with her own finger: and if not, she pierces it with the sharp sponge: and let her be careful not to touch it with the leg.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then place over it a fattened wool in wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with unguents until it is cured.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If then you fear that the wound is suppurating, then place a septic needle in the hole for several days, and remove it when the boy wants to stool.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And already there is suppuration of the wound also from the consolidation of the wound or from postmortem changes.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	Therefore it is necessary to cut that consolidation, then treat with the one we said from treatment and the needle.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	¶ About the treatment of fistulas that occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter 80.
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	Fistulas which occur in the lower part are Nodules and Enlargements which occur near the deformed anus: or in a single part of one part: it is either a single fistula or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When that nodule becomes old, it opens, and white moisture or thin pus comes out of it.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And sometimes there are penetrating ones from these fistulas.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore the penetrating ones are known by that which comes out of evacuation, and moisture, when it is used in weak evacuation: and perhaps it comes out from those wombs.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And they are fistulas when they are in the space of penetrating ones until to the ute and to the virgin's meatus.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And they are penetrating until to the joint of the thigh, and to the nodule of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From that by which it is known that the fistula is penetrating to the anus, and even not penetrating, is, that you put your finger into the anus: and you put your finger into the subtle one into the fistula from air or iron: when there is no tortuosity.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	And if there is tortuosity in it, then you put into it a finger tentam from the knee subtle, or a pilum from the hair of horses, until you feel the tentam, or a pilum in your thumb.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not perceive the whole truth, nor does anything come out of the hole, nor breath, nor offspring as I said: then you know that it is not penetrable: therefore for the treatment.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	When the fistula is penetrable up to the bladder or to the urinary sediment: then its meaning is the exit of urine from it, and its prohibition for this so that the place can be healed with medicines.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If indeed it is penetrable up to the hip joint, or to the knee: then its sign is that it may pass through and try until it comes out, if there is no tortuosity up to the knee: and an finding of pain in the circumference of the part, and that pus always issues from it: and that it does not please in it any medicine, nor is it consolidated with ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in all these fistulas that are penetrable, there is no cure at all: and the cure of them is a labor and shame to him, from whom it is made.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In those however which are not penetrable and not old, hope for a cure with a bandage: according to what I tell you, and I have proved it: and it is that you lie weakly between your hands on his back: and extend his thighs above his hip bones, and his hips are inclined towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then he will introduce the introducer into the fistula if there is tortuosity in it, until you know where it may pass.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	If however he feels it weak around the anus, then it is necessary for you to introduce your finger into the anus.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	If then you feel with your finger that it has passed through itself already, detected, but not between your finger and the thumb, or between your flesh and the skin: then you know certainly that it is penetrable: therefore you do not labor in it, because it is not its cure, as I said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They said nevertheless because it is cured in some men by flesh, and through the medicine that is expected to be applied for strength, it is, as has been said before, that a fine needle is made hot and then inserted into the fistula until it goes around the anus.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat this twice or three times until you know that all those added and filtered flesh have become ashlike, which is similar to the feather of a pen, because it has been said.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then treat that with linen wraps dipped in butter until those ashlike flesh comes out, then treat it with ointments that generate and solidify flesh.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If it is cured, that is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then it will never be cured with another treatment.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if it comes out and does not go around your thumb, which is in the anus, and it is between it and the spilled flesh from the flesh, or sifac: and you see the fistula in it that follows the surface of the skin, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and you cut with the skin as you try it that is in the fistula until it goes around the extremity of the tryout, and the tryout is freed and falls.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then clean those filtered flesh that is similar to the feather of a pen, so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If however blood does not come out of you, and it splits between you and the operation that you do so that those flesh can leave: then better what is done, and more beneficial for your strength, to cauterize it with fire or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For the cauterization with fire brings good associations, adds the ashlike of those flesh, and the separation of blood and the drying of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then that care, when the liniments have been applied to honey or thoroughly tritured wool, until the spot emits pus, and those burned flesh comes out in pus.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then the care then the heel when the ointments that are forming hard flesh, and are those medicines in which there is stimulation and exfoliation: and they are the remedies in which there is stimulation and exfoliation.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	For when they rest, then it is already cured: and there is no fear of repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	However, if the fistula has already become inflamed up to the depth of the anus, and is extended beyond the excess of the body: then insert your finger into the anus, and explore with it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	If then you feel a trial, and there is flesh or blood between you, and near to penetration: then there is no operation in that, except according to the confidence and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	That is, because it is given in that one of three modes: either to burn it itself, as we said: or to leave it, until you have obtained cohesion of this, so that it may be possible for you to insert the liniment and the cure from the nearest.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the cut, so as not to injure the surrounding thigh, and there may be an exit from the least excrement without desire.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then care for that which we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps it will be cured: or extend it and cleanse it after you have removed it as far as the anus, as we said, or when you try, or with another sharp edge.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those flesh filtered that are in the cut, until where you can with scrutiny.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then dare to restoration of the wound of the whole with the cut, and the opening above where it is consolidated: and there will remain the fistula open in the inner part of the anus, and it will be less on the weakest.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	When the fistula is ready, it is done as follows: and when you insert your finger into the fistula, it is found on the side of the anus near the surface of the body, with the skin and the margin of the anus: then take the perforated end, which is like a lancet of Aleskef, that is, the preparation of coria, according to this form.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And insert the thread into it, wound around five times, approximately.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then insert the tentaculum with the thread into the fistula, until the cohesion of it is reached.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If then it passes through the margin of the anus internally near, then take out the thread from that hole: so that you can insert your finger into the anus, and take out the end of the thread, and gather together both ends of the thread simultaneously: and tie them together, and let it hang for one or two days: and as much as the thread may penetrate into the flesh, tie it firmly, until the flesh that is between the two ends of the thread falls off and drops out: then care for the wound, until it heals and becomes sound.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If the opening of the fistula is not easily penetrated, then make it penetrate in whatever way is most convenient for you, unless it is very deep.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For you do not have a knife to make it in order not to cut it.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then make it as we have said, until it heals.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The form of the Spatumilis spikes, from which the fistula is made, whose edge is sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not penetrate what is not necessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	¶ About the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision: and care for the cuts.
Caput LXXXI.	Head 81.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are two types of varices.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or they are within the anus, resembling carbon or prunes, or almost like grains of salt.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And among them are small and large ones, and blood runs constantly from them, it is always the same, and there are many of them.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus and at its extremities.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those that are outside the anus are of few moistures, from which water white runs, or a little blood flows continuously: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment of it that is inside the anus is like that of a weak person who has been beaten with an ass's hide: and it is expressed until it goes out of the anus, and becomes visible to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore, also suspend them with gut or hold them with your own grease.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them at their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	If they are not held by the gut, because of their moisture and their own softness: then take them with a rough cloth, or with a brush made from wool, and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and apply some warm ointment to them after cutting, so that they hold their place at the site of cauterization.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what is prescribed in the chapter on cauterization.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with the rest of the treatment until they heal.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	If the anus does not yield to the exit of the stool, then apply a weak ointment in which there is a small biting in the clister, so that it may be easy to expel with what is inside the anus, and it will yield quickly when it is expelled.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	If however the warts are outside the anus, then they are easier to remove, more accessible: and it is best to capture them with your nail, or with a razor, and cut them off.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them in the manner we have said, until they heal.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And if someone dislikes cutting with iron, then it is necessary to apply a suture to them according to this method.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take the thread enveloped in the wart, and insert it into the anus.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then remove the wart from above, and make it penetrate with the needle into the root of it from the other side: and envelop the two ends of the thread with the point of the needle in the lower part, making them parallel: and fasten the wart firmly.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then cut the thread, and remove the wart.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Do this with all the warts, and let one out of them: nor take your own, lest it causes a surplus of blood from that one.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place a cloth soaked in rose or cinnamon oil on the anus, and place the wart on top of it: and instruct the patient to remain still.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then let it fall off, until it falls off.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	When the warts fall off, take care of them with ointments and further treatment until they heal.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	¶ Regarding the treatment of Fissures.
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	Indeed they often occur due to the dryness of the feces and the constriction of nature.
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	When they become too large and do not respond to medical treatment: then it is necessary to make them moist with the points of salt or with your nail, until they become soft, and remove the upper part of the cortex which prevents them from being consolidated.
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	Then take care of them until they are consolidated according to what is appropriate.
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	If they do not consolidate, then repeat them with a more severe reasoning than the first, until they bleed much and then let them care for them until they heal.
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	De cure of Alimari for wounds that are opening and those that are not, and of ants and termites.
Caput LXXXII.	Chapter 82.
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	Know that Alimari is only a round node according to the color of the body, similar to the hair clinging to it, and it occurs throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and fingers: and it causes pain during walking.
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	Therefore, it should be cut off where it clings to the hair, and held with thorns, or with a razor, and it should be uprooted from its root.
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	Then treat that: and if you wish to cauterize it according to what is said in the chapter of that wound.
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	From ants, however, the small and sharp ones are a single prominence, rough, filtered, round above the surface of the body.
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	And they often occur in the hands of children.
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	The treatment of it is to extend the ant, and cut it off: or pull it off with a thread from silk: or with wool until it falls off.
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you wish, cauterize it according to what was said with fire, or with sharp medicine: and already the Atheli opening and not opening wounds are removed with the instrument that I will say.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	Formica is also a small and rough prominence, large, on the surface of the body, crawls into the valley of cold water: and when it finds the cold, it feels like a sting of the ant in its whole body, and it happens most in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	The treatment for this is to take a quill from a goose or a strong swan's feather, and place it over the formicacia until the circle of the quill from its parts holds.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then roll your hand with the quill, until the part that is in the circumference of the formicacia is separated: and place it in deep flesh, and dig out the formicacia from the root of it.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, do this with the quill of copper or iron, according to this shape.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	The upper part of the quill should be drawn up to the height, being wrapped around it, so that it rises above the grasp of the finger and its rolling.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you wish to cauterize the formicacia according to what was said in the chapter of cauterization about Athel,
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	¶ About the shapes of instruments which are used for Clisteries in diseases of the Anus, and for the venting of the bowels, and for the relief of colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter 83.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	When a Clistery is made from silver or gold, or from melted bronze, or from hammered iron.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And sometimes it is made from these instruments of small and large sizes, according to those which are used in them.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	Therefore that which is given for the care of young children should be small; and of those whose anus is weak or painful, so also should be their Clistery.
Clistere magnum.	Large Clistery.
Cistere paruum.	Small Clistery.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	The head of the Clistery, that is, where the uter is tied, should be broad according to this manner: and there should be a distinction so that it may be placed on the uter as you see, and the lower part of its opening which enters into the anus should be round, that is, not open, soft, gently drawing towards the subtlety: and in one side there should be two foramens, and in the other side one.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	The size of the foramen should be according to the size of the teeth, and smaller in larger ones, and they should be placed in the one in which medicines are made from animal secretions: either from the paw of a small animal, such as the squirrel, which has a form similar to the small toe: whose root is a single thumb.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And let there be holes multiplied as it rotates, and let there be a space that is between the grossness of all the digits.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert a thick thread into those holes, perhaps from ten threads, or about it, and gather it with the udder like that of the squirrel.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	When the udder is placed on it, the membrane should be tied at the head of the clitoris between two distinct constrictions of strong force.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then tie the membrane with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the circle depicted here, and the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of tying it with it is: to fill the udder, or the medicine, which is heated according to the tolerance of the weak: and be careful not to make it hot or cold vagina.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then the weak one will lie down on its back, and will raise its legs to the upper parts: and put under it a blanket, that is, the layer over which men lie, or a linen cloth.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then anoint the end of the membrane with oil, or with almond oil, or with Greek mucilage, or similar.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert it into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then the midwife will take the udder with both hands of her, and express it with force, until all that is in the membrane is emptied into the intestine.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then take out the membrane, and raise the weak legs to the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If medicine considers it to be the end, then let her hold as much as she can.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps with her all night, it is better for the incision.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	If you, however, apply the bandage to his ailments of the fluid, and he hastens its end: then reapply the bandage until it is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids in the anus, or painful apostemata, then the bandage should be a fine, soft one, made of cloths on which children are bandaged.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this should be the form of the fine bandage over which the cuticle is tight.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	¶ On the treatment of head wounds without breaking the bones.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Head LXXXIIII.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken of the treatment of wounds that were suitable for division in the division, and I will now tell you the treatment of those wounds with my hand and with medicines according to the complement.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say then that wounds are divided according to the kind of wound and according to the place where the bone falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	Therefore, by which wounds are made, they are like the fall of a stone: or the cut of an ensign, or a knife: or the blow with a lance, or a piece of wood, or an arrow: and similarly from many things.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	However, wounds that are made according to the place of the body are like this: such as the bone which falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the ear: and similar ones from these parts.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am telling you about the treatment of some wounds so that I can lay down reasoning and order for the rest of the wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds: for the reminder of the writers will not be at the beginning of the third chapter.
Dico ergo.	I say therefore.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	When a simple wedge occurs in the head and there is no fracture of the bones: then consider whether it is from a fall or similar, and whether it has merely scratched the skin: and if it is a large wound, and you fear the outcome of the treatment on the weak one: then immediately perform a cranial phlebotomy: and do not delay this: and remove it from the blood according to the strength of its power: if it does not prevent something from phlebotomy, especially if it is blood that is escaping from the wound.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side of the wound.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And beware of the weak one being overfed, and with rich foods.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If something prevents reduction, then it is less from food, and it will not approach flesh, nor wounds.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place over the wound if it happens to the head a hot application, a warm ointment in rose oil alone, or with wine that is steeped.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If you are careful about the hot application from the wound, then place over the head if it is fresh with its own blood, and has not changed the air, the boy I will tell you about in a moment: and if it has changed the air, then place over it some ointment until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If the head is large, or it is from an incision with a sword, and similar: and the lips are not gathered together with the flaps, then gather them together with the suture, according to what I will tell you about the wounds of the lungs about their sutures.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If the wound has already been detected from the bone, and it hangs down, and there is no hold on it except in a small suspender: then cut it off.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then he treats the wound with medicines and restores the hard flesh in its place, and instructs the patient to eat foods rich in nutrients such as the head and cooked wheat, until it is soft enough to be chewed, and similar foods.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If I find putrefaction in the skin and it does not adhere to the bone, then I will cut out the putrid whole and remove it, and then I will treat it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	However, if there is an artery or a vein from which blood flows in these wounds, and it is not cut out by medicines, then I will investigate the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If I find that it has not been cut, then I will dry it with salt or tie it.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the need arises to cause it when it does not heal what I said, then I will cauterize it until the blood is cut out.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	However, if these wounds are small and simple, then the treatment of them is easy, as this child does to it: for he consolidates it before he changes the air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	Mode of the child's healing.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Recipe of the child's ointment. Mix one part of oil, and two parts of dried blood, and three parts of unburnt lime, and stir them well together, and apply them to the wound, and bind it with a good constriction, until it adheres well on top of it, and coagulates with the blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then bind it up from above with the child's hair, and let it remain until it does not fall off, so that it will not come off.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For this remedy will not be removed until it is healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And when it makes lime alone, when there is no oil for you, and dried blood also makes the same operation on many great wounds, when it comes together that it may be laid on them and tied, and they are recent wounds with their own blood, which has not been changed by air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	When the air has been altered by some other means, especially during the time of childhood, then the intention of this child is not in place: therefore, take care of it as we said, by putting on it some ointment made from digested unguent: or put on it powders made from farina hordei, made with water and honey, until the pus comes out.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then, take care of the rest of the treatment, until they are healed.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If, however, a fracture occurs with a bone, and it is small, then extract that with the help of the Gestalt: and I will now say the treatment for fractures of the head in that which will be.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	¶ Of Wounds of the Neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Head LXXXV.
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If, however, a fracture occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in treatment between the two, and when it is simple in the head.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If, however, the nerve of the neck has already been cut, or the artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no genius in it unless it is to be healed by the treatment that makes a vivid stipticum, such as zinc, and zegi, and those like them.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	For nerves are harmful, and they contract them.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not put anything cold on the fracture: for the substance of the nerves is cold, and its continuation is with the brain, which is a higher member: and that which is to be healed should be treated with gentle medicines, such as lime with water several times infused with oil, or with rose oil and thyme, when it is washed with sweet water: and other mineral stones, in this way, and wet ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If, however, the fracture is large, then administer a suture: or sew the lips of it with threads of silk.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it itself, until it is healed.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If indeed the wound is deep, and it happens to have a cavity in its lower part, where pus begins to gather, then make a hole in that more depressed part of it.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If the artery in the wound has already been cut, and blood flows from it: then separate or dry it, or bandage it yourself: or cauterize it if necessary for that.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If the trachea has already been cut, or the whole thing is open, and the wounds are healed: then gather the edges of the skin with the suture above the trachea, and do not touch the trachea itself, even if it is equal to it, and reduce it back over the natural figure.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tighten it in a proper way, and release it after a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with ointments in which there is styptic and escharotic, until it is healed.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it: then if there are fragments of bones in it, take them all out, or as much as you can: and what is not prepared, release it until the wound puts out and separates and runs out of its exit.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the wound is recent, then dress it with a poultice made from the pus that I will tell you.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If it seems in the wound that a fistula has formed, then take care of it with the one who will come to his chapter in memory.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	§ About the wound in Splints.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter LXXXVI.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If it is a blow from a lance or an arrow, and you see its depth, then consider it.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If blood comes out of the wound when the weak one wants to get out of it, then you know that the wound is mortal.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it lacks depth and is fresh with its own blood, do not place the child at the first hour, nor string it up, so that blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart, and weakens the weak one. But place on it an attractive ointment and dissolve it in two days.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	If the ointment is not at hand, then place a softened piece of dough in the wound opening, so that it absorbs what is exiting from there due to moisture: and let the weak one sleep on the belly, so that it circulates what is gathering in it.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	If already three days have passed, or more, and there is no spasm in the wound, nor bad heart trembling, nor stricture in the throat, and you see other good positions of it: then you know that the belly is safe.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Therefore, treat it itself and with lancets, and the rest of the treatment, until it recovers.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If its recovery is excused, and it has always opened, then you know that it has become a fistula.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Therefore, treat it from its own chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the belly is from an incision of a sword or a knife, and it is simple on the surface of the chest, or back: then treat it with what precedes from the suture, if it is large: or with dust, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if it has already made an impression on the bone, and the flakes come out of it: then search for the belly, and proceed to remove those flakes, if they are separated.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If they are not separated, then let them be, until the belly putsrefies: for it is extracted by their growth.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	The judgment of the other wound accidents in the other parts is the judgment that I have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	Of wounds of the liver, and exit from the intestines, and their exit.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter 87.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The dislocation of the liver is great, and medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	Therefore, when the liver is greatly dislocated, or the number of intestines, they will exit.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Why is introduction made of theirs, and their suture is more difficult and painful.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And even a small dislocation can be difficult from another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	Therefore, it should be difficult to reduce them if you do not immediately proceed to their introduction: for it swells, opens, and becomes engorged, therefore it is difficult to enter theirs.
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, a medium dislocation is better for dislocations: for when it is not difficult to reduce the intestine, as it is easy to be split in these two kinds.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	You know that the suture of the liver is according to four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two sutures are common to the suture of the liver and to the suture of other wounds of the body: and two other sutures properly communicate with other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	However, they are more proper when it is the suture of the liver: and I tell you one with the exposure and declaration.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say that when a wound is small, and something comes out of the intestine, and it is difficult to reduce it back: then it is for one of the two modes.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or because of the smallness of the dislocation, as I said: Or because there is swelling in the intestine from the cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When that is so, then it is necessary to heat it, as you would dip a sponge or a damp cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	If you choose to boil it in water with peppermint, and saffron, and a pinch of nutmeg, and wash the intestine with this mixture until the inflammation is resolved.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	When it makes this wine in which there is stipticity: and it is better than water alone in the resolution of inflammation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When you see the inflammation already resolved, then moisten the intestine with water in which the aloe was boiled, or the mint.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For this the entrance of it will become small when that is used.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If however the return of its discharge is after this treatment, then find in the disruption of it a little, with the instrument by which hemorrhoids are cut off.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first treatment is better when it is prepared, than the section: and there is no compulsion to cut it off after necessity and the lack of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	Let one part of it be untortured, sharp, and the other part not sharp, and let its end not be subtle with subtility of Spatumilis, indeed it should be less sharp than that: and it is like the caida, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When the gut is enlarged and enters the intestine, then it is necessary for it to be reduced according to its natural form in its own place, if possible over it: because it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When however the disruption is wide in the lower part of the belly: then it is necessary for you to make the weak lie on its back and place its legs higher than its head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the belly: then place its head and its chest higher than its lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And similarly if the disruption is in one of two parts of the belly: then place your intention and your consideration always in this, that the part where the gut is should be the higher part of the other.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	It is necessary, therefore, to administer this in large wounds, and in medium-sized wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, place it according to how it is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make it present between your hands, a wise servant who will hold the whole wound with her hand, and gather her lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then pull out from it what follows the suture something else: and this is the common method of one suture.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, that you take a thorn or the number of a thorn according to the size of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let go of the quantity of the thumb ring at the end of the wound, that is, of the physician: and take a single thorn and insert it in the thread in two extremities of the skin, with two extremities of the skin squeezed what is under the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from another part, and you have already gathered two extremities of the skin and two extremities of the squeezing: and four orders are formed.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tie with thread twice around the thorn several times from two parts at once, until the two lips of the wound are gathered together by the method of the lips.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let go of the size of the thumb and take another thorn in them, then tie it with thread as you did with the first one.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	And so do not stop making it with that from which you draw the thorn, until you complete the constriction of the wound entirely.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And they should be medium-sized between the size and the fineness, for fine thorns quickly pierce the flesh, and large ones are difficult to enter into the skin, therefore it is necessary that they be medium-sized in fineness and size.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	It is not necessary for the acupuncture point to be shown in two extremities of the skin of the proximate cut: so that the flesh does not wound quickly, and the wound does not open before the consolidation of its own, and neither do the sides elongate even with the suture, so that the wound is not prevented from consolidating.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then incise the point of the acupuncture at its extremity so that it does not hurt the weak one in their sleep: and place on them flax from all sides which hold the extremity of the acupuncture point: and release them until you know that the wound is already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this species of suture with the acupuncture point is more suitable for wounds in infants.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For there is enough of one or two or about them in their suture.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	However, the second suture is common, and it is joined with the first four extremities of the skin: the two extremities of the skin, the two extremities of the suture, and the two extremities of the suture are sewn together in one drop of water, with a thread of equal length and thickness, and grossness.
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you have pierced these four extremities with the acupuncture point, draw the acupuncture point from the side from which you entered it, so that the thread falls from the upper part of the wound: so that the suture is as the suture of the cloth in which they are tied, and place between all the sutures a quantity of the grossness of the little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This suture is known by men.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And when this suture I used for the wound of my son who was wounded with a sword and it was a greater rupture of the wound by one palm: and it came out of the intestines about two palms from the middle intestine, and it was a rupture in the middle of the belly.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	I will now perform this operation after his bowel has been exposed outside for twenty-four hours.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound has since healed in the area that was about fifteen days ago: I cared for it and he has recovered: and later, after many years, he returned to his former condition.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	The physicians determined that he could not be cured.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	It was a miracle that I could not cure it with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	Because I was in the place where I could not find the ointment, nor anything from the medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I then applied an old bandage twice a day on the wound, and frequently washed it with honeyed water until it was cured.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	There are two types of proper sutures according to the narration of the speech.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And it is that you begin with the sharp suture: and you introduce the needle from the outside to the inner part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	And when the needle has pierced the skin and gone through the tendon according to the length and width of the whole body: let the end of the sifac be on the side where you inserted the needle, and make it penetrate to the other end from the inner part to the outer in the other end.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	And when you make it to penetrate, then make it penetrate in this way in the same end: and let the end of the sifac which is in that side be free, and make the needle penetrate into the other end from the inner part to the outer: and make it penetrate with the penetration you make in the sifac end which is in its part until it passes through the whole.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then continue and also from this side, and take it out with the end which is from the sifac to the other side, and pull out the needle from the skin which has penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then reduce it to that skin, and cut it off at its extremity which is on the other side, when you have mirrored it: and pull it out from the skin of that part, and make one of them like this, and the other like that: and make the other like this, until you have cut off all its external parts according to this example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the sum of this suture is that it resembles the suture of the hair of animals, whereby their hair is cut: so that you cut it off from one part on one side of the skin, and let it go from another part on the other side, until you have completed it.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	Second type of suture, as said by Gale.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	This is the report of his speech, that he cuts it according to the likeness of some parts which are cut by certain physicians, in such a way that they gather all parts suitable for their own comparison by nature: and he reflects the extremity of the suture to its other extremity, and the extremity mirrored to the other extremity of it.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And it is done according to what I told you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	It is necessary that you carve it nearby to the mirrored extremity on the outside part, and make it pierce into the inner part of that same spot: and let go of both extremities of the suture.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then roll it again, and make it pierce from the outside part to the inner part through both extremities of the suture, that is, on both sides.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then roll it again, and make it pierce from the inner part to the outer part through both extremities of the suture, that is, on both sides: and let go of the other two extremities on the opposite side.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of suture is a better common suture, and is the suture whose remembrance I mentioned earlier.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is indeed a speech of Galen's as well.
Et dixerunt quidam.	Some said something.
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The wound suture is corrected with two incisors.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	The procedure is to insert one thread into each of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle, from that which is near you, and make it pierce until it reaches another side, according to the sutures of those who wear corslets equally.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And you know that when there is a rupture in the middle of the lung: then the suture of this part is more difficult than the other parts of the lung.
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	The judgment of the surgeon's wound is the judgment of the other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	The procedure is to place the bowel, and its own, and make it ready, and then place it over the fresh flesh.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the air has already changed the wound: then place some ointment on top of it, which is with you, until they form pus: and the threads will fall away, and they will be comfortable, and they will marvel.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then treat it as the treatment of the other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	If however, the medicines are not with you: then place it immediately over it, and let it begin to emit pus, and the old dressing: and change it twice a day, as I have taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medicines in many positions, when the wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	If however, you fear that the wound will spread to the principal limbs of the injury: then it is necessary to put on soft linen in warm oil, or in rose oil: and place it around the places which are between the thighs, and under the sheets.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	If he feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in his intestines (for this often happens), then he should apply clisterization with wine tincture, black, warm: especially if putridity has permeated the intestine and a rupture has been made through to the connection of the parts.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And know that what is outside the large intestine is easier to heal, and that which is from the subtle intestines is harder to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	However, the intestine called the Jejunum does not receive healing from wine that occurs in it altogether: and this is due to the multitude of its branches which are from the uterus, and its size, and because of the subtlety of its body, and its proximity to its own nature of nerves.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	However, if that which proceeds from the uterus is zirbum, and it has been recently taken, reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If space does not remain for it, and it has already become yellow or black: then it is necessary to bind it with thread above the place from which the blood has been drained from it, so that there will be no flow of blood.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	For in zirbum are veins and arteries.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	Then cut that which is beyond the ligament, and hang two ends of the thread from the lower part of the wound outside it: so that the attraction of its tail may be drawn towards you, and the extraction of its own from the wound of zirbum, and the emission of pus from the wound.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Rememoration of the wound that occurs in the intestine.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When a disruption occurs in the intestine and is small: then it is possible that it can be restored in some men, because I have seen who was wounded in his belly with the stroke of the lance, and it was from the right stomach, and it was old, and a fistula was made, and it was expelled from there with excrement and wind.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	I have applied the treatment, up to the point where I was not swollen with the healing of this wound: nor did I cease from subtling it, until it was healed and the site consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the site to be consolidated, I feared a further harm from an infirmity that could happen to another infirmity: and it does not happen to him from that infirmity.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better habits, eating and drinking, and awaiting, and entering the bath, and exercising on his diet.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some experimenters have said that when it happens in the intestine, and is small: then it should be treated in this way.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is like the large ants' heads you take.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then gather the two lips of the wound, and place one ant on them, which has an open mouth, over the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	And when it comes down on them, and closes its mouth, the head of it will detach itself, for it holds and does not come apart.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing this with the ant after the ant, according to the size of the wound of the whole.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce it again, and its belly.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	For those heads will remain attached to the intestine until it is eaten by the intestine, and healed, and no further harm comes to it.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is now possible that the intestine be treated with silk: which has been taken out of the animal intestine, and attached with it after it is inserted into the abscess.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is like taking the end of this silk from the intestine, and much will be extracted.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then, tie the end of the thread tightly under the knot.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then, insert that thread into the stomach, and pull out the intestine with it.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then, reduce it back to its original position.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of suture with the ants and the intestine is not unless by faith and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You know, the gallstone that is large, wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then there is no genius except in subtlety, and there is no cure at all.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	¶ About the treatment of Zuchi and Fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Head 88.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You know that every gallstone, or abscess when it becomes old and antiquated, and turns into a sore, and does not consolidate, and always emits pus, and does not abscess: then we call it universally in whatever member it may be, and we call it Zuchemen.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula indeed is according to truth, a filtered node, hard, white: with which there is no pain, of which the feather-like bend is connected: and for this reason some call it Risati, that is, the feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is in certain hours moist, which emits pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps the moisture is divided in certain hours.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And sometimes this moisture is much, and is little: and it is thick, and it is subtle.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already predicted the division, then when I said wound, that every sore which does not heal, and is not born in the flesh, is not this but for one cause of causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	Of which one is, either because of the scarcity of blood in the body: or because of its malice: or because there is hard and dry flesh between it and the lips of it, preventing the birth of flesh: or because it is full of sordidness and shame: or because the sore is putrid within itself, and the matter which is sent to it is of bad quality: or because the medicine is inconvenient in its cure: or because the decaying falls in the region is a kind of pestilence, or through the nature of the region, as happens in Caesaraugusta: where difficult digestion of diseases is made, and the healing of the abscess by nature is slow: or because there is one bone, or a number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	I have already shown you all these causes and signs of the wounds, as well as the treatments for them with medicines in division: it is necessary for me to show you now how to make you know the treatment of fistulas and abscesses, which are made by a vascular operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	Therefore, you should know that a fistula can occur in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For example, there are fistulas that infiltrate into the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or tendons: or into the intestine, or into the urethra, or into some part of the ribs: or into some part of the joints composed of bones: such as the hands and feet: and they infiltrate into the proximity of the main member, and so on.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Therefore, from these fistulas, it is according to this manner that they are difficult of cure, and do not receive treatment, and the occupation with them is labor and ignorance.
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	If it is from a fistula whose depth does not infiltrate into these locations that I have mentioned: and you hope, and trust in the cure of it, and wish to know its nature, then take a tent, or iron, if the fistula tends according to the right line, and examine it with it.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	But if there is a winding in the fistula, then examine it with a thin silver tent.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	For lead, when it is relaxed by its own body, and curves around the winding.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	If the fistula has many openings, it is not possible for you to understand anything with the tent on it.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	Therefore, cliste from these openings from their own openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For the humidity with which you cliste it, runs to the other openings, and goes out from them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then, carefully examine according to what mode it is possible for you: so that you know that here is the bone, or nerve, and the fistula's connection is long or short: or it is a fistula with many openings, and stands above all this, with the full strength of your own: with your questioning, which asks about weakness, and with your discovery of pain at the compression with your hand on the place, and similar signs and causes of wounds.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then, when you stand above all that station with truth, then go to treatment with confidence: and it is as you consider now, if the fistula is near appearing, or in a distant place from the wound, or from a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or one of the places I told you, then open the fistula according to what I have said in my narration, and remove what is in it by filtration and decayed tissues that are formed in its opening from the flesh, or thickness, and similar: and care for it until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If however the fistula is long and deep, and is according to the rightness: then it is necessary for you to cut it down as far as it is possible for you.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it from all decayed flesh of it.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then apply an unbound lint to the sharp medicines: and thrust it as far as the connection of the fistula that you have grasped with iron: do with it while it corrodes the sharp medicine entirely that remains in the connection of the fistula from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments which generate healthy skin, until it heals.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	If however it does not heal by this, then cauterize it according to what we have said.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	If then the cause of the fistula is the mouth, and it is certified to you that this is so: then investigate it and cleanse it according to what I have informed you. If nothing prevents you from anything out of the mind, or nerve, or a primary member, as I have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	If then it is discovered to you that the mouth has a corruption, and it is black: then wash it until the entire corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it with what is mixed with it, until it heals.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	If then it does not heal and emits pus as before: then you know that you have not succeeded in the complete removal of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	Then wash it over again, and make a precise measurement of it, and cleanse it with the last strength of your own.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	If then it heals, that is good: and if not, then you know that this corruption is deep within the far reaches of the body, which you have not been able to reach.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	It is not therefore your ingenuity, unless you let go of nature itself.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	If then the small mouth is corrupted and it is possible for you to draw it with fine needles which are suitable for that.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	If then there are many bones, then make a precise measurement of their attraction, and do not let anything escape from them with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	If then something contradicts you from the moisture and there is no fear of cutting them, or an error: then cut those moistures and flesh, if there are any, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	If then there is not for you a preparation to remove the bones from your hour: then place it on the side that putsrefies itself: and let it be until it putrefies what is in the circumference of those bones from the flesh and moisture.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	Guard the wound so it does not scar.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And secure the incision you made in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	Place a poultice on it, if you wish, made with ground sulfur mixed with oil: or a poultice made with ground sulfur in Egyptian ointment, or any other violet ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	When those moistures putrefy, and the bones separate from them, the release of those parts, and their attraction.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If however the bone is one large one, such as the thigh bone or the hip bone, and similar to it, and that which is corrupted from it is a large part: then scrape it off in the last reasonable way, until the blackness and corruption are removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the wound.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If however that which is in it corrupted is a large part, and the blackness has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to sew it up, and stitch it all the way to the place where the blackness has reached: then care for it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I tell you, what happens to a man in his thigh: that you place that example and aid above your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	There was a young man of about thirty years of age, who had pain in his thigh, caused by something that moved within his body, that is, from the inside out, until the matter reached the knee, and there it became a ganglion: and it was not caused by an external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	Therefore, at that time, it extended with the error of the physicians, until the ganglion was opened, and many matters came together with it.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And then the care of it was applied, until the throbbing of the knee was made, and many openings were made in it: which all emitted pus and moisture from the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	The physician, therefore, took care of the multitude of doctors for about two years, and there was no wise man in the art of hand-making, until I was called, and saw his skill, and the materials that were flowing from these large openings: even the whole body of the patient had been washed, and its color was yellow.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	Therefore, we introduced the probe into one of the openings, and it was wet to the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings: and I found them to be wet throughout from all parts of the thigh.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	Then I proceeded, and after examining one of them, I continued on another until I detached a part of the bone: and I found it to be corrupted, which was already corrupt, and worn away, and decayed, and hollowed out, until it had reached the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	Then I saw what I had found, and it was prepared from the corrupt bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I ordered that there was no corruption in the bone except that which had been cut off, and I sawed it.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I have already removed it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I applied a wound restoration with the solidified medicines over a long space of time.
Et non est consolidatum.	And it is not solidified.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried again, and I detached a part of the bone above the first detection: and I found continued corruption with the bone: and I sawed what I had seen and prepared from the same corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I tried to restore it.
Et non est restauratum.	And it is not restored.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Then I detached it again, and I did not stop hitting the particular bone, and trying to restore it: and it is not restored until I hit about a palm of bone, and extract that with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I restored it with the medicines, and it was quickly consolidated and healed, and this repetition in the operation and section of it was not necessary except for the weakness of the patient, the lack of tolerance of its treatment, and my fear of it due to death, for it happened to it in all hours from the excess of the evacuation syncopate evil.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	Therefore it was healed by proper treatment: and a bone hardness was found in its place, and a good position was made in its body, and its strength returned: and it was turned to its own dispositions: and it did not cause any harm to its walking.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	But if an eminent bone is already fractured in its place: then it is necessary to reduce it as follows: and it is: take the ligament, and tie it at the extremity of the eminent bone: and command someone to extend it upwards: and put another ligament of coarser wool as the first ligament.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then tie it over the flesh which is under the bone: and extend its extremity so that you draw the flesh down to the lower parts: and you may hold the flesh on the place where you wish to reduce it, so that it does not hurt the reduction of the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place a plank or a table under the bone below: for when you do this, it is not forbidden that the corrupted flesh may seep out.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that the reduction be on the place of the corrupted flesh slightly, so that it does not be in concoction with the bone corruption: and it should not appear to the sense of sight, and compel to the reduction of its viscus another reduction.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	For if the bone is corrupted and not eminent, then at least a part of it remains with another part: and the corruption is in the middle of it or in its own part: then hold the flesh completely from all parts.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place the wood below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then cut it from the first side, where the decay is, until the second cut is complete: and the cut should be according to the length of the decay, as we say.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	If the decay is in the joint, cut the corrupt joint and cut the bone where it continues on the other side.
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	If the decay is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no ingenuity except in the cut.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	If the decay is in the hand or foot pectoral muscle, then it is difficult to do that.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	Indeed, you should inquire about the appearance of the decay as it appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And cut it, and dress it according to whatever possible disposition you can, and with whatever ingenuity is suitable for you: when it does not make you any contradiction of the vein, or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And you know that the incisions and cuts for this bone are many, according to the position of the bone, and the preparation of them, and their bulk, and their subtlety, and their magnitude, and their equality, and their hardness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore, it is necessary to prepare the instrument of every kind of operation that is suitable for this operation.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And you know that these operations mean something good to you with the quality of the instrument you use, when you have a long desire.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of the modes of this art, and the testimony of the diseases: then you will find by yourself what is suitable for that with the instruments for all diseases.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I assure you of the last of this book, the number of instruments that you place on top of which you cut examples, and the test of which you try on others.
Forma Serrae.	The translation of "Forma Serrae" from medieval Latin to English is "Serpent's Form". However, without additional context, it's difficult to provide a more precise translation. The term "Serrae" in this context likely refers to the serpentine or serrated shape, rather than the animal itself.
Forma alterius Serrae.	The translation of "Forma alterius Serrae" from medieval Latin to English is "Another Serpent's Form". Again, without additional context, it's difficult to provide a more precise translation. The term "alterius" indicates that this is a different serpentine or serrated shape, rather than the one previously mentioned.
Forma Serrae alterius.	The translation of "Forma Serrae alterius" from medieval Latin to English is "Another Serpent's Form". This phrase suggests that there are multiple serpentine or serrated shapes being referred to in the context. Without additional context, it's difficult to provide a more precise translation.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Apologies for the repetition. The translation of "Forma Serrae alterius" from medieval Latin to English is "Another Serpent's Form". This phrase indicates that there are multiple serpentine or serrated shapes being discussed in the context. Without additional context, it's difficult to provide a more precise translation.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	The translation of "Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta" from medieval Latin to English is "This serpentine form depicted, let it be done with propriety". This phrase suggests that the depiction of the serpentine form should be done in a manner that is appropriate or fitting. Without additional context, it's difficult to provide a more precise translation.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	The translation of "Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum" from medieval Latin to English is "Let its arc be higher, its sharpness from iron: and its handle from wood, and let it be properly made in a pyramidal form". This phrase suggests that the arc should be made with a sharp edge from iron, the handle should be made from wood, and the entire construct should be made in a pyramidal shape. The term "decenter facta" indicates that the construction should be done with proper care and attention to detail. Without additional context, it's difficult to provide a more precise translation.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	The translation of "Forma Rasorii iuncturarum" from medieval Latin to English is "Shape of Razor Blades". This phrase suggests that the text is discussing the shape of razor blades. Without additional context, it's difficult to provide a more precise translation.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	The translation of "Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi" from medieval Latin to English is "Let the head of this razor be shaped like a star: and its points be shaped like those of an elischetfegi". This phrase suggests that the head of the razor should be shaped like a star, and its points should be shaped like those of an elischetfegi. Without additional context, it's difficult to provide a more precise translation.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	The translation of "Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est" from medieval Latin to English is "And it does not fit, unless the heads joined be rubbed against it when they are corrupted, or the mouth is wide and large". This phrase suggests that the razor head should be rubbed against a specific surface in order for it to fit properly. The term "corrumpuntur" indicates that the heads should be corrupted or worn down in order for them to fit correctly. The phrase also suggests that the mouth of the razor should be wide and large, which may be related to the shape of the head. Without additional context, it's difficult to provide a more precise translation.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	The larger form of the razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	The medium form of the razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	The wide form of the razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	The form of the razor where there is a connection.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	The other less fine form of the razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	The other curved ends of the razor's form.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	The rough and fine pulls of the razor's form.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	The form of the razor where the bones are cut.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	The even larger form of the razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This resembles a hammer, and its end is like a saw; it is shown in many places from the bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The form of the razor that fits to the reason of this that has been made through bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its end is a triangle, and its sharp ends are at the ends.
Fit ex Indi.	It is made from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And similarly, it should be made that all which I have mentioned from the razors, and the saws, and the saws.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	About the cutting of the ends, and the binding of bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Head 89.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The ends are putrid, either from an external cause, or an internal one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When you will have been treated by a physician for that corruption, and the cure does not agree with it: and you see the corruption coming into the member, which does not remit anything: then it is necessary to cut that member all the way where the corruption comes, so that it may be weakened by that death, or by the greater defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign that happens to it is that the member is degraded, until it is thought that: that fire has burned it, or that it has become putrid after being blackened: until the putridity comes up to the part that follows that member, and spreads throughout the whole body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore, when making the incision of this wound, and similarly if the cause of corruption is from the strike of certain venomous creatures such as scorpions of the sea, and sharks, and wasps, and the like.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If then corruption or striking is at the tip of the finger, then cut the finger, and do not leave any space for corruption to spread until it reaches the other hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And similarly if it happens in the hand, then cut it from the root of the finger, and do not leave any space for corruption to spread until it takes hold in the shoulder blade.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it seeps into it, then cut the shoulder blade at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	But if corruption passes through it, and you see it around the elbow: then it is a sure death for the weak.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And to administer beyond that is the quantity of virtue.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And similarly when corruption seeps into the toe, then cut it at one of the nails: and if it takes hold in the sole of the foot, then cut the entire foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	But if it ascends to the thigh, then cut the thigh at the knee joint.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	If then corruption has already seeped above the thigh, then there is no virtue left except for release and leaving the weak to die.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the way of cutting or holding the limb is to pull the ligament in the lower part that you want to cut, and then pull another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And extend one ligament to the lower part, and extend another ligament above to the top.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And then separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments with the thumb, until the entire flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then it is cut or sharpened.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	It is necessary that you cover all parts of the patient with linen bandages, and do not let the scalpel touch the healthy place: and an injury added to the previous one becomes hot.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	However, if the blood flow inside becomes noticeable while you are operating, then cauterize the place roughly: or place some small swollen ones above it to absorb the blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then return to your medicine as soon as possible, until it is completed.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then tie the wounded limb with a suitable bandage and take care of it until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I tell you that something happens to the foot of the man, and this is the same thing I am telling you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	What is, because it happens in the foot of the man, with blackness that is similar to burning: and corruption first occurs in his finger, until it begins to affect the whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	Therefore the man was anxious to heal himself after he saw corruption spreading in his member, which he found from pain and burning: and he applied it at the joint and healed himself.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after a long time had passed, it happened to him that same corruption in his index finger of his hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	He came to me and I wanted to recover that excess with the thing I had put on his hand from the medicines after the cleansing of his body: and it was not reabsorbed, and began to go into another finger: until it began to corrupt in his hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	He called me to apply the hand to his: and I did not want to do that, hoping for the reabsorption of its excess: and I was also afraid of its death at the incision of his hand.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	Because the man's courage was over the wound.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	Afterwards, he despairing of me returned to his land, and came to me because he had failed, and stretched out his whole hand to me. And he was healed.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not include this account unless it be an aid to the cure of that kind of disease, and according to which it is to be applied.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	¶ Of the cure of Sinu, and the quality of dressing with ointments.
Caput XC.	Chapter 120.
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When an abscess occurs in certain parts of the flesh, and it lasts for a long time until the pus collects: then it either ruptures or is perforated, and it goes out what is in it, and leaves a watery place as if it were sweat: and the skin which is over it is like fine linen which has been washed: and it does not come to the end of corruption in its own self, nor does it press into the mouth, nor into the tendons, nor into the ligaments: rightly it is called Sinus: and it is not called Fistula: but if it lasts for a long time until it presses corruption into something of these parts, then it is called Fistula, or Zuken.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the care of it is to cut through that whole skin as much as possible: and especially when it has been made fine and smooth, like linen: and I am confident that it will not stick to its place on account of the corruption.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	But if you think that the skin will stick to it and not follow the last corruption: and if there is thickness in the skin from the flesh, then care for it with Clister: and it is as you consider for Sinus.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus that comes out of it has a bad odor: then clisterize it with the Egyptian ointment which is acetic acid, and oil, and zinc, receiving equal parts, and mixing them together over fire until the medicine reddens: and it will come to a thick consistency like honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what is necessary for you: and dissolve it with water and honey, and apply the candied sea with it: and close the opening of it, and release the medicine into it to the amount of two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract it with the expression: and make this for the days total, until the sea is cleansed and the odor is removed.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when it is candied with water and ash, and this medicine is not present for you: and it is good to take ash from dry wood, or ash from oak wood: and pour over it the water.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then take it and candied with it, and until you are confident that the sea has been washed.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	If the patient is not able to bear the medicine of Egypt, nor the ash water, then candied with water and honey, which has already been mixed with something from crushed ginger.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or candied with honey and wine, for the property of honey is to cleanse and wash, and make the wine stick to the sea, especially when in wine there is an excess of stiptic and drying properties.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you make it several times, and are sure that the sea corruption is removed: then candied with it that makes flesh to be born in it.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And it is good to take from the plaster of diphtheria: and dissolve it with rose oil, and wine tincture: or candied with some medicines and ointments whose properties I have written in the treatise on ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	If the opening of the sea is tight, in which the cannula does not enter: then enlarge it with iron almost: or place in it the loose ligature in ointment Egyptian, or in ointment basilicon, until it is enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	If the opening is also large, then gather the lips of it with the suture, and release the amount by which it enters the clyster without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	If the opening from which the pus flows is perforated into the lower part: then dry it in the lower place that is in it, so that the pus may flow downwards: for when the pus is compressed in the depth of the cavity, it prevents the flesh from being generated in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	If you are unable to dry the cavity in that lower part according to what you wish: then try to prepare the member by preparation, so that the pus may flow out from it with facility according to what is prepared for you.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try to prevent anything from being retained in the pus entirely, and take solid dressings that are placed over the sign, agreeable to what you desire.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend them over the flax bandage.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let the flax bandage be of such a size as to make communication of the whole cavity.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then make an incision with needles in the direct opening of the cavity, and slightly larger than the opening.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend a soft ointment over the flax bandage according to the size of the opening: and place it over the position far from the opening of the cavity, so that the exit of the pus may be from there: and you will not remove the large bandage, unless after some days one is needed only once.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	But that which is above the opening of the cavity, is the one that moves every hour, so as to go out that which is collected in it from the pus: and so you may know whether that which runs out from it is much, or little: or digested, or not digested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And when you again consider the place of the cavity of that member, whether the lord of it feels pain in it, or there is no pain in it, or whether there is an apostematic swelling in it, or not.
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	When you thus apply your medicine in this manner and see the matter which is passing over the orifices of the Sinus, then you know that the Sinus has already adhered or is approximating its adhesion: therefore, dissolve it in the morning or on the third day: and when you have dissolved the gum, then turn the other side of the bandage and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	If however, something comes out of the Sinus after a long period of time, then do not despair of its adhesion, for the healing of it approaches, because there are men who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and there are those who act contrary to it.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	If however, something comes out of the Sinus after many days of a badly digested pus, then you know that the Sinus does not adhere.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	If however, the adhesion of the Sinus is delayed and prolonged: then add to the drying of the medicines, let the physicians make them so that they are humid in their substance and in their virtue, as the ointment Dyafinicon, when added to it, has superfluity of addition from the zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the last treatment that is given, it is best to take the ointment Dyafinicon, and dissolve it with rose oil, and renew it over the old wine equal in substance to it.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then close it up with that, and use it yourself.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And it already does a similar action when there is no Dyafinicon ointment present for you, honey, when you mix it, until it thickens, and you use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Or take myrrh, and frankincense, and olibanum: beat them all together, and make this thinner over the melted wax while it is over the fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then tie a thread around the wound, and make it as tight as possible. And when the thread is soaked in honey until it becomes thick, and then apply the honeyed thread to the wound, and place the pan beneath it, and tie it up.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And when longarista is administered, and the heavenly lily roots, and the lily itself, and the herb's flour, and the centaury: then it will be beneficial.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Either use them in their simple form, or mixed together, grind them, and mix the crumbs with honey: and apply the honey to the wound, and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the wound prolongs and is not healed by this treatment: then you know that there is corruption in its depth: or it has made an impression on the bones, or on other hard parts, or on the ligaments: then treat it according to the treatment for fistulas, as was previously stated.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	Regarding the care of Panaritius and the trimmed nail, and the addition of a cut to the digit, and the section:
Caput XCI.	Head 51.
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaritius is a wart that is born under the nail of the hand or foot, and may be born in other digits.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	When it prolongs and is neglected in its treatment, and becomes a wart of hot warts: or it corrupts and emits pus until it corrodes the nail root: and perhaps it corrupts it entirely, and perhaps it spreads the corruption to the bone, until it has an unpleasant odor: and it becomes the end of the digit flat, and its color becomes black.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	When you are treating it, if the wart is not cured by the division and your treatment does not fit: then it is necessary to cut with iron all the remaining excess from the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the wound after that.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For the cauterization of the wound is on the side.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If the mouth is sound, and the nail and nail bed are also sound, and the additions of the nail begin to compress the flesh to the interior, and begin to prick it, and hurt it: then it is necessary to place a fine gold powder under the angle of the nail that pricks the flesh, and press it upwards: and cut through the remaining flesh with ease, and place on top of it what remains of the medicines burning and corroding, until it is all removed.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for that with ointments until it is healed.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If corruption has already begun to prick the mouth, then it is necessary to cut through that mouth and take it out: for the mouth does not heal while the corrupted part remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see burning and corruption to increase in the finger, then cut it off according to the memory of the nail that was previously mentioned.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for it until it is healed.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If, however, an abrasion or impact occurs on the nail, and pain arises in it, then it is necessary to first use a vein let into the primary one.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then scrape off the nail with an acid-free cut, transferred from above to the mouth.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And guard against the section reaching the flesh that is under the nail, for you are causing it to happen by this over the primary painful one, and it will be a cause of adding flesh to the place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then care for the place with what soothes the pain.
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	But the finger added to which pain is born in some human hands, perhaps it is entirely fleshy: and perhaps there are bones in some of them, and perhaps there is a nail in it: and some of them are born from the root of the joint, or it is a birth of its nails in some nodes of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	He who is born in certain nails of fingers, does not move; and he who is born at the joint of a finger, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	His whose meat is from them, the section of it is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	What is, as you hit yourself at the root of it with a spatula wide.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But whose birth is in the root of the joint, it is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	So avoid its cutting.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	In him however who is born at the tip of a finger, it is necessary to cut into the primary meat of its round incision up to the bone.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then cut the bone with one of those convenient saws for that.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	However, the consolidation which happens to fingers is often due to the man's birth, that is, born with him, or from the consolidation of the wound, or from combustion of fire, and such.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	So it is necessary to leave that consolidation until the fingers return according to their natural form.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then place a ligature between them, or linen infused in rose oil: so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate it between them; or place a thin silver sheet between them, until the place consolidates according to what is appropriate.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And similarly if a consolidation happens to certain fingers with the palm, then cut that consolidation according to what is prepared and becomes suitable for the figure of the member.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	¶ Of the cutting of the Vice.
Caput XCII.	Caput XCII.
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	The veins are entangled, thick, full of superfluous melancholic disorders that happen in many parts of the body: and the most common of them is in the legs, especially in the legs of those who walk and labor, and carry.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	It is necessary then that you administer an enema of the body from black bile several times with a strong enema.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then make a phlebotomy on the patient's basilica.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The treatment of these, when iron is used, is according to two methods.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	Their wounds are to be cured so that blood is drawn, and black blood is extracted.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And another method is to make the vein rise and draw out all of it.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The section of this is according to this method.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	The thigh is first embroccated with hot water, until the thick, feces-like blood is dissolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then tie the weak thigh from the upper part of the hip to the lower part of the knee.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then shave the wound in one place, or two, or three wide sections.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then extract, that is, draw out the blood in your hand from the lower part of the thigh up to the top, and the upper part must be treated with a phlebotomy first.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then shave the nail until it goes out of the blood quantity that you see is sufficient, and that the weakness can tolerate.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then tie the nail: and command him to abstain from food that produces black bile: and repeat the evacuation and phlebotomy when the veins are full, and do not harm the weak one.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The extraction of this is according to this method.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Rub the weak thigh if there are many hairs in it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then put it in the bath: or embrocate it in the thigh of the patient with hot water, until it reddens and the veins become swollen, or exercise a strong exercise on it if there is no bath nearby, until the member becomes warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then scrape the skin in a straight line along its length: either at its end near the knee, or in its lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with hair follicles and scrape off the sweat from all sides until it becomes apparent to touch: and this is at the appearance of that which you see red turn to black and downward.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When it comes out of the skin, you will see it as if it were a string.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then insert the radium under it, until when it is clean and comes out of the skin: suspend it with a black eyelash, soft.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then scrape another section near that one in three fingers' length.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from its upper part until it becomes apparent.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then clean it with radium as you have done, and suspend it with a black eyelash as you have done at the beginning.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then scrape another section or several more if you need them for that.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then clean it and cut the last section near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull it out to the section that is above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this until you pull it out from the higher or all higher sections until it comes out completely: then cut it off.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	But if it does not obey you to pull out and clean: then insert a needle with strong twofold wire, and bind it, and pull it out: or insert the radium under it: and roll your hand over all parts until it comes out.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And take care that it does not cut.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it cuts, it becomes difficult for you to clean it gently and it comes out on the weakest part of it.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When you pull it all out: then put on the place of the wound a piece of soft wool dipped in wine and rose oil, or rose oil: and take care of it until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vine is contracted, having a winding which it is to be bent towards the parts, and is not as we said according to straightness: then it is necessary to find on it for all the tortuosity of its part, and the location of its involution.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then suspend it with gut, until you lift it entirely: and be careful at your section, over it not to tear the skin, or wounds: for it will be difficult to lift it up, or pull it out.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Therefore keep your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	The shape of the wound where the vine is healed.
Forma Vncini caeci.	The shape of the blind man's wound.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not like the other wounds, nor is it sharp at its extremities, so as not to wound the skin: and it has a broad bending, but it is gentle: for if it were subtle, it would tear the skin with its subtility: indeed it has superfluous grossness, as we said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	The extraction of the vein of the leg.
Caput XCIII.	Head 13.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs on earth, like Azizi, and the Arab earth, and in hot dry lands, few tender ones, that is, in which there is no growth of herbs or trees.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	Indeed its generation is from putrefaction which happens under the skin, like that which happens inside the bodies of snakes and ascaris worms, and the worms generated between the skin and the flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of this vein's growth is that which happens in the leg inflammation.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then it becomes inflamed.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to exit from the location of this cauterization, as if it were the root of a plant or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When the extremity of that part appears, then it is necessary to suspend the lead over the entire thickness of the lead, whose weight is equal to two drachms of the kilogram, up to two drachms and the same leaf: and let go the suspended lead from the finger.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever something exits from that part towards the outside, suspend that over the lead, and the same leaf.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	If it is extended to a great extent, then cut off a part of it, and suspend the remaining part.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut it off before it has completely exited.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it off, it contracts, and enters into the flesh: and it causes an aposteme, and putridity in the place, and a bad ulcer.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	Therefore it is necessary to treat it carefully and draw it out gradually, until it has completely exited from its last part, and nothing remains of it in the body: and from this same Vena it exits in some men who are five palms long and ten.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And it has already been relieved to me, because it has exited the man from twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	But if it is cut off from you at the time of your medicine: then insert the radium into its foramen, and perforate it with a long foramen, while the body, until all that is in it of matter is expelled: and administer putridity to the place with medicines on certain days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then take care of the cure of the aposteme.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this same Vena sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot, or in the foot itself: and many wounds happen to it, and it exits from all its wounds a branch.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Therefore, the cure itself, as we have said in division and what has been said earlier.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Regarding the section on worms generated under the skin, and it is called bouina's disease.
Caput XCIIII.	Head 138.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This disease is called in a certain land in our country Aegritudo bouina: for it often happens among worms, and is a small one, which is born between the skin and flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And it goes throughout the body, ascending and descending: and is shown to the sense during walking of its member to its member, until it breaks wherever it breaks into the skin place, and exits.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from putrefaction of some humans.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	So do worms and snakes, that is, pinworms, and ascarids in the belly.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And they fear from its malice.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	Because when it itself goes through the body, and rises to the head, and wanders to its place: then perhaps it may open in it, and exit, and destroy the eye: and this often happens.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	When therefore you wish to cure it, and take it out, then this is not done unless at walking of its member, and sense of its own.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	Therefore, it is necessary to tie what is above it, and that which is under it with a strong constriction bandage.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over it, and take it out from it.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it is deeply inserted in the flesh, and you do not find it: then place over the place cauterization with fire, until it dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And greater than what is feared, is its corruption, which corrupts the eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	If then you see him already inflamed in the head near the eye, then draw a good tight fringe under it.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then scrape it off from it, and remove it.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that he use weak cleansing of his body, when the physicians are putting down bad putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him avoid foods generating putrefaction in him.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	¶ About the cut for the illness of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Head 45.
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This disease is called Nakir in our land: and it is a pain that happens in some members, and then it is changed from one member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I myself have seen it, according as I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I am called to an old woman in some houses.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And she takes off her arm, and I see a small inflammation in the flesh of her arm.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after an hour she has passed, I see one inflammation going up with the fire, as if it were a child going up to her shoulder, which is higher than it can be: so that it is like silver running from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Therefore the pain has departed from that place, and it has been fixed in the shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then I sat an hour, and it ran into the rest of the body, until it had inflamed another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then she told me that it was moving in all her body, according as I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	Therefore I was amazed at the rapid change of its member to another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I myself had not seen this disease in my eyes in this manner before.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	Nevertheless I have seen many who found the pain to change from one member to another, and I did not see it as I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	I do not think this to be the case, unless it is because she was one of those who were detected by the dry parts of the body as being of the nature of the ovary: hence it appears to the senses that her soul has been changed.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	It is necessary that they do not appear according to this reason in those who are delicate and in the moist bodies of the hidden ovaries.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When you are treating her and she feels the pain of that: then if it is apparent to you with your eye, as we have said, then tighten above it, and below it quickly: and dry above it, until it leaves that attached soul: and cauterize the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If you do not see it with your eyes: then treat it with the movement of the body, and with that which expels the souls, and with those that carve them with the foul pills, and the pills of serapin, and such like.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	Regarding the extraction of the Sagittarius:
Caput XCVI.	Head 56.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	The Sagittarius is diversified according to its species and the locations where it falls from the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	The diversity of theirs is: for out of them are those which have great and small points, and sharp ones, and soft ones.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And out of them are those which have three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And out of them are those which have tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And out of them are those which have stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	Those which are according to the parts where they fall, are according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	Or if the parts be from the principal parts, as the brain, and the heart, and the liver, and the lungs, and the kidneys, and the intestines, and the uterus, and such like.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When therefore it falls into any of these members, and you see signs of death which I will tell you later, then it is necessary for you to make an extraction of that arrow from them, for death follows the part in which it is, in many different ways.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when you do not see these signs of evil, and the arrow is not hidden deep in the member, then take out the same, and care for the groove.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For when the arrow falls into the brain, and pierces the mouth, and comes out of the siphon which is over the brain, it is: for there happen from that wound, a coma, a scotomy, a trembling, a redness in the eyes, an inflation, a red tongue, a spasm, a mixture of the intellect, and vomiting of choler.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood will issue from the nostrils, or from the ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps the speech is abscised, and the voice is destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And there issues from the wound site, a white humidity similar to pus.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And it issues from there, like water of flesh.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If then you see these signs, then abstain from treatment, and remove the arrow if it does not issue.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	However, the signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart are: that it is near the left breast: and it feels as if it is fixed in a hard thing, not in a soft one.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow has a motion similar to that of the pulse: and it runs from the groove black blood.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And it follows that cold at the extremities, and a cold sweat, and syncope.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Therefore you know that death has come far from doubt.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	When the arrow pierces the lung, blood starts to spurt from the wound, and the surrounding tissue becomes red and swollen.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	He exhales a large, high breath, seeking the cold air's attraction.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow falls into the heart, which is in the chest: then it is near the ribs: and there is a great sighing with painful breathing, with a sigh: and all the limbs of the shoulders are moved.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls into the stomach: perhaps something undigested from food will exit through the wound.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls into the belly, and is embedded in it: something fecal will exit through the wound, or dung, or already split intestine.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is no hope for its cure, nor in removing the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine exits: and something comes out from it to the outside, and the pain is more severe on the weakest part: then you know that it is mortal.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The remaining parts, such as the face, neck, throat, windpipe, support, and vertebrae of the back, and the knee, leg, and foot, are healed according to various dispositions: when the arrow does not hit an artery or nerve, and there is no venomous arrow.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I tell you that I have seen these arrows, so that you understand through this about your cure.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is, because an arrow fell into the tearful eye of a certain man, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	Therefore I drew it out from the other side, under the fat of his ear: and he was healed, and it did not harm him in his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which fell into the fat of his eye beneath his lower eyelid: and the arrow was already hidden, and I could not catch it from its tip except with the very tip of my finger, where it adhered to the wood of the bow: and it was a large arrow from the bow of the Turcomen, with a soft iron, in which there were no ears.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	Therefore the Jew is healed, and there does not happen to the eye of his an accident evil.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I extracted another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabian arrow, and it is this to which they have ears.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	Therefore I held it above the same two guides: and it was already under the throat of his.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	Therefore I was able to touch it with it, until I extracted it: and the Christian is healed.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I extracted another arrow from the urine of a man, which fell into the belly of his: and we thought that he would die from it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After thirty days had passed, and nothing had changed in his situation, I held it above the same arrow: and I touched it with my fingers, and extracted it: and he was healed, and there did not happen to him an accident evil.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man whose arrow fell on the back of his, and the wound was closed over it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After seven years had passed, the arrow was pulled out from the root of his leg.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman whose arrow fell into her belly, and the wound was closed over it, and the arrow remained inside of it, and nothing had changed in her situation, and the woman did not find any harm to herself in any of the natural operations of her.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	I saw another man who had a shaft fall on his face: and the sole of his foot was healed, and he found little pain in him, and such like many others.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	I took a shaft from the king's man, which had fallen on his middle of the nose and was leaning towards the right side almost: and the shaft was hidden completely.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	I am called to take care of him after the fall of the shaft for three days.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	I found the healed sole of the shaft.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	I tried to find it with my fingers and did not feel it, and he himself found the puncture and pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I hoped that that was the end of the shaft.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	I applied the plaster to the place with the plaster that attracted virtue and digestion, confident among me that it would be the place to be cut, and I wanted to see a sign of the shaft so that I could cut it: and it did not happen in the place, meaning that the shaft had followed the place.
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	I applied the plaster to it for many days: and no accident happened, and the sole of his foot was healed in the meantime: and he remained weak from the extraction of that space for some days, until he felt the shaft one day within his nose.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	I applied sharp medicine to it, for many days until it was open: and when I tried to touch it, and I felt the thin end of the shaft that clings to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound with that sharp medicine, until the end of the shaft was visible clearly: and it passed by me after that space of about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then, after the wound had been amputated and I was able to insert my fingers into it, move it around, and it did not obey the exit: then I did not stop refining and engineering over it with such methods as those of the craftsmen, until I succeeded in removing it on a certain day with forceps made to appear suitable for the form of their ends, until I extracted it.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I repaired the wound.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	Indeed, doctors also judge that the nasal cartilage does not heal.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	Therefore, I repaired it again, and the amputated part was consolidated and healed, and it became strong in frail health, and nothing harmed it at all.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	I will tell you the quality of extracting a certain arrow: so that you can place this rule and meaning over the one I did not say.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	For the parts and distinctions of this art are not understood with narration: nor is it understood by that book, and a wise craftsman compares little with much: and when he finds that which is present, he compares it with that which is absent: and he discovers a new operation and instrument among the descent of things extraneous to this art when they happen.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say that arrows do not come out of the limbs in which they are fixed, except through two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by attraction from the place from which it entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or from the opposite side of the other part.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And that which is coming out from where it entered, or is an arrow proceeding into the fleshy place, and it is attracted and comes out.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	If it does not obey the exit from the hour in which it falls, then it is necessary to let it go for a few days until the flesh around it putrefies: and the attraction of it will disappear, and its coming out.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	If a bone is imagined to be in the way, and does not yield to your will, then release it for a few days: and then try again with attraction and motion every day until it passes.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	If it does not yield to your will after several days, then it is necessary to drill holes all around the bone in that bone with a sharp point, until the arrows enlarge.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then draw it towards you and remove it.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If however, the arrow is fixed in the bone of the head and has already pierced one of the cerebral veins, and it appears that some of the previously mentioned accidents have occurred: then cease from attraction of the arrow, and release it, until it is equal in that day.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow pierces the skull, then death is not prolonged to him.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed only in the bones, but does not pierce even to the skull: and it remains weak for a few days, and no such accidents occur: then let ingenuity be used in the attraction of the arrow and its removal.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If however, it is fixed firmly and does not yield to attraction: then apply a sharp point around the arrow as I have described: then care for the place until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If however, the arrow is already hidden in the body, and it is hidden and concealed from the senses: then seek it out when you attempt.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If however, you feel it: then draw it towards you with some instruments that are suitable for its attraction.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If however, you cannot get over it because of the constriction of the wound, and because of the length of the arrow in the deep part: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein: then find something above it, until the vein enlarges, and it is possible to remove the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	If the parts that hold the ears are free, then loosely fasten the flesh all around them from every side and every part of your skill, and also the skills you cannot reach beyond the flesh of the ear, and its bending, until it separates.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	When you perform the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use a twisting motion of your hand with the needles to all parts, until it separates: and with the finest subtlety, so that the arrow does not break, and make it difficult for you to attract it, and its own extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	If you cannot remove it at once, then let it be for a few days until the putrefied parts around it are removed.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then try it again: for if it makes a contrary flow of blood, then administer what I said in the chapter of its treatment: and guard your virtue from incision, or nerve, or cord.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And use all the skill you can to remove the arrow: and let it be with ease, and tranquility, or slowness, and firmness, as I will tell you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it is necessary that when you are pulling out the arrow, it should be weak according to its figure, according to which was at the case of the arrow in itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	For it is more difficult.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	If that is not possible for you, then administer what is possible from the figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	But the arrow that is going out from the opposite part of another thing, or already goes out from it something to the outside: or makes a bulge at the end of the arrow through the sense of the upper part of the skin near by, and you see it prominent: then cut over it, and let the section be according to the quantity that is taken in the nails.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then he draws it: for it is itself easy to remove.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If it is retained in the bone, then turn your hand according to the roundness of the bone, until the arrow points into the bone and enlarges itself: then draw it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: release it for a few days: then try again until it goes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	If the arrow is of wood in it, then push it with the arrow.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If the wood falls, and you wish to give it force: then insert the sharp-pointed instrument into it, so that the sharpness of its point reaches the end of the arrow: then push it with the arrow.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If the arrow is sharp-pointed, then push it with the arrow as you insert it into it.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	The arrow is made to point by this.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	If the arrow is poisoned, then it is necessary to cut all the flesh in which the poison is, if it is possible for you to do this.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then care for it as it comes near to that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	If the arrow is falling into the heart, or into the belly, or into the loin, or into the side: and it is near to that which you touch with your nail, and it is possible for you to cut over it: then cut it, and take care not to cut into the poison, or the nerve, and pull it out.

¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	¶ About the phlebotomy of the Basilican vein.
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	However, the Basilican vein is one of the three veins' phlebotomy jewels.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from afflictions that are under the throat and neck, because it follows the chest, and the vein: and it comes to the phlebotomer with the phlebotomy of that one, so as to avoid it, and let it be over fear of it, for there is an artery under it.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If then he errs, and adds to the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will incise that artery, and there will be a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is necessary, not to phlebotomize her with a sharp phlebotomy: in fact, she should be cutting with Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	That if the Basilican apparition is not manifest, then it is necessary to change the vein itself, or to turn it to another, or to ask for a branch of that one: or to phlebotomize in the place of that one's Funem brachii.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For it is manifest, and you should dry it with Alnesil, as we said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	If then you wish to phlebotomize that of the same one, then it is necessary before the tightening of the Funem brachii, to touch the place, until you know the place of the pulse.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then, signs are placed on the spot with wax, then the arm, and a clean section with the cauterizing iron of Al-Nasir, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And so that it does not fall by the impact through the space from the artery's place.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see, when you tie the knot, the inflammation in the place where you marked with wax, then that is an arterial inflammation: therefore, it is extinguished.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	That if you see blood to rise at the phlebotomy, as urine from a child, and it is a thin, red blood: then you know that it is from the blood of the artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then, therefore, and place your thumb over that space, then remove your thumb.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	If then the blood is let out (for it is often let out) then tie the arm, and release it, and let it be weak from its motion, and let it be above fear.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And do not let it be angry for days, until it is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if the blood is not let out and does not anger you, and there is no present medicine for you at that time, then cut the artery if it appears to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its ends are contracted, and the blood is let out.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take a piece of leather from the fistula, and find it. Take half of it, and tie it over the place of the wound that is becoming, with the bandage and the plasters until another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if the blood is let out, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	And if not: then take care of it with the one whose remembrance precedes the flow of blood from the child, and the letting out of the blood is not difficult in many positions, because of the small wound location, and the possibility of the bandage from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	Section on Phlebotomy of the Purple Vein.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	Phlebotomy of the Purple Vein is a venous bloodletting procedure that draws blood from the upper part of the head and the lower body, as it is composed of the Basilic and Cephalic veins, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it is convenient for the bloodletter to do this, because there is a nerve under it, fearing the effects of the bloodletting.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	Therefore, if he adds to the puncture of the bloodletting and finds a nerve, there occurs in it stupor, and it is difficult to cure it, and perhaps it is not cured at all.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the senses.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	However, if it is hidden in some people and is subtle and not shown: then you should place your bloodletting on that vein where you bloodlet, the section with Alnesil, and take out the nerve with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	If the vein is between two nerves, then find the vein in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	Section on the Cephalic Vein.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	The bloodletting of the Cephalic Vein is a venous bloodletting procedure because it draws blood from the head and nourishes the eyes to diseases.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this vein properly, if you want, to bloodlet it by puncturing it with the olive oil phlebotomy, or with the myrtle oil phlebotomy: because it is the easiest vein of all, because there is no subcutaneous artery, and no nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	However, it is convenient for you at the bloodletting to use a knife with the phlebotomy, and to look for a gentler place: and it will not hurt it if it is not found by first percussion, so that it may return above it with the bloodletting several times.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	Indeed, it might be beneficial for some people when there is no need for bloodletting by percussion in the first place, but this does not harm them in any way.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	The use and cautions in phlebotomy.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality and accidents of phlebotomy, which you should consider when correcting it.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First of all, it is important to know that phlebotomy is not given unless in the conservation of health, and persistence in it, and caution against the coming of diseases.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And let phlebotomy be done on one arm of three, namely the cephalic, and the black, and the basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And let phlebotomy be done at the beginning of spring after fasting, in truth, and in summer, and autumn, and winter after eating, when there appear signs of fullness.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And let phlebotomy be done on the first day, or on the third day, after the three hours have passed, since they have exceeded them.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	However, phlebotomy that is given in diseases does not have a determined hour: but when it provokes convenience and need for it, in the night or day, and in every hour, and in every time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not necessary to let blood in children until they are fourteen years old.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should bloodletting be done on a pregnant woman, unless from the fourth month up to the seventh.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should bloodletting be done on the elderly who have already passed sixty years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	For if anyone wishes to be bled for any reason, it is necessary that he cleanse his intestines before bleeding with clean cloths, if there is much fecal matter in them: so that the veins do not attract water from the intestines superfluous and putrid substances harmful to the principal membranes.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	He who suffers from dizziness caused by hunger, or nausea and vomiting, or intoxication, shall not be cured until this is removed from him.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	He who is weak with dropsy, or oedema.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let him be afraid of bleeding again after suffering from colic pain, vomiting, diarrhea, increased secretion of urine, frequent coitus, labor, exercise, and fasting, and all that dissolves the strength of the body or animal.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider the subtlety of the humors before that, if blood is thick with food and drink, and medicines: if possible, let him do this.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then let him take a bath, if nothing prohibits it: or exercise some exercise, to thin the blood.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place the bleeding of him in his chest, around the third day, as we said: and let him be afraid that his chest pains on that day from all the evils of animals: such as constriction, anger, and fear: and from all the evils of the body, such as labor, penalty, and superfluousness, and like this.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And let him sit and make present things with which he has used to run his custom, from the aroma, and the smell, and the scent, and like this in quantity as possible.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	Then let him sit the bleeder on a higher place than the bleeding place: then he will take his arm and let him rub it with his own hand twice or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then let him tighten the ligament with the correction, and bind it twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And let the tightening be temperate, because when it is unequal, or through superfluity in tightening, it prevents the course of the blood: or in softening, it also prevents the course of the blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the wound is stitched up, one should use their own hands to rub it gently until the blood flows and then make the flow of blood visible.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the surgeon should cleanse the wound with a little oil, properly.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he should place his left hand on the vein at the spot where the wound is to be made, gently, so that it does not resist the needle and the blow is avoided.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	For the vein is like a string that runs along the wound, and there is one that is full of blood: and when you place the wound over it, it contracts under the wound, and deceives the surgeon, and does not open the wound: and if it opens, it is tight: therefore, it is necessary for the surgeon to be firm and attentive to all things.
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he should let go of the wound.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If the vein opens from the oil alone, then that is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then try another oil in the same place, or above it with haste: if it does not open the spot.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	If it opens, or weakens, then let him release it on the next day, or two days: and do not tighten the ligament.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	Perhaps the hot opening will be drawn.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	He should not enter the bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then he should repeat the wound if he likes.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small, or runs blood thinly: and fear that it may not escape from the quantity of blood you want: then repeat the wound in the same hole according to its rightness, and add a little to the operation.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do this with haste, before the opening is made, for the open spot is in many people at small operations.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	If then you see the wound already, you will not then hesitate to deal with it entirely, for nothing excuses itself before you.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And place something on the wound from ointment: for it helps to stop the course of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this case than the oil itself, and than the rest of the olive.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And do the same with ointment in all your phlebotomies, where the course of blood is stopped by the prohibition of the wound: and they make this Tyrannicum alfarach, and Sagzenea, when it is placed on one of them above the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	Blood, however, becomes thin and dissolves when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If it happens in the place of the wound-incision, which often happens, especially to those who are not phlebotomized except by that wound, or is a small opening in the skin, then immediately and on the spot place a sponge soaked in warm water and salt above the place, and string it for an hour: for it becomes thin.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And it is necessary that you do this after the exit of the blood from the wound itself, or from another wound.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	If something black or yellowish remains in the place after a day, or it becomes yellow, it will not harm you: and if you wish, place something on top of it, such as aloe, or myrrh: or something from the juice of mint, that is, calamite or similar to it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And indeed, wounds and swellings often occur at the basilica phlebotomy.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	And place your hand on it, then if you find a softness under your compression on it, then that swelling is bad.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	Therefore, so as to place something on top of it from what we have said.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	Perhaps blood from this will flow from the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	However, apply a plaster to it with the one that has the stipticity, so that the site may harden.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then, take care of it itself with the rest of the treatment until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it should be that all men have it out of blood according to the quantity of their strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And what appears from the violet color above the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it out until it turns red: and similarly if you see it thick, then let it out until it becomes thin: and if it is sharp, then let it become less sharp.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it should be that which is full, strong, and requires a single extraction of blood to make the venepuncture larger and the vein wider: and in the one who is weak, it should be opposite to that.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it should be that it is taken out in the veins, and that the opening is strict: and it is better that what is given in the venepuncture is a section, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of venepuncture is safe from the flow of blood and from the incision of the nerve: and it is more praiseworthy and healthier than venepuncture by extent and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And which has been used before the venepuncture by syncopal, it should be that bread is taken moderately before the venepuncture, infused in water of the grapefruit: or it can be drunk if it is heated: and it should be taken out from the blood in three veins, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	And if the complexion is frozen, then it should take before the venepuncture bread infused in the sugar of the water: or in the sugar of the honey aromatized with spices, or in the aromatic syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If a syncope occurs during phlebotomy and the cause of its blood exit is many, then it is necessary to take animal juice in power, and a subtle sweet dew, and use aromaticity with algae, and line the chest with it, and use the remaining ones that I mentioned in division in the chapter of syncope from euction.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	If someone wants to achieve the event of his arm and dissolve his blood secondly: it is necessary for him whose phlebotomy is because euction much, and his strength is weak, that he dissolves blood gradually by the quantity of his strength in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	If however he wants to achieve the event of his arm and dissolve his blood secondly, and his body is strong: then he should do this after seven hours, or a new one from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	If however he wants to attract his blood from his body to the opposite part to which he inclines: it is necessary for him to achieve him on the second day, or on the third.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	If however in whose body is much hot blood already cooled, sharpened, and a fever occurs: it is necessary for him to withdraw the blood from it in one juice, and extract much quantity from it: and enlarge the wound until syncope occurs: after you have preserved all conditions of phlebotomy: and put your hand on the pulse of him at the course of blood, so that a death does not occur at the place of syncope.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	For it often happens that the phlebotomist knows, and he falls due to negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not necessary when you want to dissolve the arm and dissolve the blood secondly, when the wound of the vein is closed, and there is difficult blood exit, that you hasten over it with great force, and extend it carelessly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	This is indeed a harmful cold, in fact, release it, until the second vein bleeds.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	If you remove it when it becomes sharp, that which has coagulated from the blood in the opening of the vein, and place something salty dissolved in water over it, then the wound will close quickly.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And place something over it from Tyrian tar, or saffron, and place a gentle compression on it until the blood escapes.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	If indeed the vein has been struck, then release it, and do not press it, until the swelling subsides.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	If the necessity calls for the blood to be drawn a second time, and there is no excuse, then either draw it from above that place, or from another arm vein.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	However, the bandage of the arm vein is not found, and they are hidden, because it is made up of them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of the bloodletting is such that he inserts his weak hand into hot water until it reddens and the wound is clearly visible.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then it is tied over it with a bandage of medium tightness.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then the bloodletting is done gradually, not laterally, nor according to length: and it should be wide open, and your bloodletting should be above the bandage of your hand.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	If the exit of the blood is forbidden, then you should wash your hand in hot water, and release the blood to flow in hot water until you fulfill your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	If however, you are in the summer days, then you can excuse yourself from washing your hand in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed, the flow of blood is most often done in hot water during the winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	This venipuncture is safer for all veins because there is no pulsation in this vein and no nerve.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	The left-handed venipuncture of the Saleratus hand is beneficial for the ailments of the hands.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of the venipuncture is that you tie the large hand with a ligature, or your own hand, after you insert it into hot water, until it bleeds, and it will be visible to the sense of pain.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then, the venipuncture is transferred through the transfusion.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you hit it completely, it will not hurt that part in any way.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And keep it, so as not to cut your hand with the venipuncture.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	For there are bare nerves of the fingers on that part.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then, move your hand to hot water, and let the blood run out in it.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not move it in hot water, the blood will clot at the vein opening, and it will be forbidden to run.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	When you remove the necessary amount of blood from the blood, then put oil and salt on it so that it does not harden quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And similarly, it is necessary to do this with every tight branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The venipuncture of that blood is: for it is beneficial for the ailments of the spleen: and similarly do in the venipuncture, as you did in the second equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	However, the venipuncture of the saphenae is for the ailments that are in the lower part of the body, such as the ailments of the matricula, and retention of menstruation, and weakness of the stomach, and ulcers of the thighs and knees, and old wounds, and similar ailments.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	The quality of the phlebotomy procedure is such that it inserts the weak foot of its own into hot water: and makes a rubbing over it until the waters become bloody: and ties above the joint of the foot with the corrections.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	Indeed, the place for the waters is indeed at the heel, appearing as a reversed thumb: and they are rubbed out on the face of the foot's branch many.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	Therefore, the phlebotomy is done on its wider branch, or at the heel in its gathering: for it is better and more healthful.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If indeed the phlebotomy is done on the face of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are under it on the face of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy in such a way that it is done by the transuerso, as if you yourself want to strike it: and let the phlebotomy be of the Nesil type.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	However, if the exit of the blood is prohibited, then you should insert your foot into hot water: and let the blood run into it until it becomes clear.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	If indeed the phlebotomist errs in the first wipe, then he should continue with the phlebotomy to the upper parts, for it is healthy and you should not fear evil from it when you strike the nerves as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And similarly when the Saphena of the other foot is equal.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	However, the location of the Sciatic vein, as we have said, is at the heel on the side of the thumb.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the lubrication of its phlebotomy is to the pain of Anchaea, when it is due to hot blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of its phlebotomy is such that it enters the weak bath and stays: and he should tie the thigh of Anchaea from the side of the thumb to above the heel with a thin and long string, for it does not appear unless for that reason.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When then you see, then do a phlebotomy according to whatsoever ingenuity it is possible for you, or according to catharsis: and it is better, or that you cause it by incision, or allow it by section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For the place of this is more healthy, and it itself is hidden in many men with cunning.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	If then you do not find it, and it does not appear at all to the sense: then do a phlebotomy of some branch of it, and that is the one which appears in the sole of the foot, and the ear-piece: and take care of the nerves, and make run through the quantity of blood which you will.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then loosen the strictured part, and put over the place of the phlebotomy the skin, and stretch the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	For it heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	¶ About Ventilation, and the quality of its use.
Caput XCVIII.	Head 48.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Ventilations are made from the corners, and from the air, and from the earth.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And ventilation indeed is made in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	When with scarification, and the extraction of blood: and an other is ventilation without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this ventilation which is without scarification, is in two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	Either it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or it is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the ventilations which are given with scarification, and the extraction of blood, are fourteen places of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of which one is, Ventilation of the Alkehel, and is the last of the head: and Alkehel, and is in the middle of the neck: and Ventilations of Alhagdahim, and are two laminae of the collar from two parts at once: and Ventilations of the menti, and are under the jaw in the lower part of the mouth: and Ventilations of the two spatulas: and Ventilations of Alachosos over the end of the tail: and Ventilations of the two ears: and Ventilations of the two shoulders: and Ventilations of the two armpits.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And puncturing does indeed draw blood from your veins, scattered in the flesh, and for that reason, force does not fail from it, just as is the case with hemorrhage.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	It is not appropriate to administer puncturing if done with fire, or without fire, in certain diseases that arise from repletion, until the whole body is evacuated.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity calls for puncturing from a disease, or out of custom, we administer it at any time in the beginning of the month, at its end, and in the middle of it, and in whatever time there may be.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	That is because when blood multiplies in a person, until an extraction of it by puncturing is needed, it is found in the head of his scalp, and sores.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And from them are those who find repletion and redness on their face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And from them are those who find itching on their face, and in front of their face, and darkness, and weakness in their eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And from them are those who cry out at the place of their puncturing.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And from them are those whose laughter multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And from them are those who find the taste of blood in their mouth: or they bite their tongue, and spit out the blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And from them are those whose sleep multiplies.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And from them are those who see in their sleep blood, redness, wounds, and such as are like them.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When we see something from them, and properly if it is in the third day of the month: we advise that puncturing be made to be done after they have passed two hours, or three.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The head bandage of ventilation is: for it itself carries the old age to the head, and that which is poured out to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	It is necessary that that thing should be after the ejaculation of the whole body.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	Indeed, this is the ventilation in the place of the cephalic phlebotomy.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it is not allowed that he use it who has a cold complexion, or in which there is catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it does not bring him great harm.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And therefore it is not necessary that they use it the old, and in whose head there are cold diseases.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But who is on it frequently fits, a forgetfulness is generated for him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And therefore it is necessary that you preempt the ventilators, so that he puts down his hand when it is almost wet to the lower parts, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventilation or Alkehel is in the place of the phlebotomy of the fingertips, and the phlebotomy of the basilicon, and for that reason it carries asmati, and constriction of anhelitus, and a fissure of the instrument of anhelitus, and a tussie, and repletion.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	And it is necessary that the ventilated Alkehel be pushed up as soon as possible, because if it is put down lower, it generates weakness in the heart, and stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Ventilation indeed carries painful accidents in the head, and obtalmia, and hemiglossal, and perforations, and pain in the roots of the teeth: and it is in the place of the phlebotomy of the basilicon.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And it is necessary that you preempt the ventilators, so that he does not put down his hand when scarifying: so as not to rupture the artery, and to cause a flow of blood.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	Winding, however, under the chin, collects alcohol in the mouth, and corruption of the gum, and similar ones from the diseases that are in the mouth: and it is located in the place of phlebotomy, which are in two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	Winding, however, of the spatula, collects alcohol, which is made by reflection, and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	Winding, however, of the interior parts of the two lips, collects the phlebotomy of the three veins: for it attracts blood from all of these minute veins, which are in the flesh: and these minute veins attract the three veins from other larger veins, until the attraction becomes attached to the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And it is necessary that you precede the winding, so that it does not proceed too much in scarification: for the place is bare of flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	Winding, however, that becomes saturated with alcohol over the alcohol, collects hemorrhoids and lower ulcers.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And it is necessary that you precede the winding, so that it becomes large and dry: for the place requires strong suction, and perhaps the thin winds will break: and it will be scarified with a large scarification.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	Windings, however, of the couch reduce the manifest decrease: for they attract blood from the whole body, and confer pain to the old in the renals, and mammary glands, and uterus: they provoke menstruation, and confer bothor and ademen: and they stand in the place of phlebotomy of two saphenous veins, and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	Nevertheless, they weaken the body greatly, and cause syncope in many men.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	The ventricles of the winds are near the ventricles of two winds.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the winds is to place a moist vapor first, and then use gentle suction: and do not prolong the position of the winds, but place them quickly and remove them quickly so that the humors come to the place they are needed in equal measure: and do not stop repeating this until you see the place beginning to reddish and inflamed, and the redness of the blood becomes apparent: then shave, and repeat with gentle suction.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider the disposition of the body.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For those made of soft human flesh, rare bones, it is necessary to shave them only once, not more, so as not to ulcerate the site.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And advise the ventricles to enlarge the shaving slightly, and make the suction gentle, easy, and smooth.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	If there is a swelling in the blood, then it is necessary to shave it twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In water, indeed, the first opening is made for the subtlety of the blood and its clearness: and in the second, the extraction of the thick blood is made careful.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If the blood is fecal in nature, then make the shaving in the third water: so as to reach the last.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And at the end, when we want to draw the blood slightly, or rather, enough, a single shaving is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	If we want to draw the blood in multiple parts, we shave with multiple shavings.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to make the shaving deep with the shaving: and the end equal in the shaving, is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which must be administered from oils at the position of the Windsor, and what should be avoided in blowing.
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that case where the skin is rough, hard, black, and the pores thereof are strict, it is necessary to rub the places of the Windsor with open, soft, and resolvent oils at the time of the summer, such as the oil of alkeiri, or the oil of mustard, or the oil of the seeds of the cucumber, or the oil of the seed of the squash.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the time of winter, then the oil of narcissus, or the oil of lily, or the oil of chamomile, or saffron, and similar oils.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If the surplus is rough and cold, then the oil should be amaranth, or the oil of balsam, or the white oil, or the oil of aneth: and similar oils.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If it is necessary to blow large pores of young flesh, then it is necessary that he be forbidden from oil, and it is necessary that they wash the places of the Windsor of their skin with rose water, or with cold water, or with snow water, or with cucumber water, or with peppermint water, after blowing: and similar oils.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	He whose blood is of many moistures, washes with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumach water: and similar oils.
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	Whose surpluses are rough, he washes his own vents with old wine, or with cold water, or with the decoction of aneth, or with chamomile: and similar oils.
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary to avoid blowing in the bath, or in the bathtub, but it is necessary that oil be given after leaving the bath for an hour, or for two hours.
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	It does not belong for someone to sleep after ventilation.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is it that should be done so that ventilation is necessary or a phlebotomy before ventilation.
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And then it is necessary, after that, to consider first: then if ventilation or phlebotomy is choleric, and its sharpness and inflammation are above the blood: then it is necessary that it receives freezing, such as grated musk: and also endiuiam with vinegar and lettuce, and secaniabin with honey, and iuleb, and similar to these.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And put the young birds and lean meat of the fowl, and cooked foods with gritty, and similar to these.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And whose complexion is cold, it is necessary that it takes in the pot syrup of honey, or of almirena, or alsecaniabin made from seeds: and it takes a fragrant wine medium, which is between old and new: and it is recommended to use a small amount of food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And put the young birds and fowls, and pigeons, that is, small doves: and the young of the columbaissade be.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink of the day of ventilation and phlebotomy be more than the food: and it is necessary that it is given in the pot in some men in hours tyrian alfaroch, or medicament from musk, that is, muscata, or alesselithe before ventilation: and before phlebotomy, or after: so that the principal members are fortified, and the blood becomes thin.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it does not belong for them to take it in the pot heated.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	About ventilation without scarification.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	However, ventilation without scarification are those that are placed on the back, and spleen, and podagram, and over the ventrum, umbilicus, and places of the belly, and pixidem anchae: for these members do not suffer scarification above themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	Translation: And it is not sought for through ease, unless there is a tension from a blood vessel to another part: as we place the ventricle over the breasts in the case of a bloody discharge from the nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	Translation: And we apply them to dissolve the cold moisture introduced into the member: as we place the ventricle over the belly, and the navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	Translation: For it itself reduces the member, and warms it, and removes pain because it dissolves that moisture.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	Translation: It is also placed over the kidneys when there is poverty or a stone in them.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	Translation: Perhaps the force of its attachment will open the poverty, or remove the stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	Translation: And it does the same when placed over the spleen, and the liver with the bile to be removed from them both.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	Translation: And these ventricles are administered with milk only during the section.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	Translation: And sometimes they are administered with fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	Translation: And sometimes they are administered with full hot water in pleural affections: and this is to fill the ventricle, and it should be large, with hot water alone, or with water in which herbs that agree have been decocted.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	Translation: The form of the ventricle administered with fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Translation: The size of its opening should be of two fingers widely separated, according to the form we have made: and its quantity should be in the palm of the hand, at the middle: and there should be a small hole in the side, according to the amount that enters the needle: it should be made of thin wire, or thin brass strips, of equal thickness, and tempered: so as not to hurt the member in its position over it: and there should be a hole through the middle of it, of silver, or iron, where the candle is placed with fire.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	This already made filthy thing is so big, bigger than what we have mentioned, and somewhat smaller, according to the severity of its ailment and age of the one who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	Winds are different for boys, and for those who have been soaked, than for the winds of men and the bodies of the large ones.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	However, the quality of putting this filthy thing on with fire over the member is that it is like lighting a linen hair shirt with fire from flax, or a small candle from a cage: and put it on over the middle part of the man who has passed through puberty, which is in the lower part of the filthy one: so that the fire lights up the lower part of the filthy one, so as not to burn the weak body.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then it is put on over the member: and the finger is on the hole that I said, until when we hold the filthy one: while we need, we remove the finger, and the water comes out over that hole, and the filthy one is immediately dissolved.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then we light the linen hair shirt according to its kind, and we repeat it if we need that.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	However, in the wind which is given in the inflammation of pleurisy with water, there is no passed man, nor hole: and it is not given unless it is filled with water, and it is put over the member only.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this wind, the more it is big, so that it can catch much water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	¶ About the suspension of Sanguisugarum.
Caput XCIX.	Head 99.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Sanguisugae are not given in many, unless in which members there is not possible position of the filthy ones, because of their smallness, like the lip, and the gum, and those similar to them.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	If in a stripped member, such as a finger, and a nose, and like parts.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality of using them is: that the menstruous blood from Sanguisugis which are in sweet waters, cleanses from putrefaction.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are allowed to drink sweet water both day and night until hunger is appeased, and nothing remains in their bellies.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body will be flushed with blood, and with vomiting.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then cover the weak member until it reddens.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Afterward they will be placed on top of it.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are filled, and fall down, and there is a possibility of sucking the place with vomit, then it is the last in the operation: and if not, then cleanse the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then when much water is used, and it frizzes, and is expressed.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	That if the course of blood is prolonged after the flow of Sanguisugis, and it is this residue: then pour linen into cold water, and place it on top, until the abscess is exhausted.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	That if the blood multiplies, then poultice it over with crushed wheat, or with galls, and like parts from styptics, until the blood is exhausted.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or they may be placed on top of the place with halves of flaxen corks: and they are allowed to remain until the flax sticks to the place, for the blood is exhausted.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it is necessary if necessary to repeat Sanguisugis, when possible, to change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	But if they are forbidden from being hung, then cleanse the place with recent blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or tie a bandage over the places until something comes out of the blood.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they are placed, for when they themselves feel something from the blood, they immediately adhere.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When then you wish for them to fall, put something of aloes or salt or charcoal on them, and they will fall immediately.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	Discourse on the restoration, and dislocation, and treatment of torsions, and such like.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also often necessary in the art of medicine, and it is the restoration of fractures, and dislocations of bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know you, O Sons of Men, that the foolish doctors and boors, and those who have never seen the ancient book, nor read from it, ridicule this chapter.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And therefore this method is isolated from our earthly sciences.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I never found any good in it at all, and I did not get that from it, unless through the length of reading ancient books, and the desire to understand their intellect, until I extracted science from them from those.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then I clung to the experiment and study of the length of my life.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	And I have described to you all the science contained in that chapter: and after my experiment, which exceeded it, I freed that for you, and released it from the occupation of elongation, and shortened its end, and showed its end declination: and I formed many forms in it, from the forms of instruments given in it, when it is from the addition of declination, as I did in the two preceding chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Summary and collections from being of bone fractures, from those whose release is necessary before we begin the remembrance of the parts of the bones, and various, if any.
Caput II.	Chapter 2.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary that we say in the preface of this chapter, that this is the highest sermon, and the chapter, to whose understanding the artificer first directs his gaze: namely, that you, and those who are quick, may know, or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say that when a fracture, or dislocation, or twist, or case occurs in anyone, it is necessary that we immediately attend to cutting and opening the veins, and letting out the blood, or both at once: if nothing forbids, such as weakness of the virtues: or is he who has this occur to him a child, or an old man, or is it a time of excessive heat, or cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then he should be content with his food, with cold vegetables, and with flesh of animals, and of birds: and forbid wine, and fat meat, and all food that fills the belly with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Then when you are secure from the burning appetite, and do not fear the flow of matter to the member, then let the weak one return to the regimen of the first one with whom he ran his custom.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When the broken bone begins to be restored, then it is necessary that the weak one be nourished with food nutritive, much and coarse and heavy in which there is dough: such as bread made from cooked flour and water, and rice, and peas, and beans, and onions, and fish recent, and wine gross, and such like.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	When this regimen is made for the coagulation of the fracture to be more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And you know that bones fractured when they are in the young, who are in the beginning of old age, and those who are decrepit, cannot continue and consolidate according to the nature of their own, because of the dryness of their members: and they become solid and remain that which is at the end of their relief, as the bones of young boys.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	Indeed, nature attaches something similar to the fractured bone on all sides, something like glue, in which there is roughness, which adheres and strengthens it, until the collagen fibers are glued together and tied, until finally the strength and firmness of the bone comes into its own, just as it was at first, until it does not hinder itself from its own operations: and for this reason, it is necessary to feed the weak with foods that contain roughness, viscosity, and roughness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And you know that the species of fractures are diverse, according to the diversity of the limbs: for the fracture of the thigh is different from the fracture of the bone of the skull: and the fracture of the bone of the breast is different from the fracture of the bone of the back: and similarly, all other limbs are diverse in their nature: and I will come with a reminder of all the species of fractures, distinct from another, in its own chapter.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the species of bone fractures are even differentiated within themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For it is made a curved fracture, except for the stars that happen in it.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And sometimes it is made a fracture according to the length of the bone: and these are called beak-like fractures, that is, stars, and additions, such as are in a quill, when the pen is prepared to write.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And not proceeding: and it is a fracture with a thigh bone and dislocation at the head: and it is a small split fracture.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And every species has ingenuity, or a proper instrument for its restoration, according to what will be the reminder of it, distinct in its places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from that by which the fracture of the bone is known, is the curvature of it and its prominence, and its appearance to the senses, and its sound when compressed with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	When there is no apparent twist, nor sound when you touch your own bone with your touch, nor a weakness of a great pain appears, then there is no fracture here, but it is possible that there is a twist, or a small fissure: therefore, it does not need to be compressed with your hand and completely, much less placed over it with remedies from medicine that come to the place after that which fits the location: then the tightness of the subtle string is drawn together.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you know that the place when it is bent, and divided into two parts, besides what happens to it from satiety, yet every part removes itself from its comparison: then it is necessary for you to begin from your hour to rectify it, equally with it before it becomes hot.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if a hot aposteme happens to it, then let it be released for a few days until the aposteme becomes quiet.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then release it according to whatever mode can be from lenity and nature.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And you know that the restoration of it, and its equalization, is easier than the bones, in which satiety happens.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then tie it together according to what you wish for the rememoration of it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	But if they are in the bones, then it is necessary for this member of the broken bone to be extended from two parts, if your hand is, or foot: or if the member is small, then with two strings, or with a rope and your hand: or with two cords.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And your position where you place the member on a equal part of the location, according to its natural figure, until when the parts of the broken bone are extended: then try to make these additions with all ingenuity, and according to whatever way you can in their places: and take care not to cause any pain to the weak by your operation, nor wound, and try to apply one of two bones with its companion bone according to the better forms, according to your strength.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	It is necessary at that hour to touch and feel it with your own hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If you see something diverse here, correct it yourself, and make it equal by the measure of your own strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And cause a firm extension and a strong compression, just as many fools do.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For they often make this happen through their own operation of hot application or contraction in the member, as we have already seen from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then join to it after the equality, and a fitting operation, and a tightening of that member, and quietness, and tranquility: and warn the weak one upon it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make it hold, so that it does not move in the hour of its own vigilance, and dreams among its revolutions, and agitation, and at its excretion, and all its movements by the last virtue of its own.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And so that it may not be positioned like the member's position that follows pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is, because when it feels in the position of the member's pain or injury, then it should be changed to another position from that which it does not feel pain in.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And so that it may not be the position of that member crooked and unstraightened, when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of the tightening of the broken member, according to what I say.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	You know that broken members are diversified in their weakness, and their magnitude, and their form.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	For those which are small among them, such as the arm, and the finger, and the toe, and such like, then it should be a soft and subtle folding of the soft and subtle bandage.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	For those which are large among them, such as the thigh, and the leg, it should be a wide folding in them, hard.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Because the wide band connects the large member and tightens it evenly from all sides, so that it does not enter the spot.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then apply a suitable liniment after your evacuation to establish the proportion for this, on a soft layer over the place of the fracture of the same.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then wrap the bandage around the place of the fracture of the same three or four times according to the size of the member: and tighten your hand slightly with the bandage.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then apply it to the upper part of the place of the fracture and string it less than was your stricture which you tightened at the place of the fracture.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then stretch it a little with the fold and gently soften the stricture until you take the large one from the healthy place.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another carefully and wrap it again over the place of the fracture with folds.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then apply it to the lower part of the fracture with the fold.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And your operation should be in the stricture of the fold and its softening, according to what we said in the first folding above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the folds a soft layer or a piece of cloth equal to the tortuosity of the fracture, if there is such tortuosity in it, and if not, do not put anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then wrap it over the other one you took carefully.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then place stars equal to those made above immediately if there is no inflammation and no hot spasm in the place.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If however there is inflammation or spasm in it: then place on top of it the one that sits on the spasm and remove the inflammation: and let it be for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then stretch over those same stars.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And these stars should be smooth, rounded, and formed wisely: or they may be made from cane, wherefrom come the bristles, which are made from pine wood, or brushes, that is, from palm branches, or calicos: and the extent of all the stars should be according to this form, and this same figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, it should be that the star which is placed over the one being treated should be larger and thicker than the others: and the extent of the star should be according to what is possible from its size and thickness.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then stretch over the star with another one, according to the first stretching.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tie over from above with the sons according to the first stretching, as we said about the stretching: and it should be that your stretching over the place of the wound is more: and the more it extends from the wound, the less the stretching should be.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it should be that the middle threads are of medium thickness and fineness, and are made from soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the threads are thick, as we have seen from the operation of the stupid ones, their threads made from twisted linen cords fall short in quality: for the stretching does not hold up with them.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And thin threads do not fit again: for you do not achieve that by the stretching which you wish.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it does not need to be that there is less than a finger's distance between the stars.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	For if the weak one is strained at the extremities of the stars after the stretching in the healthy places: then place under them from the wound soft things, or carded wool, until nothing is hurt from that.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	But when the wound is with a bone, and there is rupture in the skin, I have remembered this according to its kind in the second chapter.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	You know that not every broken bone should be stitched together like stars on the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	What is it that when the limb is large, it is not appropriate to place stars above it, unless after five days, seven days, or more, according to the security you have from the event of the operation, you remove hot pins?
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	This is the method of plasters used by the ancients to restore, which are applied over the fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	Common method of plaster, restoring the fracture, suitable for many complexions, especially women and children, because it is from that which does not kindle heat nor cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is that you take from the flour mill, and it is the brain of the flour which hangs in the walls of the flour mill at the time of grinding the flour: and you press it just as it is, except that you do not put it with the kidney: and then you place the confection of it neither thick nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	Another method of plaster for restoring the fracture and dislocation, and torsion.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Recipe for plaster, and laudanum, acacia, enule, and mugath; and sugar of all the above ʒ X myrrhae, and aloes of the whole house ʒ V and alethil ʒ XX are taken, and they are crumbled, and mixed with water of alethil: or with kidney if the complexion is weak, if it is heated.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For it is a good composition, it restores the broken bone quickly, and it can be used by many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	Another method of plaster that also restores fractures and torsion.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Recipe for a poultice, and a mess, and white linen, of all ana ʒ X myrrhae, and aloes of Ambrosia ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX are needed, and they are all prepared by rubbing them together with much difficulty, and they are then mixed with water, or with the urine of a mouse: and they are then applied.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	Method of Making a Plaster for Joining, and Separated Bones from Their Locations: And Soothes the Pain that Accompanies Them, and Closes the Fractures and Cracks in the Bones.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Wax is applied, and dipped in vinegar, and the oily extract is placed on the spot.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	In this plaster, there is no strength for restoration, but it is good for the relief of hot applications: and it drives away the pains properly.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	Method of Making a Plaster that Restores a Broken Bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Gather the leaves of the oak and the leaves of the bay, and pound all together, and make a plaster from both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	Method of Making a Shortened Plaster for the Restoration of a Broken Bone: And When You Wish to Apply the Remaining Hot Applications.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Recipe for a Mixture of Old Herb Roots, and Chamomile, and Flowers of Wild Carrot, and Herbs, of all one part: they are all prepared with wine, if there is no heated member.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If the member is heated, then mix it with warm coriander water, or with warm water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	Method of Making a Stronger Plaster for the Resolution of Pains than This First One, When a Hard Hot Application is Given at the Restoration of the Member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Recipe for a Mixture of Old Herb Roots, and Linseed, and Balm, and Yarrow, and Sage, and Flowers of Wild Carrot, and Chamomile, of all one part: they are all prepared with salt water, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	The whole thing according to the heat of the member, and the quietness of its heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates himself did not say in his book that a poultice should be placed on a fractured member during its restoration, except for a sore made from stone and oil: nothing else: and he reported that it should be between the magnitude and the subtlety.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	Galen, however, advises that they be placed on the fractured member during its restoration, in which there is an increase in heat, such as myrrh, and aloes and olibanum, and similar to these from them which we have mentioned.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	¶ Method of the Poultice that is used for wounding and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Recipe for mugwort, and chickpeas, and hairs of human eyebrows, or the feathers of pens, and twine, and salt parts equal: they are dried, beaten, and pressed together, and a poultice is made from it.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	However, the quantity according to what should be, so that there remains the bandage, then it is dissolved, as you see now, if no pain becomes worse, nor itching, nor movement of the fractured bone from its place: then do not resolve it for many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If it happens to it in the place of itching, or pain, or inflammation: then immediately dissolve it in an hour, and take away the poultice from it: and take a soft bandage, or a wet sponge, soft: and submerge it in warm water, and wash away with it the place, until the itching ceases, and the pain settles.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let the member rest for an hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then place on it a cloth that is burned, submerged in vinegar and oil, or pink oil: and bind over it at night until you are secure from the hot pinch, and the pain of the member ceases, and settles inflammation.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then apply it to the narrow bandage, and the ointment of least degree: and do not tighten it at first with your own strap, and the finer with it, until it heals.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see, that the crust has formed, and redness, and pain, and inflammation, and all other symptoms are almost completely removed, and you need ointment and bandage, then apply it again as you have done at first equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If something does not happen to the member from any of the things I mentioned, then do not dissolve it unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when the member is dissolved for twenty days, according to what appears to you from the solution of the member, as I said, until it adheres to the fracture, and the coagulation of the flesh over it: and also then in the bandage add more than your first bandage entirely: and also in the ingestion of weak foods, according to what precedes the remembrance of its.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	But if you see that the place of the fracture has become dry and shriveled, and more than it should: then you know that food is forbidden to be applied to it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	Therefore apply the ointment with hot water to all members where you have dissolved it, and let it be for three days, and alleluia, and the bandage is nearly tightened.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Therefore food runs to the member, and heals quickly.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	However, what they do with stupid restorers of the member from the fracture is to give another member, when it does not restore in the first place, according to what is necessary, and restores according to the tortuosity, is an error in their operation, and great fear: and if it were right, they would have said this by the ancients in their books, and operated with it at that time.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	I have not seen any of their tracks in that case, and it is better to say that this is not done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	Regarding the accidental event in the head.
Caput III.	Head number three.
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	The species of fractures are diverse, and the figures of them are many: their causes are distinct.
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For it is a fracture that is made by a blow with an hammer: and the blow strikes the bone entirely until it reaches the siphac, which is under the osse, just as an axle does in a tree: and for this reason this species of fracture is called the axial one.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or the hammer strikes some bones, and it hits their face, and it does not reach the end of them by the incision: and this species of fracture is called the Kalaan, that is, the absolute laceration.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And it is a joint of two fractures, either great or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	And it is a fracture that is made by a grinding or attrition: and its cause is a blow with a stone, or a chance above the stone, or such things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	And this fracture is also a penetrating one, which is approaching the gut, which is under the osse: or it is in the face of the bones: and it is a joint of two fractures, either great or small.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	And it is a fracture that is made by a hidden one in the bone in the subtlety of the hair: and it is a small fissure, and for this reason this species of fracture is called the Capillaris.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And among them is a fracture that is made by a chance, or a blow with a stone, and such things which make the layer of the bone to be able to go into the interior, and it is a place of cohesion: just as happens when the hot air meets with them by a blow, and its part goes into the interior.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	Indeed, this is particularly true in the cases of wet bones, such as those of children.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	Indeed, all these kinds of dislocations are separated, and I recall this with reference to the whole in its proper place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	Indeed, we recognize all these kinds of dislocations by detection on the part affected, and examination of their parts when touched, and removal of the corrupted flesh that is above them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	Indeed, the species of hair is recognized by this, that it is detected on the bone, and removed, and encased around it with wax: for a black discoloration appears in this case.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the treatment of the fracture, consider first the accidents of the weak: then if you see accidents that are manifestly dangerous, such as diarrhea, and extension, and loss of intellect, and glottis abscess, and syncope, and acute fever, and exit of eyes, and redness of them, and similar accidents in many dispositions, it is unlikely that it will be cured: and if you see accidents that do not frighten you and hope for health, then begin the care of it.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	Indeed, if a wound comes to you first when wounded: and this is in the days of winter, then it is necessary that you study in the removal of bones before the fourth day of every disposition.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	Indeed, if it is in the days of summer, then it is necessary that you remove the bone before the seventh day, before the corruption that is under the bone from the bandage, and those accidents that we have mentioned occur.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	Indeed, if the fracture of the bones has already healed to touching the brain with minutiae, and is with attraction: then it is necessary that you incur the part which is comminuted and attrited, according to what I tell you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	It is said that the head of a wounded person should be treated like this: and grasp it over the eyes in whatever manner possible to you, and according to the shape of the wound, and what is needed over the weakest part.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If it happens to you during the detection of bone fluid or hot clot: then place it with it as is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And it is said that you should fill the place with poultices made from wet bandages in wine, and rose oil: and make the knee quiet until the clot is settled, and be secure from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin with the treatment of the bone, and removal of it.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And this is done according to one of two modes.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	Indeed, one mode is to cut the bone with a sharp edge: and this is its shape.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	From there, you will administer another Incisor wider than the first one: and this is its shape.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then, you will also administer another Incisor wider than the previous one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	And the second mode is to have a number of different Incisors with you: some of which are wider than others, and some of which are narrower than others: and they should be at the very end of their sharpness, and should be made of iron or steel: and use your ease in percussion on the Incisor, so that it does not hurt the head, and harms the itself.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	However, if the bone is hard and tough: then it is necessary to make a hole in its circumference, before you administer the Incisors, with Terebrae which are called Terebra, not because they are deep: and they are not called so for this reason, because they do not reach the end of the bone flesh after it: therefore, because the Terebra is the round edge above it, which is under the sharp edge of the head, similar to the margin, and the smaller circle prevents it from being submerged, and passing through the density of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	When you are ready, take a large number of these terebrae from them, as many as there are bones of sufficient thickness to fill the entire cranium of Terebrum, whose sharp extremities in length and breadth should be proportional to the thickness of the bone of Terebrum.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	This is the form of three kinds of Terebrums, or trephines.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	The quality of drilling is such that you will place the trephine on the bone and turn it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been completely pierced.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then rotate the trephine to another place and place it where there is a space between all the holes of about this size.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then drill with chisels that are between all the holes of the bone: and make it finer than you can with your hand, or with any other instrument you have prepared for this purpose, such as trowels and thin chisels.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that you take all care not to touch the trephine with the chisel or anything else from the plaster.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have drilled the bone all around and separated it from the plaster, if it is continuous with it, and taken it out, it is necessary that you make rays and equal ends of that which remains in the bone with another similar chisel.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it should be more thin and delicate with other chisels.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	If something remains of the bones that are similar to those that were cut out with the chisels, then take it with as much ease as there is with the instruments you have.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then take care of the wound after that with ointments and unguents as I have mentioned.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	The method of another operation is easy, but long due to fear: which Galen said and praised greatly, and this is his speech.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	First of all, you must begin to expose a part of the bone from the location where the fracture is most severe and apparent: then, when you have exposed that part and placed it under the extremity of this Incisorii lenticularis tooth, whose shape this is.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lenticular part does not cut anything gently: and the sharp part of it is curved on two sides of its handle in length, as you see: so that the lenticular part may be fixed to the siphac, with its sharp side facing the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then, strike it with your little hammer from the one side with the Incisorium, until you cut the bone with ease, as it rotates: and you will be secure from the bandage, which does not happen in that happening, which you fear greatly.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the physician were not a foolish man, and more ignorant of this, nor sleeping, then if anything was left attached to the bone from the bandage in some places, he would cut it off with the sharp end of the Incisorium lenticularis of his own tooth, and free it from it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	He is freed from it without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the fracture does not pass through the bandage, and that which is cut off from the bone is the face of it, and the roughness and subtlety of its sharp edges remain in it: then it is necessary to remove that roughness and those sharp edges with thin razors, made of the variety of numbers, so that you can apply different quantities of them to every place, and make them better and more appropriate for the operation, according to which the bone is broken, and its figure.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	You must administer in reason, first cutting the roots of the hair widely with the blades of your razor.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use a finer one after that.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And do not cease doing this according to continuity, until the wounds become more delicate and finer in all of them.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	However, in the remaining small hair and the subtle fracture, it is necessary to administer care according to what leads to the correction of that one.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And it is a thing which is not hidden over all, which in this art there is any desire, and we have shown in the great fractures what we have written.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	However, if the bandage is detected and holds back when you cut the roots of the hair: then it is necessary to take a piece of linen according to the size of the wound, and dip it in rose oil, and place it on the opening of the wound.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another piece of linen doubled or tripled, and dip it in wine and rose oil, and place it on the first bandage: and do this as easily as you can over it, so that it does not become inflamed.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then administer the bandage above it: and do not tie it unless by the amount that holds the wound only: and release it with this care once a day, or for two days, until you are secure from the heat of the stitch.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then dissolve it, and administer the medicine after that with those which are superfluous dryness such as the roots of the lily, and the flour of herbs, and the husk of thorn, and aristolochia, and such like: and it is as if you were making a child who becomes dry on the wound as those are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	It is generally administered in that all medicine of its kind which prevents it from biting.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And for the cause of your virtue, that your nail may be clean in your care: neither let there be soot in it, nor dirtiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	Nor does thou let the tooth gather together in it entirely: for when the tooth gathers together upon the brain, it corrupts it, and corrupts itself, and then it happens to the weak after that great malice: and it already happens in the hole of the head, when the mouth is cleaned from it, especially when care is neglected, blackness appears on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore consider now, if such accidents happen to the weak, you will know that it is far from doubtful.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if blackness does not happen, unless from the medicine which is laid on it, and it is in the virtue of that medicine to make it black: then you must take one part of honey, three parts of rose oil, and linen with them, and put them on the pannum.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then put it on the hole: then take care of it with the colors of the healing which come together, until it is cured.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	¶ About the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	You know that the nose is not broken unless two of its upper parts are broken at once, or one of them: for they are two bones: therefore, because they are two bones, it does not break the lower part which is cartilage, and it does not happen to it except wearing, and twisting, and flatness.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If one of its upper parts is broken, then you must insert a small finger into the hole of the nose, and mark the fracture with your own thumb, and with the bent knuckle, until the nose returns to its natural figure: and it should be made artificially with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	Because lest it happens through your operation on that weak pain.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	If a fracture is in the upper part of the nose and does not extend to the fingers: then it is necessary that it be equalized at the end of the radius in which there is small growth.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If indeed the fracture is in two parts, then make it similar to that: and soon after its restoration on the first day of the fracture, if possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after the seventh or tenth day at quiet, when there is heat, you should stitch it.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then insert into the end of the nose a linen bandage, if the fracture is in one part: or two linen bandages if the fracture is in two parts: and let the growth in the bandage be as much as to fill the opening of the nose.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And certain ancient restorers said that the bandage should be smeared with butter and turned every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	This does not seem to me, but rather it is necessary that the bandage be smeared with almond oil and complete with flour when it is finished.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then release the bandage until the bone is firm and the cartilage is hardened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And when it is inserted into the nose at the place of the goose quill, after it has been wrapped around the bandage: and it happens that it holds the fracture of the nose more firmly, and that it does not prevent the weak one from inspiration.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you wish, do this: and if you wish, make the bandage.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	If a fracture happens in the nose again while you are stitching, apply to the nose plaster with powder, or with powder infused in rose oil, or a little of dyaquilon.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	If, however, a hot sty does not occur, then it is necessary to apply a plaster made with flour and powdered turmeric mixed with gum and alginate.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then place a soft cloth over the plaster and do not push the nose against anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	If, however, the bones of the nose are broken or shattered, then it is necessary to cut over them and take them out with the instruments that come together with them.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then make a cut and take care of it with the part that is forming and being solidified from the plasters suitable for that, or ointments.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	If, however, it occurs between the nose and the cheek, then it is necessary to treat it with liniments: and give a needle of lead until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	¶ Regarding the restoration of the lower jaw when it is broken,
Caput V.	5. Head
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken and it is not broken with the cheek: then see if it is a deformed fracture that does not break into two, and it is curved towards the inside: then the knowledge of its fracture is easy.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	Therefore, if the fracture is on the right side of the jaw, then insert your left finger in the deformed right jaw: similarly, if the fracture is on the left side of the jaw, then insert your right hand and push the exterior part of the deformed fragment with ease from the inside with your other hand, and make it equal to the same.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the jaw fracture has already been separated into two parts, then it is necessary to give an extension from two parts according to the straight line until it is possible to equalize it.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If, however, already there has been irritation or disruption in the teeth, then tighten those from which you hope that the gold wire, silver wire, or silk will remain.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place a fracture above the broken mandible.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place a double band over it, and place a large star-shaped needle above it, or a frustum of the sole's skin of equal length to the mandible.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then tie it down from above, according to what you have prepared for the bandage of it, and make sure that its application conforms to it until it is not destroyed: and advise the patient to be quiet and calm: and put a soft food on its gums.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If, however, you think that something has already changed in the figure of some kind: then at once, and dissolve it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then correct what has changed from it, and apply the emplasm on the dough with almond oil, or with flour of wheat, after you have removed the swelling: and put a soft wool on top of the emplasm.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While this emplasm is attached over it, and the bone position does not change, let it go, so that you do not dissolve it, until it heals: or tighten the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	For this fracture is often tightened in three weeks.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If, however, in the meantime an apoplexy hot occurs: then administer that which I said often for its sedation, until that apoplexy is removed.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	And if there is a fracture with the tendon, consider it.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	If it has already been separated from the bone, or from the tendon: then use me to remove this sagged part with that which is convenient for you in removal of these from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If I am correct, and the wound opening is tight, then enlarge it with a vein puncture according to the quantity required by your need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you will withdraw that abscess, and nothing remains of it in the wound, then make an opening for the wound if it is wide: and if not, put upon it from above from the plasters which are suitable for this, and make them fatten, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	¶ On the restoration of the clavicle, when it is broken.
Caput VI.	Head Six.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Indeed, the clavicle is most broken from the front part of the shoulder, and its fracture is according to one out of three degrees.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or if it is broken and separates into two parts, other than the abscess which may be in it, it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or if such things happen in the bone abscess, it is more difficult to restore it.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or if it is a fracture of the humerus.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation when the fracture is without the humerus is, that you make the two ministers present, so that one of them holds the aid following the broken clavicle, and the other extends the neck against the part.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then make an equal fracture of your fingers until it has the form it should have, and there should be no prominence or convergence in it.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	If you need extension more, then it is necessary that you put under the weak pillow a flat sponge from cloth or wool: and its size should be according to the quantity needed by you: and extend, and hold the clavicle with your hand, until the equal fracture is made according to what is necessary.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot draw the end of the clavicle to the outside because it is deep, then it is necessary that it be weak over the collar of its own: and put under the shoulder of it a medium-sized pillow in size, and hold the hand of the shoulder down to the lower part until the upper part of the clavicle which is in the deep is raised: and then correct the fracture and make it equal with your fingers.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you perceive satay from the shoulder, and it moves: then it is necessary to find around that, and take away the satay with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is held in the bone, then your skills in the incision of that tooth with one Incastrator that you have prepared for it, after you place it under the shoulder, the instrument that is suitable for sifach: and that is an instrument made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It resembles the cochlea that does not have a connexion.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its depth is according to where you take it from the size of the bone, and its symmetry.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	However, its length is also according to what is possible for you in the operation.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it should have two ends, as you see: and one end should be wide, and the other should be narrow.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If the disruption of the wound that you cut when you took out the satay from the bone is wide, and it is secured by hot pliers: then gather the two lips of the wound with the suture.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the disruption is small, or you are afraid of hot pliers: then fill the wound with bandages and rags according to the size of the wound cut.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	And if hot pliers are used, then pour oil on rosewood, and vinegar, and wine, and place it on top of it.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	However, the closure of the bone when there is no wound and no section is, as you place on top of the bone a plaster made of flour with almond oil.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And place a soft stump on top of it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a sphere under the small bone, if you need that.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take the hip, that is, the round that the Saracens hold, which is long and narrow: and its depth should be about one palm or more.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a double layer of cloth over the bandage and plaster.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take a thimble from a fine sheet, whose width is three fingers, and in length similarly.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then cover it with cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then cover the cloth with the thimble in the place of the humerus bone which lies over the fracture and the place.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the humerus bone over it as it lies, and cover it over the neck of the same, and under the healthy and unhealthy shoulder blades, and reduce it over all parts, and how you see that the bandage holds the fracture in place, and this is what is not hidden from you, and all of it, so as not to remove the thimble from the broken bone.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And therefore it is necessary that you look at the unhealthy part every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever you see the thimble removed, and the bandage has been loosened, then adjust that, and tighten the bandage.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place the bandage on the unhealthy shoulder of the same, and place under the shoulder blade of the same a small cloth layer at night, so that when it rises with the aid of its side, it can support itself.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Therefore, the fracture of the shoulder is raised by elevation of the arm.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or tie the arm of the same to the neck of the same, and do not loosen the bandage, unless it does not happen in the place of the accident from itching, or from the aphthous ulcer, until twelve days.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then reapply the plaster, if you see the face of the same to it.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the bandage, and release it, until it is restored and coagulated.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	The fracture of the shoulder blade is indeed tied and supported, according to the best method in nineteen days: and sometimes it happens in some men in a shorter time.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	¶ Regarding the restoration of the fracture of the Spatula:
Caput VII.	¶ Head VII:
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	¶ Rarely does the Spatula break, and in its side: and they do not break from it except its edges.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	¶ When it is broken from that place, and it is broken in the middle of it, and it is not known unless by touch: then according to the figure of the fracture, prepare theSpatula.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	¶ And reduce it over the natural figure of the whole skill that is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	¶ Then place the child's milling with the eye of the almond, and a soft stitch, and place the child's milling under the double cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	¶ Then place the wide plate on top of the star according to the amount of the Spatula for the whole, or slightly larger.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	¶ If there is any connection between the Spatula and the star in some places: then make equal to that connection with a soft stitch until the star falls according to the equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	¶ Then cut under with a long amber thread, according to the fitting and strength of the star, until it is not removed from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	¶ And consider the bandage every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	¶ Whenever it is softened the bandage, tie it up again, and make equal to the star if it is removed from its place: and let it be weak on the sound side.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	¶ And the Spatula is indeed restored in nineteen days, or in nineteen and five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	When this number is completed, then loosen the ligament: and you will be in security.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For it is from bones whose union is not feared, nor their loosening.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	If however, it proceeds from a bone fragment, and punctures the skin: then cut above it, and take it away.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do what I have said in the fracture of the goose's knee from heating with an aposteme, if something comes out of it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	¶ Regarding the restoration of the breast bone fracture.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breast sometimes breaks in the middle of itself, and this seldom happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	However, the extremities of it are most broken and cut off from its accidents.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When the middle of it breaks, which leans to the lower parts, and there is pain in the chest, and difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and perhaps blood is vomited, and the connection of the broken bone is declared in the bone, and not hidden from the senses, the restoration of it is, that it be made to rise again on its own back: and place between the spatulas of it a piece of pulverized gypsum.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then press the shoulders of it, and gather up the ribs of it from two sides or parts with your hands: and make them subtle according to their disproportion, according to all manner of how that can be done, until the figure of the bones returns, according to what is necessary.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then place over it the plaster and bandage, and place under it a star from the thin sheet of salt, or chalicle, and from such like in softness, after you have applied it to the cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then make the binding of it over the broken bone subtle, so that it may not be removed: and knot with the bandage according to the roundness to the back several times, and make it strict according to its decrepitude.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the ointment at all times, and as much as it is softened, tighten it: and if the need arises to solve it at the spot of the itch, or the crust that happens in the place, or the pain, or the ulcer: then immediately, and dissolve it, and remove the plaster, and rectify what happens with the manner of its treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the ointment, if you wish to see that face: and tie it to the tightened one, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	¶ Regarding the restoration of noses, when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	You know that the nose is broken only in the thick places which follow the back, and from the extremities of these on the front side.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not happen to them by itself, because they are cartilaginous.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of it is not hidden from the senses during the examination with fingers.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And the restoration of it is made in such a way that the broken part is adjusted with fingers according to its possible form, until it is equal in figure according to what is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then the ointment, and tie the broken nose with a star, if that is needed for it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the nose is broken downwards: then a greater pain and pustule occur, and the pustule is like that which happens to him who has pleurisy: therefore, because the nose punctures the pleurisy, and also difficulty of thirst, coughing, and bloody sputum, occurs to him: and this is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And the ancients were already ingenious in it with many arts: and among them there are some who say that you should put weak foods which generate inflammation and heat, so that the stomach becomes inflamed, and extended, and the fracture is pushed to the outside.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	We ourselves abhor this, so that no cause of injury be made for making a hot sty, unless it happens.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	If it has already happened, then add to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	Certain of them said that a wet sponge should be placed over the spot, then pulled out with strength, and it is more like reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	Nevertheless, they fear that a wet sponge will attract excessive moisture to the spot due to the weakness of its position.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	Certain of them said that it is necessary to cover the spot with wool that has already been dipped in hot oil: and they place flax between the ribs, until it is full: so that it becomes an equal ligature when it is wrapped around according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	Then, a weak cure for pleurisy from food and medicine is applied.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If the weak body is not enduring, and the jaw is pierced by a sharp point, and we fear for the weak one, then it is necessary to cut over the spot, and detach the broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then we will place over it an instrument that keeps the suture, of which the remembrance precedes: and we will insert the jaw with ease, and insert it.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then we will sew up two lip wounds, if it is a large one with suture: and we will treat it with plasters until it heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If a hot sty happens to occur in the meantime, then immediately, and pour flax into hot rose oil, and place over it: and treat the weak one with that which is suitable for the sty.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	Meanwhile, also, it will heal over the side where it lies, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	¶ About the restoration of a spinal or neck fracture.
Caput X.	Chapter 10.
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Indeed, sometimes a fracture occurs in the neck of the bone, and this happens rarely. Similarly, it also happens to the vertebrae of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	When this happens to someone, and you want to know if it will heal or not, then trust in it.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened, dull, and lifeless, and cannot move them, nor stretch them, nor contract them: and when you contract them with your fingers, and prick them with a sharp instrument, they do not feel it, and do not feel any pain in them: then you know that it will not heal, and there is death in many positions for it.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	If it moves them, and they feel the contraction with their fingers and the prick with a sharp instrument: then you know that the nape of the bones is healthy, and that the weak one will heal with care.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If you find the vertebrae of the back similar to this one, and you want to know if it will heal too, or not: then consider the feet of the person: then if you see that they are softened, and that happens to them what happens to the hands: then when it lies on its back, exhaustion and emaciation come without will: and when it is turned over on its belly, exhaustion comes without will: and when it is turned over on its back, and wants to join, and cannot: then you know that it is mortal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore, do not worry about its care.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If it does not happen to him anything from that, it is better for him.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	The treatment of his that happens from that is to place hot sedative bandages on the wrist: so that you put oil that has been rubbed with heat over the softened vertebrae: or when you cut it, cut it with a sharp instrument.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place something over the aforementioned spot until the hot pain subsides: then place something over one of the comforting plasters, which dry and stretch it over the spot with a ligature: and instruct the patient to use quietness and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And let them not sleep on the part where they found pain, until it heals.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	If something happens at the site of bone friction, or if something has already been separated from it, then it is necessary to remove that from the skin.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then gather two lips of the wound, if it is large, with the suture.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for it with some ointment, until it heals.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	If the bone of the hind leg breaks at the end, and that is the end of the tail: then it is necessary to insert the little finger of the left hand into the anus, and hold the broken bone with the other hand, according to what is possible, and secondly according to the proportion.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place something over it, and remove it: and care for the leg with the care that precedes, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	Regarding the restoration of Anchae.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	The bones of Anchae are rarely broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they are broken, then the break of their bones is not unless a comminution in their extremities: and they are divided in length, and turn towards the interior: and there occurs pain in the place, and a puncture: and the thigh that is broken becomes still.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration of it is, to extend your hand over it, until you stand on the figure of the fracture as it is.
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is only in the extremities of it, then make an equal fracture according to what is prepared for you from the proportion, until it becomes like the natural figure of its.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If however the fracture is long, or already leans towards the interior: then place a weak one over its own watery part, until the restoration of that fracture be prepared for you.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When you have made the wound equal, place the plaster over it: then place the star over it, either made of wood or from the skin: and tighten the strap over which you need not fear a change in the fracture, nor the removal of the star.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And when the wound is equal to that which it fills, until it is tied up according to its equality: and order the patient to lie on his back or on his sound side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If however a hot sty comes on: then cease from its extension, and its own restoration, until it settles: and place over it what is settling, according to what precedes, then return to the restoration of it, and tie it as it should be.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If however a bone abscess or suppuration occurs: extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	De the restoration of the Albucasis Fracture Helper.
Caput XII.	Chapter XII.
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	This is a helper, which is between the thighs up to the head of the Spatula.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If however it breaks, then the restoration of it is according to one of two modes.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	One is: take a flat wood of medium size, according to this form which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And two bands are tied at its two ends.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then it is hung from the elevated place: and the patient lies down on his bed.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then he throws his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches the middle of the knot, where the knot of the wood is anchored.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then suspend something dark above it so that it extends its hand to the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then the surgeon should grasp the fracture with his hands simultaneously, until he returns to the fracture, according to what is appropriate.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And there is another method, where the weak one should be raised above his own neck with the ligament of his hand: and suspend his hand from the neck of himself.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then command the two attendants to hold one of them who is above the fracture with his hands, and for the other to hold the lower part of it, and extend each of them to their own part.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you wish for the extension to be stronger, then tie under the fracture with a ligament, and above it with another ligament: and extend them each of the two attendants to their own parts.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If then the fracture is near the end of the arm, then it is necessary that one ligament be laid under the elbow, and the other under the fracture turned towards the thigh.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And similarly if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that a ligament be laid on that place and above the elbow itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then make the fracture equal and easy without effort until it is equal to the fracture according to what is appropriate, and apply a good application: then tie it, if there is no heat from the post.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If however, a heat from the post occurs, then release the tied one until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And put on top of it the wine-soaked wool that has been absorbed in vinegar and rose oil, until the heat from the post is quieted: then tie it: and the way to tie it is to put the plaster on top of the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then put the ointment made from a new cloth over the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then he brings together the arm over the aid and places his hand openly on his own shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place the bandage, and tighten the arm over the aid so that the arm stands in the place of the stars: if nothing prevents you from that, neither will it bother you over anything broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	That is, if you fear that something will bother you over a broken bone, then use the stars: and it is good to place the larger and stronger star directly above the broken bone.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	And place the stars between all the fingers: and the length of the stars should be according to the fracture with an addition of three digits from every part.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tighten the bandage over the strings that I said at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is good that your bandage be tighter over the place of the fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And as the fracture is elongated, so should the bandage be smaller.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If you then see the position and tightening of the stars as we said, in the hour when you restore the limb, then do so: and if you fear a hot splint, then release the bandage and the stars until the seventh day, as we said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then consider the ligament in all three days to see if there is no pruritus, inflammation, or a prohibition of food to the limb due to the excessive tightness of the bandage.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	Therefore, correct this entire thing according to what we said.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	But if you are over confident that nothing will happen from that: then do not untie the ligament unless after three days, or more.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And let the back of his neck be weak and lie down on his chest, and place a full woolen bandage under the aid on his hand, equally.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	Consider the figure of the member at all times of the night or day, so that it does not break or soften the ligament.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	Correct that in its entirety with your skill.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And place the food for the weak in the order we have prescribed, so that the first food is fine and the mouth begins to tighten: then it is necessary to make the food of that member finer.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the habit of assistance and the thigh is, that it tightens in forty days: then it is necessary to make it loose, and a bath is given, and it is treated with ointments that strengthen that.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture is a grievous one, let it be drawn out: then do not soften the ligament and the stars up to fifty days, and for two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	Regarding the restoration of the fracture of the Bragg's.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII.
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the two foci.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	Of which one is small: and this is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	And the other is large: and this is that which is placed below the small one from the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps only the larger focus will break, or the smaller one: and perhaps both will break at once.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When the smaller focus above is broken, then the restoration of it is easy, and the healing of it is easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when the smaller focus below is broken, the fracture of it is bad, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when both bones are broken at once.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If the bone that is broken is the small one above, then the doctor is convenient at the restoration of it, to put a fine extension on it with ease, until it becomes its own.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	If indeed that great fire is what is broken, then it is necessary for him to put on a stronger, tighter bandage.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And it is necessary for him to place the figure of the hand at the restoration of his, and its extended above the pulse.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And the hand should be raised above all fingers: and the inferior joint of all fingers, or rather others; and the weak one sitting quadratus over itself, and the pulse near him, or in front of him, at a height, so that the weak one does not fall under the strain.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then he should extend the helper's arm from the lower part, or his own arm, or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And the helper should also extend above similarly.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then the doctor should adjust the jaw until he can reduce it according to the better figure that he can.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If indeed there are flaps in the fracture of bones, then you should dare to reduce all fragment in its place with your own virtue.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	If indeed there appears to be a separate flap, and it punctures the skin, and there is no hope for its restoration: then find over it, and remove it according to the mode that I have said in those which were mentioned before.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If however the fracture is with the tendon, then I have already made to that particular capitulum, therefore take care of its treatment from there.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If however a post-operative fever occurs at the beginning of your restoration, then line the bandage with the cloth made by rubbing oil rosato, and white wax, and it should be between the density and the subtility: and tie the bandage over it with a fine thread, until it is sated with the fever: then remove the wax, and put on the prepared plaster from the mortar with albumine oui.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then place stars, and let the star that is placed over the fracture be somewhat larger and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	You know that the number of stars Brachii is six in several arrangements: if the fracture is in one focus, or in two focuses at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your stricture over a stronger and more vigorous part of the fracture, and slightly more when the stricture is directed towards the superior or inferior parts of the fracture, or place a softer stricture of its kind, according to what was remembered at the beginning of this chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And the sheets that cover over the fracture should be soft and moist, not hard or sharp.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let the thread by which it is tied be from linen properly, a medium between the fine and coarse, as we have mentioned.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the member and the ligament after a day.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If something happens that requires correction, such as itching that occurs in the member: then it is necessary to wet the member with hot water, until the itching subsides, and release the member that is not constricted, until it subsides, and then repeat the stricture.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the stricture has already been softened, and the bone is remote, and similar to this: then correct this entirely with your virtue, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is forbidden to the member because of the excess of the stricture, then it is necessary to soften it slightly, and release it for a few days, until it runs to the food, and then tie it again.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if something does not happen to make them weak, as we have said, then it is not necessary to untie, unless after nineteen days or about this.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then the hand of the weak person is hung down to its neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And let the neck of its person be equal, and let it be guarded by its own virtue from unnatural movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And make it sleep over its back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is healed in thirty days, or in thirty-two days, and perhaps it is healed in the twenty-eighth day.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	The whole of this is according to the dispositions of the complexions, and the dispositions of the virtues.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	§ About the healing of bone fractures.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XIII.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	Know that bone fractures of the fingers and toes are rare.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to them except repeated abrasion.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When then the plantar fracture or abrasion happens, it is necessary that the weak hand lies across the quadratus: and the seat should be placed in front according to equality.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place the hand of its person over the extended one.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the assistant extends the broken bone, and adjusts it according to the physician, until they are united by a good connection.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then it is necessary that he puts on plaster and bandage, if not a hot abscess does not occur.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place the plaster over according to the quantity of the wound: and you have already covered it in linen bandage.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If however the fracture is to the lower part of the plant around the ventricle, then make a similar sphere from linen: and let the weak person lie across it with his broken foot: and then it should be tied with a long bandage.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let the plaster be of hide, in which there is softness, so that the skin applies to the body of the foot: and tie it according to what is necessary.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If then the fracture is to the outer side, then it should be done thus: place a drop of oil on top, and another needle from below in the sole; and the hand should be extended straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then place the contracture as it rotates the hand: and extend between the fingers with the ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If then a fracture occurs at one of the joints of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, it should be done according to what is appropriate.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then tie with the sole: and if you love, place a straight needle on it, small: so that the fracture may be pulled out and not move.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If then the fracture is in the other fingers such as the middle, index, or little finger, then it should be done thus: and it should be placed with a healthy digit that follows it: or they should all be tied according to the continuation: and it is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or place a small needle on top of the one we have already placed in the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider in your restoration, and after that placement, place hot stitches: and opposite when something happens from it according to the report of its story.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	¶ On the restoration of the hip bone fracture.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone is often broken and declared by touch: because it is turned to the inner and posterior part.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And the restoration of it is made in such a way that the ligament above the fracture is tied and another ligament below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And it is made weak on its face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then extend all the ligaments that are ministers to their part according to equality: and this when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If then the fracture is near the root of the hip bone, then it should be a ligament to the part of the tendon, so that the extension goes upwards: and another ligament below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	If a near-fracture of the knee occurs, then the near-ligament of the knee should be extended towards the lower parts.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the physician should treat the bone of both hands until it is reduced according to the natural figure: and it should be united by a good connection.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary to place a plaster and bandage, if not an aposteme occurs in the member.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	If an aposteme occurs in that member: then let it be given some days to settle, until the hot aposteme is settled, and then return to your healing.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	However, this bandage should be such.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary to tie above the hard fracture, that is, the binding: and tie it twice or three times: and let there remain some surplus.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then tie the thigh, until the heel of the calf is at the root of the nates.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And insert a long string between the hip and thigh near the knee to the lower parts, and let the ends of the string be at the two parts from the upper part.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then roll over the thigh and hip that remains from the dough.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then place above the hip of the star that is in the place of the fracture of its own star, and place one star on the bone of the thigh.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill the voids between the thigh and hip with soft bands, so that the bandage is equal.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with a strong bandage from the middle over the place of the fracture, three or four folds.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more you elongate with the ligament from the place of the fracture, the less and softer your bandage should be, and softer.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then pay attention to the two ends of the string that you inserted between the hip and thigh.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Stitch therefore when it is either of the three stars that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then cut then with two extremities of the fillet to the lower parts, until the warts to the sole of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And if it binds also the other ends of the stars: so that the stitch does not come out of its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then loosen the stitch on that, while it remains, so that it does not happen to the member by corrosion, nor by gangrene, nor by inflammation, nor by such things.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	If something happens from that.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore, if there is a remedy for this, and correct what happens from that, according to what we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	But if I say it is a fragment of bone that pains: then it is necessary to adjust it, if it is possible for you.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find above that, and remove that: and take care with the one that precedes the reminder, until it is cured.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture of the hip is stitched, besides the stars that we have said in aid and arm, so:
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in the restoration of it, when it is broken in that way, does not happen to a weak walk.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if it is restored alone, besides what is applied to the other leg, then it is necessary that he walks who has it, always.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And you know that the hip is stitched in fifty days, or is added little, or decreased a little: all this is according to the diversity of the complexions, and the rest of the positions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	¶ About the restoration of the fracture of the knee-joint.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You know that the knee-joint fracture rarely happens, but it happens to it often by attrition.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	If indeed a fracture occurs, then either a split or a hole is found in some of its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And this is when it is with the ulna, and without the ulna.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And he stands above it all with his senses.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And the restoration of it is such that it becomes equal to what was broken from its parts with the fingers, until it is gathered and connected according to what is possible from the equation and facility and craftsmanship.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then place the plaster made from wheat flour or milling with albumen if you need that: and place on top of it a round star, if you require that: and stretch it down conveniently for that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the arrangements that we have mentioned in the other fractures, such as burned tendon, and like that: so that you place all accidents with what is convenient for it until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	¶ Regarding the restoration of the thigh fracture.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that the thigh is two bones, of which one is large and called the thigh, and the other small and called the focus.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens that both kinds of fractures that happen to two bones of the arm, and therefore the restoration of it is like the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	If they break two bones at once, the thigh is converted to all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if it is broken more finely, the thigh is converted to the anterior part.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if it is broken more coarsely, you will find it lower: and it is from those that do not hide anything from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then apply the extension, and the equation, and the tying of the stars according to that equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	Indeed, if the fracture of the Thigh is a severe one, bearing many seths, then it should be a minor extension and a gentler alleviation of your own.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the Thigh indeed, there is something from the operation on the arm: and it is that when you make equal stars, and cover all your operation, then take two strips from pine wood, which is given in the making of solar panels that is placed under slabs: and they are made from palm leaves: and choose from them those which have a small grossness, and they should not be from the tiny ones: and their length should be according to the length of the Thigh from the knee downwards.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then cover over each strip with two folds according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one part of the Thigh on one side, and the other on the opposite side: and they should be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then tie the two strips in three places at the two ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	For when the tightening is forbidden, the Thigh leans to the right and left, and stands in a good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And already the cradle is made from wood according to the length of the Thigh, and it is placed in it with the Thigh, so that it may keep it from moving.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	And especially it is necessary that you do this when the fracture is swollen properly.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the Thigh every day, and study with it the last effort of the apostemate, or inflation, or other similar ones.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If then something happens from these, then apply it with what is appropriate, until it heals, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Of the bone fracture of the foot and toes.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	The heel itself does not undergo a complete fracture.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	The bones of the foot sometimes undergo a fracture, and even the fingers, but it does not occur except in grinding in various positions.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see the bone rise above itself to reach the prepared ground, as if walking, then he will place his weakened foot on the prepared ground.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then put your foot there, and place it on the thing that rises from those bones: then press or step on it: and the same one, until it returns to its place.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then place a plaster, and remove the bandage above: and place under the sole of the foot a small tablet with two flat caps.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then tie it with the foot tightly, after you have loosened it with the bands, and the rest that it needs.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When they have been bound for three days, or four, then untie the bandage.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find the bone equal, if it is broken, or dislocated.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation is therefore as you see.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If however some fingers are broken, then restore them, and make them equal as I will tell you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place your finger with the star according to the length of the finger, and make it a little larger than that: then place under the foot this tablet that I tell you, and tie it tightly.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If however that which is broken from the bones is two, or three, or more, then place above all the fingers the star of its quantity, loosened in linen: and tie the tablet on the bottom of the foot: and let it stand on one cap of the tablet outside the sole of the foot, so that it holds good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	It happens to you that you do not overlook, but consider all that I have said to you about the remaining fractures from the accidents we have mentioned: and place every accident against what should be done.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	¶ Of the fracture of a woman's thigh bone, and of the bones of the fingers, and of women.
Caput XIX.	Chapter 19.
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When a woman's thigh bone is broken, then make her sit square.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then lean her towards the back part of her own neck, and hold her back.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then the midwife should fill up the fracture of the woman's thigh bone with her own glove, until it is filled up, and let it be as round as a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then she should be made to shake, and gradually raise the back of her own body.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	This cot will exit, until it is round before the thigh bone of the woman, and the broken bone returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then place a pillow under her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When she wishes to move, remove the cot with ease, then let her move: and then reduce it according to the way you introduced it at first: then return it to the pillow of her own first.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let her do this for seven days, or about, for the bone will be restored.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you will, take a vesical, and tie it over the hole of her bone, and introduce the whole vesical into her thigh bone.
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the vesical with all your might, until the vesical is let out within the thigh bone, for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then fill it up with the cot, and stand for some days, according to what we have mentioned, until she is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the finger bone is broken, then administer in the restoration of it, and the proportion which we have mentioned in the bone of Ancha.
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	The correct path is not hidden in these nearby fractures, which are rare, especially in those who have some knowledge or experience of the subject.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	Understand my book thoroughly, for the fracture itself indicates to you in many positions a correct path in the restoration of his own and the tightening of his: therefore understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	When the virga (rod) of the man is broken, take the guts (intestines) of a goose: and insert the woman (vagina) into herself.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then place it on the same fold of cloth, and it will be bound and left for three days, or about that time, and it will be healed if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	¶ Regarding the restoration of a bone fracture when it is with a tendon.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	If it suits him who has a bone fracture with a tendon, especially if it is large, such as the hip bone, or an aid, or similar to it, so that it can be done quickly, and you are told the conditions for phlebotomy, as we have said.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the tendon lets out blood, then it is necessary that you go quickly to the abscess of it, so that you grind over it with a sharp knife: if there is no other present to you.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture in that same day: and do not postpone it if it does not happen to be a relapse.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	If I say, a hot relapse happens, then let the restoration of it be until the ninth day, until the relapse is settled.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach him on the third and fourth days, for you are making bad things happen to him.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	If the broken bone is prominent above the detected skin: then it is necessary that you try to reduce it and make it equal with your hands, with ease and extension small.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If however not prepare its extension, and its own equality with your hands: then reduce it with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And this is the instrument made of iron, whose length is equal to seven digits or eight, and its width is according to the size of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And therefore it is necessary for the physician to take from them three or four according to the quantity he needs for the treatment of all kinds of fractures.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And it should be rounded: and there should be a small thickness in it, so that it does not double on top of itself during compression at the hour of the operation: and its sharp ends should have a margin at its sharp ends.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And it should be above it according to its thickness from the middle to its lower parts.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	In this operation it is necessary to place the sharp, rough end of its extremity over the prominent end of the bone: and push it with that hand until the bone returns and equals a certain equality.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	Therefore, let us try to equalize the ends of the fracture that are coming out.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If however the ends of its fracture are fine and it does not take it with good reception of the instrument, then let it try to injure the end of that bone, until the instrument has power over it.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	If however you cannot reduce them with the one we have mentioned, then injure it with the one we have mentioned, or cut it with any kind of knife possible for you.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then polish that which remains in the bone from its roughness and minute bark.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When the bone is reduced and it finds a weak painful one after its reduction, then you know that the bone has not returned to its natural place.
Fac ergo illud.	Therefore, do this.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	However, you are giving me a large impediment when your restoration is complete and you make the bone.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then immerse the cloth in a black, alcoholic solution.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	And especially if it is in summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place on the back a poultice of turf or anything containing oil: so as not to cause putrefaction and corruption in the same place.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then apply stars in the hour of your complete restoration of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And let the back be detected: so that you may strike with needles at the wounds according to the number of the wounds.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And be careful not to bind the back with a fracture.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	Indeed, many doctors have done this foolishly: and they have caused death, or putrefaction, or corruption, or scarring on healthy ones.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And your stricture be gentle, soft, and varied in the remaining fractures.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	If the back is bad, or is a large back, and you fear some bad things that we have mentioned above, and you find pain in the place hanging: then it will not be necessary to put stars on it.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make these incisions from hard cloths in the place of the stars, and bind them together with it.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	But when it has been one day or two days, and you see the back beginning to come out, so that a pus is generated in it: then take off the cloth which you have put on above the back with alcohol.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then apply a bandage, and ointment with which we are accustomed to heal wounds: such as the Tetrapharmacon ointment, and like it.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	It agrees with you, so you dissolve the ligament.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And examine the wound every day in the morning and evening until it heals and becomes sound.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary to prepare the member in such a way that pus flows from it to the lower parts with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	If many days pass without the wound healing and the pus does not discharge from it, then you know that there are small bones broken in that place.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Because it is necessary to examine the wound when it is touched.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of them are separated and removed, remove them and take them out.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And which of them are not separated and pierce the member, and cause pain to happen, may be pricked and removed in any way that is possible for you to do that.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	If the wound is inflamed, or suppurating, that is, if it has a feverish or putrid appearance, then it is necessary to oppose one of them with the other that agrees with the cure of the member whose case is related in the chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And in the one in which it is necessary for me to say this, and with whom you make your present mind when the bone breaks and goes over the member, as the hipbone, and the thigh, and similar ones in other large members, it does not happen often that it attracts them, because death often happens from that, even let it be, until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps it may fall by itself in ninety days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then take care of the wound if you see it: and if not, let it be.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	¶ About the treatment of the nodification in the fracture of a bone.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This happens often in the way of this nodation in the path of healing of fractures.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially, which is near the joints: and becomes deformed in its figure from this.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it may prevent the member from its natural operation.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Consider then, if the nodation is recent: administer to it medicines which have an styptic property, such as aloe, and olibanum, and myrrh, and sarcocolla, and acacia, and such like.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	Thus, take some of these, or all of them: and confuse them with vinegar, or with albumen, or with acid: and place them over the nodation in the wound, and bind them firmly over the same stricture good.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And release the stricture, nor dissolve it in many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then dissolve it, and use another, until the nodation be removed.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or bind it over the same lead plate.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	For lead has the property to remove everything which is feared from the members.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the nodation is already turned to the stone, and is strict, and a sudden necessity is required to remove it: then find over it from its upper part, and cut off the superfluous part: or grate it with some sharp instruments, until it be removed: and take care of it until it be healed.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	¶ When it is healed, and the member remains sound after that, it does not happen according to its nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When the fracture of the bones is healed, and the member remains sound after that weak, it does not happen except for many causes.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Of which one is, the multitude of the solutions and ligations of it not according to what ought to be: or because of the superfluity of the stricture of the ligaments, until it be prohibited the food to run to the member: or because of the superfluous embrocation in its unsuitable time: or because of the smallness of blood in the body of the weak, and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	The treatment for this condition is to feed it with weak and tender food, until blood is multiplied in it.
Et administra balneum.	And apply a bath to it.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and merry company to him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then place a plaster over the member: so that it may attract the plaster to the food in large amounts.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And apply ointment to it with hot water, until the food flows out and returns to its natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	¶ About the curing of broken bones when they twist.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter 23.
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When the member has already been restored after the healing of the bone and the fracture or nodation, and it becomes deformed due to the broken bone: and it is deformed in its shape, but the member is not prevented from performing its natural operation: then it does not need to accept the speech of him who thinks that the bone should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	And there have been many stupid doctors and restorers who have done this on our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And this operation is indeed shameful, leading to death or great fear, so that it may be deadly.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the claudication and nodation are recent: then it should be applied with hot water, in which decoctions of softening herbs have been added, such as the leaves of the high-growing plant, and its root, and melilot, and similar ones.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And make for it a plaster with softening plaster, such as dyachilon made appropriately.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or consider the mucilage of the high-growing plant, and mix it with chicken fat, or with olive oil: and apply it with that.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or use ripe figs, and bind them with fine linen, and similar ones that are named from decreasing medicines to strengthen the consolidation.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	When the knot is untied with constant, old, and gentle friction made with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And the motion of the limbs is given to every part in all hours.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	If however, the knot has already become twisted, and has been made strong, and has struck against the stone, and has called for attention to its care with iron: then it should be cut off as above, and the continuity of bones should be released, and the excess from the knot or bone with the sharp knives should be cut off: and ease should be given in that place with anxiety and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	Regarding speech in Dislocation.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the exit of some joint from its place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Because it is forbidden from its own motion, and its figure becomes deformed.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And it causes severe pain and grievous wounds to come upon the weakest.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	When then a dislocation occurs in someone, it is necessary to hurry to the restoration of that one: and there should be no delay at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	For if it delays, the place will become postponed, and perhaps with it the restoration of the dislocation.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, it does not need to move, nor extend in the hour of its postponement.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	For it often causes a spasm and painful wounds.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	But when that happens, it is necessary to hurry to the bleeding of the weak one.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then it is released, until the postponement has rested.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the limb is rubbed with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then it is returned with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And all the limbs are cared for with that one whose memory fails in its place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have already arranged the chapter of dislocation, even according to what precedes in the fracture, from the upper part of the body down to its lower part.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	Regarding the care of the dislocation of the lower jaw.
Caput XXV.	Chapter 25.
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The lower jaw is rarely dislocated except in two cases.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	The dislocation of the lower jaw occurs according to one of two methods.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or they are removed from their places by a slight removal and are softened somewhat.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated in a complete and integral manner, until they are softened to the chest, until the weak jaw is curved, and it cannot hold it, nor close its mouth, and the tongue of its speaker is uncovered.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	However, when the dislocation of it is small, it returns to many positions by itself with little quantity.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If however the dislocation is complete and integral, then it should be that the reduction of it is made quickly and not delayed: and it is necessary that it holds firmly the weak head: and the physician inserts his thumb of one hand into the root of the dislocated jaw between the teeth of it, if the dislocation is from one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or he inserts both of his hands at once, if the dislocation is from two sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the rest of his fingers are outside, by which he can equal it.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And he commands the weak one to clean his jaws and to free them for eating to all parts.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the physician can hold the jaw and push it, until it returns to its place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If however the reduction is difficult, especially if both jaws are at once: then he should make a ointment with hot water and oil, until a easy reduction of it is made to the lower jaw: and he does not delay the reduction of it altogether, as we said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they finally fall asleep and close their wounds, and are not softened: then place some flax cloths over them, with a piece of wax that has been made from wax: and rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then a bandage is applied with ease, using soft ligatures.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And the sleep of the weak should be on their back: and the head of it should stand between two flax cloths, so that it does not move to the right and left: nor is it compelled, or forced to chew anything: indeed, a food of its own desire is placed under its jaw, until when the pains subside, and the mandible is sutured: then it eats what it wants, and it is administered with ease.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	It does not labor over the operation of its own mouth at eating and drinking, and the nodding, until the mandible is sutured, and it is healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If it is difficult to reduce the two mandibles when they are dislocated at some time and do not return to their places: then many fevers occur from there, and constant diet: and perhaps the weak belly is loosened, and perhaps the bitter purification of choler is vomited.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When you see that: then you know that it is a loss, and many die that are affected by this in ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	¶ About the reduction of the shoulder joint dislocation, and the extremity of the humerus.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The shoulder joint, however, is not dislocated from the inner side, because of its continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it is sometimes dislocated to the outside: and this is declared by touch.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And the restoration of it is, that it lies weak on its back, and extends its arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then place it in a strong position with your palm, because it will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then place the plaster over the same, and the bandages, and tie it tightly.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities of these, which follow the thigh, and continue with it, are not easily dislocated, except rarely.
Quod s dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	If it is dislocated on any day: then it must be reduced and made equal as we have said, and prepared for you.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then place the plaster over the same, the bandages, and the tied one.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the surgeon to remain calm and quiet until it heals.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And when this same treatment is applied to the extremity of the shoulder, when it separates even from its own place.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	¶ About the reduction of the shoulder dislocation.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	You know that the shoulder is not dislocated unless in three ways.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One of which is, that it be dislocated to the side of the titillation towards the lower part.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	The second is, that it be dislocated to the side of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it is dislocated to the upper part of the shoulder: and this happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And it is not dislocated to the back, because of the spatula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it is not dislocated to the front, because of the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	And it is most often dislocated and goes out to the lower part, turning away from the titillation: especially in those, where the flesh is few.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	For it goes out quickly in them, and comes quickly.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those where the flesh is many, it is opposite to that, for it comes out with difficulty, and goes in with difficulty.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happens in some men by blow or accident, and the shoulder is struck with hot iron, and it is thought that it is dislocated because of that.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	It is therefore necessary to try this, until you are certain of it, and then proceed to treat it.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And the dislocation is known when the shoulder is turned towards the chest: and you distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a sound one.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you find a clear difference between them, and you find a union in the head of the humerus, and under the titillation at the touch of the head of the humerus as if it were one bone: and an infirm person cannot make the hand move to their own ear, nor move it with all movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And similarly, if the shoulder is dislocated towards the chest or upwards: you will find a clear touch, and it does not hide.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And this dislocation is easy to reduce when it is recent or the child is weak.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	The reduction of this is that he should raise his own hand to the upper part.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then place your hands under the titillation of this, and raise the joint with strength to the upper part of its own place: and he should raise his hand and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then he will lower it down, for he returns quickly.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	But if he does not return by what I have said, and the days that pass before it happens are many: then it is necessary to bathe the weak person in hot water, and apply an ointment that softens and soothes, as if the roots of the tall grasses, and the grapevine, and the mallow were rubbed in and put in the water, and applied.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the weak person will rise on his back: and a sphere and wool that is equal between softness and rigidity is placed under the titillation of this.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the physician will place his heel on the sphere, and raise the head of the humerus with strength, and draw the weak hand downwards.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	Another attendant should hold the head of the weak one, so that it does not move to the lower parts: for he himself returns immediately.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	If you wish, place him according to this manner: and let the present man be longer for the weak one, and stand on the side of the side, and insert his arm under the weakened shoulder: and lift the weakened shoulder upwards until it is suspended in the air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	Another attendant should draw the weak hand towards the lower ventricle of him.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	If the weak one is lying on his back: then it is necessary that something else be hung from him, so that it weighs him down, because the dislocation returns immediately.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	It is also reduced according to another manner: and it is that the log, whose head is round figure like the handle of a mortar, should be laid on the ground: that is not heavy, nor light.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then the cloths are laid on the weak one after the logs have been placed on his head: and the weak one should stand according to the length of the log.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then the hand of him is extended towards the lower part of the other side, and his body is extended from the other side with strength: because the joint returns to its place with weakness.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	If it is difficult to reduce him by all that I have said: then use this care: and it is that you take a log whose length is the quantity of two arms, and whose width is the quantity of four fingers, and whose thickness is the quantity of two fingers: whose head is round, so that the entrance of his shoulder goes into it deep, according to this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then the soft cloths are tied over the round head: so that they do not hurt the weak one.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then the weak one is laid on the weakened shoulder, so that the hand or arm extends over the log up to the lower parts: and the log is placed over the helper, the arm, and the end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then the arm is laid over the step of the ladder across its width, and the hand is extended to the lower part, and the rest of the body is let down from the other side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The joint immediately enters.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	When the opening is completed as much as possible: then it is necessary to place under a flat sphere of equal quantity from wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place the prepared plaster made from flour with olibanum and almond glue over the entire arm as it rotates.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tie the appropriate bandage: and let the rope rotate over the plaster: and connect the hand of this to the neck of its own, and let it hang, and do not allow the hand of this to move for seven days.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it is necessary to place soft food, until the limb is strengthened, because it is more beneficial for its healing.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then a larger one is placed after seven days, or five, and it is moved with motion.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If it holds firm and is not softened, then it is already cured.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If the joint is dislocated many times, due to the moisture that happens to it, or for some other cause: then it is necessary to apply this cauterant with three holes, according to what was said in the chapter of cauterization.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If this is all done and the ligament is loosened after seven days, and the joint is not strengthened, and the plaster and bandage are applied again to it several times, and it does not hold, and it falls, and cannot be lifted up to the shoulder: then you know that the bones of its arm which are towards the head of the humerus are already cut, or stretched, or softened: and you know that the joint is never set in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	Dislocations, however, are caused by the force of pulling and extending the chest and breast, and they are reduced with impulse when it returns, and the remaining tightness and care are given until it is cured.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If, however, it occurs after cure and there is stiffness in the member and slowness in its movement, then a weak bath should be used many times until the stiffness is relieved and it returns to its original state.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	¶ Treatment of the Dislocation of the Knee.
Caput XXVIII.	Chapter XXVIII.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	You know that the dislocation of the knee joint is difficult, and it also returns with difficulty, especially to all parts, and particularly to the front and back.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you: for it is falling under the use, and under the touch, according to whichever figure it is dislocated.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you reduce the dislocated knee with the sound one, it is clearly shown to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	The joint is concealed, and it cannot double the arm, nor touch with its own elbow.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And it is necessary to hurry and reduce the dislocation immediately before it becomes a hot sprain.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if a hot sprain occurs to it, the reduction becomes difficult: and perhaps it is not cured at all, especially when it is to the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	For it is worse in every kind of dislocation and more violent pain: and often it dies with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the restoration of it is when it can be reduced by those that are possible to be reduced, and the hand of the patient is extended with two hands: and the arm of the patient is expanded, and the hand of the physician is above the knee and under it, and he presses the dislocation with his palms of his hands simultaneously, or with the root of his thumb, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	If indeed it is a dislocation to the front, then it returns thusly, so that the hand doubles with its own hand, until it strikes with the root of its palm, which is dislocated, with its own little finger.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer a strong extension, with firm hold: and it is, as if two hands were extending the arm, and both hold it, so that it does not move during extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm is turned over to all parts, after it has been reduced above the palm of the hand, whether it be a long doubled bandage or a wide ligament.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when it touches the physician's hand with the joint, anoint it with oil: so that it be one of those which aid in the lubricity of the joint with ease.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then he will drive the joint with a strong push, until it returns.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after the reduction of it, it is necessary that it be laid on the same plaster, wherein there is stipticity, and exudation with the bone: and it should be tied in a proper manner.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And hang the arm from the weak neck: and let it remain for some days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then it is unfastened.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If then the joint is firm in its place, then unfasten the ligament from it, and let it go.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see the joint not to be well tied, then repeat the plaster, and the ligament, and let it go for some days, until it is tied.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then let it go.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If however, oldness comes to it after the reduction of the joint, and it is in motion: then administer hydration in the bath, and subtle friction, and compression, until it becomes tight, or lay it on the same joint, that is, the fat nates of a pig.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then, let it lie and release her on that day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then, take it away and insert him into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When he is washing, then scrape the joined part with gentle rubbing.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then, dip it over her again once, and twice, and a third time with the introduction of the bath, until it becomes soft.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if you wish, place over her feces a damp, heated wax, and twist it over her.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Do this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	She becomes softened, and returns to its original position.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	¶ About the treatment of dislocations in Almahassem.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXIX.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The hand of Mahassem is often dislocated, that is, the joint between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And the reduction of this dislocation is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	The contrary of the others is jointed.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	Nevertheless, it is necessary that there be ease in the reduction of this dislocation at the time of its dislocation, before the place be seized; or it may happen in the seizure of the place a hot aposteme.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of this dislocation is that you place Mahassem's weak hand over the table, and extend her other hand; and the physician places his palm over the prominence of the joint, and presses it until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	Nevertheless, it is necessary that it be considered if the palm has already receded to the vent of the hand: then he places his weak back over the table at the extension and reduction; and if the dislocation is proceeding to the back of the hand, then the position of his hand intrinsically over the table is that the inner part of his hand is placed over the prominence of the joint, so that the hand of the physician falls on its own prominence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If he returns immediately, it is good: and if not, then grasp it with ointment while it is seated, and let him go, without troubling about this.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if he does not endure, nor can you supervise his reduction after he has left him for several days, nevertheless the union remains according to the texture of his own nature: and it will not hurt the weak at all, unless his hand is softened, and he cannot hold anything: then you know that the nerves are either ruptured or merely scratched.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	It is not genius in this, unless it is held with ointment near the risk of its case.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps it does not harm anything.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	When Almahassem does not return, then place the ointment we have mentioned over him.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it is grasped and let go for five days, and then it is loosened and let go, and the hand is exercised.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	If however, the movement of his body is arrested, and something heavy happens to it within it: then ease it with warm water and friction several times, until it is eased.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	¶ About the treatment of the dislocation of the digits.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When a digit is dislocated from any of them, or from the back of the palm, or from its ventrum: then extend the finger, and press the dislocation with your thumbs until it returns.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the head of the finger and suspend the reversed part to which it is dislocated for two days, and let it go.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it and extend it until it is straight in that day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When it is night, tie it according to the description: and do not cease to untie it in the day: and exercise it with motion: and tie it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	This should be done after some days, until it is tightened.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	Similarly, if it is dislocated to the belly of the hand, and you have done the first part of your operation, tighten it to its own part, and then do the operation again until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	Similarly, when it is dislocated to other parts, do the operation as before.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	¶ On the treatment of a dislocation of the Dorsospine.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter XXXI.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When it happens to anyone that the Dorsospine is dislocated, or the complete dislocation of the neck, or the Spondiles are pulled out from their places: then there is no cure in this case, because death comes to the weak.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And the sign of this is that the weak one goes out without will, and cannot hold it, and often some members of him are softened, or two thighs of him, or two arms of his, or one of them: or the Spondile is pulled out from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For it is often removed because it is often made to be removed to four parts.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	Therefore, that which is removed to the back, is called Gibbosity.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	The cure of it is, that you consider this now, if Gibbosity happens from childhood: then there is no cure in this case, neither is there any healing at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	But in the other that happens by chance, or by hitting, or similar to these, the ancients have already spoken about the modes of curing with a long speech.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	Whose most does not return when beneficial.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I have already briefly spoken of it, which does not excuse much from much proximity to my house: and from my explanation, in which I explained that, and shaped the instrument of it in a different way from what they showed it, and explained it.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I declare that there is no intelligence or cure from the gangrene that occurs from the anterior part.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And similarly, in those that occur to both sides as well.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And it is not cured from them, unless those that happen in the back properly, as I say: and it is, as it extends over its face above the heel, nearly up to the wall: and it is expanded under it with a moist string, so as not to hurt the chest of its.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then a straight log is placed on the ground, fixed in the heel at the end of the foot, nearly at the head of its: and another log is placed at the other end of its foot: and it should hold the log, and it should not be firmly fixed in the heel.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	And it should hold the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then cover over the weak head, and under the ligament of its gently, tightly: and extend the end of the ligament to the log that is at its head: and tie it up in it.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then stretch another string above the ankles of its, and above its knees, and at its heels.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the strings together, and tie them up in the other log that is at its feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then the holder will extend all the strings to the part of the log ligament, and the two logs should not be removed from their places where they are fixed: but they should not be firmly fixed, as I said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician will put his hands on the spine with strength, until he returns: or he will put it over a table.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he will tie his feet to the table until he returns.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	If however he does not return by this treatment, then take the table whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	The surgical incision should be made on the wall near the weakest point, where the table's edge enters.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the table on the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	The physician should then place his feet on the opposite end of the table.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	The physician should tie it tightly until the spine is compressed and return to his place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then, if you wish, operate with the hand that is wrapped around your arm: and it is as if you are placing two sticks on the ground near the weakest part of the foot, where the length of one brachium is equal to the length of the other.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And the length of the stick between all the fingers of your hand should be equal to one palm: and already there is a hole in every place where the tornum runs: and it should be firmly planted on the ground a lot, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And then he inserts the round stick: and the tornum is where the ligament rotates in two holes of two sticks.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at the end of it there is a hole where the stick is firmly planted, whose length is equal to the hand that rotates it, and in two other sticks it is also like this.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tie the ligaments that you have tied in the weak chest of the tornum that is at the head of it: and tie the ligaments that you have tied in the legs of it in the tornum that is at the foot of it.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand at all the minor tornums that rotate the hand of your leg with the ligament, and the physician should compress the spine according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of the tornum that follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then after the spine is compressed and returns to its place, then it is necessary to put the plaster of ichor with albumin on the wound.
Deinde stuppam.	Then he applied a dressing.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then place above the plaster a star-shaped piece from the tablet, whose width is three digits, or about them.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And the length of it should be such that it occupies the place of Gibbositatis, and above a part of Sanae's spine.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then it is placed with the bandage that we mentioned.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And a weak nourishment of fine substance is used until it heals.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	If there remains some prominence in the place at the end of healing: then it is necessary that the medicines which soften and ease be given, with the administration of the tablet that we mentioned at a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And already the lead is being administered in that layer.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And sometimes there is a prominence in the end of the spine of the back: and it is supposed to be a dislocation, and that is the bone that has already projecting.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Therefore it does not belong to be presumed to it with this medicine, perhaps it will cause death to happen.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	¶ About the treatment of Anchae's dislocation.
Caput XXXII.	Caput XXXII.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You know that the joints of Anchae and the joints of the elbow do not happen unless it is a dislocation only: nor does it happen to them which happens to other joints by removal small and conduction.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And indeed the joint of Anchae is dislocated according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	For what reason it is that it is dislocated to the front and back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And indeed it is mostly dislocated to the inside: and very little to the front and back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of the dislocation of it to the inside is: because when you join the weak thigh with a sound one with a weak one, it is longer: and the thigh of his is more prominent than the sound one, and the weak one cannot extend its foot at the inguinal area: and it is the place which follows the inguinal area struck by fire, because the head of the hip has already been soaked there.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	The mark of this is that a dislocation occurs on its outside, which are its opposite circumstances.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	The mark of this is that a dislocation occurs in the front, because it extends the sound thigh according to the complement: indeed it does not double itself without pain which is in the knee: and if it strives to walk, it cannot go over that in front: and it retains its urine, and it is pinched at its buttock, and there is a cushioning of its thigh at its heel during walking.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	The mark of this is that a dislocation occurs in the back, as it does not extend the thigh, nor can it double itself before doubling the knee: and its thigh is also shorter on the other side: and the buttock is softened, and the head of the hip is at that place.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	Reduction, however, of this dislocation is that you should consider at that time, if the dislocation is habitual, which is already old with having it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then, if you perform a reduction of it, and it remains according to its disposition: then there is no cure at all in it.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore, it does not follow that there should be a presumption of great pain.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	In that one whose dislocation is recent, and it is of one of the four kinds of dislocations: then promptly to this, if you want to join it, extend it to the interior and to the exterior, and move it right and left: perhaps it will return, and there will be no need for another care.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	If, however, it does not return in this way, then it is necessary to prepare a strong attendant, and extend the thigh of its lower part: or with its hands, or with the bandage that is laid on its thigh above the knee: and another attendant extends its hand over the fingers of its, so that it pushes its own hand under the fingers of its.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then he ties it with a gentle bandage over the root of the hip bone, and holds onto the other end of the ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And its extension should be from the front of the thigh to the shoulder or from the back to the back.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And their extensions should be of equal length until the weak one hangs down with his body from the earth and remains hanging.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	For this is the common form of the four kinds of extensions.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If then the displacement returns with that which I said, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary for every kind of this that I will say about its treatment.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In the reduction itself of that kind, when the displacement is to the inside, it is necessary for the weak one to be hung over the sound side of its own.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then he will put the bandage over the root of the hip bone, in the part that is between the head of the hip bone and the place under the thigh.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then he will extend the bandage upwards from the front of the thigh to a higher part of the body, to the shoulder.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then he will take another strong arm for him, and will reduce the large part of the weak thigh, and will extend it to a strong extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	And now it returns to its own place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	For this is the easiest of the other kinds of treatment for this member.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If however, he is excused from you and does not obey you to enter with this kind of treatment altogether: then it is necessary for two weak feet to be tied together with a strong and gentle bandage over two calcanei, and over two knees; and the length of each should be of the same size as the four digits of its own quantity: and the weak one should be extended more by the quantity of two digits.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then the weak one is hung up on the head of the wooden beam, which is at home: and its length is equal to the quantity of two forearms.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then have the strong man of the youth press the head of the thigh: and let it hang with the weak one at another place: and let the strong man of the youth push the thigh with strength, for the joint returns to its place with weakness.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In the reduction of its own joint, when it is dislocated to the outside, it is necessary that the weak one lies on the foot, according to what we have said about the genuine deformity.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And the tendon is tied above the thigh of the weak one, properly, and above his breast.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two beams are placed, one at his foot, and another at the head of the same.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a beam is placed in the middle of the thigh, fixed well: over which wet bandages are placed so that it does not hurt the weak one: and the beam should be between the thighs so that it does not attract to the lower parts during extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then all the helpers extend to their own part, and the physician ensures the reduction with his hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If then he obeys to the reduction, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, place over the same tablet, and press it equally as we have said in the deformity, on the same.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the weak one lies on his own sound side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it is necessary that the weak thigh is stretched out carelessly: and this is according to the same statement over the thigh: and the physician places his right hand palm on the weak groin.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he bends it with his other hand, and places it extended to the lower part of the same leg.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	If the dislocation is to the back: then it is not necessary for the weak one to extend to the lower parts, and to be raised above the ground: rather, it should be placed above a hard object, just as it is necessary when it is also dislocated wide on the outside, according to what we said about his pillow over two bellies: it is above his face, and the ligaments are extended: according to what we said earlier.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And it should be given compression with the table, even above the place to which it is going to be rejoined, when the reduction is complete according to what is necessary.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of the reduction will not be hidden from you: and it is that the weak ones extend two legs: and when you see them equal, and the weak one strings his own leg, and expands it without excuse: then you know that the member has already returned, according to what is necessary: then join the two thighs, and put on plaster, and tie with a tight rope, so that it does not move widely to any part: and the weak one should hold tight for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then untie the ligament, and the plaster, and compare the leg with the other: then if you see them equal in state, then you know that the dislocation is already firm: therefore, the weak one should be able to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see something of softening: then return, and the plaster of that, and tie it according to your first tightness: and let it be loose for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then untie that and make it slow in walking over the other for a few days until it is well recovered.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	¶ About the dislocation of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	¶ Chapter XXXIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	The knee is dislocated in three ways.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	The dislocation occurs on the outside, inside, and bottom, that is, to the back.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	And it is not dislocated to the front.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	The sign of this dislocation is that it is bent downwards, as if to apply its thigh to its own hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	However, if it does not adhere to the hip: then you know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	The restoration of all modes of this dislocation is to make the weak one sit upright, so that it may extend its thigh as far as possible, and your back may be against its face if it can, and place its foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then make it cling to the knee of your hand, and make the fingers of your hand straight above the knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your hand's palm the two sides of the knee with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another extends its foot, until it returns to its place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	The sign of return is that it clings to the thigh with the hip in ease, not laboriously.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then apply the plaster itself, and make it cling to the thigh with the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind it together for three or four days.
Deinde solue ea.	Then untie it.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And the weak one should not use walking for a few days until it is cured.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	However, if it refuses your reduction, then administer a strong extension with the ligaments that precede the story of Anchaea, until it returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	¶ Treatment of Dislocation of the Heel (Calcaneus)
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The heel is sometimes reduced by a small removal, and sometimes it is dislocated according to the complement.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And its dislocation is made, either to the inside or outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	The sign of this dislocation is that you see the calcaneus swollen, proceeding to the part to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	The treatment of this displacement is a easy reduction: and it is that it extends with ease with the hands, and becomes equal, until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the treatment of this however when it is dislocated according to the complement, it is necessary that you make the weak one sit upright: and hold it with a strong assistant from the posterior part of the back of it, in the middle of itself.
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold it with your right hand leg of it from the upper part of it, and with your left hand from the lower part of the foot of it in the place of the calf.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then take the leg with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with your left two fingers.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend it with your left hand, and press the chest of the foot with your right hand without effort.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Do this twice as we have told you.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then press the chest of the foot to the thigh in your third finger, and you will pull the calf.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	If then it returns to the thigh in one finger, or in two according to this way, and you see the leg equal, it is good: and if not, then you repeat the operation on it, because it returns itself.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	If however it is forbidden you the reduction of it with that which we have told you: then make the weak one lie down on its back over its own back over the earth, and fasten a cushion in a firm earth, so that it falls between its legs: and you have already covered over it with a cloth, so that it does not hurt the weak one.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then the assistant takes the chair of it: then extend the assistant's other leg, either with his hands or with a bandage that lies over the collar of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then the surgeon extends all his hands against the extension of his opponent's: and a splint is to be stood still between two weak legs, holding it, so that it does not attract the body of his opponent towards the lower parts at the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then the surgeon should reduce the dislocation with his hands, and the other should hold a sound leg to the lower parts.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For dislocation returns with violence.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	When then the dislocation returns, and you are declared healthy of the recovery thereof: then place the plaster and ointment, and tightly tie it with the firm ligaments, and tie the foot with the ligament to the thigh.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary that you should beware or fear lest the nerves which are above the heel posterior should be harmed, and the ligament not be placed over them, lest they be injured.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then release it to them in two or three days.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	If the ligament is softened, tie it up again: then dissolve it on the third or fourth day: and forbid the weak one from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	If however he dares to walk before that time, it is not secure that the ligament may not be dissolved over the dislocation, and corrupted, and not receive after that treatment.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If however a hot aposteme happens to him: then it is necessary that you should give him in the sedative of his, in which our narrative precedes in another place from the cure, and ointment, until it be removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	¶ About the dislocation of the toes of the foot, and care.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that he be equal to what is dislocated from them with the extension of a little without labor: and that indeed is not difficult, but rather easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If however the dislocation is in some of the nails of the sole of the foot: then it is necessary that he make his weak foot sit on a place equal to the earth, or on a table: and stand as walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand still and place your foot on that which is being discussed from among those joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then heat that with your foot while you wait, and you will see it already even, and there will be no sign of an eminence in its place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then place under your foot's heel a tablet which will take the whole foot, with two heads on it.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then tighten it accordingly, after three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then loosen it, and make it rest from walking for many days, until it is tightened and secured from reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	¶ About the kinds of dislocations with a bone or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	¶ Head XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When something happens from that, and you take care of its cure and restoration, death often follows: and therefore it is not proper to presume upon the cure of that kind, unless he who does so be very skilled in the art, having long practice, merciful, pious, slow, not audacious, nor presumptuous: and to use in medicines which are laid up hot only: and to let go the weak for a long time.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you see, or hope for health from the salvation of pain and in which something seems to hope:
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Therefore, let him try the reduction of that immediately at the beginning of the case, before the hot aposteme comes.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	If then the member returns according to our will, then we administer the regimen which soothes the hot aposteme: and we care for the bone with it that is convenient to him from dry unguents.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	But if the dislocation is with a fracture, and happen in bones that are separated from each other, then let him try the removal of those, and make in it what I said in simple diseases from that which precedes in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	According to your virtue, and to keep you safe from the beginning of life to the end of it, fear nothing. This is according to what I have said before.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For this is better for you before God, and more lasting for your glory, and more safe for your body among them at their time.
