of hermaphrodites
Hermaphroditism occurs in two ways in men: one is that between the two testicles there appears something like the female genitalia, sometimes with hair, and sometimes urine comes out of it. The other way is in women, where they have something like a penis and two testicles above the base. The treatment for both men and women is to cut all the extra flesh and treat it like other wounds. In the second way, in men where urine comes out through the skin of the testicles, there is no treatment.
