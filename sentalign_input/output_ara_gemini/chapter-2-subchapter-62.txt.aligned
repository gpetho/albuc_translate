Chapter sixty-two on incising the watery vein.	CHAPTER SIXTY-TWO. On opening a watery hernia.	0.73262215
Hydrocele is the collection of moisture in the white membrane that is under the skin of the testicles surrounding the testicle, which is called the scrotum, and it may be in a special membrane prepared for it by nature on one side of the testicle, so that one might think it is another testicle, and it may be between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane that we mentioned, and this only occurs rarely.	A watery hernia is a collection of fluid in the white membrane lying beneath the skin surrounding the testicle, which is called the scrotum. Sometimes it has a capsule of its own which nature has formed alongside the testis so that one would think it another testicle; it may also form between the skin of the scrotum and the white membrane which we mentioned; however, this occurs very rarely.	0.8310759
This hydrocele arises from a weakness that affects the testicles, so this substance flows to it, and it may result from a blow to the testicles, and this moisture is of many colors, either yellowish, or bloody red, or turbid black, or watery white, which is the most common.	This hernia arises from a weakness occurring in the testicles and this matter drains into it; sometimes it happens from a blow upon the testicles. The fluid is of different colours, sometimes yellowish, sometimes blood-red, sometimes like lees, black, and sometimes the fluid is watery-pale; this actually is the commonest.	0.7720934
The signs by which the collection of water is known are that if it is in the white membrane that we mentioned, the swelling will be slightly elongated and round, like the shape of a testicle, and the testicle will not appear because the moisture surrounds it from all sides.	Now these are the signs whereby we know where the fluid is collecting: if it be in the tunica albugínea, as we have said, the tumour will be round and slightly elongated like the shape of an egg. The testis is not apparent since the fluid hems it in all round.	0.7623631
And if the moisture is in a special membrane for it, the swelling will be round on one side of the testicle, and for this reason, one might imagine it is another testicle.	But if the fluid be contained in a capsule of its own the tumour will be round, to one side of the testicle; therefore one imagines that it is another testicle.	0.7580824
And if the moisture is between the skin of the testicles and the white membrane, it will be perceptible by touch.	If the fluid be situated between the skin of the scrotum and the tunica albugínea it will be obvious to the touch.	0.6655105
And if you want to know the color of the moisture, probe the swelling with the square probe whose picture has been presented, and whatever comes out after the probe, you will judge it by what is inside it.	If you wish to know the colour of the fluid, take a sample from the tumour by means of the four-sided exploring needle which has been figured previously; and by what comes out in the track of the explorer you may know the colour of the contained fluid.	0.7539475
Then you pad the water-filled membrane with wide padding and remove all the water.	Then open up the membrane containing the fluid with a wide perforation and draw off all the fluid.	0.8208965
Then you separate the edges of the incision with hooks and stretch the membrane upwards, and do not touch the containing skin of the testicle, and you cut the membrane however you can cut it, either all at once or piece by piece, especially its thin side, because if you do not complete its cutting, you cannot be sure that the water will not return.	Then with hooks separate the two edges of the incision and draw the membrane upwards but do not touch the skin overlying the testes; then cut away the membrane in whatever way is possible, either as a whole or piecemeal, particularly the side piece; for unless you use the utmost diligence in cutting it away you cannot be certain that the fluid will not come back.	0.88044393
If the testicle protrudes out of its skin during your work, when you have finished cutting the membrane, put it back, then bring together the edges of the skin of the testicle with sutures, then treat it as you would treat other wounds until it heals.	If the testicle should protrude from its covering of skin while you are operating, return it when you have finished cutting the membrane; then bring together the two edges of your incision with a suture. Then dress with the usual dressings for wounds until healed.	0.8183619
If you find that the testicle has been corrupted by another disease, you should tie the vessels that are in the spermatic cord for fear of bleeding, then cut the testicle from the spermatic cord and remove the testicle, then treat it as we have mentioned.	If you find the testicle corrupted by some other disease, you will have to tie off the vessels which are in the suspensor, for fear of haemorrhage. Then cut the testicle from the suspensor and remove it and dress as we said above.	0.9124324
If the collected water is on both sides, know that they are two hydroceles, so cut the other side as you did on the first, and if it is possible for you to perform the operation as one, then do so.	If the accumulation of fluid be on both sides you may know it to be a double hydrocele; so make another incision on the other side as you did for the first. If it is convenient for you to make one operation of it, do so.	0.8643972
Then you wipe the blood and insert wool dipped in oil or rose oil into the incisions, and put other wool dipped in syrup and oil on the outside and spread it over the testicles and the flank, and place folded rags over it, which are the compresses, and tie them from above with the bandage that has six ends, in this way:	Then wipe away the blood and apply to the incisions wool that has been soaked in olive-oil or oil of roses and on that again more wool that has been soaked in wine and oil, and spread that over the testicles and over the hypogastrium; and over that again folded pieces of linen forming pads and bind them down with a bandage having six heads.	0.8486283
Then two pieces of cloth are taken, sewn together, and stuffed with carded wool according to this example.	Two pieces of cloth should be taken and sewn together and packed in between with carded wool to this pattern.	0.77962404
And the ends with which it is tied are made of cotton or moist wool. And they are gathered by tightening in the waistband of the trousers.	The ends by means of which it is attached should be made of cotton or soft wool and should be drawn tight at the waist of the breeches.	0.72975534
And one of the ends is taken on the buttocks to the back. And the second is taken towards the pubis. And the two ends are on the thighs from below. And the two remaining ends are on the groins.	One of the ends you take over the seat toward the back: the second end you take toward the pubes, the two ends round the thighs below, and the remaining two ends over the groin, and the whole is bound up tight with the belt of the breeches.	0.7966361
And this bandage may also be made by cauterization instead of incising with iron.	This rupture may also be treated by cautery instead of surgery.	0.7085345
Which is that you take a fine knife-shaped cautery and incise with it the skin of the testicles while it is hot, as we have described, until the white membrane containing the water is exposed.	This will mean taking a knife-edged cautery and cutting with it the skin of the testicles; it should be hot, as we told you before, and used until the white membrane covering the hydrocele be exposed.	0.7971683
Then take another cautery of this shape: And it resembles the Greek eye,	Then take another cautery of this type, which resembles the Greek letter tau; and with it perforate that membrane.	0.65977705
then you cauterize with it that peritoneum while it is hot until all the moisture comes out,	It should be hot so as to draw out all the humidity.	0.5144835
then you stretch the peritoneum with hooks and peel off the containing layer with the cautery iron and cut it as much as you can until you completely eradicate it and be careful with the testicle, do not touch it with the fire,	Then stretch the membrane with hooks, dissect away the capsule with the cautery and cut it away as best you are able until you have completely removed it. But be careful that the heat do not touch the testicle.	0.7629017
and know that this procedure is safer and further from bleeding and better than the incision procedure,	You should know that this operation is safer, further removed from the danger of haemorrhage, and better, than operation by incision.	0.8064854
if you encounter during the incision or during cauterization a hot swelling or bleeding or something else, then you should treat whatever you encounter of that with the appropriate treatment as mentioned before,	If, while operating either with the knife or the cautery, you are hindered by an inflammatory swelling or haemorrhage or anything else, you should deal with all of them by suitable treatment in accordance with what has been said before.	0.83413976
if the patient is cowardly and does not have patience for this procedure because of its ugliness, then let him use the lancing as I will describe it,	If the patient be timid and will not suffer this operation on account of its unpleasantness, then treat by perforation as I shall now describe.	0.80113095
and if it is confirmed for you by the evidence we presented that the hydrocele is watery, then you should sit the patient on a high chair,	When by the signs we have mentioned you are certain that the hernia is watery, you should seat the patient on a high chair and pierce the tumour in its lower part with a broad scalpel.	0.68673086
then lance the swelling at its bottom with a wide scalpel and make the lancing along the body and let the opening be wide so that all the water flows out,	The perforation should run in the long axis of the body, and it should be an ample opening to let all the fluid run out.	0.66758287
then put cotton on the area and bandage it and leave it to absorb the remaining water, then treat it until the wound heals,	Then put cotton on the place and bind it on and leave it so as to soak up the rest of the fluid; then dress the wound until it heals.	0.8988198
if the exit of the water is difficult during your lancing of it, and that is only because the white membrane obstructs the mouth of the wound and prevents the exit of the water, then you should insert into the wound a goose feather or the instrument with which the water of lovers is extracted, whose image has been presented before, or increase the opening of the wound a little,	But if the fluid fail to flow out when the opening is made, which would be due to the tunica albuginea's obtruding into the opening and preventing the outlet of the fluid, you should then introduce into the wound a goose-quill or an instrument such as is used for ascites, already described; or else the opening should be widened a little.	0.71637046
and know that the water may return and collect after six months or so, so if it collects, lance it in the same manner, and the patient should endure his days.	But you should know that after six months or so the fluid may come back and collect again; when it does so, perforate him in exactly the same manner; so will the patient prolong his life.	0.7704815
