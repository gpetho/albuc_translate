On the reduction of ribs when fractured. Know that rib fractures occur only in the thick areas near the back, while their front ends are subject to contusion because they are cartilaginous, and knowing this is not hidden from the senses when examining with the fingers.	On the repair of ribs when they are fractured. You should know that fracture of the ribs occurs only at the thick parts bordering on the vertebrae, whereas the anterior extremities are only contused, because they are cartilaginous; this is easily diagnosed on examination with the fingers.	0.8897979
Their reduction is by straightening the fracture with the fingers in a secure manner until the shape is as it should be, then bandage and splint the broken bone if needed. If the rib fracture is angled inward, it causes severe pain to the patient.	They should be set by levelling out the fracture with the fingers in any manner you can so that the form is as it should be; then apply the plaster and bind the broken bone with a splint, if necessary.	0.7807557
And a pricking like the pricking that occurs to someone with pleurisy, because the bone pricks the diaphragm, and also causes him difficulty breathing, coughing, and expulsion of much blood, and this is difficult to treat. The ancients devised many tricks for it.	If it be a depressed fracture of the ribs, then the patient will have a vehement pain and a piercing sensation like that of pleurisy, since the bone is piercing the pleura; in addition he will have difficulty in breathing and will cough, and vomit much blood; the treatment of this is difficult. In this the Ancients practised many devices.	0.8020699
Some of them said that the patient's food should be such as generates flatulence and wind, so that the abdomen swells and expands, and the fracture is pushed outward. We dislike this, lest it be a confirmation of the occurrence of a hot swelling if it has not occurred, and if it has occurred, it increases and confirms it.	Some said that the patient should have food of such a kind as to generate wind and inflation to blow out and stretch the belly and so push out the fracture. We, however, reject this, since it will excite an effusion if one has not already arisen; and if one has arisen it will increase and confirm it.	0.90356946
Some of them said that a cupping glass should be placed on the area and then sucked strongly, which is more like the standard, except that it is feared that the cupping glass will attract excess to the area because of its weakness.  Some of them said that the area should be covered with wool dipped in hot oil.	Some of them said a cupping-vessel should be applied to the place and strong suction be made; this seems more reasonable except that there is a risk of the vessel's drawing superfluities to the place on account of his weak state. Some of them said that the place should be covered with wool soaked in warm oil and that a pad should be placed in the intercostal space to fill it up so as to make the bandaging level when you wind it round.	0.83351386
And padding is placed between the ribs until they are filled, so that the bandaging is even when you wrap it around the circumference. Then the patient is treated with the treatment of pleurisy, with regard to food and medicine. If the patient is afflicted with a severe matter that he cannot bearâ€¦ And the bone was piercing the diaphragm with a harmful piercing, and we feared for the patient, so it is necessary to make an incision over the area and expose the broken rib. Then we place under it the instrument that protects the peritoneum, which has been described previously, and we cut the bone gently and remove it.	Then treat the patient with diet and medicines as for pleurisy. If the patient is in such a bad way that he cannot bear it, the bone painfully piercing the pleura, and we are afraid for him, then we shall have to cut down upon the place and lay bare the broken rib; then we place under it the instrument to protect the membrane, which has been described, and gently cut out the bone and remove it.	0.8396478
Then we bring together the edges of the wound, if it is large, with sutures, and treat it with ointments until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs during that time, then quickly soak compresses in rose oil and place them on the area, and also treat the patient internally with that which soothes the swelling.	Then the edges of the wound should be joined, with a suture if large, and dressed with ointments until healed. If meanwhile there arise an abscess, quickly soak pads in oil of roses and apply them to the place and treat the patient with internal remedies against abscess too.	0.909294
And he lies on the side that makes sleep easier for him until he recovers.	Let him lie upon the side which is easier for him to sleep on, until it heals.	0.8061115
