 CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE.
On the reduction of a dislocation of the clavicle and of the head of the humerus.
 The clavicle is never dislocated inwards because of its continuity with the breast-bone; but sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and then it is detected by palpation.
The replacement is thus: the patient is to lie on his back and stretch out both arms; then with the palm of your hand press heavily upon the place and it will go back.
Then apply to it the plaster and pads, and bandage it up.
As to the extremity of the clavicle, which is close to the shoulder and joined to it, it is only rarely dislocated; but if ever it is dislocated you must reduce it and set it straight as we have mentioned, by any convenient means.
Then apply the plaster, pads, and bandages, and bid the patient keep quiet and still until it is healed.
By this same treatment you may also reduce the head of the humerus when it is displaced.
