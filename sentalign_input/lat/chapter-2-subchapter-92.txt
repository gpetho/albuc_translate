On the incision for worms generated under the skin, called the "Bovine Disease."
Chapter 94.
This disease is called the "Bovine Disease" in a certain land among us, because it often occurs in cattle, and it is a small worm that forms between the skin and flesh.
And it moves throughout the whole body, ascending and descending, and becomes perceptible as it moves from one limb to another, until it eventually breaks through the skin and emerges wherever it ruptures.
Its formation is due to the decay of certain humors.
Just as worms and serpents, that is, roundworms and ascarids, occur in the belly.
It is feared for its malignancy.
For when it moves through the body and rises to the head, and reaches a place, it may rupture there, emerge, and destroy the eye; this happens frequently.
Therefore, when you wish to treat and remove it, this can only be done when it is moving and visible to the senses.
You must therefore bind tightly above and below it with a constricting band.
Then make an incision over it and extract it.
But if it is deep in the flesh and cannot be found, then apply a cautery with fire over the area until it dies.
The greatest fear is its corruption, by which it destroys the eye, as we have mentioned.
If you see it has already reached the head near the eye, then bind tightly beneath it with a strong constriction on the eyebrow.
Then make an incision over it and extract it.
The patient must cleanse their body with medicines that dissolve foul, putrid humors.
And they should avoid foods that cause decay.
