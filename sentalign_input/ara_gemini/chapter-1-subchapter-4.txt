Chapter four on cauterizing chronic migraine.
If you treat migraine with the aforementioned advanced treatment and what we mentioned in the classification of diseases, and the treatment does not work, and you see that the ailment is not resolved by what we mentioned of the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire, then it is necessary to heat the knife-shaped cautery iron until it becomes white after marking the painful area with a line half a finger long or so, and you withdraw your hand at once while pulling it tight until you cut the artery and reach the bone, except that you should be careful of contacting the jaw that moves during chewing, lest you burn the muscle or the nerve that moves it, causing spasm.
Be careful and vigilant about bleeding from the artery that you cut, as there is danger in cutting it, especially for those who are ignorant of what they are doing and have not been trained and experienced, and it is better to leave the procedure.
The management of accidental bleeding from the artery will be mentioned in its place in the book, God willing.
If you find that the ailment is not resolved by this cauterization and you see that the patient's body can tolerate it, cauterize him in the middle of the head as we described, and treat the wound until it heals, God willing.
And if you wish, use the cauterization that we mentioned in the chapter on dissecting the artery with the two-bladed cautery iron, for it is a better and more effective cauterization than this.
