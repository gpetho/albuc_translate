of the fracture of the leg
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is rightly called "fibula," and the other is called "tibia";
and fractures occur just as they do in the arm, and therefore the restoration is similar to that of the arm, and the procedure is the same. And if both bones are broken together, then the leg turns in all directions.
And if the slender bone is broken, it turns forward.
And if the large bone is broken, there is great pain, and it is clearly visible;
and it turns downwards.
Then apply traction, and set it evenly, and bind the splints evenly as well;
but nevertheless, if the fracture is severe, and there are many pieces, the traction must be less and lighter;
and align it according to your skill.
And when you have completed all your work, then take two wooden splints, shaped so that they enclose the leg on one side and the other, and are the length of the leg from the knee to below;
then wrap in two places a bandage above and below, and tie it in the middle also, and at this point the leg will not be able to bend to the right or left, and so it is well;
and some apply a cradle the length of the leg, and it is made of wood, and the leg is placed in it to prevent movement, and this is properly done in a fracture where there is a wound;
and move the leg each day to see if there is a hot abscess or another problem;
thus treat it until it is healed.
