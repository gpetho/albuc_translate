Chapter fifty on the swelling that arises from the twisting of a nerve.
Just as a swelling may occur in an artery or vein, so too may it occur in a nerve, whether due to a blow or from excessive fatigue or similar causes.
This occurs most frequently in the wrists and heel, and in every place where joints move. It is a protruding swelling, its color similar to the rest of the body, and it is most often painless. If pressed firmly, the patient feels a kind of numbness.
The swelling is not located deep within the body, but rather under the skin. It moves in every direction, yet doesn't go forward or backward.
So those that are in the joints, it is inadvisable to treat with iron instruments, for it may cause chronic pain.
And as for those that are on the head or forehead, incise the skin with a scalpel.
If the swelling is small, grasp it with forceps and cut it off at the base. If it is large, hook it with a snare, peel it off, then extract it and close the wound with sutures, treating it until it heals.
