On the fracture of the bones of the foot and toes.
Chapter XVIII.
A fracture does not at all occur in the heel.
But a fracture sometimes occurs in the bones of the foot, and a fracture happens in the toes only rarely, and they generally only suffer abrasion in most conditions.
If a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot, and you see those bones lifting over each other, then the patient should place his foot on prepared ground, as if walking.
Then stand, and place your foot over the elevated part of those bones; afterward, press down or tread upon it, and align it until it returns to its proper place.
Then place a plaster and tow on top, and put a small board under the arch of the foot, with two flat ends.
Then bind it with a suitable bandage around the foot, after wrapping it with cloth and other things needed.
After three or four days have passed, then release the bandage.
For you will find the bones aligned, whether fractured or dislocated.
Thus, the procedure for them is as you see.
If some toes are broken, then restore and align them as I have described to you for the restoration of the fingers of the hand.
Then place a splint along the length of the toe, slightly wider than it, and then put under the foot the board I mentioned, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
If, however, two, three, or more bones are broken, then place a splint over each toe, of its respective size, wrapped in linen cloth, and bind the board to the bottom of the foot, standing on one end of the board outside the arch of the foot, so that it holds with good support.
And it is suitable for you not to forget but to consider everything I have told you in the other fractures regarding the injuries we have described, and apply what is appropriate for each incident.
