of the fat of the eyes
Exinach is a fat that is generated in the tissues of the upper eyelids, and this happens more to children than to any other people, and it greatly bothers their eyes, and they have mucus in the mornings, and they cannot look at the sunlight because tears rush to their eyes;
and because of this they constantly lie on their faces, and sleep on them, and their eyelids below their eyebrows are moist, which swelling and appearance are covered by the exinach that is visible in the eye.
And when you press the area with your fingers and feel the exinach between them.
And the method of the procedure is that the patient puts their head in your lap;
and then take a linen cloth, and prepare a tent in the shape of a circle according to the amount of exinach contained on each side, then put it on them;
and press with your fingers on one side and the other, so that the exinach is gathered in the middle of the circle;
then split the moisture in the middle with a sharp spatula, making a cut the width of, and no larger than, the incision made for bloodletting;
and cut the skin deeply until you reach the exinach;
and in several instances, exinach comes out of the cut, looking like a piece of white fat.
Then extract it all in one piece with a cloth grasped between your fingers over the fire, and turn your hand right and left until it is removed;
and be careful not to push into the cut, that you do not reach all the way to the eye with the spatula, lest you injure it.
And if the exinach does not appear at the beginning of the incision, then enlarge the incision slightly until it appears;
then extract it as we have said, then soak cloths in vinegar and water, and place them on the area, and bind with bandages.
And there are some men who grind salt and apply it to break down the remaining moisture.
Then treat it until it is healed.
And if a hot abscess develops at the site, treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
