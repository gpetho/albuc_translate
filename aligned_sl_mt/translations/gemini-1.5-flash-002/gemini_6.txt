O, son, since I have completed for you this book, which is the culmination of the science of medicine,  through its completion, and through its explanations, and through its clarifications, it seems to me that I should complete this for you with this treatise, which is a part of manual operation, that is, surgery.
Because manual operation is neglected in our region and in our time, almost entirely deprived, so that the science of it is in great peril, and its practice is lost; and there remains of it only some small descriptions in the books of the Ancients, which are mostly corrupted and thus lead to error and hesitation, so that its intentions are obscured and its strength and art are weakened.
And it seems to me that I should revive it with the ordering of this treatise, following the path of explanation, clarification, and abbreviation; and so that it comes with the forms of cautery instruments and other surgical instruments, as is appropriate, through the addition of clarification, and through their preparation, which is a necessary matter.
But the reason why a skilled artisan with his hands is not found in our time is that the art of medicine is lengthy, and it is necessary for its practitioner beforehand to be trained in the science of anatomy, which is quite difficult, so that he knows the functions of the limbs and their forms, and their connections and separations; and he should have knowledge of the bones, nerves, and muscles, and their number and location; and of the pulsating and quiet veins, and the places of their emergence.
And for this reason Hippocrates says that in name it is much, but in practice little, and especially in the art of the hand.
But we have already spoken of this in the introduction to this book; for he who is not knowledgeable in what we have said about anatomy is not exempt from falling into error by which men will die, as I have seen many such cases, for some are trained in this science and practice it without knowledge and without experience.
For I saw a foolish and reckless physician incise a scrofulous abscess in the neck of a woman, and he incised some arteries of the neck, so that a great deal of blood flowed until the woman died in his hands.
And I saw another physician who undertook to remove a stone from a man who was elderly, and the stone was large, and he came to him and extracted that stone with a piece of the bladder, so that that man died on the third day.
And I was called to extract it, and I saw that because of the size of the stone and the condition of the patient, I knew that he would die.
And I saw another physician who received a stipend from a duke of our land for surgery, and it happened that a black slave who was under him suffered a fracture in his thigh; and the physician, in his ignorance, extracted the fracture, over the wound, with cushions and splints with tight binding, and did not allow the wound to breathe.
And then he unbound it according to his wishes, and then he bound it again, and then he left it like that for some days and commanded that we not unbind the bandage; and it remained so until the thigh and foot were suppurated, and it resulted in loss (of the limb/life).
And I was called to him, and I prepared to unbind the bandage, and tranquility was achieved, and thus a lessening of his pains.
But however, corruption was already confirmed in the limb, so that I could not restrain it, and the corruption did not cease to spread in the limb until the patient perished.
And I saw another physician who perforated a cancerous abscess, and it was ulcerated after some days, until its malignancy was magnified by its lord (i.e., the condition worsened greatly).
Which is why, because the burning cancer is full of melancholic humor, then it is not suitable that it be approached with iron at all, but that it be in a limb which suffers so that it is entirely contained (or, that it be in a limb that can be entirely removed).
And therefore, sons, it is necessary for you that the operation with the hand be divided into two divisions: that is, into an operation which is associated with health, and into a work in which there is peril in the greatest circumstances (or, in the most serious cases).
And I have already explained this in every part of this book, in which operations come which contain error and fear; therefore it is necessary for you that you guard against this and leave that (i.e., avoid those operations), lest fools find a way to speak and dishonor you.
And therefore, take up your instruments with diligence and with God's protection, and treat your patients with happiness and firmness.
And use the best method, by the grace of God, leading to health and praiseworthy success, and leave the terrible diseases of difficult healing, and abstain from those things that cause you fear, so that wavering in your faith and in your reputation does not overtake you: for it remains more for your glory, and higher in the world and behind your holiness.
Galen already said in some of his admonitions: Do not treat a bad disease, lest you be called a bad physician.
And I have divided this book into three chapters.
Begins the division of the book, and first of the first part. The first chapter deals with the head down to the feet, the forms of instruments and cautery tools, and what is necessary in the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter, on suction and perforation, and on cupping glasses, and on wounds, and on the extraction of arrows and similar things, all chaptered and ordered according to the forms of the instruments.
The third chapter, on reduction and dislocation, and on the treatment of sprains and similar things; a chapter ordered from head to foot, and on the forms of the instruments.
It is necessary that I describe the qualities of the benefits of this cautery and its drawbacks, and in what constitution cautery is prohibited.
Therefore I say that the discourse on the quality of the benefit of cautery and its drawbacks is a long and prolix discourse, and subtle in science, and a hidden secret; and many wise men have already spoken of it, and they have disagreed about it, and a small part of their discourses suffices for me, fearing prolixity.
And therefore I say that cautery benefits all complexions universally, whether with matter or without matter, except for two complexions, which are cold complexions without matter.
In the hot and dry complexion with matter there is disagreement; for some say that cautery is beneficial to it, and others say the contrary, that cautery is not suitable for a disease which is caused by heat and dryness, because the nature of fire is heat and dryness, and it is inconvenient that a hot and dry disease should be healed with something that is hot and dry.
And I contradict those who say the contrary, that benefit is achieved through cautery in every hot and dry disease that occurs in the human body, because when you compare the human body and its humors to the complexion of fire, you find the human body cold.
And I say, regarding this discourse, that experience has revealed this to me several times.
However, it is not fitting that this should come from someone who has already been exhausted and exercised in the chapter on cautery by prior practice, and who has understood the diversity of human complexions and the disposition of diseases in themselves, and the causes of those, and their accidents, and the duration of those.
But in other complexions, there is no fear for you, and especially in cold and humid diseases, because all physicians are agreed on those, and they do not disagree on the benefit of cautery in them.
And know, sons, that the secret of healing by cautery with fire, and its goodness, is superior to cautery with burning medicine, because fire is simple, whose action does not reach beyond the member which is cauterized and does not harm the other members adjacent to it except with little harm.
But the action of burning medicine reaches those members which are distant from it, and quickly brings about in the member a disease of difficult healing and quickly kills.
But fire, by its sublimity and the goodness of its substance, does not do this except to remove superfluities. And it is known to us by experiment and by long service of study with the art concerning the truth of the causes; and therefore I am excused from the length of discourse. And if it were not that it is not written in my book in this place to reveal to you this secret concerning fire, and the quality of its operation in the bodies and its expulsion by which it expels illnesses, with philosophical demonstrative discourse, which would be difficult to understand in your minds.
And know, sons, that they disagree on the time in which it is convenient to perform cautery, and they posit springtime as the best time.
And I say that cautery is convenient at all times, because the harm caused by accidental timing is overwhelmed by the benefit which is obtained by cautery, and especially if the cautery is for necessary, strong and sudden pains, which do not allow for delay because it is feared that those pains might become worse, which is a greater harm than a small harm introduced by timing.
And this does not enter your minds, O sons, this is only considered by the vulgar people and foolish physicians, that is to say that for that illness which is cured by cautery, there is no unsuitable time, and they posit that consequence.
And the cause is not at all as they believe, for cautery is only in the place of a medicine which alters the complexion and dries the humors which are the cause of the pains.
However, cautery is superfluous over medicine because of the swiftness of its efficacy and the power of its operation and the greatness of its effect.
And it is possible that the illness may return at some time, according to the complexion of the patient and the location of the illness, and the strength of the patient, and what is prepared in the patient's body from the aggregation of superfluities within, and what has been acquired by the patient through diet and similar causes; but if the illness to which cautery is administered is a subtle illness in a limb with few superfluities and humors, as is cautery of a tooth for pain and similar cases, it is possible that the pain will not return, but this happens rarely.
And it is more common speech that cautery is the last resort of medicine, and this is a true saying, not in the sense that they understand it, for they believe that it is not a cure that profits with medicine or any other cause except cautery.
And the cause is contrary to that; and the intention that cautery is the last resort of medicine is only when we administer methods of cure in certain illnesses, and those medicines do not help, and then at the end of the treatment, one administers cautery, and it helps in that case. And therefore, from this it is understood that cautery is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of the common people and many foolish doctors.
And the ancients said that cautery with gold is better than cautery with iron, and they did not say this except for the evenness of gold and the sublimity of its substance.
And they said that the place of cautery does not scar, although that is not entirely true, for I have already proven this and found that it does not do so except in some bodies and not others, and cautery with gold is good and better than with iron, as they said; however, when you do cautery with fire with gold, it is not clear to you, because it is heated according to the quantity you want by the roughness of the gold, and because it prepares to receive cold; and if you apply too much heat, the gold melts from the fire, and some laminae fall into the fire, causing the craftsman trouble from this.
And because of this, cautery with iron is done more easily and more readily with precision of operation.
And I have already ordered this chapter on cautery according to chapters, and I have ordered those from the head down to the feet, so that I might explain to the one asking what he wants from it.
The first chapter.
This cauterization is applied to dampness and coldness on the brain; the accidents of which are two causes: that is, a cause of sudden and profuse rheumatic flux, called coryza, flowing from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and excessive sleepiness, and toothache and sore throat, and universally any illness that comes from coldness, such as paralysis, sudden stroke (apoplexy), and similar illnesses.
The method of this cauterization is this: first, order the patient to be evacuated with purgative medicine, cleansing the head, for three or four nights, depending on the strength of the patient, his age, and his constitution.
Then order him to shave his head with a razor, and then have him sit between your hands on a low bench and place his hands on his feet.
And then place the root of your palm near the  [likely meaning:  a specific point near] the bridge of the nose between his eyes. However, when your middle finger has reached that point, mark the spot with ink, and then ignite the olive cautery, of which this is the form:
And then place that [the cautery] on the spot marked with ink, in such a way that it descends, with which your hand is gradually constrained, and you revolve it.
And then lift your hand slightly and observe the place, and if you see some quantity of the head of the bone uncovered, like the size of a grain of barley, then lift your hand, and if not, return your hand with that iron, or with another like it if this one is cooled, until that which I have told you is seen of the bone.
And then take a little salt and dissolve it on the location and leave it for three days.
And then place on it cotton soaked in vinegar and leave it there until the burn scar is destroyed. And then treat the area with tetrafarmacon ointment until it is healed.
And it has been said that when the wound remains open, it better discharges the arm, because it is better and more beneficial.
And some of them say that the elbow should be cauterized to the bone, and the cautery should be held there until some part of the bone's substance is hardened/burned.
And then scrape away what is burned from the bone, and then let it be healed.
And others say that with the cautery, penetrate to the back, until it firmly penetrates the bone, until the bone is charred, and this is the manner of a small ulcer. And they believe that vapors from the head exhale from that place.
And let the wound be kept open for a long time, and then let it be healed until it is consolidated.
But I have not seen these two types of cautery at all, except in some men, as a method of fear; and leave that, it seems to me, better is health when it is; for the head is weakened by the solution of its continuity, as we have testified in the other members, and especially when the patient's head is of a cold nature.
And the first type of cautery is safer and better, in my opinion; and with that I use and with that I work for health.
Chapter two.
Concerning the cautery of the head.
When chronic and prolonged pain occurs throughout the head, and this is prolonged in the patient, and he uses leeches and cupping and purgatives and plasters and poultices and cauteries and unguents and similar things, and especially if he has already been cauterized with a cautery which we recount and none of those things benefit him, then consider whether the patient's head is of strong constitution by nature; and if it is not weak and finds much great cold, then cauterize that with another cautery a little below that one. And then cauterize that above the temple of his head with a cautery until the scab is formed. Incise the scab and let the bone be uncovered to the extent that we have recounted, and cauterize that with a cautery in the back part of the head, in the place which is called the vas - and this is the place where a cupping glass is placed. And ease your hand in this, and do not uncover the bone, for the patient thereby finds much great pain, different from the pain of all the other cauteries of the head.
And I say this cautery in its place, because it is necessary that the cautery with which the temples of the head and the occiput are cauterized is a more subtle cautery than that with which the middle part of the head is cauterized; and this is its form.
Chapter Three.
Concerning the cauterization of a not-ancient migraine.  (or, Concerning the cauterization of a recent migraine.)
When a sudden pain occurs in the head, or a spreading pain around the eye, let the head be evacuated with purifying medicines, and let the other treatment be administered, which I have described in the various diseases; and if nothing helps, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with an acute, burning medicine, or with iron.
But cauterization with a burning medicine is that you take a clove of garlic, and you crush it and bind its extremities on both sides. Then incise the location of the pain in the temple with a lancet until a place is made under the skin, so that it is hidden.
Then bind it tightly with a bandage for a continuous constriction, and leave it for three hours; then untie it and remove the garlic, and leave the wound for two or three days, then apply a cotton swab soaked in vinegar until the area becomes inflamed.
And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, do this with some burning medicines which I have written about in the twelfth treatise on burning medicines.
But cauterization with iron in this manner: heat a cautery iron of which this is the form:
and it is called a nail or peg, because its head is shaped like a nail, which has a certain curvature, and in the middle of it is a small eminence.
And then place it on the location of the pain, and hold your hand — so that the flesh underneath is not burned — and move the iron little by little with speed.
And if the amount of flesh that is burned is as much as half of it, due to the specific nature of the cautery, then lift your hand so that the artery beneath is not burned, so that there is no flow of blood.
And then soak cotton in salt water and place that on the area, and leave it for three days; and then apply cotton soaked in balm, and then treat with ointment until it is healed.
And if you wish, cauterize with the tip of the scalpel according to the cautery method, and be careful of cutting the artery in this specific, not-ancient, type of headache.
Chapter four.
On the cauterization of chronic headache.
When you treat a headache with what we have said in the preceding treatment, and what we have said in the divisions of diseases, and the treatment is not effective, and sometimes the illness is such that what we have said about the first cauterization with medicine or cauterization with fire is insufficient, then you should heat the cautery knife until it is white-hot, after marking the location of the pain with a line whose length is half a finger, or about that; and place your hand there for a moment and press it until you incise the artery and reach the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be mindful of the continuation of the jaw, which is moved during mastication, and that the muscle not be injured and the nerve which moves it, and that spasm does not occur.
And if it is about the guarding and caution regarding the flow of blood from the artery that is incised, for there is danger in its incision, and especially for one who is ignorant of what he does and is not studious and experienced; and leaves the operation to him at the beginning.
And I will come to the recollection of the treatment of accidental bleeding from the artery according to its manner, in its place in this book.
And if you see from this illness that this cauterization is insufficient and the patient's body is tolerable, cauterize it in the middle of the head as we have recounted, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish, administer the cautery which we have mentioned in the chapter on the constriction of arteries with a cautery having two blades, and this cauterization is better and more suitable.
Chapter 5.
Chapter 5: On the cauterization of earaches.
When pain in the ear comes from cold and is treated with laxative remedies and with the other treatment which I have mentioned in the division, and the pain is not relieved, then apply the cautery, and this is what is called a "puncta," of which this is the form:
And then apply the cautery point by point, and let it be moved around the entire ear as a wheel is turned, or in the circumference of each part if the pain is located in a specific part. Extend the cautery from the root of the ear little by little after you have marked the place with a probe.
And if the cautery requires ten points in the whole ear, or however many, then treat those places until they are healed.
Chapter 6.
On the cauterization of a cough.
A cough which is cured with cauterization is only of those types which come from phlegm, as we have said in the divisions of illnesses.
Avoid cauterization of the type of cough that arises from dryness or from a spasm of the nerve.
When you treat that type of cough with leeches and purgatives and gargles, and your treatment is not effective, then you should cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one at the root of the ear, the second a little below the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips.
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected area, for softening only comes to the part that appears healthy.
And the form of cauterization is that you cauterize it with the cautery at the very tip of the upper ear, a little above the temple, and another in the temple, the length of which should be according to the length of the little finger, and hold your hand with the cautery until half the thickness of the fingernail is burned.
And this is the form of the cautery, and it is a type of knife, the form of which is shown above/previously described. However, it is more subtle if that is done slightly as you see; and it is necessary to cut it with a little less excess thickness.
Then treat the area with what has been previously described until it is healed.
Chapter 7.
Concerning the cauterization of chronic apoplexy.
When apoplexy is chronic and you treat it with what we have said, and your treatment does not help, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize them with four cauteries:  on all four corners of their head; and with a cautery in the middle of the head, as we have said; and with a cautery on the neck. And the manner of cauterization is done as described above.
And it is also cauterized above the mouth of the stomach; and it is better behind; and then let it be treated with what follows.
Chapter 8.
Concerning the cauterization of forgetfulness done by flame.
So that large enemas and purifying pills are given to the patient at the beginning.
And then shave the patient's entire head and apply to their neck a plaster of cetre [a type of plaster, likely containing a specific ingredient] described in the treatise on plasters.
And apply that several times, for that is a manner of cautery. And do this according to the same order which I have already said.
And therefore if he is healed by these means, it is good; and if not, then make for him three cauterizations in the back part of his head, which descend from the uppermost part of the head down to the lower part of the neck. And place between each cautery the width of a finger, and then treat the cautery with what has been prescribed.
But if you add to it and the patient tolerates it, then apply cautery to the middle location; and if you want a greater addition, then cauterize that over the two horns.  (Here "horns" likely refers to a branching or spread-out location related to the initial cautery site).
Then treat that until it is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped according to the form given before.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the cauterization of paralysis and the softening of the whole body.
That you proceed in the purification of the head with herbs and with that which we have said; and then shave the patient's head, and then cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head, and with a cautery over all the horns of the head, and with a cautery over the back part of it, and with three cauteries over the vertebrae of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the illness of softening of the body to find it and the patient tolerates it and the illness is severe, then cauterize it with four cauteries over the vertebrae of the back, and finally with a cautery until it is numb from the burning of it, and raise your hand. And then care for it until it is healed, and this should be an olive cautery.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the cauterization of epilepsy.
The epileptic is not cauterized unless that epilepsy is due to phlegm.
And therefore it is necessary that you purify his brain at the beginning with herbs and with the other treatments which we have described in the section when the patient is strong and can tolerate the expulsion of medicines.
And if it is a child who cannot tolerate medicines, then administer gargles and masticatories that purify the brain, before that for many days, with the improvement of the diet.
Then shave the head of the patient, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head according to the previous method, and with another cautery on his occiput, and cauterize above each temple. And if the patient is strong and can tolerate it, then cauterize him with the cauteries which I have mentioned, having paralysis and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the neck and the vertebrae of the back.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped, as has been previously described.
But if the patient is a child, then apply a small/fine cautery according to this method.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the cauterization of melancholia.
When the causes of melancholia are corrupt humors and a thick phlegm, then cauterize it with the cauteries which we have described in the treatment of paralysis.
And if the cause of melancholia is a superfluity inclining towards melancholia, and the patient's body is humid, then give him something to drink that cleanses his brain, according to what has preceded in the division (of treatments).
Then shave the patient's head, and then make a properly-made poultice for him on a circle (possibly referring to a bandage or cloth), and then place that in the middle of the head.
And the patient should be seated upright, and held on all sides (supported).
Then apply a liniment; and it is more worthy (better) to use old sheep's fat. And heat that over the fire with moderate warmth, which the said sufferer feels when it is applied to him. Then pour that into the middle of his head within the circle (bandage), and leave it there until it is cold.
And do this to the patient once a week, with his other treatment, until he is healed; or if you wish, cauterize it making small punctures according to his need, but hold your hand with a cautery thus prepared: this is a kind of cautery which moistens the brain evenly.
Then apply that cotton soaked in butter or goose grease.
Chapter 12.
On the cauterization of water descending into the eye.
When the beginning of water in the eye is declared to you by the signs which I have mentioned in the division, then begin and give the patient something to purify his head, and guard him from all humidities.
And make him sweat in a bath for some days.
And then order him to shave his head, and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of the head; and then cauterize it with two cauteries on the two temples if the beginning of the descent of water is in two eyes, or on one side if the beginning of the water is in one eye.
Incise with a cautery all the veins and arteries which are below the occiput (back of the head); and let the cauteries be far apart in the width of the temples.
And beware of a flow of blood when it is cauterized; and if you see a flow of blood from it, stop it with some medicine, which is possible for you.
And I come with wisdom which is in the extraction of arteries and with the excision of them and the caution of blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized in the neck below the two bones with two cauteries placed separately.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the cauterization of old tears.  (This likely refers to long-standing wounds or sores, using "tears" in a metaphorical sense.)
When the tears from the eyes are old and persistent, and through the veins and arteries which are in the manifest area of the head externally, and it is verified that this is a superfluity of cold phlegmatic humors, then cauterize that with the cautery which we have recounted in the beginning chapter about water falling into the eyes, and with a cautery in the middle of the head and with two cauteries in the neck below the two temples, and with two cauteries in the neck below the two bones. And if it needs additional treatment, then cauterize it in all the area of the corner of the eye above the end of the eyebrow with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the cauterization of nasal odor (or nasal stench/foul smell).
When you treat this with what we have said in the section and your treatment is not effective, then you prepare and give the patient  decoctions to drink for three nights; and then shave his head, and cauterize him with a medium-sized cautery, with an olive-shaped cautery. And then cauterize that with a clove-shaped cautery, with two cauterizations above the two eyebrows, a little below the hair.
And be careful with the cauterization so that you do not burn it.
And of the clove-shaped cautery, this is the form/shape.
Chapter 15.
Of the cauterization for the softening/mollifying of the eyelids.
When the eyelid is softened by illness or humidity, then cauterize that eyelid with a lunar cautery; and this is its form:
And if you cauterize that (area) above the two eyebrows a little with two cauteries in each part, and they should be elongated towards the temples. And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the eyebrow.
And do not press your hand too much with the cautery, but only to the extent that a third part of the eyelid is hardened/cauterized.
Chapter 16.
Concerning cauterization of the eyelid of the eye when the hairs are turned inwards and prick the eye.
When the hairs of the eye are turned inwards so that they prick the eye, cauterization in these cases is done in two ways, for cauterization is either done with fire or with a burning medicine.
If cauterizing with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to shave their eyelashes like those who cleanse them, until they are long and thick; and if they prick near their roots, then bind the patient's eyes with a bandage so that they are not injured until the eyelashes have grown.
Then, when they have grown and thickened, place the patient's head in your lap, and then mark on the eyelid of their eyes with a probe, with a mark that is shaped like a myrtle leaf, and let the beginning of the mark be near the hairs.
And then place a cotton ball soaked in egg white or in mallow mucilage on the eye.
And then heat the cautery, whose form is this.
And then cauterize over the mark that you made, little by little, in many times, until the surface of the eyelid which is like a myrtle leaf is burned, all properly apparent.
And a sign of the success of your work is that you see the eyelid already contracted and the hairs raised above the puncture of the eye.
Then raise your hand and leave it for three days, and then place cotton with a poultice on it until the scar is healed. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if some matter returns through the hairs near their origin and the eyelid is softened, then perform the cautery again on that area, exactly as you did before.
But if the hairs are under the eyelid, then cauterize it until it is raised to its natural place and is even, so that the hairs do not touch the eye.
But cauterize with a caustic medicine; this means that you instruct the patient to pull the hairs until they are elongated and even, and then a leaf-shaped piece of linen is applied.
Then take known soap and quicklime, one ounce, or something like that, and mix these ingredients well, and do this quickly so that it does not get cold; then spread this on the linen shaped like a myrtle leaf, and place this on one or both eyes; and place under the eye a cotton ball soaked in egg white, and the patient's head should be in your lap.
And place your finger on the medicine and press it lightly, but do not move it until the patient feels the bite of the medicine, for the bite is like fire.
And when you perceive that he feels the bite, then leave the medicine and move it with your finger; when the bite ceases, then remove the medicine and wash the eye with water; and then observe if you see that the eyelid is raised as it should be, relieved of the constriction by fire or incision, for then it is well; and if not, return to applying the medicine to the place where the medicine has not yet been applied and it does not darken until your work is even and the eye is contracted.
Then place cotton with a bandage on it until the scab from the cauterization is gone, and then treat it with healing ointment or something else until it is healed.
And it is necessary for you, during your operation, to watch with vigilant diligence that nothing of the medicine falls into the eye, and if the eyelid after a few days is softened and some hair grows in the eye, then repeat your medicine on that part of the eyelid which is softened, and exactly as you did in the beginning, and then bandage it until it is healed.
And this is the form of myrtle leaf. (Referring to a shape or method described previously, likely a shape for applying medicine or a bandage)
And know that the eyes of men are diverse in size, both large and small, and therefore your constriction (or perhaps contraction/adjustment) should be made accordingly.
And the path of righteousness will not be hidden from him who studies this art. (This is a metaphorical statement implying that proper technique will be revealed to the diligent student).
Chapter 17.
Concerning the cauterization of a fistula that is in the tear duct of the eye.
When you treat a fistula with what we have mentioned in the divisions of diseases and your treatment is not successful, then you must cauterize it in this manner: instruct the patient to place his head in your lap, and let a minister hold his head between your hands in such a way that his head is not moved or shaken.
Then place cotton soaked in egg white or gum arabic on his eye.
And then heat the cautery, whose shape is this:
which should be concave, like the shape of a cane or a vulture's feather, at the end with which the cauterization is performed.
And if you wish, let it be penetrating to the other extremity. And if you wish, let it be sharp like a probe.
However, the concave one is better for your work.
Then press the fistula if it is open, and draw out the pus and dry it. And if it is not open, then open it and extract the pus from it.
Then place over it the cautery, which should be well ignited, and hold your hand a little below the cautery, from the eye to the side of the nose, so that your hand does not waver or the patient is disturbed, and then place the cautery on the granulation of the eye and cauterize it.
And so if at the beginning your cautery penetrates to the bone, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery once or twice, if necessary; and leave it like that for three days, and then apply a bandage over it with a drying ointment until it is healed.
But if ten days have passed and it is not healed, then apply a sharp, corrosive medicine until the bone is exposed and scraped as is appropriate in its chapter.
And there is another method of cauterizing a fistula which some ancients mentioned: approach the location of the fistula and open it, and then place in that fissure a thin tube, which is shaped like this:  And pour into it the quantity of one ounce of molten lead; and hold your hand with a cloth with good retention, and the patient should not be moved so that the molten lead does not reach his eye; and it is necessary to place over the patient’s eye a cloth soaked in egg white or water, for the lead adheres to the location of the fistula and heals it with marvelous healing.
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said about the cautery and the treatment, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to make an opening in the nose and reduce the fistula to the body of the nose according to where it will return to its proper place.
Chapter 18.
Concerning the cauterization of the cleft of the well (likely referring to a fissure or wound).
Often fissures occur on the lips, and especially on the lips of children.
Therefore, if you treat those fissures with what we have said in the divisions and your treatment is not effective, then ignite a small, knife-like cautery according to this form which is shown:
And let its concavity be according to the subtlety of a knife.
Then carefully place that ignited cautery into those fissures until the cautery reaches the bottom of the fissures.
Then treat it with cerates until it is healed.
Chapter 19.
Concerning the cauterization of a fistula in the mouth.
When in the root of the uvula, or in the palate, or in the roots of the teeth, an abscess develops and then breaks, and then becomes chronic, and pus flows and a fistula is formed, and you treat it and the treatment is ineffective, then you should ignite a cautery according to the size of the fistula, and then place that ignited cautery into the opening of the fistula, holding it with your hand until the heated iron reaches the bottom of it, and afterwards do this once or twice; and then treat it with what we have said about treatment until it is healed.
And so if the wound is excised and heals, it is good; but if not, then it is necessary to expose the area and remove the corrupted bone according to what will be found in its chapter.
Chapter 20.
Concerning the cauterization of the teeth and the softening of the gums.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth are loose, and you treat them with medicines and they don't help, then place the patient's head in your lap, and then heat the cautery—the shape of which will be appropriate for this—in such a way that you place the small cup (or shield) over the tooth and quickly insert the heated cautery into it, and hold it a little while until the patient feels the heat of the fire has reached the root of the tooth.
And then remove your hand, and then repeat the cauterization a few times as needed.
And then let the patient fill their mouth with salt water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out, because the loose tooth is fixed, the softened gum is tightened, and the corrupt moisture is dried.
Chapter 21.
On the cauterization of toothache.
When toothache is due to coldness, or if there is cold or worms in it, and you cannot cure it with medicine, then cauterization is done in two ways: either cauterization with a hot iron, or cauterization with fire.
Cauterization with a hot iron is that you take a hot iron and heat it in a fire, and then take cotton and wrap it around the end of the probe, and then dip it in the boiling iron, and apply it to the painful tooth quickly until it is cooled.
And then repeat this several times until the power of the fire reaches the root of the tooth.
And if you wish, dip wool or cotton in the aforementioned hot iron, and place that on the aching tooth, and place a glowing iron on top of that until the iron reaches the bottom of the tooth cavity.
However, cauterization with fire is that you use a small tube of brass or iron, and there should be some thickness in its core so that the intensity of the fire does not reach the patient's mouth.
Then ignite the cautery, shaping it as needed, and place it on the tooth, holding your hand there until the cautery cools; and do this several times because the pain will be relieved either that day or the next.
And it is necessary that, upon application of that cautery, the patient fill their mouth with good hot water and hold it for an hour, and then spit it out; and this is the method of cauterization.
And cauterize with whichever extremity you wish, as is possible for you.
And this is the form of the cannula:
Chapter 22.
Concerning the cauterization of extrophuli (likely referring to a type of skin lesion or protrusion).
When extrophuli are caused by phlegm and cold humors and are not responsive to digestion by medicines, and you wish to digest them lightly, then you ignite the concave cautery, whose form is as follows: having two open ends so that the smoke escapes through one end of the cautery, and place that ignited instrument upon that abscess once, or more times if needed, until it reaches the base of the abscess.
And if the abscess is small, then apply the cautery according to the size of the abscess, and then leave it for three days, and apply cotton soaked in butter over it until that which the fire has burned is healed.
And then treat it with ointment and bandages until it is healed.
Chapter 23.
Concerning the cauterization of hoarseness and the constriction of the throat.
When humors gather in the pulmonary canal, especially when this is accompanied by coldness of constitution, then it is necessary that the patient be evacuated at the beginning with laxative medicines, and afterward cauterize below the root of the throat in the constricted place.
And be careful not to reach the throat with the cautery, nor burn the uvula, only a little.
And cauterize that with another cautery below the junction of the neck at its last vertebra. And let its cauterization be done with a nail, following the previous method.
And afterward, treat it with what was previously prescribed until it is healed.
Chapter 24.
Concerning the cauterization of lung disease and cough.
When cough and lung disease are caused by cold humors, and the patient has no fever or consumption (tuberculosis) and the illness is chronic, then cauterize with two cauteries on the clavicle, in the previously described places, inside and outside; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest, between the two nipples; and let the cautery be a nail according to the preceding form.
And if you wish, your cauterization may be done by puncturing with the cautery that is called a puncturing instrument, the form of which precedes in the puncturing for earache.
And let the punctures be made within those limits; and then treat it with the same remedies that have been described previously, until it is healed.
And let the cautery have three prongs, for cauterization is done with this: with one application you can make three cauteries according to this form:
Chapter 25.
Of the cauterization of the testicle, which is the head of the seminal duct.
When the head of the testicle is dislocated due to lubricous humors and is not fixed in the moment of its return from its dislocation until it is in the place it is accustomed to return to, and then with a small movement it is dislocated again, as we have testified, then first you must reduce the dislocation; and the patient should be turned onto his back or onto his healthy side; and then lift the testicle which is inside the scrotum toward the upper parts with the fingers of your left hand, if the joint is dislocated inwards.
And then heat the cautery which has two heads; and this is its form:
And then cauterize the testicle until it penetrates to the other side; and the figure of the cauterization will then be of four cauterized heads.
And sometimes it is adjusted according to this count, and therefore there are eight cauteries.
And then place cooked pork fat with salt on the cautery, and then keep the patient calm, and the member should not be moved for some time until it is healed.
And if the dislocation is in the upper parts and this [treatment] is done late, then cauterize over the muscle with a nail-shaped cautery or with many pointed cauteries, because the joint is strengthened, the humidity is removed, and the patient is healed.
Chapter 26.
On the cauterization of the stomach.
When cold and many humors enter the stomach, exceeding its capacity and multiplying within it, and if you continue the treatments and do not improve, then the patient should lie supine on his back, extending his arms and legs. Then cauterize the area with three cauteries: one cautery below the feet, to the extent of one finger's breadth, using a nail-shaped cautery; and two more cauteries below on either side of this cautery, so that a triangular figure of cauteries is formed. Space these out so that they are not joined together, which would cause putrefaction.
And the depth of the cautery should be two-thirds the thickness of the finger.
And let the shape of the cautery be according to this form without addition. And if you wish, cauterize with a large cautery in the middle of the stomach according to this form; and this should be a cautery in the form of a circle according to this form:  (Note:  This line indicates the presence of accompanying diagrams, which are missing from the text provided.)
And let the stomach be cauterized, paying attention to the fact that this cauterization is frightening: and it is so that you mark on the stomach points according to the amount you wish with a probe, and then cauterize those points with a cautery; and then treat it with the previously described treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 27.
On the cauterization of the cold liver.
When pain arises in the liver due to coldness, humidity, or excessive flatulence, so that it is expelled from its normal fullness by superfluous egress, and the patient is treated with what we have said and it does not help, then the patient should be supine on his back, and mark with a probe three cauteries according to this form and this same quantity on the liver under the hypochondria, where the patient's decubitus is felt. (Again, this implies accompanying diagrams showing the location and shape of the cauterizations.)
And let the space which is between each cautery be according to the thickness of a finger, and let the cautery be according to the length of the right index finger.
And do not compress the area with the cautery too much.
And if the amount of what is burned is the amount of half the thickness of a finger, and no more, and if the patient is standing on his feet; and if he is not standing, then let him lie down, having already extended his legs, and raise his arms.
And it is possible for you to cauterize these areas with a knife-like cautery, when you have subtlety and prudence in the art.
And beware that you do not proceed too much in the cauterization, and let the thickness of a whole finger be burned so that the whole body is burned and it reaches the intestines, because the finger here is thin; and know this.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the perforation of an abscess of the liver with a cautery.
When there is an ulcer or abscess in the liver and you want to know if that abscess is in the flesh of the liver or in its tunic, then if it is in the flesh of the liver, the patient finds gravity and pain without acuteness.
And if it is in the tunic of the liver, the pain is very acute and sometimes it tires the doctors in its treatment.
Therefore, the patient should be turned onto their side; and then mark the location of the abscess with a probe; and then ignite the cautery which is shaped like a hook, the form of which was shown on the previous page. And cauterize with that cautery until the entire abscess is consumed, until it reaches the bottom, until blood escapes.
And then treat it with the treatment for other abscesses until it is healed.
And it is not fitting that this form of cautery be used except by one whose study in the art of medicine is extensive, and in whose hands many diseases have been known; but let someone with experience sometimes dare this operation, however, leave that to us, and it is better.
Chapter 29.
On the cauterization of pleurisy.
The ancients said that cautery with the roots of birthwort for cold pleurisy, according to this manner, is effective; and it is this: that you take of the long, dry roots of birthwort a root one finger-length long, as is found, and let it be of the thickness of a finger.
Then immerse it in oil and heat it in the fire, and then cauterize with one cautery in the place which is between the continuation of the clavicle and the neck; and with two small cauteries below the chin, slightly inclined towards the part which is below the beard, and with two cauteries in the place which is inclined between the fifth rib and the sixth, inclining slightly to the back parts; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest; and with another on the stomach, and with three cauteries on the back parts; and with one cautery in the place which is between the two shoulders, and with two cauteries on the two sides of the chest, below the cautery which is between the two shoulders.
And it is not necessary that you grasp the cautery with your hand, but rather let it be in the evident manner of the work. (Or: ...but rather let it be in plain view during the operation.)
And some ancients said that some men use a cautery of iron similar to a ray and ignite it, and place it in the place which is between the ribs, until it reaches the abscess and is purged of its matter, just as we have said in the abscess of the liver.
But this perforation with cautery is not without danger, for one may easily kill the patient in the place, forming a fistula which is incurable.
Chapter 30.
On the cauterization of the spleen.
When you treat the illness of the spleen with what we have said of the treatment in the division and it does not improve, then cauterize it in three ways, all of which are correct. One is to make three or four cauterizations in a line according to the length of the spleen, following the shape of the liver cauterizations, the shape of which has preceded.
And between each cauterization let there be the width of a finger or a little more, and the manner of cauterization should be the same as that which we have described for the cauterization of the liver.
And do not press your hand with the cautery; and the patient should be lying on their side.
And another way to cauterize is to ignite the cautery having two points, which we have described in the chapter on muscle dislocation, and raise the loin which is in the area of the spleen where the patient's left side lies.
And let your elevation, with which you raise the loin, be according to the length of the body, so that cauterizations are made according to the width of the body.
Then introduce the two points, very hot, into that space so that with them you penetrate the loin from the other side.
And then withdraw the cautery; and thus four cauterizations are made.
And if you wish, cauterize with a cautery having three points.
And then you must take care of the cauterization until it has finished discharging pus for many days, for this is more important than the other preceding actions in the treatment.
Chapter 31.
Concerning the cauterization of a dropsical patient.
Cauterization is not suitable for all dropsies, but only for a certain kind.
When you treat a dropsical patient with the methods of treatment which we have described in the division and your treatment is not effective, then it is necessary that you cauterize him with four cauteries in the area around the navel, and with one cautery on the stomach, and with another cautery on the liver, and with another cautery on the spleen, and with two cauteries between the vertebrae of the back, and one cautery on the right foot, and with another cautery over the stomach. And the depth of the cautery should be proportional to the thickness of the skin.
And leave the cautery open so that it discharges pus for a long time.
And do not remove the cautery from the patient before it is necessary, for two intentions should be combined, and his healing should be hastened with helpful measures.
The shape of the cautery with which the abdomen is cauterized should be nail-shaped, as its form is described above; and that with which the back is cauterized should be olive-shaped, as its shape is described above.
Chapter 32.
Concerning the cauterization of the feet and thighs.
When the feet are inflamed with dropsy and are filled with yellowish water, it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the dorsum of the foot, in the space between the little toe and ring finger. Raise your hand with the cautery and do not twist it; then raise your hand again and do not completely remove it, for the yellowish water will drain out.
The cautery is according to this form: Then make two cauteries on both thighs, and on each thigh a cautery should be made with the knife-like end of the cautery. And let the cautery be according to the length of the thigh: one below the knee and the other below the middle of the thigh; and on each thigh two cauteries.
And leave the wound open without treatment for a long time so that any water may drain from it.
And then treat it with those things which we have mentioned.
Chapter 33.
Concerning the cauterization of the abdomen.
When the abdomen is cold and damp to the point that it weakens the virtues—that is, the digestive and retentive virtues which are in the stomach and intestines—and this is treated with methods of cure and it does not improve, and sometimes the patient suffers, exhibiting a weakening of the vital forces, then cauterize it with a large cautery over the stomach as previously described in the cauterization of the stomach, with a circular cautery and with four small cauteries in a circle around the navel, with a thin awl-like cautery; and with a cautery on the hypochondrium, above the spleen, with a large cautery, or with two cauteries.
And if sometimes the humors are excessive and the patient tolerates it, then cauterize it over the pubic bone and over the intestines, and quickly apply two cauteries near the stomach and near the groin, for this is a perfected cure of benefit from which you will not err.
Chapter 34.
Concerning the cauterization of chronic hemorrhoids.
When there are by nature chronic hemorrhoids, or one of thick cold humors or corrupt humors, and they are treated with what we have said in the previous section and your treatment does not improve, then cauterize with three cauteries on the most inferior part of the sacrum, small and triangular, and with a cautery above the navel, almost two fingers' width.
And if you suspect that his stomach is cold and his food is not digested, and you see his face inflamed, then cauterize that on the stomach with a large cautery as previously described; and with one cautery on the liver, and with another cautery on his spleen with a nail-shaped cautery, and leave the cautery open for some time, and then treat him until he is healed.
Chapter 35.
Concerning the cauterization of athel [likely a misspelling or archaic term, possibly referring to a type of growth or swelling] near their excision.
When you excise an athel, then you ignite the cautery which is shaped like a ray/sunbeam. Then insert that ignited cautery into that excised athel, and restrain your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vein from which the blood comes.
And do this once or twice, for if the atheyl are numerous, then cauterize each of them as we have recounted, and then treat those with that which you apply to them of ointments until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on someone, it is slower in healing.
Chapter 36.
Chapter 36. Of the cauterization of fistulas which are formed naturally in the private parts.
When nature does not obey the work which we have recommended in its place, and the patient is frightened by it, let it be healed with cautery.
Therefore, when someone has a fistula in the private parts, and it is old, it is corroded by pus and corrupt humors.  Therefore, what is most fitting is to probe it with a slender probe, and then know the quantity of its depth with the aforementioned probe.
Then ignite the cautery that is similar to a ray (or, a pointed cautery). And then place that ignited cautery into this fistula, according to the amount which the probe entered.
And repeat the cautery on it until those corrupt bodies are burned, quickly once or twice or three times, according to your necessity.
And beware of burning the nerves and veins; or if the fistula goes to the body of the bladder or to the body of the bowel, then beware of all those places; and do not do this unless the fistula is in a fleshy place and you think that it is not penetrating (deeper structures).
And then treat the area until it is healed.
And if the place is sealed, and the matter has been excised from it, and remains so for a long time, then know that it is completely cured.
And if the materials (infected matter) have not been removed from it, then know that it is penetrating, or that the bone beneath is corrupted, or that it comes from those causes, the memory of which will be found in its place (in the following discussion/context).
Chapter 37.
Concerning the cauterization of sores/ulcers.
When in sores pain arises from cold or excessive windiness, and because of this the patient's strength is diminished, then it is necessary that you cauterize that area over the sores with a cautery, over each sore with a nail-shaped cautery, the preparation of which has been previously mentioned.
And quickly cauterize again a little lower, so that three linear cauterizations result, and then they will be more effective in healing.
Chapter 38.
Concerning the cauterization of the bladder.
When weakness and softening occur in the bladder due to cold and humidity, such that the patient cannot retain urine, then cauterize that area in the lowest part above the bladder, where the pubic hairs begin, and cauterize with one cautery on the right side, and with another on the left.
And let the length of each cautery be according to the size of the walnut; and cauterize that area with a cautery in the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries if necessary.
And let the cautery be a nail-shaped tool, as is appropriate.
Chapter 39.
On the cauterization of the womb (or uterus).
When cold and humidity affect the womb, and because of this pregnancy is prevented, and her menstrual flows are corrupted, and their onset is delayed, and pain occurs before their arrival, then the area should be cauterized with three cauteries in a circle around the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder; and with a cautery above the lowest part of the back, or with two cauteries, and let the cautery be nail-shaped.
Chapter 40.
On the cauterization of a dislocated hip.
When mucous humors are poured into the area of the hip, and are the cause of its displacement, and the sign of this is that one leg is longer than the other when they are compared. And the location of the dislocation is found where it protrudes.
Then it is necessary that you cauterize the patient on the part of their hip with a circular cautery, after you have marked with a probe the circumference of the affected area as it is swollen, so that the affected area falls in the middle of the circle.
And let the cautery be of the kind previously described for the cauterization of the stomach.
And if this cautery is not available to you, then cauterize it with three cauteries using a large olive-shaped cautery.
And let the cautery be done according to the size of the thickness of the whole spine; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 41.
On the cauterization of the sciatic vein.
When pain comes in the hip area, and it is caused by cold and dampness, and the patient is treated with what we have said and it is not effective, and this is ancient, then it is necessary that you purge the patient of thick humors with fetid pills or with artificial pills or similar; and then cauterize it.
And the manner of cauterization in that case is according to two methods: either cauterization with burning medicines, or cauterization with fire.
If according to two known methods, of which one is that you cauterize that area on the patient's hip with three triangular cauteries according to this form; and make them of good depth. And let the space which is between each cautery be the amount of the thickness of a finger, whether the cautery is olive-shaped or large.
But sometimes let the cautery be on the middle point, above the head of the hip, so that there are four cauteries.
And if you wish, cauterize with the circle whose form precedes in the cauterization of the hip dislocation, so that it is a continuous circle and burns the thickness of the whole hip.
And this is the method of cauterization in sciatica when the pain is localized in the hip and does not extend to the thigh.
But if it extends to the thigh, then cauterize that with two cauteries on the thigh, on the spot to which the patient points as the location of pain; and with one cautery on the hip, four fingers somewhat below the left side.
And if the cautery is knife-like, let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the hip.
And if the patient indicates that the pain extends to the area near the toes, then cauterize there where indicated with a cautery in three or four points, or more if needed.
And if the patient indicates that the pain is below the buttock towards the thigh, then cauterize there with a knife-like cautery.
And be careful in all cauterization that you do not use the cautery to the extent that you burn nerves or cause great injury, and that because of this you do not cause the patient harm, such as unconsciousness or convulsion.
And I have seen one and another of those whom I cauterized on the ankle, and I went too far in the cauterization, and the leg swelled until the tumor reached the foot, and the whole foot was perforated and corrupted. And then a strong case of diarrhea occurred, and then death.
And if the pain is in two places at once, cauterize each according to this manner.
And some wise men say in the cauterization of the ankle, use a cautery of which this is the manner: make a circle of iron similar to a ring whose circumference is half a palm; and let the opening be according to the thickness of a date pit, or a little less.
And within that circle let there be another third; and let the space which is between them be the quantity of a walnut; and let those circles be open on two sides; and let the length of those irons be a walnut or two walnuts, and make in those irons properly prepared margins in the circles; and this is its form:
Then let it be heated in the fire until it glows red and throws off sparks, and then let it be placed on the part of the ankle, the patient lying on their side. Therefore cauterize that with three round cauteries at once.
Then leave it for three days; then plaster it with a bandage and leave the wound open for several days; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
Says Albucasis: O, son, we have used this type of cautery little because of the fear of looking at it, and because we have found few who dare to look at it.
But of the good cauteries to him who suffers them, and finds with it the place of it.
But cauterization with burning medicines is that you make two circles having a perforated armature in which to place the handle of the iron door; let the length of the walls in height be two nuts or something like that.
And if the space which is between each is the quantity of the thickness of the finger; and let them be open below and above, and let them contain themselves between them according to this form:
Then place it over the affected part of the hip, the patient lying on their side, and compress your hand over the part of the hip; and then take warm water and pour it between the two circles, and let the quality of it be with little fire gradually, and keep it for the amount of an hour, and let the patient suffer the biting and burning of it — for this produces a burning like fire — until the burning ceases.
Then raise your hand with the instrument and wipe the warm water from the whole hip with fresh water.
Then leave it for three days and place a bandage over it until the blackness of the burn is removed, and leave it for some days, and pus will flow from it; this is the final healing.
Then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make for him a bath containing water, in the same way as it is done for the hip.
And this is the method of hot water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on the rectification of medicines. Take alkali and quicklime, equal parts of each, and crush them and place them in a new pot, the bottom of which is perforated by a small hole, according to the quantity that will enter the ray. (The "ray" here likely refers to a specific instrument or body part; more context would be helpful for a definitive translation.)
And place under the bottom of the pot another glazed pot, and pour onto the alkali and quicklime some fresh water that covers them by a finger's breadth, and then compress them with your hand with good pressure, and let the sharp water descend from above into the glazed pot below.
And then collect all that water, and pour it over more fresh quicklime and alkali, for then it will be of a very strong acidity, which is used in many medical operations and in the cauterization of other members, because it acts like fire.
And some medicines with which cauterization is also done are:  honey,  vinegar, and lime with soap, mixed together.
And Gualia recounted from an ancient man the operation and cure with which pain in the hip and sciatic vein is cured, and highly praised the effectiveness of it, and said that it had no need of further treatment, and that it healed at once, as recounted, because he quickly entered a bath and was already healed of it.
And it is that fresh rue should be taken, and if fresh is not found, a fresh fig should be taken; and it should be well crushed with a little fat and placed on the hip where the pain is, or on the thigh, or on the leg, and bound on.
And it should be left on for three hours, or for as long as the patient feels the burning sensation.
Then put him in a bath, and when his body is reddened, expose him to the sun, for the pain ceases and he is healed.
And know that it is not fitting that anyone use cautery with these medicines except after the evacuation of the body.
But already Dioscorides said that when the varicose vein is cauterized with goat's dung, it benefits him very much; and the cautery should be applied in this manner: wool should be taken and soaked in old oil, and placed between the toes and the ankle.
Then take dried goat dung and burn it until it becomes charcoal; and then place it on the wool and leave it there until it is extinguished. Then repeat this, and do not cease doing this until the sensation of burning reaches the ankle and relieves the pain.
And this method of cautery is called cautery of  goats (or "cow cautery," depending on how "vaquas" is interpreted - it seems to be a scribal error).
Chapter 42.
Concerning the cauterization of toothache.
Sometimes pain is in the teeth due to various causes, such as a fall or a blow, or excessive evacuation, and similar causes, due to the infusion of cold and humid matter.
And cautery is only suitable for that one type which is caused by the effusion of cold matter.
Therefore, after evacuation of the patient with purging pills and similar things,  make incisions on the tooth where the pain is, three lines according to its width, then mark with ink in each line five cauteries or more, according to the patient's tolerance and their strength.
And let the cauterization be done with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, cauterize with three or four cauteries with a medial nail-shaped cautery according to this form:
Chapter 43.
Of cauterization at the beginning of gibbosity (or hunchback).
Many times this illness happens to small children; and a sign of its beginning in children is that it occurs in their spine with elevation and movement.
And you find in the last vertebra of the back and neck that it begins to rise above the other vertebrae.
And so when you see this and want to prevent it, then cauterize that with a cautery which is circular according to this form: so that the cautery takes in the whole part of the vertebra equally.
And if you wish, cauterize in the circumference of the vertebra with a pointed cautery two or three lines. And let the points be close to each other.
And then treat the area until it is healed with what we have said.
But beware that cautery is not administered in a swelling that is caused by a spasm of the nerves.
Chapter 44.
Concerning the cauterization of gout and joint pain.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors which are infused into each member of the body, then when pain comes in the feet, it is customary for physicians to call this properly gout.
And therefore, if gout caused by cold is cured by a method of treatment and the pains are not removed, then cautery removes them.
And it is that you cauterize that near evacuation in the area of the joint of the foot with many cauteries.
And let the cautery be olive-shaped, of which this is the form:
And if it is necessary that a puncture be made on the surface of the foot, then do it with a pointed cautery. And if the pains rise into the knees or other joints, and this often happens, then cauterize that area on each knee with three or four cauteries on each side with this olive-shaped cautery.
And if many cauteries are necessary, then cauterize that area, and do not press too hard with your hand and the cautery beforehand; let it only be about the thickness of a finger.
And if the pains rise into both knees, then administer the cautery which we have described in its chapter.
And if the pains are only in the hands and it is called  suagra (likely a form of hand pain or arthritis), then puncture in the circle of the veins, as if revolving, puncture in those two lines.
And if the pain remains in the fingers, then puncture in the circle of the veins on each finger and on the palm of the hand.
And if the pains reach the elbows or muscles in a few days, then cauterize them in every part of the affected areas.
And do not neglect the patient's good regimen and the reception of medicines, for if a good regimen is followed and the inflammation is evacuated with this cautery, he will be healed, God willing.
Chapter 45.
On the cauterization of fractures.
When a fracture occurs in the knees and the intestines protrude before the patella to the genitals, and this begins to happen, then you should order the patient to abstain from food that day and to use lenitive remedies so that the rupture descends from his belly.
Then hold the patient between your hands on his back, and instruct him to hold his breath until the patella or intestine is expelled or appears.
Then return it with your words and signs, gently pushing the rupture over the pubic bone, noting that its extremity should resemble a semicircle at the upper parts of the body.
Then ignite the cautery, whose shape is as follows:
until it is very red and throws off sparks. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area so that the intestine does not protrude.
And you have already opened the space between the patient's thighs and placed a cushion underneath; and let another servant be on their legs, and another on their feet, who holds their hands.
Then place the cautery on that mark with your hand, holding the cautery straight, and hold it there until you reach with it the bone of the pubis to the middle of the duodenum; and repeat this another time if you did not reach the bone on the first attempt.
And observe carefully the position of the intestine during your cauterization, so that you do not burn the intestine, lest death or other great harm befall the patient.
And know that if you do not reach the bone with the cautery, do not complete your operation.
And it is necessary that the cautery for children be small, according to their size and measure.
Then care for the cauterized area for three days with a bandage until the burn scar is healed.
And then treat it with other ointments until it is healed.
And the patient should lie on their back for forty days until the area and wound are sealed/healed.
And it is necessary that you provide the patient with nourishment according to the length of their treatment, which will cleanse their bowels, and that the intestine does not protrude during the healing process.
And then, when he wants to get up after forty days, apply a properly made bandage, and keep it on for another forty days.
And let him be lessened in work and in the fullness of food and drink, and in vehement voice, for when he uses this regimen of healing entirely he will be healed.
And I will describe the treatment of ruptures in other parts of the belly; and if, at the beginning, you want them not to protrude, then cauterize the rupture with a round cautery according to its size, and let that which is exuded from the wound be like the third part of it; and then treat it with what we have said, and it is not appropriate. (This last clause feels like a correction or an afterthought, possibly noting an exception or alternative method not fully explained.)
And some first said that the rupture should be cauterized with a triangular cautery according to this shape, since it is marked with a probe:
and a line is placed across the widest part of the rupture, and another line above it; and place your hand with a nail-like cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.
Chapter 46.
On the cauterization of torsion. (or twisting; likely referring to a twisted intestine or similar)
When in some member, because of a fall or a blow, pain arises and persists for a long time and does not yield to treatment with medicines, then it is necessary to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
And let the cautery be appropriate to each member according to its size and smallness, and its strength and weakness, and the location of the torsion and its pain.
Therefore, if it is healed by the first cauterization, it is good; and if not, then repeat the cautery on it; for it is customary for those pains that they are punctuated from one member to the next closest member, so it is necessary that you treat those with cautery until the patient is healed.
Chapter 47.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
Lepers are sometimes helped by cautery, especially if the type of leprosy is caused by putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy.
And so, if you wish to cauterize someone, consider whether the leprosy is spreading and whether it can be cured with what we have said in the division, and if it does not decrease or remain stable, and you fear that the corruption will spread throughout their body and their entire complexion, then cauterize them on the head with five cauteries: one in the middle of the head, and the second lower, between the forehead and the hairline; and two on the temples; and one behind, on the nape of the neck.
And finally, with the cautery, press your hand slightly inward so that a small impression is made on the bone, and the crusts are removed, so that the exhalation of thick vapors is relieved; and cauterize over the spleen as needed.
And if the leprosy is already widespread on the patient and manifestly apparent, then you should cauterize them with the cauteries mentioned for the head; and with a cautery on the tip of the nose, and with two cauteries on the two cheekbones, and with two cauteries on two vertebrae of the neck, and with six cauteries on the vertebrae of the back, and with a large one on the vertebrae near the buttocks, and one on the buttocks, and with two on the hips, and one on each hip, and with two on the groins and one on each groin, and with two on the knees, and with two on the thighs, and with two on the ankles of their feet; and cauterize them on all the joints of the fingers and toes, and on each heel of their feet, and on the wrists of their hands.
And be careful of the nerves that are on the heel, so as not to burn them.
And sometimes it is cauterized with one cautery on the pubic bone and with another on the stomach opening, and another on the liver.
And know that the more precisely you apply the cauteries, the more beneficial and helpful it is; and know that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery, as they would with other wounds, because their body is already numb.
And the cauteries should be large or small according to the limbs and joints, as is prescribed by the specifications of the instruments.
Then treat the cautery with cooked barley flour mixed with honey and with other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Concerning the cauterization of numbness/stupor.
When a limb is numb or asleep and has been treated with medicines, oils, and plasters, and is not healed, then you should cauterize that numb limb with cauteries according to the size or smallness of the limb.
And let your cautery penetrate the thickness of the skin a little. And then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
And sometimes some numbness is cauterized which extends to the hands and feet, and to the vertebrae of the back, near the origin of the nerves which move that limb, and the numbness is relieved.
But do not attempt this except for someone who is skilled in the anatomy of the limbs and the origin of the nerves moving the whole body.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the cauterization of white patches which are morphea (vitiligo).
When the white patches are old and you do not apply any medicinal ointments, then you cauterize it with a cautery iron a little, according to the size and nature of the affected area, until the whiteness and its color are relieved, and its color is changed.
Then treat it with flour of barley and lentils with rose oil and arugula leaves, and with pigeon blood or adder blood, of each an equal part, and all mixed together, and apply a linen cloth over the area until it is healed.
Chapter 50.
Concerning the cauterization of cancer.
When cancer is beginning and you want to stop it, then cauterize it with a circular cautery iron around its perimeter as it is developed/spread.
And the wise men say that it should be cauterized with a pointed cautery iron in the middle; however, this is not my practice, for I fear that it will be ulcerated, and I have seen this happen several times.
And it is more proper that it be cauterized around its perimeter with a circle, as we have said, or with several cauteries.
Chapter 50.  (Assuming a Roman numeral system;  LI = 51 is also possible depending on the manuscript's numbering conventions.)
Concerning the cauterization of a boil/abscess.
When a boil is delayed in maturation, and this is due to the abundance causing it, or to the age of the patient, because he is old and decrepit, with little blood, or due to the season, and you wish to hasten the maturation of the boil; then cauterize around its perimeter with several small, pointed cauteries; and then leave it, for it will hasten maturation.
But if you wish to perforate it with a cautery, then you heat the cautery, of which this is the shape: and place that in the middle of the boil until it penetrates the skin.
And if the cautery is in a lower place, so that the body of the arm is relieved; and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 52.
On the cauterization of corrosives.
A corrosive is a corruption that moves in the limb, which corrodes it like fire consuming dry wood.
Therefore, if you see this corrosive in a place that suffers cauterization with fire, then you should ignite very small, hot cautery nails, and large ones as is appropriate for the place where the corrosive is.
And then cauterize it completely until you eradicate all the corrosion and none of it remains.
And then leave it for three days, and place crushed sulfur mixed with oil on the cauterized areas until all the scabs are gone and all the corruption is eradicated.
And then treat it with a flesh-generating ointment.
But if after three days you see that the flesh grows healthy where there is no corruption, it is good; but if not, then repeat the cauterization on whatever remains corrupt in those places.
And corrosion is sometimes treated with a sharp medicine, for that is a substitute for cauterization. But however, cauterization with fire is of more certain benefit.
And I have already described the treatment with sharp medicine in the section on incisions, and therefore use that when you have need of it.
Chapter 53.
On the cauterization of ulcers and other similar ailments.
Often, a disease called an ulcer develops on the parts below the foot, and it is a deep, penetrating sore that damages the foot; and cauterization in these cases is done in two ways, that is, cauterization with fire and cauterization with hot water.
But cauterization with fire is to heat a concave cautery resembling a vulture's beak, which is made of iron according to the size needed to contain the entire ulcer, and it should have fine edges.
Then place that heated instrument on the ulcer, and gently move your hand with the cautery in a circle around the ulcer until the cautery reaches the depth of the ulcer. And leave it there for three days until it begins to shed eschar. Then plaster it with crushed wild mallows mixed with salt, and leave the plaster on it for one night, for this will eradicate it from its roots.
Then treat the area with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
And if it does not heal, and this often happens on the surface of the body, especially on the hands and feet, then you should apply cautery with water to these areas.  Take a small tube of bronze, iron, or vulture's quill, and place it over the ulcer. Then pour a small quantity of hot water into the tube, and hold your hand, gently moving it with compression around the tube.  The edge of the tube should be pressed into the root of the ulcer, and the hot water will find its way to the root of the ulcer. Let the patient endure the bite of the hot water for about an hour, then remove it, for the ulcer with its roots will be eradicated.
And do this with those [ulcers] and then with the others until you have treated all those that are on the body.
Then treat those [sores] after the roots of the ulcers have been eradicated, with ointments that generate flesh.
Chapter 53.
Concerning the cauterization of tremors.
When someone suffers from tremors due to cold in the nerves, or from a cold fever, or from a similar cause, then you should cauterize them with four or five cauteries on the spinal vertebrae, one cautery between each vertebra; and with a cautery on their feet, and on their stomach, using an olive-shaped cautery.
And his tremor will subside, and hasten the healing of the cold illness.
Chapter 54.
Concerning the cauterization of accidental ailments of the body.
When in the body there are boils and pustules caused by thick, corrupted matter; then, at the beginning, when they appear, it is necessary that it be cauterized on the head of the fistula with a fine cautery made with myrtle wood, the end of which is heated with fire; or with long roots of erestologia; or with a lenticular cautery.
And sometimes a cautery is also applied at the beginning of its expulsion in this manner; and they are not believed, and the superfluity is broken up by doing this, and heals from it.
However, it is necessary that this be done near evacuation with phlebotomy.
Chapter 56.
Chapter 56. On the cauterization of a blood flow accident caused by an arrow wound.
Often, there is a flow of blood from an arrow wound which is incised near the wound, which flows outwards, or near the incision of abscesses or cauterization of the limb, and similarly, and it is difficult to stop this.
Therefore, when this happens to someone, then you should press with your hand on the opening of the arrow wound, and place your finger on it, tightly pressing it many times until the flow of blood stops under your finger, and it does not come out.
Then place in the fire small and large olive cauteries, many in number, and blow on them until they are very hot.
And then take one of these, small or large depending on the location and the wound where the artery is broken,  and apply it to that vein quickly after you have removed your finger, and hold the cautery there until the bleeding is stopped and restrained.
And if the blood is expelled from the opening of the artery when you remove your finger and apply the cautery, then take another cautery quickly from among those which are prepared in the fire, and do not cease doing this one after another until the bleeding is stopped.
And be careful not to burn the nerve that is there, and that another ailment befall the patient.
And know that when blood flows from an artery, it is not possible to stop it in those cases, especially when the artery is large, except in one of four ways: either with a cautery as we have said, or by extraction if it is not extracted, for when it is extracted the extremities are better burned and the bleeding is stopped, or that it be tied with thread or with a tight ligature, or that medicines whose virtue is to stop blood be placed upon it; and these should be tightened with a cushion with a decent constriction.
But that which administers a decent restriction with a ligature and with a tightening with cloths or by the application of cauterizing substances and the like, should not be applied except late.
But if this happens to someone and the physician or medicine is not present, then gently press with the index finger on the opening of that vein as we have said, and apply great pressure to it until the blood is stopped from the principal part of the wound, and the finger should not be removed from the artery; and upon the artery sprinkle very cold water until the blood is congealed and thickened; and consider whether cautery or medicine is needed.
Of incisions and perforations and cupping and of phlebotomy and of wounds and their similars.
We have already discussed in the first chapter every illness in which cautery with fire and with burning medicine is suitable, and the occasions and causes of it, and the necessary instruments with the forms of the cauteries; and I have ordered the chapters from the head down to the feet.
And I will proceed in this chapter in the same manner, so that the one who seeks this will be aided, then regarding that which he will have asked.
And before I begin this, it is necessary, son, that you learn that in this chapter it is about the terrors that are mentioned in the first chapter on cauterization.
And because it is necessary that there be great caution in it, for in the operation which is in this chapter, many times it causes an evacuation which is with blood, with which life is maintained, through the opening of a vein, or incision upon an abscess, or opening of a fistula, or purification of a wound, or extraction of an arrow, or incision of a stone, and similar things. And all of these are accompanied by fear and trembling, and in most of them, death results.
And I warn you that this should not befall you, in which there is hesitation, for sometimes it happens to you by the hands of men with many kinds of illnesses. And of them, there is some who becomes angry with his illness and death is light for him, and this is because of the vehemence of what he finds in his illness, and because of the length of his illness, and with the illness is a fear which signifies death.
And of those, there is one who gives you his possessions and says you are hoping for his health, and his illness is pernicious.
Therefore it is not fitting that you consent to him who comes to you, of whom this manner is; and your caution should be greater than covetousness and your rapacity; and do not presume anything about this except for certain knowledge which verifies this to you, and to which a praiseworthy outcome follows.
And use in the cure of all your patients prognostication and indication of him to whom health is restored, for in that there is help for you in the acquisition of fame and memory, of praise and glory.
O, sons, may God inspire you with His understanding and may He not deny you direction and protection, for this is in His hand.
And I have ordered this chapter, distinguishing it by chapters as preceded in the chapter on cauteries, from the care of the head to the feet, so that what you ask for and what you need may be alleviated for you.
Chapter one.
Of the treatment of the water which is contained in the heads of children.
Know that this illness often happens to children at birth, and when the nurse compresses the child's head without gentleness.
And sometimes it happens for a hidden cause which is unknown.
But I have only seen this illness in children; and all those whom I saw died from it, and thus it is, to my knowledge, a deadly affliction for them.
And I have seen a child whose head was filled with water, and his head was always thus enlarged until he could no longer support himself because of the size of his head, and moreover the humidity increased until he died.
And this humidity is either collected between the scalp and the bone, or it is collected under the bone on the brain.
Because if the operation is such that the humidity is between the scalp and the bone and the abscess is small, then you must make an incision in the middle of the head with a fissure in width, and the length of the fissure should be about two finger-widths so that the humidity can drain, and this is the form of the spatula:
And so, if the humidity is more increased and the abscess is larger, then there should be two incisions in this manner:
And if the humidity is under the bone, the sign is that you see the sutures of the head open on all sides and the water is squeezed out when you compress that area with your hand on the inside parts and this is not hidden from you. You must make an incision in the middle of the head with three incisions in this manner:
And then extract all the humidity from the incision; and then tighten the incisions with cloths and lint; and then bathe it above with wine and oil until the fifth day, and then untie the bandage and treat the wound with tents and ointments, and bind the head evenly; and let the patient eat dry food with little humidity until the member is strengthened and healed.
And there is another method of incision, that you consider where the magnitude of the abscess and the collection of water appear, for sometimes it is more in the occiput, or in the front part, or on the right, or on the left; and therefore aim with the incision where the abscess and the accumulation of water appear, and do it as best you can.
And observe that you do not cut the artery and that a flow of blood ensues, and the patient dies from that flow of blood with evacuation of humidity.
Chapter Second.  (or Chapter Two)
When someone experiences cataracts or rheums in the eyes or feet, and this is chronic, and the treatment with medicines does not help, then the last resort is the incision of those two arteries.
And therefore, when you wish to incise them, have the patient raise their head, and rub the area with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear, and then constrict the patient's neck with a cloth; and then observe where the vein pulsates; and the location of each, above the areas near the ears, is depressed, and is hardly visible except in some people.
Then mark the artery with a probe, and then incise each one with a sharp lancet on each side, making an incision reaching the bone, and this should be across the width of the head.
And if you wish, insert the lancet under the artery and sever it at the incisions above.
And let the length of the incision be about two joined fingers, because when a vein is incised, the blood comes out with a pulsating flow, which spurts out frequently.
But if the artery does not appear to the touch, then you must measure from the ear a space of three fingers, and then mark it with a probe, and go in as far as the bone.
And the amount of blood to be shed is about six ounces, and you should quickly let out more or less, and all this depends on the strength of the patient and the fullness of their artery.
And then examine the wound, and if any part of the splinter remains on the bone, then incise it so that a hot abscess does not develop.
And then bind the wound tightly with feathers and linen bandages, and then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Concerning the extraction of arteries which are in the temples.
When someone suffers from chronic migraine or sharp headaches, due to acrid humors and a quality in the tissues of the temples, or a vehement and similar old affliction, and is treated with the methods of medicinal cure and this does not help, then we must attempt in these illnesses the extraction of the arteries in the temples, or their cauterization as we have shown.
And the manner of the operation and extraction of these is that the patient shaves the hairs which are on the temples; and he should look for the artery appearing in the temple because it is shown to you by its pulse, and is hidden only in few men by the intensity of cold.
And if it is hidden from you, then the neck of the patient should be constricted with some cloth; and then rub the place with a rough cloth or evaporate the place with hot water until the artery appears to you manifestly. And then you take the spatula of which this is the form: And then you scrape the skin with that [spatula] easily until you reach the artery; and then place an ointment there and extract it to the superior parts until you extract it from the skin and uncover it from the tunics which are below it, from every part.
But if the artery is subtle, then wrap it with the end of the oncia [a type of surgical instrument], and then cut a part of it according to the amount by which its ends are lengthened and contracted, and there will not be a flow of blood, for if they are not incised, the blood will not rise at all.
And then evacuate from one to three ounces of blood.
And if the artery is large, then it is necessary that you tie it in two places with strong double silk thread or with cords, and do not worry about putrefaction before the consolidation of the wound and a flow of blood will result.
And then incise the superfluity which is between the two ligatures; and do this at that time or approximately another time.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery to the bone with a knife-cautery until its ends are incised, and it will be in place of that same work.
And it is a better procedure unless the patient has a fever or is of a warm complexion; for cautery is one of those things that helps to dry up humidities, and therefore it is better in its effect.
And it is necessary after the extraction of the arteries that you fill the place with old linen, and that powders are placed on it decently made, and then it should be cured with dry medicines causing the flesh to grow and with bandages until it is healed.
And if while you are operating another time there is a flow of blood from the artery, then you must take care to restrain that blood, either with a cautery, or by filling the place with linen, and squeezing your hand until the blood is restrained. And if none of those things is at your disposal, then place your finger on the place until the blood is congealed, and bathe the place with very cold water until the sharpness subsides, and it is constricted as necessary.
And what is lighter in the extraction of an artery is that you cauterize the vein with this cautery having two blades, after you have marked the two places with a probe, and place each one, very hot, until they reach the bone and cut the vein in two places, so that what is between its extremities is elongated, because they are not completely consolidated with this cautery.
And this is the form of the cautery:
And let the sharpness of the two blades be equal. However, if it is less sharp than two knives, it is better, for if it is as sharp as two knives close to each other, and does not cut the flesh quickly.
Therefore, since in those [cauteries] there is some thickness, the heat of the fire is contained within them and the flesh is cut lightly.
And this method is better in every way and gentler.
And let the space which is between the two blades be the amount of the thickness of a finger.
Chapter four.
Concerning the treatment of sharp and acrid watering of the eyes.
When there are acrid tears, and it is the flow from those veins which are on the forehead, and you find no cause for this in medicinal treatment, and sometimes the face of the patient becomes red and feels a crawling sensation on the forehead as if it were the crawling of ants, and the eyes are swollen, moist, so that the hairs around them are matted, and the eyelids are inflamed by the sharpness of the tears, the ancients had a method for treating this, and they called that treatment "spassa".
And it is that you command the patient to shave the hairs which are on his forehead, and then incise three slits in the forehead, equally distant according to the length of the forehead. And if the length of the fissure is two fingers: one fissure should be equidistant from the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second according to the length a little beyond the movement of the muscles which are in the lacrimal duct, and the third on the other side.
And beware of the incision of the arteries which are on both sides, and keep your hand away from the continuation of both jaws. And if the space of each incision is the quantity of three fingers [wide].
And if you have a prepared piece of sponge or dried cloths at hand, with which you will dry the blood.
Then insert a spatula with two sharp ends, of which this is the form of its incision: which is from the part of the temples to the second incision. Excoriate with that [tool/instrument] the whole ridge which is between the two incisions, with the [surgical] knife which is above the bone, and then do this from the middle incision to the second incision. And then remove that spatula and insert into the first incision again another instrument which is called a curette, sharp on one side and not sharp on the other.
And place the sharp edge of that [instrument] against the flesh attached to the ridge, and its blunt edge against the bone, and push it in until it reaches the middle fissure, and sever with it all the vessels that descend from the head to the eyes.
But let the incision be continued to that appearance of the ridge, and then do this in the middle fissure to the other fissure.
And after a sufficient quantity of blood has flowed, squeeze the places of the congealed blood clots.
And then place in each fissure a piece of old linen, and put on those powders soaked in wine and oil and vinegar, and see that a hot abscess does not develop.
And on the third day untie the bandage and administer a great infusion of warm or lukewarm water, and then treat it with basilicon ointment with rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Chapter 5.
Concerning the treatment of tears due to cataracts and those descending into the eyes from the inner parts of the head.
When someone suffers from acute and persistent cataracts, and sometimes the patient's eyes are thin and small, and their vision is weakened, and the eyelids are ulcerated and their skin falls off, and there is sharp, persistent pain in the front of the head and consequent sneezing, then know from these symptoms that the materials and cataracts originate from many veins proceeding from the inner parts.
And the best cure in such cases is this: order the patient to shave their forehead, and then incise a fissure in the middle of the forehead, a small one in width (and begin with the incision from the left temple to the right temple; and let the incision be to the bone; and lengthen your cut from the temples which are bruised due to mastication), until the bone is uncovered.
Dry all the blood with a sponge or a dry cloth and then fill the space between the two lips of the incision with old cotton or linen cloths. And then bind it above with powders soaked in wine and oil so that a hot abscess does not develop.
And when you unbind it and see that the abscess has diminished, then it is necessary to scrape the bone until new flesh begins to grow there, and then treat it with a drying regimen that causes the flesh to grow, as if you take two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony and mix them, and from them make a plaster and apply it to these wounds to promote the growth of new flesh.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the treatment of what falls into the ears.
Every cause that falls into the ears is one of four types, for it is either a mineral stone or something similar to a stone, such as iron or glass; or it is from a plant, such as a kernel or a bean; or it is a flowing substance such as water and sour wine and similar things; or some animal.
And therefore, when a stone or other similar substance falls into the ear, which does not soften or grow in the ear, and you place the ear in the sun, and if you see the stone, then instill some violet oil or sesame oil into it, and then proceed with its extraction, and make them sneeze with a potion, and plug the nostrils before the onset of sneezing. And then place some pieces of cloth or wool around the ear, and gently pull the ear upwards, for many times it is expelled by these means.
And if it is not expelled, then proceed with its extraction using the instrument called a slender epicyclic probe, of which this is the form:
And if it is expelled with the probe, it is good; and if not, then proceed with its extraction using a thin hook with little curvature.
And therefore, if it is not expelled by this, then make a brass cannula and insert the end of the cannula into the opening of the ear and seal around the cannula with wax and softened oil so that nothing is open except the cannula. And then extract it with your breath with strong suction, for many times it happens with what we have recounted.
But if it is not expelled in this manner, then take a small quantity of ignited or prepared birdlime, which is used to catch birds, and place it on the end of a thin stick, and then carefully wrap it around that properly positioned cotton. And then insert that into the opening of the ear easily, and then dry the ear of its moisture.
And so, if it is not expelled by all the means which we have recounted, then you should aim to remove it before it becomes a hot abscess or spasm.
And the manner of removing it is that you first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and extract blood according to their strength, and then make this incision between your fingers and turn the ear to the upper parts, and make a small incision at the root of the ear below its cartilage in a well-prepared location. And let the incision be of a crescent shape so that it reaches the stone, and, the stone found, remove it if you can with appropriate instruments; and then immediately close the incision with speed, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the cause occurring in the ear is a growth of fat that is swollen, then administer its cure and extraction; but if it does not yield to such treatment, then take finely powdered litharge according to this method: and administer with that the removal of that growth which has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it is already moistened by the vapor of the ear, and place it on thick cloths, and carefully extract it with forceps or with a fine instrument, or with an incision as we have said, for its extraction is thereby eased.
But if water has entered the ear, the patient should use sneezing as a first measure, and fill his ear with some old cotton, and lie down on the ear into which the water has entered; and if it is expelled by this, it is well; and if not, then take some heated smooth stones and lentils, about the length of a finger, and warm them a little in the fire, and let the patient insert one of these into the opening of his ear and jump on one foot on that side and strike it with another stone against the stone which is inside the ear. Therefore, do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled.
Therefore, do not cease this with the stone until all the water is expelled. And if the water is not expelled in this way, take some paper or tow, and place one end of it in the ear and hold the other end to the fire until the majority of it is burnt.
And quickly place more tow there and do this several times until all the water is expelled, and extract it with a cannula as has been said above of the extracting stone.
But in the extraction of a creature entering that ear, if it is small, like a fly or similar, cure it as we have said in the division; but if it is of a large size, which is evident to the senses, then administer its extraction with tweezers and hooks, and the cause of this is the lightest of all the other causes that fall into the ear.
But in the extraction of a worm generated in the ear, when you cure it with what we have said in the division and in the treatise on distillations and your cure is not effective, then you should expose the ear to the sun.
And so if any cause of the worms appears there, then extract it with tweezers or with fine hooks; but if no cause appears, then take a cannula narrower below and wider above, of which this is the form: And insert the narrow end into the ear according to the amount the patient can tolerate; and then suck with it strongly, and do this many times, until all the worms are expelled.
But if it does not obey you in this way, then you should fill and seal the opening of the cannula with wax as we have said; then administer distillations which the ancients have already proven in the cure of worms, and you will find this in the treatise on distillations.
And let your effusion, with which you pour the medicinal oils into the ear, be with this instrument, of which this is the form: And make it of silver or bronze, narrow below, in which there is a small hole, and flat above.
And let it be such that it pushes what is in the concavity of the cannula, contained where it will be necessary. And if you wish, take a rod and wrap its end decently with cotton, and then pour oil into the concavity of the ear, or juice of some herb, or whatever you want of these medicines into the cannula—and that is in the ear—and then insert the rod with cotton on top and press with your hand, with moderate compression, until the oil is expelled into the concavity of the ear and the patient feels the oil inside.
And what is poured into the ear should already be slightly warmed by fire. And be careful that what you distill into the ear is not too cold, for ear medicines do not tolerate that.
Chapter 7.
Concerning the treatment of ear obstructions.
Sometimes children are born without perforated ears, and this also happens in some adults; an obstruction in the ear canal due to injury or by flesh growing there.  And this obstruction sometimes occurs in the opening of the ear canal, which prevents drainage, and sometimes in the outer parts.
And that which happens in its opening, which prevents drainage, is in the greatest disposition towards difficult healing.
And in that which allows drainage, you should expose the patient's ear to the sun and observe it. And then if you see an apparent obstruction, open it with a fine spatula, of which this is the form:
If its end is narrow, with one side sharp and the other not; and the spatula should be two finger-widths wide so that it does not injure the ear.
And if the obstruction is due to flesh grown in the ear or its canal, then remove it with fine hooks and incise it vigorously until all the flesh is removed.
And if the obstruction is in the opening of the ear, then take a thin, fine reed and heat it slightly with fire, and then insert it into the ear canal.
And then, if you have felt an obstruction with which the patient experiences difficulty, due to the severity of hearing loss, alleviate the pressure on it gently; and be careful not to injure the nerves of the ear.
Then place in the ear a linen cloth, according to the size of the opening, which you have wrapped in Egyptian ointment; and do this for a few days until you are sure of the healing of the wound; or take some wool, dip it in warm water, and sprinkle it with finely crushed powder and use it; and if you see that the ear is already abscessed, then you must remove the wool and replace it with other wool which you will wrap in a plaster made with rose oil, until the abscess is completely reduced; and then treat it until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs, then submerge a sponge or cloth in cold water and apply it to the ear, and use the other treatment which constricts the flow of blood, which is described in the treatise on distillation.
Chapter 8.
Concerning the treatment of a stye which develops on the eyelids.
Styes which develop on the eyelids are sometimes moist, sometimes dry.
Therefore it is necessary that you hold them with forceps or with your fingers, and incise them with a spatula from their roots, and then apply a poultice to the affected areas.
But if pain with bleeding occurs, then cauterize them with a thin, lentil-shaped cautery iron.
And the best cauterization is near the incisions, and often they return when some cause remains in their roots; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned and do not return.
Chapter 9.
Treatment of swelling that comes to the eyelids of the eyes.
Many times there appears on the eyelids of the eyes some growth which resembles a swelling in its firmness and hardness, and because of its swelling it is called a swelling.
And it is an accumulation of thick humidity in the eyelid below and above.
Therefore, the operation on them is that you consider then if the swelling is coming forth in such a way that it appears from the eyelid and is spread throughout; and the cause of it is slight.
Then make an incision on it lengthwise, and then peel it off entirely easily until it comes off, and then lift it up with tweezers and cut it off.
And if the growth is large, then you adjust it with sutures; and cure it until it is healed.
And if it is small, you will suffer no harm from it because the ointment heals it and it will fill in.
And if the growth is leaning towards the inner parts of the eyelid beneath the inner surface, then lift the eyelid and lift the growth with tweezers,  even if you need to make an incision, and press it from all sides, and if the eyelid is lengthened by the incision, this harms nothing.
Then, after the incision, wash the eye with salt water; and treat the area with something that causes it to fill in until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the treatment of a growth on the upper eyelid.
A growth is a swelling which is generated in the membranes of the upper eyelid, and mostly in children, it irritates their eyes and causes them to have a continual discharge; and they cannot look at the brightness of the sun because of it, for tears gather there.
And therefore you see them lying on their faces all the time, and sleeping on their faces; and the lower eyelids and eyebrows are moist, showing swelling and the appearance of a growth is evident in the eye; and when you press the area with your fingers, you feel a growth there.
And one method of operation is this: the patient places his head in your lap, and you place a cloth between you and him to act as a support.  Make a circle of the appropriate size to encompass the entire growth, then place it over the growth and press it with your fingers all around so that the growth is concentrated in the center of the circle. Then make an incision into the center of this swelling with a pointed instrument, the incision being no larger than that made in bloodletting.
But in the operation it is necessary that you cut through completely until you reach the growth, because in most cases the growth comes out through the incision in the form of a white greasy substance.
Then extract it with cloths which you have wrapped around your fingers at the edges and roll it between your right and left hand until it is completely removed.
And be careful not to push too deeply into the incision so that with the instrument you do not reach the eye and injure it.
But if the growth does not appear at the beginning of the incision, gently probe a little further into the incision until the growth emerges; and then extract it as we have said; and then soak cloths in wine and vinegar, and place them over the area and bind them with powder.
And some crush salt and place it in the cavity of the incision so that it dries any remaining moisture.
And then care for it until it is healed.
But if a hot abscess occurs at the site, then treat it with soothing plasters until it is healed.
Chapter 11.
On the ways of touching the eye.
When in the eyelids of the eyes there are growths beneath the natural skin and are inflamed, then these harm the eye and cause various illnesses, such as constant tears and softening of the eyelids and membrane, until this causes destruction of the eye, which is called a tactus of the eye, and it is cured in four ways: either by cautery with fire; or with an acute medicine as previously mentioned in the chapter on cautery; or the tactus is made by incision and suture; or by cannulas as I shall describe.
And therefore it is necessary that you place the patient's head in your lap; then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand, and if it is turned, it is good; and if not, insert a needle into that part where the pus is beneath the eyelid, and make the needle penetrate upwards, and this should be – near the margin of the eyelid where the hairs grow – near the hairs, and draw the pus to the upper parts with the eyelid, and turn it with a ray.  (The "ray" here likely refers to a surgical instrument or a tool to manipulate the eyelid)
Then make an incision in the inner part of the eyelid below the inflamed growths with a small, sharp instrument from the major lacrimal duct to the minor lacrimal duct; and then extract the pus and place small pieces of cotton or cloth under the eyelid, and then bind over the eyelid with a bandage, and let it be like the shape of a myrtle leaf.
However, the shape [of the bandage] should be according to the amount of swelling of the eyelid, for this varies in people, for some it is necessary to incise a large amount of the eyelid according to how much the eyelid is softened.
Then make an incision with the small instrument along the two lines that you have marked, beginning from the major lacrimal duct to the minor lacrimal duct. And if your incision is near the natural hairs, [let it be] as thick as a king's [hair/thread]. (This likely refers to a very fine incision)
Then place the hook in one of the two corners of the wound, and then scrape it all, and then join the two lips of the wound with glue or fine wool thread, and wipe away the blood, and stick what overflows from the threads on the two eyebrows with some sticky substance, if you wish to do so, and if not, don't worry.
Then leave the suture of the threads for three or four days, and then take care of it.
And if you wish, leave the wound without suture, and treat it with something that dries and constricts, because the eyelid is raised by the sealing of the wound and its aggregation; but suture is better.  Therefore, the ancients advised this [suturing].
But however, let there be diligence on the part of the physician, and it is a good operation, and let there be no fear in him.
And there is another way to treat [this], and it is to make a mark on the eyelid in the shape of a myrtle leaf, and then raise the eyelid with three hooks separated and joined according to this form:
But if this is not possible, to hold the hooks, and this is not appropriate, then take a needle on which there is thread and place that in the middle of the figure, and introduce the other thread near the larger tear duct, and the second thread near the smaller tear duct, and adjust between your fingers the threads with equality, and then with those lift your hand with even elevation, raising the entire area over which it is marked as we have recounted.
And then join the two lips of the wound with a suture, and treat it until it is healed.
But if an abscess occurs near your incision or your fissure, treat that abscess with a plaster and similar things, and with ointments.
And sometimes it happens to the eyelid that its hairs are inverted, then it is necessary that you use on that what we have said of incision; but suture in each case is more skillful/artificial.
To bandage with canes is according to this method/form: and it is that you turn back the eyelid and cut the growth that is inside as I have recounted; and then skillfully make two thin canes or splinters whose length is according to the length of the eyelid and whose width is less than the width of the space/gap. And you have already incised at the ends of each part, where you have the threads/sutures.
Then carefully add each one with subtlety over what is superfluous of the eyelid of the eye, and bind the canes to each part with a strong binding, and leave it for some days, for the growth because of the binding will die and dry up and rot until it falls off by itself.
But if it is delayed/prolonged, then break it with forceps, and then treat the wound until it is healed.
Then, when it is solidified, the eyelid is raised and the hairs do not prick/protrude.
And this is the form of two canes which you will make according to this form/model: and have the quantity of length and width neither more nor less.
Chapter 12.
Chapter 12. Of the elevation of prickly hairs in the eye with a needle when the hair is hard.
When there are unnatural, hard, rough, and prickly hairs in the eyes, then the operation is that you take a fine needle, and place it on that fine silk thread and lion [possibly a type of linen or fine fabric;  the term requires further context for definitive translation], and then you adjust its ends, and tie each [end] in a very subtle manner. And let the length of the threads be the quantity of a palm [hand-span].
And then you prepare two other fine threads underneath it briefly, and tie the ends of those if you wish.
And then have the patient place their head in your lap, and be near the sun so that your work is illuminated, for it is a subtle and delicate operation.
And then insert the needle into the root of the hair, adjusting it as needed, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly until you extract it from above the natural hair.
And then pull the hair upwards and insert it into the alixati (likely a solution or ointment), and let there be one, two, or three hairs, but no more.
And then pull your hand with that until the hair is pulled out with the alixolati (likely a solution or ointment) in the eyelid, along with the natural hair.
But if the alixalati is pulled and the hair is not removed, you will draw the alixalati towards the lower parts with the bile that you have mixed with it, until the alixalati is removed from the upper wound.
And examine it with the vision of the eye, for then you will remove the alixalati and the bile, and clean and close each one and close the eye, and leave it closed for two or three days, until the hair adheres to its place and good flesh grows over it.
And if the hair is shorter, then you attach a long hair from the natural hairs, and it is raised with that, or you leave it until it is lengthened to a certain space, and then you raise it.
Chapter 13.
Concerning the treatment of a stye which appears on the upper eyelid.
When a stye appears in the eye, and it is a contraction of the eyelid when it is contracted upwards, or to the right or left side, due to poor healing of a wound or incision or cautery, and it is called lagophthalmos (leporina), and this ectropion or is natural or accidental, and is caused by the healing of a wound or incision or cautery, or by something similar to their bad healing.
The method of operation is that you incise that consolidation and separate its lips, and place between them a small piece of linen cloth, and bind them until they are healed.
And it is not fitting that you use treatments which dry or constrict; for if you do this, the stye will return worse than it was before.
Use on it things that soften, such as fenugreek, and apply a poultice with the water in which mallow and linseed have been boiled, or diachylon ointment, which should be liquefied with some oil, and soak the linen cloth in it, and treat it with that.
And the treasure of your treatment is that you ensure, by every means, that it is not consolidated in a way different from its original form.
And this operation which we have described is nothing but a rectification of the stye so that it does not return to its previous form.
Chapter 14.
Concerning the treatment of a stye which is formed on the lower eyelid.
This stye, which forms on the lower eyelid—which is truly called a stye—is of two types: one natural, the other accidental.
But the accidental type is caused by a wound, or a cut, or cauterization, or similar things.
And the method of operating is that you take a needle with double thread, and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left lacrimal duct to the right lacrimal duct, until the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then stretch the flesh upwards with the needle and sew it with the needle, and incise it with a wide spatula. And so if the eyelid's shape returns to normal, good; but if not, take a splint and place it in the slit, and with it reshape the eyelid, and stitch the two fissures on the lower eyelid.
And let the ends of the two fissures be two angles of the incision, which you have made so that they meet, and let an angle be formed between them so that when they come together, their shape is formed.
And this shape is the Greek letter: lambda.
Then remove the flesh on that side to the extent that the lower eyelid is affected, so that the eyelid may be restored.
Then join the separated parts and sew them with wool thread; and then treat them with what we have said of emollient medicines and poultices until it is healed.
And if it is excoriated due to a fissure, suture, or cautery, then you should make a flat incision on the skin of the eyelid, as previously described. Then separate [the wound] with a poultice between two lips, as we have said.
In summary, regarding the treatment of excoriation whether above or below, the operation should proceed as prepared in the manner of excoriation, which exists in many varied forms.
And the skillful surgeon always prepares himself in every possible way to restore the shape to its natural form, or close to it, and the patient according to what is appropriate for the operation and the instruments, in the best conditions.
Chapter 15.
Of the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this consolidation happens to many people such that the upper eyelid is adhered to the white of the eye, and its natural movement and function are impeded, then you must insert the tip of a probe beneath the eyelid and lift it up, or extend it with an unguent.
And then you incise the adhesion with a fine spatula, which should not be sharply pointed, but rather blunt, so that the patient is not disturbed during the operation, and move the spatula so that it does not injure the eye with its sharpness.
And let your incision be such that it separates that adhesion easily, until the eyelid is returned to its natural shape and the entire adhesion is healed.
And then you put salt water in the eye with which you wash it; or distill into it some vitriol dissolved in water.
And then separate the eyelid from the eye with a small splint, and place wool soaked in egg white on the eye, and then on the third day use consolidative remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the incision of the nail and the fleshy eminence of the tear ducts.
Know that a nail is of two types, for it is either nervous, and is similar to hard, thin horn; or it is non-nervous, similar to a congealed white humidity, which when iron touches it, or is forced to be taken with an instrument, is severed, and the instrument is not embedded in it.
And both types begin only from the larger tear duct, until it grows little by little, covering the sight and obstructing the light and movement of the eye.
But the manner of operating in its incision is that the patient should place his head on your lap, and then open his eyes, and raise the eyelid with your hand, and then grasp the nail with a small, double-ended instrument and extend it to the upper parts. And then take a needle and insert into it a horsehair, or ox hair, or cow hair, or something similar, or strong thread, or double the end of the needle little by little and insert it into the middle of the nail, and penetrate it with the needle, and tie the nail with thread; and extend it to the upper parts, and scrape with the hair the edge of the nail which covers the pupil. And thus you follow it with the hair into the back of it.
And then you incise the remainder at the root of the tear duct with a fine spatula or with small scissors, and leave the natural flesh of the tear duct so that through the incision of it there is no continuous flow of tears.
And sometimes the nail, with only the forceps extended or with thread, as we have said, and then it should be scraped with a lion spatula, of which this is its form:
And be careful that with the spatula you do not touch the cornea and that a rupture occurs in it, and that the pupil is perforated.
Then, after the incision, put a little crushed salt or finely powdered cinquefoil into the eye, and leave it there until the next day; and then treat it with whatever is appropriate until it is healed.
And if the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert the needle, nor is the forceps applied to it, then very often this type of nail is cured with medicines, and is healed as I have recounted in the division.
And if you wish to incise it, then you open the patient's eye and take a thin lion spatula of sharpened iron according to this form: with subtlety.  (or: delicately; with precision) And if you see that it is rarefied and is congested and rooted there, then distill from your still into the eye cinquefoil juice or rosewater or crushed salt, and occlude the eye until the next day.
And then repeat the operation on it until all that is there is removed, unless, on the contrary, a hot abscess forms in the eye, for then you leave that and cure the abscess first until it is healed.
And then repeat your operation on it with reason until it is healed.
The eminence of the lachrymal flesh, if it is noticeable in the eye causing great harm, should be suspended with a hook; and incise it in part, and do not extend the incision so that you do not cut the flow of tears.
And then instill rosewater and cinquefoil juice into the lachrymal duct until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Concerning the incision of a growth and what is born of fleshy matter in the eye.
Sometimes in the eyes of some, red flesh is born and grows until it covers the pupil, or approaches and presses on the eyelids, and strongly compresses the eyelids at the outer edges, resembling a balustrade rose.
But the operation is that the patient places his head in your lap; and then open the patient's eyes and remove all that flesh with suitable instruments for this, and hold it with forceps or tweezers; and then incise the flesh from the beginning until all is finished with the scalpel, and be careful of the eye that you do not injure it during your operation.
And let your incision with which you incise those things be with a spatula, which we have recommended in the incision of the nail, or with small scissors with which the hair is collected, according to how its form will come for this chapter.
Therefore, when your incision is completed and all that flesh is removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt, or instill into it red powder similar to that of corrosive medicines, and place a bandage on the outside of the eye with egg white until it is secured from a hot abscess.
And if some cause of inflammation remains and hot blood is observed, and you fear a hot abscess, then leave the eye and cure that abscess with whatever reduces that abscess, and then repeat the operation on it until it is healed, and similarly do with the fleshy excrescence which occurs in the eye of this kind.
But however, you should know that you should avoid all treatment of the eye, whether by natural or accidental means, operating with iron, and do not put your hand to any of these operations until you see that that member is able to withstand that operation.
Chapter XVIII.
Concerning the collection of pus in the eye.
Pus is caused by red veins which are hardened over the eye and prevent the sight, and they weaken the eye over many days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning that you consider if the eye in which there is pus is strong and in it there is no other illness than pus; then you should collect that pus.
And it is that you command the patient to place his head in your lap, and then suspend those veins with an uncia or two, according to your judgment; and let that uncia be of subtle doubling according to this form:
or two unciae gradually in one piece according to this form:
And then let those veins be collected with fine forceps, with subtlety, and wipe away the blood little by little, until you see those veins be removed from the eye and be retracted.
And be careful that you do not injure the eye with the ends of the spatula; and if your operation is at midday before the sun, and you are very firm in your operation that you do not incise except those veins.
And when you have finished, then you distill into the eye verdigris or rue so that with its sharpness it corrodes what has been removed from the eyebrow.
But if this is not possible for you, collect everything at that time, and then you plaster everything with something that soothes his pain, and leave it for a few days until his pain is soothed and he is assured of a hot abscess.
And then repeat on him according to the same manner until he is healed.
And this is the form of the forceps:
Chapter 19.
Concerning the reduction of a nasal fracture.
When you treat a fracture with cautery or with a sharp, burning medicine, as previously described, and it is not healed, then there is no pus in it but fissures on the abscess before its maturation, and you must extract all the moisture which is in it and the pus until the bone is exposed.
And thus, when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or blackness in it, then you scrape it with an instrument of which this is the form:
And it is named a rasp, and it should be made of Indian iron, and its head should be round, like a button, which should be pointed by filing or sharpened by subtle sharpening (as it is in the following form).
And place that [rasp] on the corrupted part of the bone, and then rotate it between your fingers, and press your hand little by little until you know that the corruption is scraped away.
And this should be done several times, and then restore the place with drying and astringent substances.
Then if the place is consolidated and good flesh has grown there and the body of the sore is separated and remains for 40 days, and it is not renewed and is not festering and no accident happens to it, then you will know that it is healed.
And if not, then there is no other way than to reduce the fissure to the shape of the nose, and according to this manner: that is, you uncover the second bone with an iron or with a sharp medicine, and when the bone is uncovered, then you take a rasp according to this form:
Let the extremity of the iron be triangular, and let its shaft be slender, tapering to the extremity, like this. (The final phrase implies a diagram would accompany this instruction)
And then place that upon the bone, and let that be near the lacrimal bone; and move your hand a little from the eye, and then rotate your hand with the rasp until it penetrates all the bone, and the patient will feel it because they will feel the air escaping when you move your hand.
Then restore the place with styptic and drying medicines, as you have been taught.
Then, when the flesh has grown and the place has hardened, the matter which flowed to the outside parts returns to the nose, therefore this is easier for the patient.
Chapter 20.
Concerning the reduction of the protrusion of the eye.
When the eye protrudes completely and is not injured by a wound or diminution, then it is necessary to relax the patient, and then to observe him, and then to apply cupping glasses to the neck without scarification and suction for good evacuation; and then apply to the eye an ointment which is made of acathus, aloe, incense, and sarcocolla, and then firmly apply the plaster to the eye with many powders.
And the manner of the powders is that you take many lion cloths, and each cloth should be folded into four layers; and make many of these.
And then place those one on top of the other according to the amount that the eye needs. And then bind tightly over these with a strong cloth with firm pressure; and repeat the cupping with suction without scarification; and then remove the cupping glasses and leave the eye tightly bound day and night.
But if meanwhile the ligament is softened, then it is necessary that it be very tight.
And then remove the bandage day and night, as we have said.
And if you see the eye already reduced, it is good; and if not, then repeat the plaster with the powders and the binding and the cupping until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Concerning the incision of the prominence of the uvea tunic.  (or: Of the incision of the swelling of the uveal coat)
When there is a rupture in the uvea tunic, and it is prominent and protrudes beyond the eyelids like a grape, and the man's form is disfigured by this, and you want to incise it, then the operation is as we have recounted: that you insert the needle into the root of the uvea from below to above, and then place another needle with double thread from the lacrimal side, and make that penetrate and leave the first needle according to its position; and then incise the place of the double thread and lift with that the part of the uvea in the circle of the needle, and tighten it strongly.
And then remove the needle and place on the eye wool infused in egg white and allow the thread to adhere to the uvea.
And then treat the eye with something that strengthens it until the wound is healed.
And sometimes collect from all sides with a circle of cloth the greatly swollen prominence within the eye, and then it should be pierced with a fine spatula that reaches the pupil of the eye, and drains the albuminous moisture, and the eye descends and enters immediately.
And then tighten it until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of alconati (likely a type of eye condition or injury).
This illness, which is called alconati, is nothing but a humor which is located in the eye similar to descending water, but it is not that.
But the manner of working on it is that you make the patient sit on a prepared and straight seat, and then take his head in your hands on both sides and gently move it until you see the humor come to the lower parts, and then it should be dried and not descend, and light should be avoided, and the patient should see things as he used to see.
And if it does not descend downwards, know that it is water.
But if the descent of the humor is not prepared with what we have said, then make the patient sit between your hands and then take a thin spatula and use it on the panniculus, wiping a little below the juncture of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the iris (towards the empty space), until the humor is expelled.
Then, when it is expelled, you instill warm water into the eye in which you have mixed honey, or water in which you have previously boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then let it be treated with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 22.
On the treatment of the water descending from the eye.
We have already described the types of water in the division and which ones should be punctured, explaining this according to their nature.  Then, that which follows [is for] healing.
Then it is necessary that you make the patient sit between your hands on a square [cushion] and bind his/her healthy eye, tying it firmly.
And then place your left hand near the eyelid of his/her eye, if the eye in which the water is located is the left eye; or with your right hand, if the eye is the right one.
And then with your right hand take an almond, if the eye is the left one; or with your left hand, if the eye is the right one.
And then place the end of the almond near the cornea, along the width of a ray, in the white of the eye on the side of the smaller lachrymal duct, and then push the almond gently and roll your hand with it.
And then penetrate into the white of the eye and feel that the almond has already reached the empty space/cavity.
And it should be that the distance of the almond to the pupil is the measure of the space which is from the pupil to the edge of the blackness, and that is the cornea of the eye; for you will see with that pupil with the vision of the eye through the clarity of the corneal tunic.
And then place the almond into the place where the water is, and then you draw it down one time then another, and then if the water descends immediately, then the patient sees that upon which his vision fell immediately, and the almond in his eye.
And then rest a little; then if the water has descended, then you remove it another time before the almond is expelled.
And then when it is dried and does not descend, then you extract the almond with ease, and gently rub it with your hand, and then dissolve a little clear rock salt in the water and with that wash the eye inside; and then place outside the eye cotton or tow or wool infused in rose oil and egg white and bind the eye with this.
But we and those of our time place over it, as crushed, with egg white.
And if the almond does not obey you upon entering the eye because of its hardness — for there are some men whose eye is very hard — then it is necessary that you take the instrument which is called alberid, of which this is the form:
And then perforate that joint with that [instrument], and do not insert your finger into the hole, but only make a subtle pathway for the almond.
And then introduce the almond as we have said.
And for the completion of your work, let a darkened, comfortable sleeping place be prepared for the patient, where he may sleep on his back, and all movement should be forbidden.
And position him in such a way that his body is aligned, and he does not turn his head to the right or left at all.
And let the healing occur according to its disposition within three days.
And then, release him from that dark room and expose him to gentle light, show him some things, and then return him to the treatment by the seventh day.
And it is not fitting that you do this at the hour of treatments or immediately after the infusion. Having said this, you must avoid this because the water can easily, by a great and vehement gaze,  [cause harm/be affected].  (The last part is difficult to translate precisely without more context.  The meaning hinges on what "reguardament" refers to here - likely some kind of intense observation or focus.)
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you must open the wound before the seventh day and treat it with something that reduces the abscess.
Then you blindfold him and place over his face a cloth through which his vision is regulated, leaving him for some days in the darkest room.
And then let him be moved from that room gradually and converse about his affairs.
And know that in this case the student is not excused from seeing some things, and then you should be bold in the operation.
And it has come to us from some of those who are in Artach, and some say that a fire was made in the Ayrac magdaam, a perforated place through which water was sucked.  (Note: "Artach" and "Ayrac magdaam" are likely place names or specialized equipment/locations, and their exact meaning is unclear without further context.)
However, I have not seen anyone in our land who has perfected this, nor have I read about it in any of the books of the ancients; and it is possible that this is new.
And these are the forms of the types of magdaam, so that he who is ignorant of them may know them:
And they should be made of bronze or iron specifically, and their ends should be made with this triangular subtlety, the sharp end like this, which is the form.
Chapter 24.
On the treatment of rotten flesh in the nose.
When in the nose various fleshy growths are born, of which some are similar to a very small scorpion, or to a polyp fish; and this illness is called polyp, for it resembles that fish in appearance. And from it is cancerous flesh, spreading, of a dark color; and from it is flesh that is not dark-colored, a lion's flesh.
Therefore, in that which is in these fleshy growths that is not cancerous or malignant, you should make the patient sit between your hands and place him in the sun, open his nostrils, and prick the growths with your nail. Then extract it outwards, and then incise what you have grasped of it with a thin, sharp spatula from one side until you know that all the flesh has been removed; for if any part remains from which excision is possible, then you scrape it with one of the fine instruments easily until nothing remains. But if it bleeds profusely or is a hot, festering abscess, then apply what is necessary; or if it is one of the malignant abscesses, then you incise and cauterize it until the bleeding is stopped and all the cavities are removed.
Then, near the incision, let there be poured into the nose, sharp wine and water or wine. But if the nose is open and a moisture flows from it into the palate, then know that it is healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that inside there is flesh corrupted in the deep bones of the nose to which excision has not reached.
Then it is necessary to introduce a linen thread, to which some thickness is added, and tie many knots in it, placing between each knot the quantity of a finger or less, and then instruct the patient and introduce one end of the thread into the nose with a rod or any other instrument that is possible for him.
And after that is done, let him draw in its scent until it reaches the nasal passages, and it comes out through the throat, because often children in schools do something similar to this action, and it is an easy thing for anyone who wants to do it.
Then place the two ends of the thread, one end coming out of the nose and the other remaining in the nose, and then administer a mixture of ground meat with the knots that are on the thread, and do this until you know that the flesh is now with the knots of the thread.
Then remove the thread, and place a poultice near the extraction of blood in the nose, and do this for three days or more until the ointment corrodes all that is rotten in the flesh.
Finally, at the end of the treatment, place a lead cannula in the nose for a few days until it is healed.
But if you need a more drying cure, use that one.
And this is the form of the instrument, a head-purger, with which oils and medicines are distilled into the nostrils:
And make this of silver or bronze, which should resemble a small open lamp, like a small shell, and the opening similarly.
And if you wish, make a closed cannula like a tube, and the cannula of the head-purging instrument should be flat and open; to which there should be a handle at the back, with which you hold it when you heat the oil or water that you want from the juices and the extractable substances.
Chapter 25.
Of the boils that grow in the extremities of the nose.
Many times a boil grows in the extremities of the nose, and it is magnified and increased in a few days, to the point that it is easily observed.
And for this it is necessary that you incise it at the beginning of its appearance, and eradicate it entirely. And then place on the location either a cautery or a burning medicine which will stay in place.
But if its incision is delayed until it is magnified, then consider if it is hardened, firm, of a dark color, and with little feeling; then do not touch it with iron, for it is a cancerous abscess; for many times he who incises this abscess suffers great harm from it,  the one who had it.
And if the abscess is of a light touch and not of dark color, and sometimes incision is possible throughout, then evacuate the patient and incise it without fear, and treat the place with something that dries and constricts until it is healed.
Chapter 26.
Chapter 26. Of the suturing of the nose, lips, and ear when their continuity is broken by a wound or similar injury.
Know that when an accidental discontinuity occurs in one of these cartilages, you should put little confidence in that operation except in certain men.
Therefore, when such a thing happens to someone, consider if it is a fresh wound with its blood, and then you should align the two lips of the wound with sutures, and then treat it until it is healed.
And if the lips of the discontinuity are already separated, and each is healed, then you must scrape away each part of its apparent surface until blood appears. Then align the two lips with sutures and tighten them, and over them sprinkle dragon's blood and crushed herbs, and place over the powder a piece of diachylon plaster, or some other of the consolidating plasters, and leave it bound for two or three days, and then unbind it and change the plaster and leave it until the stitches are naturally dissolved; then treat with ointment until it is healed.
But the manner of suturing is that you close the discontinuity either with needles, as we have recounted in the suturing of the abdomen, or close the discontinuity with thread, as has been shown to you.
Chapter 27.
Of the extraction of those things that come between the two lips in the inner parts.
Often there appear in the inner parts of the lips of many men certain hard abscesses resembling kernels, and some of them are smaller and some are larger.
Therefore it is necessary that you separate the lips and feel each of those hardnesses on all sides, and then, after the excision, fill the place with crushed sage until the bleeding is stopped, and then let it be washed with sharp wine and the place be treated with something that is styptic, until it is healed.
Chapter 28.
Of the incision of the flesh attached to the gums.
Very often a growth appears on the gum, flesh attached which the ancients called an albulus; then it is necessary that you suspend it with a hook or hold it with forceps and incise it to its root, and let the pus or blood flow.
And then place on the area crushed sage or other styptic or drying powders.
And if that flesh returns, then incise it a second time, and cauterize it, for after cauterization it will not return.
Chapter 29.
Concerning the treatment of teeth with iron.
When on the surface of the teeth, both inner and outer parts, and between the gums, rough, loose, and sometimes blackened crusts are attached, and they become citrine or green, causing corruption to the gum and making the teeth loose.
And then you should make the patient sit between your hands, and rest his head on your lap, and scrape the teeth on which those crusts and similar things appear, like sand, until nothing remains of them, removing the blackness, the yellowness, and the others until they are cleaned.
Then, if this (cleaning) has removed what was mentioned at the beginning of the treatment, it is good; but if not, then you repeat the treatment on them on the next day, and the second, and the third, until you reach the desired final result.
And know that teeth require many scrapers of diverse shapes and forms, according to what is prepared for your operation. And because the scraper with which the tooth is scraped on the inner part is different from the scraper with which it is scraped between the teeth, according to other forms; and these forms of scrapers should be prepared by you, which you will see immediately:
Chapter 30.
On the extraction of teeth.
That you cure the tooth of its pain with all skill and delay its extraction, for there is no cause that supplants its function when it is extracted, for it is a sublime substance, wherefore its extraction is excusable.
But when the patient is forced to have that tooth extracted, you must be firmly certain which tooth is aching, for many times the pain deceives the patient and he thinks it is in a healthy tooth, and you extract that one, and then the pain does not cease until the diseased and aching tooth is extracted, for we have already seen this through the operations of barbers.
Therefore, when you are certain which tooth is aching, and you know it well, then you should scarify around the tooth with a spatula in which there is some virtue, until it is loosened from the gum on all sides, and then remove it with your fingers, or with fine forceps, beginning little by little until it is completely loose.
And then apply strong, large forceps for good traction or firm grip, and place the patient's head between your knees so that you hold him well and he does not move, and then pull the tooth straight in such a way that you do not break it, nor cause the patient greater pain.
And then, if it is not dislodged, then take one of those instruments, and place it under it on all sides with ease, and force its removal in the same way as was done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is cracked or decayed, then you should fill that crack with a cloth and bind it with the end of a thin rod so that it is not broken at the time of your tightening around it with forceps.
And you must open carefully with scarification around all parts of the gum and watch your strength so that you do not break it and a part of it remains, and return to the patient because the pain may be greater than the first pain.
And beware that you do not do what some ignorant barbers do in their haste and boldness concerning the extraction of teeth, without administering what we have recommended; for many times they cause great diseases in men which are more difficult to cure, and their roots remain, all or some of them, or that they extract it with some bones of the jaw, as we have often witnessed.
And then, after its extraction, the mouth should be washed with hot wine or sour wine with salt.
And if bleeding occurs from this, as often happens, then crush some quantity of alum and sprinkle it on the wound, and if this alum does not help, cauterize.
The shape of the forceps and fine tongs with which the tooth is grasped at the beginning should be of long extremity, short and thick handle, so that they do not bend when you work with them.
And let them be like tongs with a thick handle so that when you squeeze with them they are not bent; let the ends be short.
And let them be made of Indian iron, precisely made with straight ends, and at the ends of these let there be teeth, of which one enters into the other and tightens by strong constriction, and sometimes the ends of these should be in the shape of the beak of a bird called a *ciconia* (that is, a stork), and they are of strong constriction.
Chapter 31.
Of the eradication of teeth and the extraction of broken jaw bones.
When you must eradicate a tooth which is broken and some cause remains, then you must apply a poultice to the area for a day or two until the area is softened; and then introduce pincers or forceps, the ends of which are similar to the beak of a bird called a *ciconia* or stork, the shape of forceps:
Let their ends be made like a file or rasp.
And if it does not yield to you thus with these forceps or pincers, then you must dig around the root and scrape away all the flesh and introduce the instrument which is called an *atali*, that is, a small lever, of which the form is this:
And let it be of short, somewhat thick extremity, and let it not be bent so that it is not broken.
Therefore, if by this the root is removed, it is good; and if not, help yourself with these other instruments of which these are the forms: the form of the first instrument is a triangular end in which there is some thickness:
The form of the second instrument is that it should be triangular and of a more slender end.
And then you are aided by this instrument having two branches, of which this is the form, approximately the following: and with other instruments which precede in tooth scraping; for the work is easily done with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, and this is the form:
of the triangular, curved or short end, which should have some thickness, and not be bent so that it is not broken.
And also know that the instruments for loose teeth are similar to the other instruments.
But the wise and subtle artisan in the art finds for himself, according to what the operation and the diverse diseases signify to him; for there are diseases for which the ancients did not name or provide a proper instrument, because of the forms of diverse types.
But if the bone of the jaw or of the other bones of the mouth is broken, or if it is possible, then it should be treated in its place with what is convenient for it from among the instruments and forceps which we have mentioned in the extraction of the roots of the teeth, and help yourself with a splint of which this is the form:
And let there be some thickness in it little by little, and let it be tightened or held with the mouth so that it does not escape or flee until the bone is completely set; and then restore the place with medicines suitable for this.
But if there is a small rottenness in the bone, then scrape away that rottenness and its blackness, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 32.
Concerning the treatment of teeth that protrude above the others.
When teeth are prominent, not according to their natural course, their shape is flawed, and especially when this happens to women, and especially to venerable old women; then you must consider: if a tooth is next to another tooth, and closure or alignment is not possible, then extract it; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then you incise it with an instrument of which this is the shape; and it is similar to a boar's tusk, and it should be made of Indian iron with a very sharp point.
And let your incision, with which you incise it, be made in several days because of the hardness of the tooth, so that no other tooth is injured.
And if it is a prominent tooth suitable for filing, then file it with an Indian iron file of which this is the shape:
And let the whole thing be of Indian iron and very carefully ground; and let it have very fine points, like a file with which needles are made, with which the tooth is filed little by little over many days with ease, so that no other tooth is damaged or broken. Then smooth it at the end, and scrape it with some scrapers.
And if it is a tooth of which a part is broken and injures the tongue, then it is necessary that you file it until the roughness of that fracture is removed and smoothed, and it is filled so that the tongue is not injured, nor the speech impaired.
Chapter 33.
Of the restoration of damaged teeth with gold or silver wire.
When the front teeth suffer concussion and loosening due to a blow or a fall, and the patient cannot bite on what he eats, and you have treated it with styptic medicines, and your treatment has been ineffective, then, so that they do not fall out, contrive that they are fastened with gold wire and not silver, because silver turns green and quickly powders after a few days, but gold is never changed.
And let the wire be of such fineness and thickness according to the quantity that can fit between the teeth; and the manner of the binding is that you take the wire and pass the double of it between two healthy teeth, and then let it grow with two turns of the wire between two damaged ones, or if one or several, until the thread reaches the healthy tooth on the other side. Then repeat the weaving to the point where you began, and tighten with your hand gently and skillfully until it is firm.
And let your tightening, with which you fasten the wire, be such that it does not slip from the roots of the teeth.
Then cut off the superfluous ends of the wire with forceps or scissors, and smooth those ends in each place with a file, and fold them over and hide them between the healthy tooth and the damaged tooth, so that they do not injure the tongue. And then leave it thus tightened until it heals.
But if it is loosened or broken, tighten it or them with another wire in the same manner at all times.
And this is the form of the teeth and the arrangement of two healthy teeth and two damaged teeth, as you see them tied together:
And when it is done that one or two teeth are returned to their proper places, and they are grown back as we have recommended, and that they remain fixed.
And this is only done by good and skilled craftsmen.
And sometimes some cow bone is adapted, and it is shaped like a tooth, and it is placed in the place where the tooth is missing, and it is secured as we have said, and it remains and serves for a long time.
Chapter 34.
Concerning the incision of the ligament which is in the tongue and prevents speech.
This ligament, which is under the tongue, is sometimes natural, with which one is born, or accidental and occurs due to a wound which has already healed.
And the operation on him is that you open the patient's mouth, their head being in your lap; and lift their tongue, and then incise that nervous ligament according to its width until the tongue is freed from its constraint.
But if in that [area] there is any hardness or knot, and this is due to the healing of a wound, then you make an incision and cut that across its width until you have incised the ligament and the knot is dissolved.
And be careful that no fissure is made in the depth of the flesh and that you do not cut too deeply and cause a flow of blood.
And then wash the site of the incision with warm water or with vinegar or with cold water; and then place under the tongue a linen cloth; that is, a small cloth which the patient keeps under the tongue each night so that it does not heal again.
But if bleeding occurs, place crushed vitriol on the area; but if the bleeding persists, then cauterize the area with a lancet-shaped cautery which is suitable for this. And then treat it with the other remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 35.
On the extraction of a ranula from under the tongue.
Sometimes an abscess resembling a small tumor occurs under the tongue, preventing the tongue from its natural function; and it is quickly enlarged until it fills the mouth.
And the operation is that you open the patient's mouth, sitting before the sun, and examine the abscess.
And if you see it is dark or black, hard, and the patient feels no sensation in it, then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
And if it is tending towards white, and moist, then you place the lancet there, and incise it with a fine instrument, and incise it on all sides; and if blood flows during your operation, then you place crushed vitriol upon it until the bleeding is stopped.
Then return to your work until you have completely removed it, until it is washed with verjuice and salt; and treat it with the other cures for this until it is healed.
Chapter 36.
Concerning the extraction of an abscess from the two ears and of that which is situated in the throat and of other abscesses.
When a goiter develops in the throat, these are glands that are gathered together like cotton, which protrude outwardly and are called two ears; when you treat them with what we have said in the division and it is not healed, then you consider if the abscess is hard, of dark color, with little feeling, then do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is thick, then do not touch it with iron because of the flow of blood; rather, let it mature, and then either you will extract it, or it will break open by itself.
And if it is white, soft, and its root is thin, then it is one that should be incised.
And the operation on it is that you consider, before your operation, whether the abscess has already matured completely through rest or if it has diminished somewhat; and then make the patient sit before the sun, and their head should be in your lap, and open their mouth, and the servant, taking it between their hands, presses the patient's tongue down with a very fine instrument of which this is the form:
And let it be made of silver or brass, and let it be as thin as a knife.
Then, as you press the tongue with that and the abscess is shown to you, and you have gazed upon it, then take an onion and put it in the abscess, and pull it outwards as much as you can. Furthermore, if you pull out some matter from the tunics (layers of tissue), then immediately incise it with an instrument of which this is the form:
Furthermore, if you pull out some matter from the tunics (layers of tissue), then immediately incise it with an instrument of which this is the form: and it is similar to forceps, however its ends are curved, so that the opening of each is opposite the other, very sharp, which should be made of tempered iron.
But if this instrument is not at hand, then incise it with a spatula of which this is the form: And let it be sharp on one side, not sharp on the other.
And after you have incised one side, incise the other in the same manner, and immediately after the incision, let the patient gargle with cold water.
But if there is a flow of blood, let him gargle with a decoction of pomegranate rind or myrtle leaves and similar styptic substances until the flow of blood is restrained, and immediately treat it until it is healed.
And sometimes other abscesses appear in the throat besides those two [already mentioned], and incise those as I have said in the incision of the two sides equally.
And I myself once treated a woman with an abscess which had formed in her throat, which abscess was tending towards a dark color, with little feeling, which had already closed her throat, and the woman breathed with a narrow passage, and I had already forbidden her food and drink of water, and she was close to death if she had lasted for a day or two more.
And the abscess had grown so much that it had formed two points from which it emerged through two openings.
Therefore I treated it with a fistula and inserted an instrument into one of the openings, and I pulled it, and a large portion was extracted from it, and immediately I incised it from where I understood the other opening was, and immediately I opened its mouth, and compressed its tongue, and immediately I inserted the instrument into that abscess.
And immediately I excised a large part of it, and only a little blood flowed from it. Therefore the throat of that woman was freed, and she immediately began to drink water, and soon she took food.  Therefore I did not cease to incise that abscess many times over a long period, and another abscess succeeded it in that place, which I incised until it was completely removed.
Then I took hold of it and cauterized her throat; thus it was stopped. And immediately I walked around and did not know what God had done regarding me in this.
Chapter 37.
On the incision of a wen when it is abscessed.
When catarrh descends to the uvula, and it is abscessed and long, then it is called a perpendicular [abscess]; and if it is thick and round in the lower part, then it is called a bubo.
But when it is cured with what we have said in the division, and your cure does not succeed, and you see that the cauterized abscess is still present and is subtle, then you should incise what has grown round; and if it is of that length, and is bloody, of a dark color or black, and there is no feeling in it, then you should attempt its incision, for in that there is danger to the patient.
And when you see it according to the manner I have described, in its whiteness and length, make the patient sit and press down his tongue with an instrument that suits its shape, and then insert the incision in the uvula and pull it down and incise it with one of the two instruments which are described in the incision of the tonsils.
And you should not incise it except what is exactly within the natural limit without addition, for if you incise more, you will injure his speech.
And for the incision, use what we have recommended in the incision of the tonsils, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the patient is frightened by the incision, you should use skill in cauterizing him without causing fear, and the method of cauterization is only with a sharp instrument; you should place the patient's head on your lap, and then press down his tongue with the instrument we have mentioned, and then take the liquid which we have mentioned in the chapter on cauterization, and apply it with that live coal, and do not apply it thickly or thinly, and with that fill the concavity of the instrument which has this shape:
Let the extremity of it be concave, in which the medicine is placed, like the concavity of a spoon, and place the instrument with the medicine on the uvula, and let the patient lie on his side so that the saliva or mucus from his mouth flows out because of the internally applied medicine, so that nothing of it descends on his throat and harms him.
And then take your hand with the medicine, and press it on the uvula for the space of half an hour until you see it become blackened and dried by the action of the medicine.
And if you wish, take cotton and wrap it around the end of the spoon, and submerge the cotton in the medicine, and introduce the spoon with the cotton in a cannula from above so that the cotton adheres to that cannula, and do this as many times as is necessary until you achieve what you want from the cauterization of the uvula, and then leave it because it will dry and fall off after three or four days.
And if you judge it necessary to repeat the medicine, repeat it, and after the cauterization, wipe the area around the uvula with cotton soaked in wine, and cleanse with it what remains around it from the medicine, and let it be washed with cold water, and let it be treated externally with an embrocation, and internally with gargles until it is healed.
And this type of treatment is safer than incision and less frightening.
Sometimes the uvula is cured with a method more subtle than cautery or incision, for it is cured with fumigation in this manner: take calamint, hyssop, oregano, rue, Arabic gum, chamomile,  [and] similar herbs, and mix all these ingredients, or some of them, in a pot, and let them be submerged in sour wine and boiled; and let the pot be well sealed with a suitable lid, and let there be a hole in the middle of the pot, over which a concave brass instrument is placed in this manner; it should be made of silver or brass.
And let the end [of the instrument] be inserted into the patient's mouth so that the vapor may reach the uvula through the cannula, until the uvula is sufficiently fumigated.
And then repeat this several times until it is dry, and be careful not to perform this treatment at the beginning of the appearance of an abscess, for it would increase the abscess too much, and you should not do this, but rather cauterize the inflamed area of the abscess.
But if you do not have this instrument at hand, then take a reed and attach a broken eggshell to the end of it, so that the patient's mouth is protected, because the eggshell prevents the vapor from burning the mouth.
And this treatment is good for health.
Chapter 38.
Concerning the extraction of thorns and that which adheres in the throat and of other causes.
Many times something adheres to the throat, such as a fishbone or some other thing.
Then it is necessary that you extract that which is apparent of those things, upon which your sight falls, after you have pressed the tongue with an instrument before the sunlight, so that that which is in the throat may be revealed to you.
And that which does not appear and is hidden from you in the throat, you must make the patient vomit before the food is digested in the stomach, for very quickly the thing attached to the throat will be expelled by vomiting; or let the patient swallow a piece of turnip or lettuce root, or a piece of dry bread; or take a piece of dried sea sponge, bind it firmly with thread, and then let the patient swallow it, for when it reaches the place where the thorns are, it will extract them and they will be expelled. And moreover, take an eel, bind it with thread, and let it be put inside and quickly extracted; or take a leek and quickly insert it and quickly draw it out.
But if it is not expelled by those methods which we have mentioned, then use a lead instrument according to this form:
And let it be thicker than a small root, and at its end let there be a concavity which you may easily introduce into his throat.
And let him have his head raised up, and beware of touching his throat bone, so that it may happen to him, with that [instrument], to push the bone or thorn, or that the physician does it with his hand.
But however, it is better that the patient himself introduces it, because of his knowledge of the location of the attached cause, and pushes downwards, and pulls his hand with the instrument upwards, all this according to the amount which is prepared for him until it is expelled.
Chapter 39.
On the extraction of a leech attached to the throat.
When a leech is medicated with what we have said in the division of treatment with medicines and it does not come off, then consider it in the patient's throat in the sun, after you have compressed his tongue with the instrument which we have recommended to you.
Then, if you see the leech, extract it with a small hook or with delicate, gentle movements.
And if it is not possible for you to extract it with that, then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat, and then place a heated iron in the concavity of the cannula, and do this as many times (until the leech is dead and detaches itself from the throat), and abstain the patient from all water that day.
Then take a vial full of cold water, and open his mouth into it, and wash the mouth with it; and do not swallow anything from it, and stir the water from time to time with your hand, because the leech, as soon as it feels the water, falls off.
But if it is not expelled by what we have recommended, then fumigate the patient with cyperus or with asafoetida using the instrument which we have recommended in the fumigation of the uvula.
Do this, so that it will fall out.
And another method of operation in the fumigation of it, is that you take a pot in which there are ignited coals, and the pot is covered with a cover in the middle of which is a hole, and the end of the instrument is fitted into that hole; and then let the fumigation come from above; and let the patient put his mouth to the end of the cannula, and close his mouth so that the fumigation is not expelled until you know that the fumigation has reached the leech, for the leech will immediately fall out.
And if it does not fall out, then you repeat the fumigation many times, and abstain the patient from drinking, and eating salty things and garlic, and do not drink water, and thus it is necessary that with this regimen it will be expelled.
And this is the form of the instrument with which a leech is extracted from the throat when it is seen; and it is similar to forceps like those sometimes used, except that it has a certain curvature in it: which is placed in the throat, and its end is similar to a stork's beak, which is hollow, in which there is a roughening of the file, so that, when it grasps something, it does not let go.
Chapter 40.
In which is the sum of the discourse concerning the opening of abscesses and their incision.
Abscesses are of many species, of many types, as you will remember from their description, of each one in this book.
And they are diverse in their perforation and incision in two ways, of which one is by the type of abscess itself; and because of what we understand of the humors.
And the second way is according to the locations in which they occur in the body, for an abscess occurring in the head is different from an abscess occurring in the buttocks; and an abscess in a fleshy place is different from an abscess occurring in a joint; and each has its own judgment for operation.
And moreover, there are some abscesses which should not be perforated except near maturation of the pus within them or their completion.
There are other abscesses which should be opened when they are raw and not matured according to their completion, such as abscesses that are near the joints, because an abscess when it is near a joint, its being is prolonged until that which is in its circumference is digested, and very quickly the ligaments or nerves of that joint are corrupted, wherefore the cause of contraction of that member is made; or it is an abscess near a principal member, and if you delay its perforation until it is matured, it will harm the principal member; or it is near the buttock, therefore perforate it even if not matured; and you should not perforate it raw, of incomplete digestion, except that which is near the buttock, so that the pus of it may not spread and be elongated to the inner parts of the buttock, and a fistula be made, or that it be made in its term that it may not be healed. But you must know the time of the perforation of the abscess, and this is when it is matured.
And know that it is matured when there is a lessening of the pain and the cessation of the fever, and also the diminution of the redness and of the pulsation, and the acuteness of the head of the abscess, and the other signs.
And because it is necessary that you know that the perforation falls in the place most below the abscess and from the pus coming from the healing of the eminence.
And the perforation should always be along the length of the flesh or of the body, if the abscesses are in the parts of the hands or of the feet, and away from the tendons, the cords of the nerves, the arteries; and finally, in all equal places in which there is no reflection; because in those that are reflected, use perforation according to that member.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy place, then it is better that you delay its perforation until its digestion is completed according to what we have said; for if you perforate it before that, the course of its pus and much filth is prolonged, and quickly its lips are hardened and its depth increased.
But some abscesses are perforated according to the width of the flesh or body due to necessity, or according to what the member requires.
And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small abscesses, and in large abscesses a large and wide perforation, or many incisions, according to the diversity of the size of the abscesses.
And others are abscesses in which it is necessary that the skin be incised and hollowed out when it is made like bread and is ripe, as happens in cases of swellings and buboes.
And some of those are incised with a three-angled incision; and others are incised in the shape of a myrtle leaf, like the abscesses of the armpits.
And there are those in which a round incision and a lunar incision are administered, and similar ones.
But that which is not like the aforementioned superficial abscesses, you must perforate with only a superficial or flat perforation.
And when the abscess is large and has collected much pus, you must perforate it, and do not worry about extracting all the pus at that time; having extracted some of it, then pack the abscess until the next day, and then extract a larger portion, and then do this many times according to its degree until it is all discharged.
And especially if the patient is of weak constitution, or a pregnant woman, or a small child, or an elderly person in a weakened state, because the vital spirit is often depleted with the discharge of pus, and the patient dies very easily, and you must operate carefully on them.
Therefore, observe this chapter with great caution, and concerning your perforation in which you perforate these abscesses, you must clean the wounds and consider whether the wound of the abscess is small, or a flat incision; then you administer lint or old linen to it; and if the abscess is large, and the fissures of the perforation are many, then you must place a wick in each opening until they unite.
And if a part of the skin is excised in the abscess or you have hollowed it out in the circumference, then you must fill it with old linen or thread made from linen cloth, as when you have extracted splinters or roots, without moisture; and tighten it until the third day; and then proceed and treat it with the ointments that are necessary until it is healed.
But if bleeding occurs during your operation, then apply cold water and sour wine in which you soak a linen cloth, and apply this to the bleeding area many times.
But if the bleeding persists, then you must administer the treatment and cure and powders which I have recommended in many places in this our book and division.
But if it is winter, and the location of the abscess is a place of many nerves, then you should mix powders in hot wine and oil, and apply those to the areas.
And if it is summer, and the areas are fleshy, then you should apply powders soaked in water and oil or in wine and oil, and all this should be cold until the third day, as we have said, and then you should open the abscess and cleanse it and administer to its treatment what is suitable for it until it is healed.
And this is what is necessary for the knowledge of the treatment of abscesses universally, but according to the way of distinction I have already discussed each abscess and how to treat it in specific chapters.
Chapter 41.
Concerning the incision of abscesses which appear on the back of the head.
On the back of the head, small abscesses are found, a kind of nodes containing membranes in their composition; and their appearance is varied.
And some are purulent, and those contain a moisture similar to slime. And some contain a moisture resembling dust, and similar to them; and some are stony, hard.
And in the incision of all, and in the extraction of those, there is no fear, since the extraction of them does not cause contrary effects.
And the operation in the incision of these is that you probe them with an instrument whose shape is appropriate for this, which is called a probe, until you know what it contains.
For if what it contains is moisture, then incise it lengthwise with a superficial incision according to this form:
And begin the incision from line B to line G. Then, when the moisture is evacuated, you scrape away the skin that contained that moisture, and do not leave any of it at all, for often it returns if any of it remains.
And then immerse cotton in Egyptian ointment, if it is available, and if not, in salt water; and fill the wound with it and leave it there until the next day, for in this way you corrode all that remains of that film.
And then apply the cotton with Egyptian ointment a second and third time if it is needed, until you are confident that there is no trace remaining of that film; then treat the wound with ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess contains fatty nodules, then you incise it according to this form: with an incision in the shape of a cross, and insert forceps between the two lips of the incision and scrape it from every part, and exert your strength in extracting the membrane which contains it.
But if the arrow causes resistance, then do what I have recounted to you first.
And similarly, treat a petrified abscess with incision and cure as we have told you; and incision on a petrified abscess is easier, because it has little blood and little moisture.
And sometimes some of these abscesses, which are in the head in some men, have no moisture at all; the reason is that I incised an abscess on the head of an old woman and found the abscess like a dull, rough, white stone, which could not be cut, and if anyone were struck with it, it would hurt them.
But in other accidental abscesses in the head other than this one, this is not the chapter, such as the abscesses that occur on the heads of children and behind the roots of the ears, but the incision of all these should be a superficial incision.
And make the perforation of those in the lowest part of them so that the body may be relieved of the pus in the lowest parts.
And then treat those with what is appropriate for that cure.
Chapter 42.
Chapter 42. Of the incision of scrophulas which happen in the neck.
Often these abscesses occur in the neck and in the armpits and in the groin; and sometimes they happen in other parts of the body.
And those which happen in the neck, and many are generated among them, and every scrofula of these is within its own tunic, and thus as in the nodes and abscesses of the head, as we have recounted.
And the types of these scrofulas are many, for of these some are stony, and of these some contain humidity, and of these some are malignant which do not obey cure.
Therefore, in that which you see of good disposition on palpation, of which the color that is manifest is close to the color of the flesh, and is soft in every part, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the veins, nor to the artery, and is not deep, it is necessary that you incise it with a superficial incision from the upper part to the lower part of the body, from line G to line B, and scrape it from every part, and extend the lips of the flesh with hooks, or with many hooks if you have need of them, as we have said in the abscesses of the head, and extract it little by little.
And it is most important that the vein or nerve not be incised.
And let the instrument not be too sharp, lest it cause you to injure your hand with the incision, or that it disturb the patient, and that you incise what is not necessary to incise; for if you should incise a vein or artery and prohibit yourself from your operation, then place on the wound crushed vitriol or other powders which stop the flow of blood, and bind the wound, and leave it until the acuteness of the abscess subsides and the wound becomes softened and begins to be suppurated. When the blood is cut off.
Then return to your operation until you have completed it.
And then inquire with your finger if there is any cause of other small scrofulas, then incise those and cleanse them.
And if there is a large vein at the root of the scrofula, it is necessary then that you not incise that scrofula at its root. Beforehand, it is necessary that you tie it with strong doubled thread and that you leave it until it falls off by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old linen which you have already submerged in Egyptian ointment, and then care for it.
And if you incise the entire scrofula, then it is necessary that you adjust the two lips of the wound and suture it immediately, so that no superfluity remains.  (The "2" after *cuzas* likely indicates a footnote or a variant spelling/word.)
But if you see that superfluity remains because of the size of the scrofula, it is necessary that you intend to incise the root of it, and extract it, and administer suture and that which is said [above].
And that scrofula which contains humidity, perforate it with a superficial perforation where the place of its maturation appears to you, and place the perforation so that it is at the lowest part of the body, as we have said.
Then administer a perforation, perhaps with ointment and similar things, so that it corrodes that which remains of the corruption. And then, when you see the wound already cleansed, then you cure it with a flesh-generating ointment until it is healed.
Chapter 43.
Concerning the incision of the abscess accidentally occurring within the throat.
The ancients described this incision in the throat, but no one in our land has been seen to have performed it.
And this is the writing/inscription/account of the speech/discourse of those (people/doctors).
But in men having a quinsy, the extraction from the throat must be avoided, because no benefit is gained thereby, since all the veins and the major ones of the patient are there.
But in those who have abscesses located in the mouth or throat or both ears, when the illness is not in the windpipe, it is necessary to use the incision of the throat to avoid the loss which is made by perforation.
Therefore, when we want to do this, we should incise the throat below three circles of the throat's circles, or four with a small incision in width in the space between two circles, such that the incision is in the membrane, not in the cartilage. And this place is suitable for the incision, because it is devoid of flesh and its blood vessels are distant.
And if the physician is timid, then he should extend the throat membrane with a hook, and then cut the membrane until he reaches the pipe/canal, but he should avoid the blood vessels if he sees any of those.
And then incise the membrane as we have recounted; and the incision of the windpipe is indicated by the flame which emerges from it with what is broken from it and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
Then, since the time is critical in which perforation is feared, bring together the two lips of the wound's membrane, and sew that only without the cartilage.
And then administer medicines that cause the flesh to grow until it is healed.
And Albucasis says that the summary of the discourse which we have recounted, the exposition is nothing other than to see that some of these abscesses have already obstructed the throat of the patient, and the patient has come close to death, and his breath is cut off, and some proceed to incise the epiglottis so that the patient breathes through the wound for some respiration, and is saved from death.
And for that reason I order the wound to be left open until the malignancy of the illness is consumed; and its malignancy lasts for three days; and then at that time I order the wound to be sewn, and cure it until it is healed.
And this which I have seen with my own eyes is that a servant took a knife and put it in her throat and incised with it a part of the lung's tube, and I was called to her cure, and I found the mucus as it is found in those who are dying, and I uncovered the wound and found the blood which had come from the small wound.
Then I was satisfied that she had not incised a vein or artery, and the wind (air) was escaping from the wound, and I cured it until it was healed.
And there was no harm to the servant except hoarseness in the voice, and after some days she returned to a better state of health.
And now I say that in the incision of the throat there is no fear (danger).
Chapter 44.
Chapter 44. Of incision on an abscess which occurs in the throat externally, and is called a throat hernia.
This abscess called throat hernia is a large abscess according to the complexion of the body, and it is common in women.
And it is of two kinds, for it is either natural or accidental.
And the natural kind cannot be cured.
And the accidental is of two kinds, of which one resembles fatty nodes, and the other kind resembles an abscess which is formed by the knotting of an artery, and in this there is danger. And one should not presume to use iron on it except in the case of a small one. And you should probe and investigate it with your finger; and if you find it similar to a fatty node, and it is not connected to any of the veins, then you should incise it like nodes, and extract it with whatever it contains from the skin and with a small scalpel; and if not, then its entire being should be examined, and then treat the place with whatever is appropriate for healing until it is healed.
Chapter 45.
On the incision of the types of nodes.
There are many types of nodes, and I have already described all their types in the division (of chapters/topics).
And it is necessary that I recount again the difference between a node and an abscess, as it may cause doubt.
Therefore I say that with an abscess there is heat and fever and vehement pain until the boiling of the superfluity is settled; and putrefaction is complete, then the fever, pain, and heat cease.
But with a node there is neither heat nor fever nor pain, and it contains that leonine [lion-like, referring to its color or appearance] matter which is in its own sac.
And it is according to the color of the body, and its beginning is like a swelling and is made like a bladder, whether larger or smaller, and they are of two types, for either they are greasy and contain humidity, and the colors of the humidity are many, as I said in the division (of chapters/topics).
Therefore it is necessary, when you arrive at the treatment of a node, that you explore and investigate it at the beginning with an instrument which is called an intromes, according to how its form will be in the chapter which is near this one.
And the manner of examining abscesses and all nodes is that you take this instrument and insert it into the most humid place which you find in the abscess, and you will rotate your fingers with it little by little until you know that the instrument has penetrated the depth/thickness.
And then place your hand according to the size of the abscess, and then remove the intromes and consider what has come out in its track/wake.
And if the running humidity, whatever its color, is expelled, then you will incise it with a superficial incision as I have said in the case of other abscesses.
And if no humidity comes from the track of the intromes, then know that it is fatty/thick.
And dry it up with an incision in the form of a cross, according to this form: as I have taught you, and suspend it with hooks, and peel the skin from all sides easily, and keep the skin or sac, if you can, over it and extract that pus with the node.
But if it is broken during the operation, it is not possible to extract all the pus, and this happens many times, and then you extract it piece by piece until nothing remains.
Because if anything remains, little or much, the node will return again.
And if you see that some small part remains, then fill the wound with some sharp corrosive powders and bind the wound, and place on it a hot poultice, and treat it with another treatment until it is healed.
And if it is a large node, then you sew the two lips of it and treat it with that which causes it to grow flesh.
But if a pulsating vein is present, or a non-pulsating one, then you cauterize and fill the place with crushed vitriol and leave it tightly bandaged for two or three days until the wound dries and the boiling of the blood subsides; and then return to incising that which remains of the node.
Chapter 46.
Of the forms of instruments necessary in incision and perforation.
Of these are the forms of the instruments, and there are three kinds: some are large, some are medium, and some are small.
The form of the large instrument is this:
The form of the small instrument is this:
They are made of iron, of lead, with suitably rounded ends, so that they easily enter the abscesses.
And these are the forms of the instruments, and they are named *albered*, and one of them is called *berid*.
And they are of three types, for of them there is a large, a medium, and a small one.
The form of the large instrument, its form:
The form of the medium instrument, its form:
The form of the small instrument, its form:
It is suitable that they are used for those abscesses and discharges and fistulas and buboes, because among those are those from the bones and from other causes.
And they are made round, thick, smooth, like large needles with which saddles are sewn, and they are made of citron brass, or of brass, or of iron, or of silver. And the best are when they are made of citron brass.
And the instruments are made of black lead, which are agreed to be used to open fistulas in the concavity of which reflections are found, so that they are reflected with their lightness with those reflections.
And they are of three types, for some of them are long, and others medium, and others short, according to the size of the fistula's width and its stricture.
Shape of the large lead instrument:
Shape of the medium lead instrument:
Shape of the small lead instrument:
The shapes of the hooks are of many kinds, for some of them are simple, which have only one curve, and they are of three types: large, small, and medium.
And of them there are curved hooks, and they are of three types.
And of those there are hooks having two curves, and they are of three types.
And of those there are hooks having three curves, and they are of three types.
And all these are necessary in their place.
Shape of a small simple hook, its shape:
Shape of a large hook having two curves: Shape of a medium hook having two curves: Shape of a small hook having two curves:
Shape of a large hook having three curves:
Shape of a medium hook having three curves:
And these are the shapes of the scalpels with which nodes and abscesses are cut and scraped, and there are three types, for of them there is a large, a medium, and a small.
Shape of a large scalpel:
Shape of a medium scalpel:
Shape of a small scalpel:
The ends of those with which the incision is made are sharp, and the other ends are not sharp, and they are not placed in such a way, except that it is done skillfully in the scraping of the nodes, fearing the incision of a vein or nerve, and through these the patient is healed and finds a little tranquility because of the cauterization which he finds after the scraping of the abscess.
And these are the shapes of the cauteries, and they are of three kinds: large, medium, and small, as you will see.
They are made of bronze and are similar in shape to the instrument with which alcohol is made.
And it is at the pointed end, hidden by a sheath, and in that sheath there are openings inside and outside, as you wish, as you see.
The shapes of the sheaths, which are hidden among the fingers for the perforation of abscesses and which the patients do not perceive, are of three types: large, medium, and small. And these are the shapes of those:
The shapes of cupping glasses with which the flow of blood is cut off, and there are three types; large, medium, and small; their shapes are:
They should be made of bronze or copper, round with some length, and they should be thin.
And it is necessary that you have these types of cupping glasses: large, medium, and small, so that with them you can cut off the flow of blood quickly when necessary, and when other medicine is not initially available.
However, do not use them to cut off blood in every part of the body, and use them only in fleshy areas, such as in the fleshy parts of the legs and thighs, and in the fleshy parts of the arms, and of the breasts, and of the abdomen, and of the knees, and similar fleshy and moist areas.
And sometimes other small instruments are made, similar to small bags, according to this shape; by means of which blood is drawn off when it is done by phlebotomy, or by incision of a vein, or by cupping.
And sometimes they are made round according to this shape:
Chapter 47.
Concerning the care of the breasts of men which are similar to those of women.
Sometimes the breasts of some men are inflamed due to the effect of sleeping, and then the breasts are inflamed, and they resemble the breasts of women, and become purulent, white.
And to one who has this, it is necessary that he incise those with a lunar incision according to this shape, from line B to line G, and then excise the entire thickness, and then fill the wound with incarnative medicine, and then join the two lips of the wound with sutures, and treat this until it is healed.
But if the nipple inclines downwards and is softened by its size as happens in women, then let it be split into two superior halves, with two incisions similar to a lunar shape, each contained within the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from line B and line G. And then excise the skin that is between the two lips of the wound, and remove the fat, and administer that which we have said of the suture and powders which are necessary in the healing until it is healed.
And if you do not complete the incision of what should be incised due to the patient's unease and bleeding, then it is necessary that you fill the wound with cotton soaked in corrosive ointment and leave it until it corrodes the remaining fat, and then treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 48.
Of the perforation of abscesses which come below the nipple.
These abscesses which come below the nipple are a type of scrofula, hard, which contain a sac-like skin.
And of those, some contain humidity; and those which contain humidity should be incised with a lunar incision according to this figure: from line G to line B. And when all that is in the abscess of pus is evacuated, then you fill it with old linen and leave it there until the next day.
And then the linen should be removed and it should be treated with a suitable ointment for this, until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the type of nodes and scrofula, then you incise it as we have said in the section on scrofula, similarly.
But if the wound is so extensive that it produces putrefaction, then apply cautery to it as we have previously described.
Chapter 49.
Concerning the incision of abscesses that occur from an arrow wound or a vein.
When an arrow is broken, and the shaft which is on it is consolidated, then often an abscess occurs.  And the signs by which it is known that inflammation and abscess are from an artery or vein: for when an abscess is from an arrow, it is long and extends deeply into the body; and when you press the abscess with your fingers, you feel a kind of grating or creaking sound within it.
And that which is from a vein is round on the surface of the body.
And incision of this abscess is dangerous, especially that which is under the armpits, and in the groin, and in the neck, and in many places of the body; and it is very large, therefore its treatment with iron (cautery or surgery) should be avoided.  And that which is in the extremities, or on the head, should also be avoided.
But concerning that which is there from inflammation of the opening of the arrow wound, make a long incision along the shaft; and then widen the incision with hooks and around the arrow, and free it from the tissues until it is uncovered.
And then place a needle there and make it penetrate to the other side, and bind the arrow with a double ligature in two places — which procedure I have shown you in the extraction of two arrows that were in the temples.
And then puncture the place which is between the two ligatures with a spatula until all the blood that is there comes out, and the abscess is dissolved.
And then administer a treatment in which pus is generated until the ligatures fall off; and then treat it with ointments suitable for this until it is healed.
And if it is an abscess caused by a severed vein, then you should hold with your hand as much as you can of the abscess with the shaft, and then insert the needle under the place that you have held under your hand, and make it penetrate; and let there be a double thread on it so that you extract it from the other side, and then tie the abscess with a good ligature, as I have told you in the ligature of a grape, in two parts with two ends of the thread.
But if you fear that the thread will be pulled out, then insert the thread with that needle under the whole abscess below the incision of the first needle, and tighten your threads in four places.
Then dry the abscess in the middle of it until, when what is inside has come out, then you incise the superfluity of the shaft, and leave what is tied from it.
And then place on it a powder which you have submerged in wine and oil, and then administer the treatment which is done with poultices and ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 1: Of the abscess which happens through the twisting of nerves.
Just as abscesses happen in an artery and in a vein, similarly abscesses happen in the nerves when they are struck or when there is excessive labor, and similarly.
And it is formed most often in the locations of the joints or of the heel, or in any place where the joints are bad.
And the abscess is serious, and it resembles the color of the other body, and it is in the worst dispositions of them, and when it is constricted with vehemence, the patient feels a kind of numbness.
And the abscess is not aggregated in the front of the body, and therefore it is under the skin, and it is bad in every part and does not go to the front or back parts.
Therefore, that which is in the joints should not be invaded with iron, for contraction will quickly result.
But that which is on the head or on the forehead, pierce the skin with a spatula. But if it is a small abscess, then take it with forceps and cut it from the root.
And if it is large, then you suspend it with a hook, and flay it, and then remove it; and close the wound with suture, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 51.
Concerning the incision of an abscess which happens in the area that happens in the abdomen.
It happens to some men many times in their bellies and in other parts of their bodies,  those things which are called fungals by similarity to fungi, of which the root is subtle and the head is large; and the lips of these are turned inwards, and there are some that are small and some that are very large.
And I have seen one, and in his belly were two such things which were more like fungi, and there was no difference between them in whiteness,  [having] a slender root.
And the lips of these were turned inwards and split open, and humidity flowed from it constantly.
Therefore I incised them and found in one about eighteen ounces and in the other about six ounces.
And the operation in the incision of them is that you consider then if the patient is humid, and the color of the growth is white, humid, with a subtle root; then you incise it with a broad spatula, and let cauteries be in your presence in the fire, because many times after the section of it much blood is expelled; and if the blood overcomes you, cauterize it.
And if you see the patient fearful and timid, beware of incision with iron; but then take freshly made lead plaster, and bind the growth with it, in the manner which we have said; and leave it for two days.
And then adjust the tightness of the lead thread; therefore, do not cease to tighten the lead strongly around the growth, until it is severed and falls off by itself without effort.
But if the growth is of a thick root, then in its incision there is some cause for fear and dread, and especially that which is in the belly.
But it is possible that you incise half of it, and then cauterize it so that it does not return.
And then care for it until the wound is healed.
And beware that you do not presume to incise a growth which is of a dark color, with little feeling, and of a slow growth, for that is a cancerous ulcer.
And I bring to mind a crab in relation to this.
Chapter 52.
Concerning the treatment of umbilical hernia.
Umbilical hernia is caused by many things; either by fissures of the umbilicus which is upon the belly, and from it the membrane or intestine protrudes as in other ruptures; or by blood which flows from a vein or artery as has been said before, or by constricted wind within it.
But if it is due to a fissure of the umbilicus and protrusion of the membrane, then the color of the swelling is similar to the color of the body; and it is soft without pain, and appears in various locations. And if it is due to the protrusion of the intestine, then its location is as we have recounted, with greater variation; and when you press it with your fingers it is hidden, and returns readily; and it is easily felt there, and is greatly increased by the entry of a bath and strenuous work.
But if it is due to moisture, then it is soft and is not hidden when you press it with your hand, nor is it constricted, nor does it grow.
And if it is due to blood, then the swelling appears with these signs, tending towards blackness.
But if it is due to raw flesh, then the swelling is heavy, large and hard, and is located in a specific area.
But if it is due to wind/gas, then its touch is soft.
And the operation on it is that you consider then if the swelling of the umbilicus is from arterial blood, or venous blood, or from wind/gas; then you must be prohibited from its treatment, because in that there is fear and dread as I have taught you in the chapter in which I have discussed swellings from artery and vein.
And if the swelling of the umbilicus is due to the intestine or the membrane, then you must order the patient to hold their breath, and be lying down extended; and then mark with a probe around the entire umbilicus, and then command them to lie between your hands on their back, and then surround with a broad spatula the circumference of the umbilicus over the area which you have marked with the probe; and then extend half of the swelling to the upper parts with a large inch; and then tie around it with strong thread or with silk, and in a decent tying manner.
And then open the middle of the extended swelling over the ligature and insert your finger into that opening and seek the intestine; and if you have found it and secured it by the ligature, then you extract carefully and push the intestine into the inner parts of the abdomen.
And if you have found the membrane, then take that with forceps; and incise its superfluities.
But if it is an artery or vein that is involved, then surround that spot, and then return to your operation; and take two needles and put on them two strong threads and insert the two needles into the circumference which you have made around the swelling in the manner of a cross, which you make penetrate; and then tighten the swelling in four parts over the needles.
And if you wish, remove the needles and leave the place until the extended flesh dries up and falls off by itself; or incise it when it is thinned and dried, and then cure it with what is appropriate of ointments until it is healed.
And if the prominence of the umbilicus is of flesh grown there or by humidity, then it is necessary that you conquer the swelling as we have said and extract the blood or humidity which you find there, and then cure it with what is appropriate and consolidate the place.
Chapter 53.
On the treatment of cancer.
We have already spoken, in the division, of the types of cancer and in what manner it is subject to treatment with medicines, and that the treatment with iron is to be avoided so that it is not ulcerated; and we have said that cancer is generated in the mother, and cautioned about its treatment.
And the ancients said that sometimes cancer is in a place where its eradication is possible, as in the case of cancer which is in the breasts or in the groin and similar members, to extract all of that, and especially when it is small and beginning.
But when it is old and large, one should not apply oneself to it, for I have not been able to cure anyone of it, nor have I seen another who has succeeded in doing so.
And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is that you proceed and purge the patient, and draw off some black bile, and then bleed the patient if manifest repletion is found.
Then prepare the patient with a preparation in which the location of the operation is situated, and then apply to the wound ointments which are suitable for it; and then scrape thoroughly on all sides with a sharp curette until no trace of its roots remains. And let the blood flow, and do not staunch it lightly, and press the areas, and wipe away the thick blood entirely with your hand or with an instrument which is available to you among your instruments.
But if you find an excessive flow of thick blood from an incision of a vein or an artery, then cauterize it until the flow of blood ceases, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 44.  (Assuming a standard chapter numbering system)
On the treatment of dropsy.
We have already recounted, in the division, the types of dropsy of water, and the signs of each type, and their treatment with medicines.
And that which is cured with iron is only the species of ascites, and iron is not applied to the species of tympanites or to the species of anasarca, for that is mortal.
And when you have treated this species of tympanitic dropsy with medicines and your treatment is ineffective, then consider, for if the patient has already acquired weakness, or has another illness along with this dropsy, such as a cough or abdominal pain and similar ailments, then beware of treating with iron, for there is danger in this.
But if you see the patient with exuberant strength, and with him there is no other illness but dropsy alone, and he is neither a child nor an old person, then the manner of his operation is that you lift the patient between your hands, and the assistant gently presses his belly with his hand, driving the water toward the lower part of the abdomen, and then take a lancet in this way:
Let it be two-edged, long, with a sharp point like a lancet; but nevertheless, let there be some shortness in it, little by little, so that in the operation with it you do not enter the intestine, and injure it.
And then consider if the origin of the dropsy is from the intestines, for then it is necessary that you, with the incision, move away from the navel by the amount of three fingers toward the lower parts, to the right of it, above the pubis.
But if the origin of the dropsy is due to liver disease, then your incision should be three fingers to the left of the navel.
And if its origin is from the spleen, then your incision should be on the right side.
And it is not fitting that your incision be on the side on which the patient wants to lie, lest the superfluities run to that weak place.
And then perforate the entire peritoneum with the instrument, and then insert it into that incision, and raise your hand with the spatula between the peritoneum and the omentum, and you should peel it back; and if it is the quantity of a fingernail or thereabouts.
And then perforate the omentum until the spatula reaches the empty place, which is the location of the water. And then extract that and insert an instrument of which this is the form: and it is similar to a fine silver cannula; it is made of silver or bronze or tin, which at its lowest part has a small hole, and on its sides there are three holes: two on one side and one on the other; and its end is incised in the manner of a feather, thus:
And at its uppermost end is a ring, because when the instrument reaches the water, then it immediately rests on the instrument, therefore evacuating the water in a moderate quantity, because if you evacuate more than is appropriate at that time, the patient will very quickly die from the resolution of their animal spirit, or you will cause a syncope which is a sign of approaching death.
But evacuate according to the quantity of its virtue and according to what the patient's disposition signifies to you by the virtue of their pulse and their well-being.
And then extract the instrument, and retain the water, the reason for which is that it is immediately retained by the chain which holds the hole that is above the cup, of which I have already told you to perforate it in that manner.
And then reinsert the instrument the next day if you see the patient tolerating it, and extract a small quantity of water, and do this for a few days cautiously, and beware of error so that little water remains.
But if you are afraid for the patient, and leave a large quantity of water, then treat him with burial in warm sand, and induce sweating in a bath, and expose him to the sun for a long time; and treat him with drying medicines until he is healed.
And cauterize the stomach, spleen and liver after the extraction of the water, as I have recounted in what precedes.
Chapter 55.
Of the treatment of children who are born with imperforate urinary tracts.
Sometimes a child is born from its mother's womb and the head of its penis is not perforated (or the opening is narrow or not in its proper place).
Therefore it is necessary to treat it with perforation as soon as it is born, with a very fine probe, according to this method:
And then place a thin lead pin into the opening and leave it there for three or four days.
And when it wants to urinate, it should be stimulated and it will urinate; and then return the pin.
And if you do not place the lead [pin], it is possible that the urine, which goes to that place, will not allow it to close.
But that [wound] whose opening is narrow should be treated with a lead pin, as we have said, for several days until it is widened.
But those in whom the opening is not in its proper place, it is said, the cause of this is that in those who are born, the opening is below the tip of the penis, so that they cannot urinate properly until they raise the penis with their hand upwards; and this is not [a matter of] generation, because the semen cannot reach the mother in a straight line, and it is a very long-lasting illness.
And the manner of the operation on him is that the patient should be placed on his back, and then extend the head of his penis with your left hand with strong traction, and incise the tip of the penis at the site of the foreskin with a sharp scalpel, like a feather incision, or shave a little of it away, so that the middle of it becomes similar to the head of the penis and that the opening falls in the middle, as it should be.
And be careful in your operation about the flow of blood, for this often happens; and stop it with something that absorbs the blood, and treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 56.
Concerning phimosis, which occurs in the foreskin at the head of the penis, and of corruption, blackness, and adhesion of the foreskin to the head of the penis.
This phimosis often occurs on the penis and is an excess of fleshy growth.
And of these, one is malignant and the other is non-malignant.
For the non-malignant type, you should suspend it with a fine thread and cut it away until it is completely removed; then, apply to the wound a pledget soaked in Egyptian ointment; and afterwards, treat it with diachylon ointment until it is healed.
And if the phimosis is malignant, of a dark color, then you should apply cautery to the incision and the root of it.
But if the phimosis is on the prepuce of the head of the uncircumcised penis, and one part of the phimosis is inside the prepuce and the other part is outside, then you should remove the part that is inside first until it is healed; and then you treat the outside part, because if you treat both at the same time, there is a risk that the prepuce will be damaged.
And if you observe in the genitals and prepuce blackness and corruption, then you should remove everything that is already blackened and that is beginning to corrupt or is already corrupted; and then apply to it a poultice of honey, which is mixed with crushed and sifted pomegranate rind flour and powdered herbs.
And then treat it with another appropriate treatment until it is healed.
But if there is a flow of blood, then apply lunar cautery according to this method:
because cautery is beneficial for two conditions at once, that is, for bleeding and for a wound when it is corrupted.
And if the head of the penis is corroded and completely destroyed, then you should insert a lead cannula into the meatus of the prepuce so that the patient can urinate through it.
In the adhesion of the prepuce to the head of the penis (and this adhesion only occurs in one whose prepuce is healthy, and circumcision has not been performed on him; and when adhesion occurs due to a wound or abscess) it is necessary that you scrape with a blunt spatula until the adhesion is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed from all parts.
And if it is difficult to separate these exquisitely, then you should scrape with a spatula some of the head of the penis and the prepuce, and this is because the prepuce, when thin, is very easily perforated by its slight thinness.
Then separate the prepuce from the head of the penis with a very thin linen cloth, which has already been moistened in cold water so that they do not adhere again.
And then it should be treated with styptic wine until it is consolidated (healed).
Chapter 57.
Of the cleansing of children and the treatment of what happens to those circumcised.
Circumcision is not a solution of continuity like other wounds; however, since it is of our operation and our will, and since it is especially performed on infants, it is necessary that we assign to it the best operation and the easiest path leading to health.
Therefore, I say that the ancients did not describe circumcision in any of their books, because they did not use it in their laws, and it is only because we have acquired it through experience.  The reason is that I have found most of the surgeons and barbers using circumcision and cleansing with a lancet and with forceps; and they use ligature with thread and incision with the fingernail.
And I have tried all these methods and I find no better cleansing with forceps, with ligature with thread, than cleansing with the fingernail, because many times the membrane escapes higher up, because the foreskin has two layers, and the lower layer remains, and it is easily forced to another incision and certain pain. And with cleansing which is done with an awl, and is digital, which shoemakers use, the incision of the tip of the penis is not secured, because it easily enters the hole [of the penis].
But in the operation with a fingernail, it easily rusts and corrupts your operation. And the foreskin of a child is short by nature, and many times it is born in such a way that it has no need for cleansing, and I have seen this.
But of the cleansing that is done with forceps and ligatures with thread, the goodness, experience has shown me, because the forceps are of proportional incision, for this reason that the sharpness which is above is the same as the sharpness which is below; and therefore as you press your hand, two sharpnesses are proportional, and you incise according to a comparison at one time; and a compression is made of the thread with a form containing the foreskin of the penis completely, with which no error at all happens.
And the manner of the first operation is that you make the child, especially if he is among those who understand a little,  to remain still, so that you do nothing but tie the thread to his penis only, and leave it there until the next day.
And then make him happy in every way possible that he can receive to his understanding. (Or: ...that is possible to his understanding.) And then make him lie between your hands, prepared and still; and hide the forceps in your hand or under your foot, so that the child does not see them or any other of the instruments.
And then put your hand to his penis and blow on the foreskin, and pull it back until the head of the penis is revealed, and then cleanse it of what is added to it of dirt.
The shape of the forceps for circumcision, this is the shape:
Let the extremities be non-cutting and the others be cutting, so that the branch of the nail does not protrude, and let the length of the two points be like the length of two handles equally. (This refers to the design of surgical forceps, specifying that some parts should be blunt and others sharp, and that the overall length should be balanced.)
But the error in circumcision is that you very quickly remove the entire inner foreskin, or a part of it, after the incision.
Therefore, it is necessary that you extend that [foreskin] with your fingernail before the suppuration of the area and that you incise it evenly.
And if you cannot hold it with your fingernail, then grasp it with forceps and incise it.
But if three days have passed, and what is swollen remains under the inflamed penis, then you should leave it until the hot abscess subsides, and carefully incise it, and cut it as you are prepared to do.
And be careful of the head of the penis, for that will not harm him.
And then treat it with that which consolidates the wound, from the powders which we have recommended in the treatise on powders.
And if it is incised beyond measure from the scrotum, and you attend to the parts above, this will not harm him.
And furthermore, treat it with what we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 58.
Concerning the treatment of urine retained in the bladder.
Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by obstruction from a stone, or by congealed blood, or by pus, or by flesh, and similar to those things which we have said about the methods of treatment in the division.
And if it is not dissolved with what we have said, and the cause is vehement in the patient, then it is necessary to administer extraction with an instrument which is called a syringe, of which this is the form: Let it be of silver and be subtly long and concave, like a bird's quill, with a thinness of a long ray, in the likeness of a palm and a half, to which there is a thin tube at its head.
And the manner of drawing out the urine by this means is that you take a doubled cloth and tie at its end wool or cotton with a good binding; and introduce the ends of the cloth into the part below the syringe, and cut with the scissors if any superfluous part of the wool remains, but introduce it into the cannula with force. And then grease the syringe with butter and egg white.
And make the patient sit on a chair, and rub their bladder and penis with moist oils, olive oil and rosewater.
And then introduce the syringe easily until it reaches the root of the penis; and then bend the penis upwards towards the navel; and then push the syringe inside that; and then push it until it reaches the bladder, and the patient feels it has reached the empty place, and this is not done according to this order, but the passage goes in a tortuous way.
And then extend the cloth with the wool little by little, because the urine will wet the wool.
Then extract it and make a cure with urine, and use a syringe; do not cease doing this and use the syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief.
Chapter 59.
Concerning the method of irrigating the bladder with a catheter and similar instruments suitable for this purpose.
When an ulceration or abscess occurs in the bladder, or blood clots in it, or putrefaction is constricted there, and you wish to instill waters and medicines into it, then it should be done with an instrument which is called a catheter, and this is its form:
except that its extremity is blunt, that is, closed. And in that (extremity) are three holes: two on one side, thus it goes.
At the beginning is a concave place, in which is what is pushed in, and it should be according to the quantity that fills it, without addition, except that when something is drawn from the humors with it, it should be drawn, and when it is expelled, it should be drawn with it, and when it is expelled long, as the catheter does with which naphtha is inserted in sea battles.
Therefore, when you want to extract humors from the bladder, insert the extremity of the catheter into the humor, and draw with it what is pushed to the upper parts, because the humor is drawn into the concavity of the catheter.
And then insert the extremity of the catheter into the urethra as we have recounted in the syringe; and then expel the humor with what you expel, because that humor comes to the bladder immediately, and the patient feels that.
The form of the fine catheter with which the bladder is catheterized, and this is its form:
And let it be made of silver or brass, of which the upper end should resemble a small feather, and below it a canal inside, smoothly.
And then take a goatskin bladder, and place in it the humor that you wish to inject into the bladder, and then tie it between two [objects] with a strong double thread ligature, and warm that humor over the fire.
And then insert the end of the catheter into the penis.
And then squeeze your hand on the bladder with the liquid with gentle pressure until the patient says that the liquid has already reached the bladder.
But if you do not have a bladder at hand, then take a piece of parchment and make a circle from it; and pierce it all around its circumference; and then insert strong thread into those holes, so that it is reinforced; and then grease the circle so that it is greased like a clyster, after you have placed in it what you want of the humors, oils, and waters.
And then you tie that to the instrument and do with it as you have done with the bladder, and express it with your hand until the liquid reaches the bladder.
Chapter 60.
On the extraction of a stone.
We have already mentioned in the division the types of stones and their treatment with medicines, and the difference between stones generated in the kidneys and stones generated in the bladder, and their signs.
And we have discussed the stone in which one operates with the hand, and incision.
And the stone generated in the bladder properly is that which is lodged in the bladder.
And I am narrating this with clear exposition and brevity.
Therefore I say that stones generated in the bladder mostly affect children; and among its signs is that the urine which is expelled from the bladder is similar to water in its thinness, and sand appears in it; and the patient rubs his genitals, and often cries out in pain, and is restless; and with this he expels much stool.
And the cure of children from this is easier until they reach fourteen years; and the cure is difficult in the elderly. But in young people it is moderate because it is between those [extremes - referring to easier cure in children and difficult cure in the elderly].
And of that [stone] which is larger, the cure is easier; and if it is small, it is contrary to that [i.e., more difficult].
Therefore, concerning the cure of this, it is necessary at the beginning that we purify the patient with a clyster which removes all the filth which is in his bowels; for this filth sometimes prevents the discovery of the stone through its examination.
Then let the patient be taken with his feet up and shaken and massaged downwards so that the stone descends to the bottom of the bladder, or that it jumps from its place sometimes.
Then make that  (presumably a patient support or positioning aid) between your hands, prepared, and his hands should be below his thighs, so that the whole bladder is made to incline downwards.
And then search for it and everything else around it (the stone).
Therefore, if you feel the stone in the space, then you must immediately attend to it with an incision.
And if it does not completely fall below your touch, then it is necessary that you anoint the index finger of your left hand with oil, if the patient is a child, or the middle finger if he is a grown young man, and insert it into his anus. And search for the stone until it is below your finger. And return it little by little up to the neck of the bladder.
And then press on it with your finger, and expel it outwards to the place where you made the incision.
And command the assistant to press the bladder with her hand; and command another assistant with her right hand to extend the genitals upwards, and with her other hand to hold back the perineum which is below the genitals, in the region where the incision is made.
And then introduce a well-sharpened spatula, of which this is the form: and cut what is between the anus and the genitals, not in the middle, but towards the left thigh; and let the incision be above the stone, and your finger in the anus, and let the incision be transverse, so that the external incision is wide and the internal narrow according to the size that the extraction of the stone allows, and no larger, because very easily by compressing with your finger, which is in the anus, the stone will be expelled through the incision without difficulty.
And know that some stones are angular and jagged, which makes their extraction difficult because of this.
And of those that are like a nut, and are round, the extraction is easily done.
Therefore, if it is one that has angles and edges, adjust it in the fissure.
And if it is not thus expelled, then it is necessary that you push on it, or that you tighten around it with a decent instrument, the end of which is like a file with which you press on the stone, and it does not escape; or that you introduce under it a subtle instrument with a curved end.
But if you cannot [reach/work on] it, then enlarge the opening a little, and if you want to stem the flow of blood, constrict it with crushed vitriol.
But if the stone is more than one, then at the beginning you place your hand at the opening of the bladder, and then incise it; and then gently push on it; and similarly proceed if there are more than two.
And if the stone is very large, then it is unwise to incise it with a large incision, for it causes one of two things to the patient: either death or continuous urinary incontinence, because the area is not completely healed.
But administer its expulsion until it is expelled, or work on breaking it with forceps until you extract it in pieces.
Therefore, when you have completed your operation, then fill the wound with aloe and dragon's blood powder, and bind it tightly. And place over that a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and cold water, so that a hot abscess may be calmed.
Then lay the patient supine on their neck, and do not untie the bandage until the third day.
And when you have untied that, bathe the area with water and much oil, and then treat it with diachylon ointment and basilicon ointment until it is healed.
But if in the wound there occurs a hot, burning, and corrosive abscess, and of such an appearance as if blood were frozen in the bladder, and urination is thereby prevented (and this is known by the passage of blood with urine), then insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains, it provokes corruption of the bladder and putrefaction thereof.
Then wash the wound with sour wine, water, and salt, and with a poultice of whatever is suitable for its healing until it is healed.
And it is necessary during the entire treatment that you bind both thighs and adjust the medicines which are placed on the area.
And if the stone is small and is in the meatus of the penis, and is lodged there, and thus urination is prevented, then treat it with what I recommended before you resort to incision, for many times because of this treatment incision is required; and I have proven this, and it is that you take a heated iron perforator, of which this is the form:
of triangular extremity, sharp, set in wood.
Then take bile, and bind with it the penis below the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then insert the iron into the penis, perforating easily until the perforator reaches the stone. And revolve the perforator with your hand against the stone little by little, and you will enlarge the perforation until you make it penetrate from one side to the other; for then the urine will be immediately released.
Then press your hand on what remains of the stone on the outside of the penis, because it is broken, and it will be expelled with the urine, and the patient is healed.
But if this cure is not suitable for you for some reason that prevents it, then tie one bandage below the stone, and another bandage above the stone. And then incise upon the stone in that penis between the two bandages. And then extract it. And then untie the bandages and clean the congealed blood which is formed in the wound.
And it is not necessary to bandage below the stone except to prevent it from returning to the bladder, and the other bandage above only because, when the bandage is untied near the extraction of the stone, the stone returns to its place and closes the wound.
And for this reason it is necessary for you, when you tie the bandage above, that you elevate the stone to the upper parts, or that it returns thanks to your action, and so closes the wound as we have said.
Chapter 61.
On the extraction of a stone from women.
Stones are rarely generated in women.
But if a stone is found in any of them, then the cure is difficult, and is forbidden in many ways.
One reason is that women are very easily made virgins again (i.e., their hymen can easily reform or be mistaken for intact).
And the second is that you will not find a woman, whether chaste or married, who willingly exposes herself to a physician.
The third is that you will not find a woman who well knows this art, especially the manual operation.
And the fourth is that the location of the incision for stones in women is distant from the location of the stone itself, therefore requiring a deep incision, and there is fear in that.
But if necessity compels you to this, then it is necessary that you take a female physician who is well-skilled, and few such are found.
But if you are deprived of that, then seek a cautious and skillful male physician, or present a matron well-versed in women's matters, or a woman who knows some part of this art.
Therefore, present that woman, and command her to do all that you order her, from the initial examination for the stone;  the reason for this is that if she observes whether the woman is a virgin, then she must put her finger in her rectum and search for the stone.
Then, if she finds it, she should grasp the stone with her finger, and then command her to incise over it.
But if she is not a virgin, then command the matron to insert her finger into the vagina of the patient and search for the stone, while placing her left hand on the bladder, and compress it with good compression.
Then, if she finds it, she should gently draw it from the opening of the bladder towards the lower parts with the sum of her strength until it reaches the root of the thing.
And then incise over it near the midpoint of the vagina, towards the root of the thing, wherever it is stopped in her, and center the stone at that point, and her finger should not be removed from the stone while grasping it.
And the incision should be small at first; and then insert the tool into that incision, and if the stone is felt, then adjust the incision according to the size that she knows the stone will be removed from.
And know that the types of stones are many: for some are small and large, and smooth and rough, and long and round, and having branches.
Therefore you should know how many types there are of them so that you can signify what you want about them.
And if you see a flow of blood, apply crushed vitriol to the place and hold it for an hour until the bleeding stops, and then return to your operation until the stone is removed.
And see that you prepare with you the instruments which are mentioned in the extraction of stones in men, so that you are aided by them in your operation.
And if you see a flow of blood, and you know that the expulsion of blood is from the artery that has been incised, then place powder on the area and bind it tightly with powders and a descending bandage, and do not repeat this; and leave the stone and do not extract it, for the patient will quickly die. And then care for the wound.
Then, when the sharpness of the blood has subsided after a few days, and the area has healed, you return to your operation until the stone is removed.
Chapter 62.
Concerning incision for a strangulated hernia.
A watery hernia is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the white sheath which is below the genitals' scrotum containing the testicle, and is called the sheath.
And sometimes it is in the proper membrane which nature has prepared for the testicle, so that it is enclosed as if it were another testicle; and it is the scrotum between the white sheath which we have mentioned, and this is only cartilage.
And the generation of this hernia is due to weakness which affects the genitals, so that this matter is poured into them, and sometimes it happens due to a blow inflicted on the genitals.
And this moisture has many colors, for its color is either tending towards yellow or bloody, or red, or black and foul-smelling, or watery white, and this is the most common.
And the signs by which it is known where this accumulation of water is are these: for if it is in the white sheath which we have mentioned, then the swelling is round, tending slightly to length, like the shape of an egg, and it appears above the testicle, because the moisture surrounds it on all sides.
And if the moisture is in the proper membrane, then the swelling is round with part of the testicle and therefore one believes it to be another testicle.
And if the moisture is between the covering of the genitals and the white sheath, then it falls below the scrotum.
And if you want to know the color of the moisture, then you examine the color of the moisture in the swelling with a probe, the shape of which has been previously determined; and according to what has appeared on the probe, judge what is inside.
Therefore, when we come to its treatment with iron (cautery), then it is necessary that we order the patient to be bled if that is possible for you, and cleanse his body.
Then let him be supine on his back on something a little raised, and place many cloths beneath him.
Then sit on his left side, and order the assistant to be on his right side, who should extend his hand from one of two sides to the covering of the genitals and to the part of the navel.
Then take a broad spatula and split the covering of the genitals from the middle, lengthwise, almost to the pubic bone.
And let the incision be made straight, equally distant from the line that divides the skin of the genitals, until it reaches the underlying white fat.
And scrape that [fat], and observe, and be careful not to cut it; and your scraping, with which you scrape it partially, should be suspended, and more subtly scrutinized with the scraping, according to the amount possible for you.
Then perforate the water-filled cyst with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
Then separate the two lips of the incision with hooks, and extend the cyst upwards; and do not touch the covering of the genitals, and incise the cyst in the way that is possible for you. And incise it in its entirety or in pieces, and especially its thin layer, for if you do not exquisitely scrutinize its incision, there is no certainty that the water will not return.
But if the egg [cyst] protrudes from its covering during your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the cyst, return it inside, and then join the two lips of the covering of the genitals with a suture, and then treat it like other wounds until it is healed.
And if you find the egg [cyst] corrupted by another illness, then it is necessary that you tie the vessels which are on the suspensory ligament, and extract the egg, and then treat it as we have said.
But if the fluid is collected in two separate parts, then know that there are two hernias; therefore incise that part as you have done the other equally; and if it seems to you that it is one operation, then you do it.
And then you wipe away the blood, and insert into the incisions wool soaked in oil or rose oil; and place on the outside other wool which you have soaked in wine and oil, and spread it over the genitals and the area of the abdomen; and place over it folded cloths and powders, and bind those on top with a bandage which is according to this form:
And then two cloths should be taken and filled with carded wool in this manner; and the ends should be made with which it is pressed with cotton or damp wool, and they should be attached with a tight binding to the inside of the breeches, and one of the ends should reach from the buttocks to the thighs, and the second should reach to the groin area, and two ends should be on the two thighs and two other ends on the two ankles, and the whole binding should be adjusted in the inside of the breeches.
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with cautery instead of incision with an iron; and it is that you take a thin, knife-like cautery and that you incise with it the skin of the genitals, and it is ignited as we have recounted until the white cyst containing the fluid is uncovered, and then you take a cautery of this shape: and it is similar to the Greek letter.
And then pierce the cyst with it, and ignite it until all the moisture is expelled.
And then spread the cyst with tweezers, and scrape it with tweezers, and scrape it with a thin, ignited cautery; and incise it as much as possible until you eradicate all of it; and beware that the fire does not touch the egg.
And know that this operation is safer and involves less blood loss, and better than an operation with incision.
But if an abscess forms contrary to expectation during the incision or cauterization, or there is excessive bleeding, then you must treat whatever problem arises, with the treatment appropriate for it, as has been said.
But if the patient is fearful and does not expect a second operation because of its horror, then administer a perforation as I have described; and this is when you are certain, from what we have said about the signs, that the hernia is watery.
Then you should have the patient sit on some raised seat, then perforate the abscess at its lowest part with a wide spatula, and make the perforation according to the length of the body.
And let the opening be wide enough that all the water drains out.
Then place a cotton cloth over the area and bind it, and leave it so that the remaining water drains out. And then treat it until the wound is healed.
But if there is resistance to the drainage of the water, at that time you should perforate it: and this is done only because the white pannicle in the opening of the wound creates resistance and prevents the exit of the water; then you should put into the wound a probe or instrument with which water is extracted from dropsies, the form of which is described before; or apply a small pressure to the opening of the wound.
And know that if the water returns and is collected again within six months or thereabouts; and when it is collected, then it should be perforated in the same manner, for the patient will thus pass his days.
Chapter 63.
Concerning the incision of a fleshy hernia and its treatment.
Know that in the incision of this hernia there is danger leading to death in most cases; therefore, in my view, its removal and being saved by that [method] is better.
And I am remembering the operation on that and the types of abscesses.
Therefore, I say that abscesses arise in the genitals which are composed of [certain parts], and this is caused by many things: either by an acute, acrid superfluity which is poured into the genitals, or by a blow.
And the color of the abscess is according to the color of the body, and no pain is found in it, and it is a serious abscess.
And very quickly is a lapified abscess, of which the color is dark, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it is caused by a knotting of the arteries, and by inflammation of those, so that its remembrance is perceived, or by inflammation of the veins.
But that which is from inflammation of the arteries is known by the dispersion of the abscess when we press it with our fingers; and it should not be touched.
But that which is caused by inflammation of a vein is not dispersed by any cause from compression with the fingers.
And it is possible that an incision be made upon this kind [of abscess] and upon other flesh; and it is so that you incise the skin of the genitals, and then extend the testicle upwards, and extract it from the white sheath, and free the suspensory ligament, and ligate it, and incise the suspensory further until you free it from all parts of the scrotum.
Therefore, if the testicle is already consolidated with those inflamed tissues, then it is necessary that you extract the testicle and incise it.
And if there is adhesion between any part of the sheath, or between that which is between the vessels, then it is necessary that you free all that adhesion and incise it with a circular incision.
But if there is a growth of flesh in the place of the adhesion which is behind, then it is necessary that you incise all that which is there, and extract the testicle as we have said.
Therefore, when your operation is completed, then fill the wound with wool soaked in rose oil and wine; and then treat it with other treatments until it is healed.
Chapter 64.
On the treatment of a scrotal hernia.
A hernia is an abscess enveloped by some covering similar to a boil, with softening of the testicles, and it makes movement, exercise, and walking difficult for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, it is necessary to be mindful of what preceded it.
However, we must describe the operation as the ancients did.
And I say that you should have the patient sit on a raised stool; then gently push the suspensory of the testicles downwards; and then hold the scrotum with your fingers along with the vessels that are attached to the penis; and have another assistant hold and firmly stretch those out.
And then incise with a sharp, broad lancet with a transverse cut directly over the vessels until the vessels are exposed.
And then scrape the entire area as we have instructed you in the extraction of arrowheads that are lodged in the temples.
And then insert a double-threaded needle into those [vessels], and tie it first at the place where you made the incision, and tie it again at the other end. And then incise those [vessels] in the middle with a straight cut along the length of the body, and extract whatever is accumulated of foul and corrupt humors.
And then treat the wound with the same treatment as other wounds in which you desire healing to be engendered, so that the vessels which bleed from one of the two genitals may be cauterized, for this is not harmful.
But if you cut all the vessels, then it is necessary that the testicles be removed, or that the testicles be tied off along with those vessels so that they are deprived of all nourishment by the incision of the vessels, and that they be atrophied, or that they be tied off so that there is no help for them.
Chapter 65.
Concerning the treatment of intestinal hernia.
The occurrence of this hernia is due to a separation that happens in the peritoneum extended over the abdomen on the side of the inguinal rings of the abdominal wall, causing the intestines to descend through that rupture.
And this rupture is either of the peritoneum or an extension of it, and these two types occur for many reasons: a blow, a jump, a shout, the lifting of some heavy object, or similar.
And the sign of this, when it is due to an extension of the peritoneum, is that it occurs gradually over a long time, and not suddenly; and it is an inguinal swelling that extends toward the groin because the peritoneum compresses the intestine.
And the sign of it, when it is due to a rupture of the peritoneum, is that it initially causes severe pain suddenly; and it is a different swelling appearing below the groin, and this is because of the protrusion of the intestine and its body outside the peritoneum.
And sometimes the omentum is protruded along with the intestine, and this hernia is called an intestinal zirbal hernia.  (Note: "zirbal" is likely a transcription variant or a word specific to this dialect/text and may not have a direct modern medical equivalent.)
And sometimes it is caused by flatulence, and sometimes a tear occurs in the intestine, and it is retained there, and this causes great harm to the patient, and sometimes it causes severe pain, especially when it is pressed.
And in the treatment of this type of illness, using iron (i.e., cautery) is dangerous, therefore it should be avoided in this case.
And the method of operating on this is that you command the patient to return the intestine with his hand to its cavity if it obeys its return, and then it should be wrapped around its neck between your hands, and raise his legs.
Then hold the cord, which is the spermatic cord, upwards, and incise the spermatic cord lengthwise; and then place hooks in the two lips of the incision as you need to open the incision with them.
And if the incision, according to the amount that is possible for you, allows the testicle to be expelled from it.
Then scrape away that skin which is under the spermatic cord until the hard white tunic is uncovered on each side.
Then you insert your finger into what is the testicle, into what is between the white tunic, which is under the spermatic cord, and the second tunic, and break up with it the adhesion which is in the part behind the testicle.
Then gently pull the spermatic cord upwards with your hand, and with this, stretch the white tunic upwards with your left hand, and elevate the testicle with the tunic to the edge of the incision; and instruct the assistant to pull the testicle upwards while you completely dissolve the adhesions behind with a complete solution [i.e., completely loosen or separate the adhesions].
And check with your fingers that there is no bowel enveloped in the hard white tunic. But if you find anything there, then push it back down into the abdomen.
Then incise in the area below the spermatic cord, through an incision from which blood and pus will flow, just as we have described above.
Then apply wool soaked in oil and place it on the wound; and apply the ligature which we have described (and sometimes the white tunic is cauterized, which we have mentioned near the incision to prevent bleeding, because this often happens) and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if its falling off is delayed, then let it be bathed with warm water, and keep it there until it falls off as we have said.
Then treat the wound with the other treatments for wounds until it is healed.
Chapter 66.
On a Windy Hernia (or,  Concerning a Windy Hernia/Ventosity)
In this hernia, I have not seen anyone who has been bold enough to treat it with iron.
And the first ones said that it is done as we have recounted in the hernia that is with blood; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision on that with the patient's consent; and then dry the area around the abscess with something that opens it, until the vessels collapse.
And cure the wound as we have said until it is healed.
Chapter 67.
Of the disruption that is made in the inguinal region (groin).
Sometimes a rupture occurs in the groin as we have said, and swells the area.
And it does not allow the intestines any cause to descend into the genitals; and if it does, it is little; and it returns in all hours (at any time).
But if the time is prolonged with this, a fissure is made in the inguinal canal until the intestine descends into the inguinal canal; and this happens because of the extension of the inguinal canal which is in the groin as we have said, which is caused because the inguinal canal is stretched, and then it is softened and the area is inflamed and swollen.
And its cure is with cautery, as its narration has preceded.
And sometimes it is cured with iron according to this manner: and it is that the patient lies on his back between your hands, and then dry the area of the rupture of the swollen abscesses with incision across the width according to the amount of three fingers.
And then tighten the white inguinal canal that is under the scrotum until it is uncovered (or exposed).
And then take the ray (presumably a surgical instrument, possibly a cautery) and place it on the prominent part of the inguinal canal, and press it towards the front of the abdomen.
And then sew the two prominent places on the end of the inguinal canal ray (instrument), and join one of them to the other with a suture.
And then remove the end of the ray (instrument), and do not completely incise the inguinal canal, nor extend the wound, nor anything else like that, as I will let you know in the treatment of intestinal hernia.
And then treat it with the treatment for wounds, and if you have incised the fibers, cleanse it and restore the wound until it is healed; because the inguinal canal is constricted and the prominence of the rupture is not aligned (or reduced).
And cauterization is better in this place, because it is closer to health (i.e., a more effective and less risky treatment).
Chapter 68.
Concerning the softening of the swelling of the testicles.
Many times the swelling of the testicles in some men is softened because the flesh that is between them is softened, and this hinders their proper functioning (or development).
Then it is necessary for the one who is entrusted with his care to make the patient lie on his back, and to incise all the swelling which is softened above the natural swelling; and then to adjust the two lips (of the wound) with a suture.
And if you wish, sew up at the beginning the excess of the softened swelling with three or four stitches and with a firm suture.
And then incise between the sutures; and then care for it with the treatment for other wounds until it is healed and the stitches fall out.
Chapter 69.
On castration.
Know that castration is forbidden in our law, but because of this I am obliged to mention it in this book; and its mention is necessary only in two ways, one of which is so that it is within the knowledge of the physician when questioned about it, so that he knows its treatment should it occur; and the other way is that many times we have need of the castration of other animals for our benefit, such as horses, goats, pigs, and similar animals.
And therefore I say that castration is done in two ways: either by abrasion, or by incision.
But in that which is done by abrasion, the method of operation is that we cause the animal to be bathed in warm water until its genitals are softened and relaxed and hang down. And then take them with your hand until they are resolved and do not appear under the touch.
But in castration done by incision, it is necessary that you hold the animal and grasp the scrotum with your left hand.
And then tie the suspensory ligament, and incise over each testicle with one incision so that the two testicles are exposed.
And then incise them after you have skinned each one. And do not leave any material on those of the cyphus (likely referring to a wound or ulcer), except the fine cyphus which is on the vessels.
And this method of castration is better which is done by crushing, because crushing quickly leaves no trace of the testicles, so the animal does not desire copulation.
And then treat the wound until it is healed.
Chapter 70.
On the treatment of hermaphroditism.
Hermaphroditism in men is of two kinds: one is where there appears in the space between the testicles, that which is between the two testicles, a shape like a woman's vulva in which there is hair.
And sometimes urine flows from that opening which is in the space between the testicles.
But in women there is one type: and it is that the vulva above the pubic bone is like two testicles of a man, somewhat smaller externally, like a man's prepuce and two testicles.
And the cure is of three types: two for men and one for women. And it is necessary that you incise those adhering flesh until the impression of it disappears, and then that you treat those with the treatment for other wounds.
And in the second type in men, from which urine flows which is in the space between the testicles, there is no cure or operation for it.
Chapter 21.
Concerning swelling and prominent flesh due to causes in women.
A slight swelling is readily attributed to natural causes until it is pressed and examined; and sometimes it is magnified in some women to such an extent that it spreads, as in men, and extends to the genitals.
Then you should hold the excess swelling with your hand or with a bandage and incise it.
And do not overdo the incision, especially near the root, lest a flow of blood ensue.
And then treat it with wound treatment until it is healed.
But a fleshy growth is flesh that grows in the mother's womb until it fills it, and it soon protrudes externally, resembling a tail (and for this reason some initially called this "tailed disease"); therefore, we must incise it as we incise a swelling, and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 72.
Concerning the treatment of gout.
Gout is when the woman's vagina is not perforated, or is small. And this is either natural or accidental.
Accidental is due to a preceding illness, and that is caused either by improperly formed flesh or by a thin or thick septum.
And it is formed either in the front of the mother, or on her sides, or in her upper part, or in her lower part, and it prohibits conception, pregnancy, and childbirth, and very quickly it prohibits menstruation.
And the diagnosis of this is made by observing the womb; if the obstruction is apparent, it is straightforward. But if it is not apparent, then you search for it with your fingers or with a probe.
But if the obstruction is due to a thin septum, and it is close to the two labia, then you cut and break it.
And you should place powders on the two labia, and then place your index fingers of both hands inside them.
And the woman should be on her back, her thighs spread, and then forcefully spread the two labia until that thin septum is broken and the obstruction is opened.
And then take wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the area, and keep it moist throughout the day so that the incised area does not heal.
But if the septum is thick and dense, then you must incise it with a broad spatula or with a myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is due to fleshy growth, then lift it up with a hook, and incise it.
And have with you medicines that stop the flow of blood without biting, such as acacia, dragon's blood, and enses, mixed with egg white.
And then administer a wide lead cannula so that the wound does not close up too quickly.
And keep it there for some days and apply some dry lint.
And then it should be treated with the other consolidation treatment until it is healed.
And sometimes it happens in the birth of other fleshy growths, and then it is necessary to incise in this manner. But if this is due to a cancerous abscess, to the cancerous abscess which is in the mother [presumably, the breast or womb], no counter-irritation should be applied with iron in any way.
Chapter 73.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids and of a boil and red tumor that occurs in the vulva of women.
Hemorrhoids are a swelling of the orifices of many veins, from which much blood continuously flows; and when hemorrhoids are old, they become boils.
And I have already described in the division the types of these [hemorrhoids] and their symptoms, and I will say thus which ones receive treatment and which ones do not receive treatment.
Therefore I say that hemorrhoids and boils, when they are in the womb and do not appear externally, then in those cases, treatment should not be done with iron [i.e., cautery or surgery].
But those which are at the orifice of the womb, upon which sensation falls [i.e., which are externally palpable], those are the ones that are cured.
And it is necessary that you place the woman in a cold bath and then excise the boil with scissors, or with a rough cloth, and incise them at their roots.
And then sprinkle upon those [wounds] to staunch the flow of blood, one of the incisive powders without biting [i.e., causing further irritation], such as acacia and similar things.
And then bathe her feet for an hour, and then place them in cold water.
And if the flow of blood persists, then make her sit in a decoction of sumac and pomegranate bark and oak bark and similar things.
And then take barley flour and mix it with honey and sour wine and make a plaster with this and apply it to his back.
And if the blood is stopped, good; and if not, apply two cupping glasses, to the breasts without scarification.
And then take wool and soak it in coriander juice or in comfrey juice or in  mallow juice with old wine and apply it to the area; and then treat the area with ointments until it is healed.
And treat that until it is healed.
Chapter 74.
Concerning the perforation of a fistula occurring in the mother.
Many kinds of abscesses occur in the mother, such as cancerous abscesses, stony abscesses, ulcerous abscesses,  abscesses with swelling, herpes, hemorrhoidal fistulas,  fissures, abscesses in the thighs (or similar), and other abscesses. And I have already discussed these illnesses, their types, their signs, and their cures in the previous section.
And it is necessary that I explain in this treatise the hot abscess which occurs in the mother, when it is among the abscesses that collect pus; and if you wish to know in what manner the operation is performed with iron (a cautery).
Then you must consider if the pain of the abscess at its beginning is acute, with throbbing, phlegm, and fever; and if it becomes red and inflamed to the touch, then do not attempt perforation, but treat it with remedies that promote maturation until the severity of the symptoms subsides.
Then you must make the woman lie down on a couch that has two supports; and recline her on her back and adjust her feet to the lower part of her abdomen, and her thighs should be spread, and place her arms under her knees, and bind each with a suitable bandage.
Then the midwife should stand on the right side and provide the instrument with which the opening of the womb is opened, the form of which will be described in the procedures that follow.
And when you wish to apply this instrument, you should place the tip of the instrument at the neck of the woman's womb; and that which enters the womb should not exceed the neck of the womb and harm the patient. But if the instrument is larger than the neck of the womb, then you should apply powders to the texture of the neck of the womb so that the entry of any instrument into the neck of the womb is prevented.
And you should place the turning device that runs on the instrument on the upper side, and let the assistant hold the instrument and rotate the turning device until the opening of the womb is opened.
And when the wound appears, and is touched by hand and is soft and wet, then you should dry that wound with a clean sponge.
And when the pus is evacuated, then you should place in the wound a piece of cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil, in which some astringent has been added; and place the compress in the section at the neck of the womb.
And place outside the womb and over the vulva clean wool soaked in water in which mallows have been boiled.
And then let it be treated for about two days with an ointment which is suitable for this, until it is healed.
And sometimes the womb and the wound are washed in such a way that it is rinsed with water and honey, and then with water in which the root of lily or of birthwort has been boiled, and then returns to the ointment.
And if the wound is hidden inside the womb, then you must be prohibited from treating it with iron, taking care to do what we have said in the division. (The "division" likely refers to a previous section of the treatise.)
Chapter 75.
To teach midwives in what manner living embryos should be treated when they emerge in an unnatural way. (or... when they present abnormally)
It is necessary that the midwife know at the beginning the form of natural childbirth by its signs, and it is that when you see the woman straining downwards and desires to smell the air, and moreover is relieved by what is above her of the birth, and hastens the emergence of the embryo, then you should know that this birth is according to natural form, and it is the emergence of the child head-first, and the afterbirth with it, either suspended or hanging from the navel.
Therefore, when you see those signs, then it is necessary that her belly be compressed so that the embryo descends easily because when it descends head-first, the afterbirth descends with it, and it is cleansed of those superfluities with a good cleansing.
But that which is other than this birth is unnatural and unfavorable, for when the embryo emerges feet-first and its body is emerged before its head and feet, and one of its hands, or its foot, or its head and one hand, or its belly, and it is quickly turned on its neck—these are similar to the unfavorable presentations.
Therefore, it is necessary for the midwife to be wise and skillful in all these matters, and to guard against error and deception.
And I am showing all the forms of these, and what skill is needed in them so that it may be signified by this and be established upon this.
When the fetus has emerged head-first through natural expulsion, and this is difficult for the woman and the birth is difficult, and sometimes her strength is already weakened, then have her sit, or have the women support her, and evaporate her genitalia with cooked fenugreek and moist oils.
Then the midwife inserts a small, thin spatula between her labia and with it she tears the secundine, or she scrapes it with her fingernail until it removes the moisture within. And press the woman's belly until the fetus descends.
But if it does not descend, then the woman should be given a clyster of mallow and fenugreek mucilage with anise.
And then, during the clyster, order her to be compressed and make her sneeze with a sternutatory; and hold her mouth and nose for an hour, for the fetus will be expelled immediately.
And if the two hands of the fetus are expelled at the beginning, then you must reduce them gently little by little. But if it does not obey the introduction, then place the woman on a stool and raise her legs, and then shake the stool on the ground; and the woman should be held so that she does not fall from the shaking.
And if the hands are not returned and the fetus dies, then incise them and extract the remnants of the fetus, or tie the body to its hand with a cloth and extract it gently, for it will be expelled.
When the fetus is positioned on its feet, then you must push it upwards, and then gently turn the fetus, and then grasp it, and then take one of its feet and extend it little by little.
But when it has entered the vulva, then you command her to strain, and make her sneeze forcefully, for it will be expelled if God wills it.
And if it is not expelled by what we have recounted, then you return the fetus little by little until you place it in its natural position, for it will then be expelled with ease.
And if it is prevented by everything we have recounted, then take mallow and dissolved gum, and pound everything in a mortar with good force, and then apply this to the vulva of the woman, and the lowest part of her belly. And then make her bathe in lukewarm water, up to her hypochondria (the region below the ribs).
And when you see that the lower parts of her are softened, then give her a fumigation of myrtle and apply it to her. And when she has had the fumigation for an hour, then make her sit on a chair, and then make her sneeze and hold her mouth, and lift her up, and press the lower part of her belly with gentle compression, for the fetus will be immediately expelled.
Thus of the fetus, laterally holding one of its hands. Let it be managed by reduction of the hand, but if you cannot reduce it, then raise the woman and make her walk.
And if she cannot walk, then make her lie on the bed, and shake her hips with violent shaking, and then administer pessaries which I have recommended made of mucilage.
And if childbirth has occurred, then make her sit on a stool, and then work on the reduction of the hand, and grasp the fetus according to its natural form, and make the woman sneeze and command her to strain herself until it is expelled.
Thus of the fetus, over the neck, its hands spread out, and its face is towards its mother. Let the midwife hold the hand of the fetus and then gently turn it, and let it come out easily.
And when it is grasped, then place on its neck that which we have recommended of oil and mucilages.
And then instruct her to cough gently, and when you have done this, then make her sit on a stool and instruct her to lean on her right side, and then instruct her to strain; and make her sneeze with a suitable [remedy/method]. The prepared fetus exits sideways.
When the mother's suffering lessens in this manner, observe, and then you incise the secundines with your fingernail until it is emptied of its moisture.
And if the fetus is suspended around its face and neck, then you incise it at the umbilicus, so that it may not be retained and die.
And then gently push the fetus inwards until you place it as it should be, and tell the woman to strain a few times, and it will be expelled easily, if God wills it.
The birth of twins or multiple fetuses. Know that twins are often born, and sometimes three or four, but this is rare and seldom happens; but there are reasons for this in nature, and they do not live.
And count those, even if they are multiple, as one pregnancy, and they are separated by a membrane, distinguishing them by the ligament in the umbilicus of each one. And sometimes they are expelled as if it were one fetus by easy natural birth, and sometimes they are expelled by an unfavorable birth, as we have recounted.
And if some of their births are difficult and arrive at what we have said about unnatural presentations, then you treat those as we have recounted.
And if the midwife is skillful and does this with ease and skill, and with patience, and is resourceful according to every presentation as she is prepared for by her skill in bringing about health.
A remembrance of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and is aborted.
Sometimes one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, and even ten or more are formed in the mother, and it has been verified by me that one woman aborted and expelled six, and another ten, all formed, which fact was established by the measurement of glorious wise men.
And all this must be in the knowledge of the midwife, because it easily appears similar to that, and therefore she must oppose it with what is necessary.
Chapter 76.
On the extraction of the fetus when it is dead.
When you treat a dead fetus with what we have said in the division of medication and it has not yet been expelled, and you are forced to use an operation with your hand, then you must consider if the woman is of sound constitution and is not afflicted by any of the conditions which cause loss of life to be feared for her.
Then the woman should be placed on the bed on her back, with her head inclined downwards and her hips elevated.
And the assistant should hold her from both sides, or she should be tied to the bed so that her body does not extend during the extraction of the fetus.
Then you should moisten the mother's vulva with moist oils and with mucilage of mallow, and fenugreek, and linseed.
Then let the midwife anoint her hand with those oils and mucilages, and gently insert her hand into the mother, and then search with her hand for the place where the umbilical cord is attached to the fetus.
And convenient places for this: then you should consider if the fetus is positioned to descend headfirst, and then you should grasp the umbilical cord at its eyes, or at the neck, or at the mouth, or at the palate, or under the chin, or at its clavicle, or in the places near the ribs, or under the hypochondria.
But if the descent is feet first, then at the heel, or in the middle of the back.
And it is necessary that you hold the umbilical cord with your right hand, and place its curvature in the space between the fingers of your left hand, and gently insert your hand and grasp the umbilical cord in one of those places we have mentioned, until you reach the empty cavity.
Then place and apply another umbilical cord, or a third if necessary, so that there is equal traction, and there is not extension only along its straightness.
Rather, it should be pulled evenly on all sides, so that its removal is eased, just as it is done with a tooth before its extraction.
And it is necessary in this that which is between them that the extension be softened; and if any part of it is retained, then it is necessary that the midwife lubricate some of her fingers with oil and expertly insert them and loosen that which is retained with them.
Therefore, if part of the fetus is expelled, then the umbilical cords should be moved to a higher location; and do this until the entire fetus is expelled.
But if one hand emerges before the other, and it is not possible to reduce it because of its constriction, then it is necessary that a cloth be wrapped around it; and then extract it until it is entirely expelled, and incise it either at the joint of the hand or at the elbow.
And thus you should proceed with the other hand and with both feet.
But if the head of the fetus is large, or a constriction occurs during its emergence, or there is accumulated water on its head, then it is necessary to insert between the fingers a spiny spatula and split the head and extract the water, or to break it with an instrument which is named "alundat", the form of which will be shown with the forms of the other instruments in the chapter which follows this one.
And similarly proceed if the fetus has a naturally large head: then it is necessary to incise it with an algematu, or to grasp it with an alunda as we have said; and then extract the bones with forceps.
And if the head is out but constricted by the clavicles, then it should be split so that the fluid which is in the feet is drained.
But if it is not complicated, nor resists emergence, then you should incise the head immediately as much as you can.
And if the lower part of the abdomen is abscessed or dropsical, then you must perforate it so that the fluid within drains out.
But if the fetus is feet-first, then its extraction is easy, and its passage to the mother's birth canal is easy.
But if it is constricted around the belly and feet, then you must extract it with a cloth wrapped around your hand, and you must incise the belly and feet so that what is within them drains out.
But if the other limbs are extracted and the head remains, then the midwife inserts her left hand; but if the mother's birth canal is open, then she inserts her hand into the uterus, and searches for the head with it, and pulls it with her fingers into the mother's birth canal, and then inserts one or two fingers inside, and pulls it out with them.
And if the mother's birth canal is constricted by a hot abscess that harms her, then it must not be disturbed; instead, it is necessary to administer a perfusion of moist, oily substances. And administer plasters; and bathe the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
And if the fetus is lying on its side, then, if possible, it should be turned: and what we have said should be administered as in the case of a living fetus.
And if this is not possible, then it should be incised in pieces, and extracted.
And it is necessary that no part of the afterbirth be left inside.
And when you have completed all your work, then administer what we have said concerning the treatment of the hot abscesses that might occur in the mother.
And if bleeding occurs, then bathe in styptic waters and administer the other treatment.
And I have seen a woman in whose womb was a dead fetus, and soon after that, she became pregnant again, and again the fetus died. A long time ago, an abscess occurred in his navel; and it swelled until it was opened, and it began to discharge pus.
And I was called to his care, and I treated him for a long time, and the wound did not heal.
Then I applied plasters of strong attraction to him, and I drew out a bone, and after a few days, I drew out another bone; and I was very astonished, since there should not be bones in the abdomen.
And then I considered that they were bones from the dead fetus.
Then I cleansed the wound, and extracted many bones from it, the woman being in good condition, and she lived in this way for a long time, still discharging a little pus.
And I did not consider this to be strange, but rather because in this there is skill and help so that the skillful physician with his hands administers the cure.
Of the forms of the instruments that are necessary to extract the fetus.
Form of incision with which the mother is opened:
This is the form of a constrictor in which the edges are joined, in which joining there are two incisions at the two ends of two shafts. But this incision should be more subtle than the constrictor, and be made of ivory or boxwood.
And let the width of each shaft be about two fingers, and the margin of each about one finger, and the length of each is one and a half palms; and in the middle space between the two shafts are two fastenings of the same wood, which are already fixed, of which the length is half a palm and a little more, and the width of each is about two fingers, or a little more.
And these two additions are inserted into the mouth of the womb so that it is opened with them when you turn the two prescribed incisions.
Another form similar to that one, but more subtle and lighter:
Let it be made of ivory or boxwood, in the likeness of forceps. However, at its extremity are two additions, like those you see, and the length of these additions is about one palm, and the width of each is two fingers.
And when you wish to open the womb with them, then you make the woman lie on the bed with her legs hanging down, that which is between her thighs open. Then open your hand with the instrument, just as you do with scissors, according to the amount you want to widen the opening of the womb, until the woman does what you want.
The form of vertigo which the ancients described:
The form of the instrument with which the fetus is expelled:
The form of the instrument with which a large head is countered (or, dealt with).  The "2" likely indicates a variant or a second type of instrument.
And it resembles forceps which have teeth at the end, like a saw, and sometimes it is made long like forceps, in this way, like a saw, which has teeth like the teeth of a saw with which it is incised and countered (or, dealt with). Form of a small instrument; or, A small instrument's form.
The form of a hook having a spine (or point).
The form of a hook having two spines (or points).
The form of a spatula having two ends with which the head is severed (or cut).
The form of two broad spatulas.
All those instruments are used, and the more the types of those are multiplied and prepared by the artisans, the easier their operation is and the more valued they are by men because of their quantity (or number).
And do not neglect any of those instruments, whatever they may be, that are prepared for you, for the necessity of those is not excusable (or, their necessity cannot be avoided).
Of the extraction of the afterbirth.
When the afterbirth is retained after childbirth, then you should order the patient to hold her breath, and then make her sneeze forcefully, and press your hand over her mouth and nostrils, and if by this it is expelled, it is good.
And if not, then you take a pot and pierce a hole in its lid and put herbs inside it, opening the mother's mouth, such as rue, chamomile,  Arabian gum, cassia wood, and St. John's wort (or goldenrod). All these herbs, or some of them, should be submerged in water in the pot, and place that over the fire.
And then place a reed cannula in the mother's mouth, and hold it there until the vapor reaches the mother's womb (or inner cavity).
And then make her sneeze as we have said, and the afterbirth will be expelled quickly.
But if this treatment remains ineffective and it is not expelled, then you instruct the midwife to submerge her left hand in sesame oil or mallow poultice, and then insert it into the vagina and search for the afterbirth with it. And when it has been found, then take it and extract it little by little. But if it is attached to the womb of the mother, then she should insert her hand as we have described, and when she has found the afterbirth, extract it little by little as recommended, so that the mother does not collapse from the vehement traction. Furthermore, it should be moved to the right and left sides easily.
And if the mother's mouth (cervix) is constricted, we have already recommended treatment with sneezing and with herbal oil medication.
But if it is not expelled by all the methods we have recommended, then be careful not to tire yourself with repeated attempts at extraction. However, what has come out at the mother's mouth (cervix) should be tied to the woman's thigh, and then cauterize it with ointment and tetrafarmaco; for this will cause it to fester over a few days and it will dissolve and be expelled.
But when it festers, a foul odor rises to the head and stomach, and this harms the patient; and then fumigations suitable for this should be administered.
But some of the Ancients already tested fumigation with hellebore and dried figs.
Method of instrumentation by which a woman is fumigated for the retention of menses and the afterbirth:
Let it be made of glass or bronze.
And let the thin end be placed in the vagina and the wide end over the fire, and the fumigation be placed on the embers of the fire.
And let her hold that until the fumigation is consumed and then another.
Concerning the treatment of an imperforate anus in a child.
Many children are born and their anuses are not perforated, which are very narrow and obstructed. Then it is necessary for the midwife to perforate that narrow passage with her finger; and if not, perforate it with a sharp instrument, and be careful not to touch the rectum.
And then place on it wool soaked in wine and oil; and then treat it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear that it is obstructed, then place a cannula in the opening for several days, and remove it when the child wants to defecate.
And sometimes anal obstruction occurs due to the consolidation of a wound or abscess; then it is necessary that this consolidation be incised, and then it should be treated with what we have said about the treatment and the lead [presumably referring to lead-based ointments].
Of the treatment of fistulas that develop below. (or "Of the treatment of fistulas which appear lower down.")
The fistulas that develop in the lowest part below are knotty and thick, which develop near the anus externally or in the space between the parts.
And it is one fistula or several.
And since that knot is old and discharges a watery white humidity or subtle pus, and sometimes some of these fistulas are penetrating.
And those penetrating ones are known because of what comes out of them through discharge and flatulence; and sometimes the patient suffers from discharge, and worms easily come out of them.
And sometimes these fistulas penetrate into the space, into the bladder, and into the urethra; and some penetrate into the hip joint and into the buttock.
And what distinguishes a fistula penetrating into the anus from one that is not penetrating, is that you put your finger inside the anus, and insert a thin probe of bronze or iron into the fistula when there is no tortuosity.
But if there is tortuosity in it, then insert a thin probe of lead or horsehair into it until you feel the probe or hair on your finger.
And if you do not feel it at all, nor does anything come out of the opening, neither discharge, nor worms, nor flatulence, as we have said, then know that it is non-penetrating, and then turn your attention to its treatment.
And when the fistula penetrates into the bladder or into the urethra, then its sign is the presence of urine in it, and it is forbidden to use that place for anything until the area is healed with medicine.
But if it penetrates into the joint of the hip or into the bone and causes pain in the surrounding area, then its sign is that the probe penetrates as far as the bone if there is no tortuosity in the bone, and pain occurs in the surrounding area; and that it always produces suppuration; and that no medication works, nor does it heal with ointment.
And in all these penetrating fistulas, there is no complete cure, and the treatment of these is the work and vanity of foolish physicians, on which it is founded.
But in that which is not penetrating and not chronic, healing with iron is hoped for, according to what I will recommend to you, and this I have already proven.
And let the patient lie between your hands on his back and raise his legs upwards, so that his thighs are inclined towards his belly, and then introduce a lead or bronze probe, if there is tortuosity in the fistula, until you know the place where the probe reaches.
And if the patient feels pain around the anus, then you should insert your finger into the anus.
And if you feel the probe itself penetrating through your finger, beyond what you feel between your finger and that abscess or flesh, then you know for certain that it is penetrating; and then do not work on it, for there is no healing in it, as we have said.
However, some say that it heals in some men slowly.
And the medication by which help is expected for him is that you ignite a fine cautery according to the width of the fistula, as has been previously described, and insert that ignited cautery into the fistula until it reaches around the anus; and then repeat this two or three times until you know that all those fleshy, fistulated parts resembling a bird's feather quill are cauterized.
And then treat it with poultices wrapped in linen until all the cauterized flesh sloughs away, and then treat it with flesh-generating and consolidating medicines, and if it is healed, good; and if not, then it will not heal at any time by any other treatment.
And if the probe enters, but does not penetrate beyond your finger which is in the anus, and between that and the probe there is a thick layer of flesh or abscess, and sometimes the fistula is in such a way that it is only superficial at the beginning, then dry the beginning of the fistula, and you will see it drying with the probe, and it will be in the fistula until the incision reaches the place where the end of the probe arrives, and through the probe it is freed and cauterized.
And then cleanse those fistulated tissues which resemble a bird's quill and leave no trace of them behind.
But if a flow of blood sometimes comes between you and your operation when you cauterize those tissues, then the best and lightest instrument is to cauterize with fire or with a sharp medicine, because cauterization with fire achieves two good things: that is the cauterization of those affected tissues, and the stoppage of bleeding and drying of the humors.
And then treat it with poultices wrapped in linen or crushed fabric until the place is free of pus, and then treat the wound with ointments that generate and consolidate firm flesh.
And these are medicines in which there is stypticity and desiccation; when then it is restored, it is healed and we do not fear recurrence.
But if the fistula penetrates to the rectum and is far from the surface of the body, then insert your finger into the rectum and examine it with that.
And so if you feel the fistula and between you and it there is a veil of fat or flesh, and it is close to penetration, then there is no operation there except by way of trust and hope.
Which requires administering one of three methods: either cauterize it as we have said; or dry it until you reach its cavity so that you can introduce the poultices and the cure is near; and do not proceed much with incision so that you do not cut the muscle containing the rectum, and that happens to the patient thus without their will; and then treat it with what we have said because it will heal very quickly; or lengthen that veil and clean that pus until you dry it near the rectum, as we have said, either with a probe or with another instrument with a sharp end, and then cleanse those fistulous tissues which are in the section where you can with cauterization; and then strive to make the restoration of the whole wound with incision, and if the orifice above is not consolidated, and the fistula remains open in the part of the rectum, it will be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula ends in this way: when you insert the probe into the fistula, and it is in the side of the rectum near the surface of the body with the curvature and in the margin of the rectum, then take a probe with a perforated end, which is like a needle for preparing hides in this shape:
and insert it into that fistula wrapped in five threads or around them; and then insert a probe with thread into the fistula until you reach its cavity.
But if it penetrates into the margin of the rectum more inwards, then you pull the thread from that hole so that you insert your finger into the rectum; and pull out the end of the thread and join the two ends together, and tighten each one, and leave it for a day or two, and when you incise the thread more into the flesh, tighten it well so that the tissues are incised which are between the two ends of the thread and that they fall.
And then treat the wound until it is consolidated and healed.
But if the opening of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate, in whatever way is prepared for you, except that it is very deep, because it is not for you to do this so that you do not incise the muscle; and then treat it until it is healed.
The form of the pointed spatula with which the fistula is opened: its curvature is very sharp and the other part is not sharp, so that it does not incise what is unnecessary, as sometimes happens.
Concerning the suturing of hemorrhoids from which blood flows during their incision.
Hemorrhoids are of two types, for either they are between the buttocks, similar to charcoal, or they are like bunches of grapes. And of these, there are small and large ones, and blood constantly flows from them, and there is one, and there are many, and they are outside the anus, and at its extremities.
However, those that are outside the anus are, according to the majority, of little humidity, from which a citrine liquid or a little blood flows continuously, and their color is according to the constitution.
And the treatment of that which is inside the anus is that you command the patient to sit and strain until the anus opens and the hemorrhoids appear to you. Then you should grasp and lift them with hooks or hold them with your fingernail, and then incise them at their roots.
But if the hooks cannot hold them because of their humidity and softness, then grasp them with a rough cloth or cotton or a pledget of wool, and extract them with your fingers, and then incise them and sprinkle some hot powders on them near the incision, so that they act in place of cautery; or cauterize them as is described in the chapter on cauterization. And then treat them with the other treatments until they are healed.
And if the anus does not yield to opening, then  stimulate the patient with a small, mildly irritating enema, and wash it with that water which is in the anus and which will gently cause it to open when the patient strains.
But if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is slight, and you should grasp them with your fingernail, or grasp them with a hook, and incise them, and then treat them with what we have said until they are healed.
And that which you have incised, you must suture as follows: take waxed thread and insert it into a needle and then pull the hemorrhoids together at the upper ends, and make the needle penetrate the root on the other side, and wrap the two ends of the thread in the lower part of the needle, and it should be laterally; and tighten the hemorrhoid with a strong suture, and then tie the thread and remove the needle.
And do this to all of them, and leave one of them unsutured, so that the excess blood may flow from it.
And then place on the anus a cloth soaked in rose oil or cerate; and place that on the anus and command the patient to rest. And then leave it until it falls off; and when it has fallen off, treat it with ointment or other treatment until it is healed.
And since they are old and that medicine is not effective, then you must scrape them with the point of a spatula or with your fingernail until they are moist and the crust above is removed, which prevents their consolidation; and then treat them until they are healed.
Then remove them with more forceful scraping than the first time, until they bleed a lot and are excoriated; and then treat them until they are healed.
Know that *alamermar*, that is, a nail (ingrown toenail), is nothing but a red nodule according to the color of the body, similar to the head of a clove, and it is found throughout the body, and especially in the parts below the feet and in the fingers, and because of these, pain occurs in the area.
And then it is necessary that what is in the circumference of the nail be incised, and held with forceps or a hook, and be eradicated from its root; and then treat it.
And if you wish, cauterize it according to what was described in its chapter.
But a wart is a small, rough, fistulated, round eminence on the surface of the body, and it often appears on the hands of children.
And its cure is to excise and incise it, or to bind it tightly with a thread or a hair so that it falls off. And if you wish, cauterize it, as we have said, with fire or with a sharp medicine (caustic).
But a mole is a small, rough or fistulated, large eminence on the surface of the body, growing mostly in the hair, and when friction encounters it, it is felt like an ant bite, and it is found all over the body.
And its cure is that you take a cannula of goose quill or vulture feather, and let it be strong, and place it over the mole so that the circle of the cannula contains the parts of it; and then rotate your hand with the cannula so that you incise what is in the circumference of the mole, and place it in the depth of the flesh, and eradicate the mole from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a brass or iron cannula according to this method:
Let the upper part of the cannula be drawn out to a thinness, blunt (that is, not perforated), wrapped so that the pressure on it may be lessened and its rotation facilitated.
And if you wish, cauterize the mole as previously described in the cauterization of a boil in the chapter on cautery.
Concerning the instruments that are used to administer the chrism (or, more generally,  ointments/medicaments).
Sometimes chrism is made of silver, or lead, or molten or hammered brass; and sometimes it is made of these instruments, small and large, according to those to whom it is administered, for that which is administered in the treatment of small children should be small; and for those whose buttocks are fragile or painful, the instruments for them should be small.
The form of a large and a small instrument (cautery):
The head of the cannula above, to which the pouch is tied, should be wide in this manner; and there should be a distinction where the pouch is tied, as you see.
And the lower extremity of it, which is inserted into the anus, should be blunt (that is, not open) and very smooth, tending towards subtlety; and on one of its sides there should be two holes, and on the other side one hole, and the width of the hole should be according to the thickness of the rays and a little larger.
And let the pouch, in which the medicines are placed, be of animal bladder or sheepskin, and its length should be one palm.
And let it be perforated with many holes as it is rolled up; and let the space which is between the holes be the thickness of a finger.
Then insert into those holes strong threads of raw silk, about ten threads, or thereabouts; and attach the pouch with this; and when the pouch is placed in position, tie it tightly at the head of the clyster with two distinct strong ligatures, and then cauterize each hole with this.  But the method of cauterizing with this is that you fill the pouch with medicine, which should be heated according to the patient's tolerance; and be careful that it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Then let the patient lie supine on his back, and raise his legs and place under him a cushion upon which are placed men or a sheet; and then anoint the extremity of the clyster with oil or egg white or fenugreek mucilage or the like; and then insert it into the anus easily, and then the attendant should take the pouch and squeeze it with both hands and with force until all that is in the clyster is evacuated into the bowel; and then remove the clyster and the patient lowers his legs.
And if the medicine forces him thus, let him keep it as long as he can; and if he sleeps with it all night, it is more beneficial.
But if you apply this clyster in cases of diarrhea and the evacuation causes pain, then you repeat the clyster until he is cured.
And if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then let the clyster be very thin and soft, of the kind with which infants are given clysters.
Concerning the cure of wounds.
I have already said in the division on the cure of wounds what was appropriate to the book, and I say thus the cure of those with hand and with medicines according to what is fitting.
Therefore I say that wounds are diversified according to what wounds are made with and according to the place upon which the wounds fall.
And the causes by which wounds are often made are thus:  a stone throw, or an incision from a sword or knife, or a blow with a lance, or with a stick, or with an arrow, or similar things of many causes.
But the wounds that are in the locations of the body are thus: a wound which falls upon the head, or the neck, or the feet, or the belly, or the thigh, and similar to those of the limbs.
And I am recounting the cure of certain wounds so that you may apply that reasoning and rule to other wounds.
And I will begin with simple head wounds, for the discussion of compound wounds will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore I say that when a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no fracture, then consider: if it is from a stone throw or something similar, and it has only grazed the scalp and is a large wound, and you fear the occurrence of a hot abscess in that patient, then you must take care and immediately phlebotomize the cephalic vein, and do not delay this; and extract blood from it according to the patient's strength, unless some reason prohibits phlebotomy, especially if the blood that has issued from the wound is slight.
And let the phlebotomy be on the opposite side from the wounded part; and guard the patient from repletion and from wine and from heavy foods.
But if some cause prohibits bloodletting, then let his diet be reduced, and let him not approach meat or wine.
And place on the wound, if a hot abscess occurs in it, a lint cloth soaked in plain rose oil or in wine in which a styptic has been dissolved.
But if it is certain that a hot abscess will form, then place on the wound, if it is fresh, its own blood and the powder which I shall shortly mention, before the air has altered it.
And if the air has already altered it, then apply some ointment until it is healed.
But if the wound is large, or is caused by a sword or similar weapon, and its edges are not joined together, then join those edges with sutures, according to the method of suturing that I shall describe.
But if the wound has exposed the bone and hangs, and there is not much tissue holding it but only a small ligament, then incise it and then treat the wound with medicines and restore the flesh in the place of the bone, and instruct the patient to eat foods that are thick and easily digestible, such as broth and similar foods until it is healed.
And if you find putrefaction in the bone and it does not adhere to the bone, then you incise all that which is rotten and remove it, and then treat it.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which a flow of blood might occur, and it is not stopped by medicines, then you search for the artery, and if you find it uncut, then you incise it with a spatula, or tie it; and if necessity compels you to do what we have said, then you cauterize until the bleeding is stopped.
And if these wounds are simple and small, then their cause is slight; therefore you sprinkle this powder on them, for it consolidates them before the air alters them.
And the manner of making the powder is this: take one part olive oil, two parts dragon's blood, three parts quicklime; let it all be finely ground and sifted, and with it let the wound be filled, and let it be tightly bound until it adheres well to it, and is coagulated with the blood.
And then bind it above with bandages and leave it, and do not unbind it while it is like this, unless it becomes inflamed, for the medicine is not removed from it until it is healed.
And sometimes only heat does this, when you do not have olive oil and dragon's blood at hand.
And do this same operation on large wounds when it is necessary that it be applied to them and they are closed, and they are recent wounds with their blood, which the air has not altered.
And if the air has altered them, and especially if it is in summer, then this powder is not suitable, but rather treat those wounds with what we have said, so that you apply some digestive ointments to them, or that you apply powder made from barley flour with water and honey until they produce pus; and then treat them with the other treatment until they are healed.
But if a fracture in the bone occurs with the wound, and it is small, then you extract it with forceps.
And I will say the treatment of head fractures in what follows.
Of the wounds of the neck.
But if the wound occurs in the neck, then there is no difference in medication between it and a simple wound of the head.
But if the nerves of the neck or an artery are cut, then if it is a nerve, there is no other remedy than to avoid treating it with something that causes strong astringency, such as vitriol and similar substances, because they are harmful to nerves and contract them. And do not apply anything cold to the wound, because the substance of the nerves is cold, and their continuity is with the brain, which is the highest of all the members.
And if it is cured with mild medicines, such as washing the wound with fresh water, sometimes infused with rose oil or plain oil, and applying a poultice after washing with fresh water and other softening herbs in this manner, and moist ointments.
But if the wound is large, then administer sutures, or draw together its lips, and then treat it with powders until it is healed.
But if the wound is deep, or pus has accumulated in its lowest part, then perforate it at the lowest point.
But if an artery has been incised in the wound and bleeding ensues, then separate or dry it, or tie it, or cauterize it if necessity compels you to do so.
But if the vertebrae of the neck have been incised, or some of them, and the veins of the neck are unharmed, then you should join the edges of the wound with sutures above the spinal column and do not touch that; first equalize it and restore it to its natural shape, and then bind it with a suitable bandage, and leave it for a few days; and then treat it with ointments which have styptic and healing properties until it is healed.
But if the wound has damaged the bone, then clean it, and if there are bone fragments in it, extract all those that you can; and what you cannot manage, leave it until the wound suppurates, and is separated, and the inflammation is reduced.
And if the wound is recent, then sprinkle on it the powder which has been recommended to you. But if a fistula has formed in the wound, then treat it with that which will be recalled in its chapter.
If it is a wound from a lance or knife, and you see its depth, then consider further if there is a discharge of air from the wound when the patient breathes; then know that the wound is mortal.
And if it is not deep and the wound is recent with its own blood, then you place on it the powder at the first hour, and do not bind it tightly so that the blood is not retained in its depth and returns to the heart and kills the patient, but place on it attractive ointment, and unbind it twice a day.
And if the ointment is not at hand, then you place old linen on the opening of the wound so that it draws out that which is of the humors; and make the patient sleep on the wound so that that which is in it flows out.
But if three days or more have passed since the wound and it has not caused the patient spasms or tremors of the heart or constriction of the throat, and you see his other good dispositions, then know that the wound is safe; and then treat it with cauterization and with other treatment until it is healed.
But if its healing is delayed, and it remains open for a long time, then know that a fistula has formed; therefore treat that according to its chapter.
And if the wound is from a cut by a sword or knife, and is simple on the surface of the foot or back, then treat it with what is prescribed for stitching, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
But if it has caused damage to the bone, and pieces have been cut from it, then you cleanse the wound and try to extract those pieces, if they are separated. But if they are not separated, then leave them until the wound is suppurated, so that their extraction is facilitated.
And for other accidental wounds in other limbs, the treatment is the same as what we have said.
Of wounds of the abdomen.
The indisposition which happens in the belly is either great, or small, or moderate.
And a small rupture is made difficult in another way, and it is such that their reduction is more difficult, if you do not take care of their replacement immediately, because it opens and swells, wherefore their insertion is made difficult.
Therefore the best rupture is moderate, because in that one the reduction of the intestine is not difficult, as it is difficult in the two species previously mentioned.
And know that the suturing of the belly is according to four methods, but two sutures are common which are suitable for the suturing of other wounds of the body.
And two other sutures proper [to the belly] communicate with other wounds, but however they are more proper in the suturing of the belly.
And I recount to you each one with exposition and explanation.
Therefore I say that when the wound is small and some part of the intestine has come out through it, and it is difficult to reduce it, then this is in one of two ways: either because of the smallness of the rupture as we have said, or when the intestine has become inflamed by the coldness of the air.
And therefore when this is so, then it is necessary that you warm it in such a way that you submerge a sponge or cloth moistened in lukewarm water alone, or that you boil it in water with squill, cyperus, and spikenard, and bathe the intestine with it until the inflammation is resolved.
And sometimes it is done with something that has astringency, and it is better than water alone in resolving the inflammation.
And so when you see the inflammation to be resolved, then you moisten the intestine with water in which mallow and marshmallow have been boiled, for by this the replacement of it is eased with little difficulty.
But if the replacement of it is hindered despite this treatment, then incise the rupture a little with an instrument with which hemorrhoids are incised.
And the first treatment is better, when it is proper that there is no incision, and there is no need to dry it because of necessity and weakness.
Of the instrument, this is its form:
One part of it is sharply curved, and the other part not-sharp, and the end subtle, and not with the subtlety of a spatula, rather somewhat blunt.
And so when the wound is enlarged and the intestine is outside, then it is necessary that its reduction be according to its natural form, in its proper place, if possible, for that is better.
But when the rupture is wide, and is in the lower part of the belly, then it is necessary that you make the patient lie on his back, and raise his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the upper part of the belly, then you raise his head and feet higher than the lower parts.
And similarly, if the rupture is in one of the two sides of the belly, then always keep your attention and consideration on this, so that the part in which the wound is, is higher than the other.
And thus you should administer this in large wounds and in medium-sized wounds.
And in small wounds, apply what you have prepared, and then have the assistant place his gentle hands between your hands, who will hold the entire rupture with his hand and adjust its lips, and then uncover from that side to that side so that the suture is somewhat more certain.
And this is the common method of suture: first, take the needle, or several needles according to the size of the wound; then leave the needle's end from the ring finger of the wound, and pull the needle, making sure not to put thread in the two ends of the stitch, with two ends of the thread, which are under the stitch of the inner parts until you make it penetrate that part; and you will already have added the two ends of the stitch and the two ends of the thread, and that makes four rows [or layers].
Then tighten with double thread in the circle of the needle, and sometimes on both sides together, and then bring together the two lips of the wound by decent approximation; and then leave the width of a finger and insert another needle there, and then tie that one with thread as you tied the first needle; and do not cease doing this with the needles if necessary until you have completed the entire closure of the wound.
And let the needles be of medium size between thickness and thinness, for thin needles very easily lacerate the flesh; and thick ones are difficult to insert into the stitch, and therefore they should be of medium thickness and thinness.
And it is not fitting that the needle be inserted too deeply into the two ends of the stitch, so that the flesh is not lightly lacerated and the wound opens before its consolidation.
And the sutures should not be too long, lest the wound be hindered from healing.
Then cut the ends of the needles so that they do not injure the patient during their sleep; and you will place over the suture finely powdered herbs from all parts, which will hold the ends of the needles; and leave those there until you know that the wound is healed.
And this type of suture with needles is most convenient in small wounds, because in their suturing one or two needles or thereabouts suffice.
But the second suture is common: and it is that you sew together the four ends, of the wound and two ends of the lip, at once, with a needle around which is wrapped thread of equal fineness and thickness.
Then, when with the needle you have penetrated these four ends, return the needle to the same place from which you began, so that the drawn thread falls from the highest part to the wound, so that the suture is like a cloth suture with which cloths are sewn together.
And place between each suture the width of the little finger.
And this suture is known to men.
And with such a suture I sewed up a wound which had happened to a man in his belly, who had been wounded with a knife, and the disruption of the wound was greater than a palm, and two palms of intestine had come out from the middle of the wound, and the disruption was in the middle of the member; and then I reduced it after the intestine had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours.
And the wound was consolidated in the space of fifteen days or thereabouts, and I cured him and he is healed; and afterwards he lived for many years, and is preserved in his faculties.
And the other physicians had judged that he would not be healed; and it was by a miracle, for I did not cure him with ointment, because it was in a place where ointment was not found nor any medicine, but I placed on the wound old linen twice a day and assiduous washing with honey water until he was healed.
But I will describe two kinds of sutures proper, according to the account of Paraula (or possibly a name similar to that).
And it is that you begin with the suture of the gut, and introduce the needle from the outside to the inside.
And then, as the needle penetrates the gut and that same laceration, according to the width and length of the whole body, leave the end of the thread in which you have inserted the needle; and make the needle penetrate the other end from the inside to the outside at the other end of the wound.
And when you have made that penetration, then you make it penetrate again in that same end of the wound from the outside to the inside; and leave the end of the thread that is on this side, and make the needle penetrate the other end from the inside to the outside.
And make it penetrate with that penetration with which you make it penetrate the thread at the end of the wound which is on his side until all of it penetrates.
And then begin on that same side and sew it with the end of the thread on the other side, and extract the needle from the gut which it penetrated, and then return it to that gut and sew the end of the thread which is on the other side with this end of the wound; and extract it from the gut which is on his side.
And do this once and again, and do this once and then again until you sew up all that is outside according to that example.
And the sum of this manner of suture is that you sew with a skin suture, with which you sew skins, so that you sew the gut once from the side of the end of the gut, and that you leave it another time until you have completed it.
But the second proper kind of suture, which I call, say, "Gualia," and this is spoken of by him and recounted by him, is that you sew it according to the resemblance with which some physicians sew it, so that you join each part to its corresponding part conveniently by nature; and apply the end of one side and the end of the wound to the other end of the side, and this is done as I have recounted to you.
So that you place the needle in the end of the wound closest to you on the outside part, and make it penetrate the inside part in that sole place, and leave two ends of the intestine; and then turn the needle and make it penetrate from outside to inside in the two ends of the intestine.
And then turn each of those, and make each penetrate from the inside part to the outside part in the other two ends of the wound which are on the opposite side.
And this manner of suture is better than the common, light suture, and it is the suture of which I have previously made mention.
This is the discourse of Gualia.
And moreover, some say the suture of the belly is rectified with two needles, that is, that you insert into each of these a thread, and begin with the insertion of the needle from the side that is towards you, and make it penetrate to the other side according to the suture of those who sew hearts similarly.
And know that when the disruption is in the middle of the belly, then its suture is more difficult than in other places of the belly.
But the judgment of the medication of a wound is the judgment of other wounds.
The reason is that when you cleanse a fresh wound with its own blood before the air alters it, and you return the intestine and sew it and dress it properly, then place incarnative powder on it.
And if the air has already altered the wound, then place on it some ointments that are at your disposal until they form a hard scab and the threads fall out and are consolidated with cyprus and myrrh; and then treat it as the treatment of other wounds until it is healed.
But if you do not have those medicines at hand, then immediately apply, as soon as it begins to suppurate, old lint, and change it twice a day, as you have been taught, until it heals, for you will not need other medication in many situations when the wounds are simple.
But if you fear that the wound will spread infection to the principal members, then you should submerge lion wool in good quality tempered oil, or in rose oil, and place it in the area around the armpits and under the arms.
And if you feel pain or putrefaction in the intestines, for this often happens, then cauterize it with warm black astringent wine, especially if the putrefaction has reached the intestine and has made a penetrating exit into its cavity.
And know that a wound in the large intestine is easier to heal than one in the small intestines.
And it is difficult to heal because the intestine which is called "jejunum" does not receive complete healing from a wound; and this is due to the great multitude of veins that are in it and because of their size within it, and because of the subtlety of its substance, and because of its proximity to the nature of the nerves.
But if what comes from the wound is the web [likely referring to the omentum or similar tissue], and you obtain it fresh, reduce it according to your skill with which you reduce the intestines similarly.
But if it has passed into the space and has already turned green or black, then bind it tightly with a bandage over the blackened area, so that bleeding occurs, because there are veins and arteries in that web [tissue].
And then incise that which is beyond that ligament, and let two ends of the bandage hang down from the part below the wound, so that the traction of the [injured] tissue towards the falling of the web and emission of the arm of the wound may be relieved from you.
A recollection/reminder of wounds when they happen in the intestine.
When a rupture occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it is possible that it can be restored in some men, because I saw one who had been wounded in his belly by a lance thrust, and the wound was on the right side of the stomach, and the wound was old and had formed a fistula, and from it issued gas and flatulence.
Then I pursued his cure, although I was not confident in his recovery, but I continued to treat him until he was healed and the place was consolidated/healed.
And I, after I saw the place consolidated, feared for the patient that some accident might befall him in his belly; and no such accident occurred, and he resumed his usual diet of eating and drinking, and then entered a bath and exercised himself according to his abilities.
And some experienced men have said that when a wound occurs in the intestine and it is small, then it should be bound in this manner: that you take ants with large heads; and then adjust the two lips of the wound and place one of those ants, its mouth open, over the two lips of the wound; then when it bites those and tightens its mouth, cut off its head, for it adheres and does not dissolve.
And then place another ant next to the first, and do not cease to do this with ants, one next to another, according to the size of the whole wound.
And then reduce and sew the wound; and let those attached heads remain in the intestine until the intestine is healed; and let no harm befall the patient.
And it is also possible that the intestine be sewn with fine thread which is made from the intestine of an animal, passed through a needle; and it is that you take the end of these intestinal threads, and let it be well scraped, and then tie the end of it with the thread, wrapped, and then insert that thread into needles and sew with that the intestine, and reduce that into the disruption.
And this method of suturing with ants is only according to a way of trust and hope.
But if the wound is large and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines, because then it is only a reduction, and not a complete healing of it.
Of the treatment of a fistula and fistula.  (Note:  The repetition suggests a distinction might be intended, perhaps different types of fistula, or fistula and a related condition).
Know that every wound and abscess, when it ages and becomes old, and becomes an ulcer, and is not consolidated and discharges pus constantly and is not excised, then, in whatever member it may be, is universally called a fistula, and we call that a fistula (or zukem).  (The repetition and slight difference in spelling suggests a possible dialectal variation or a synonym.)
And a fistula, according to truth, is a hardened, white nodule, with which there is no pain, and which has a concavity like the concavity of a bird's claw; and for this reason it is called a claw-like ulcer, that is, a claw.
And in some men it is moist, which discharges pus; and quickly the moisture is excised in a few hours. And sometimes this moisture is thick, and is little, and is coarse, and is subtle. (This describes the variability of the discharge.)
I have already shown all those causes, and the signs of them and their treatment with medicines in the division (of the treatise).
And it is necessary that I make known to you the treatment of a fistula, which is done by means of a surgical operation with the hand.
And know that fistulas occur in all the members of the body; for there are fistulas that reach the large veins and arteries, or the nerves, or the diaphragm, or the intestine, or the bladder, or one of the ribs, or one of the vertebrae of the back, or one of the joints composed by composition, such as those of the hand and foot; and those that affect the proximity of the main member and its similar parts.
Therefore, that one of these fistulas, which is according to this manner, is among the illnesses of difficult healing, and does not receive treatment, and occupation with it is labor and ignorance.
And if it is one of the fistulas whose depth does not reach those places that I have mentioned, and you hope and trust in its healing, and want to reach its knowledge, then take a probe of bronze or iron, and if the fistula goes straight, and search for it with that.
But if the fistula is tortuous, then investigate it with a subtle lead probe, because lead, with the lightness of its body, is easily bent along the tortuous path.
And if the fistula has very horrific contents, it is not possible for you to examine it with a probe.
Then, cleanse the orifices through its orifices, because the moisture by which you cleanse it goes through the other orifices and cleanses them.
And then inquire carefully, in whatever way possible for you to know if there are bones or nerves here, and if the depth of the fistula is far or near, or is it a fistula which has many orifices and is situated there; do all this with the utmost of your strength, with your questioning, with which you question the patient, and the discovery of the pain through your compression with the hand on the area, and similar signs and accidental causes to the abscess.
And when you have ascertained all these things with true judgment, then proceed to the treatment with confidence: and it is that you consider then if the fistula is close at hand or in a safe place, far from a joint, or from a nerve, or from an artery, or from a vein, or from one of the places which I have told you.
Then you dry the fistula as previously described, and remove what is in that filtration and of corrupted flesh, and that which has grown in the orifice of the flesh, or of cartilage and the like, and treat it until it is healed.
But if the fistula is of great depth, and is straight, then it is necessary that you incise it in the front as much as is possible for you, and then cleanse it of all its corrupted flesh; and then apply cauteries wrapped in sharp medicines, and introduce them into the depth of the fistula, which you have grasped with an instrument.
And do this several times until the sharp medicine corrodes all that is rotten in the depth of the fistula from the corruption.
And then restore it with ointments which generate healthy flesh until it is healed.
But if it is not healed by this, then you cauterize it as we have recounted.
But if the cause of the fistula is bone and you are certain of this, then you investigate it and dry it as we have recounted, if you do not prohibit any cause from a vein or nerve or principal member as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed to you and there is some corruption and blackness in it, then you scrape it until all the corruption is removed; and then treat it with that which will cause it to grow flesh until it is healed.
And if it is not healed and discharges pus as it did before, then know that you have not reached the total eradication of the corruption; and then uncover it again and meticulously scrape it and cleanse it with all your strength, and then restore it.
And so if it is healed, good; and if not, then know that that corruption is in the deep recesses of the body, which has not been reached, and then for you in that case there is nothing to do but leave it.
And if the corrupted bone is small, or it is possible for you to pull it out, then pull it out with fine forceps which are suitable for this.
And if there are many bones, then meticulously remove all of them, and do not leave any behind with your strength.
But if some of the moisture causes you difficulty, and there is no fear or mistake in their incision, then incise those ligaments or flesh if they are there, and free the bones.
But if you are not prepared to remove the bones at this time, then apply something to the wound that will fester the wound, and leave it until it has reached the area around those bones of flesh and ligaments, and keep the wound from healing, and keep the incision you made during the operation constricted.
Having said that, if you are afraid, place on it a cloth soaked in crushed rue with oil, or a cloth soaked in Egyptian ointment, or in any of the green ointments, for when those ligaments fester, and the bones are separated from them, their removal and extraction is eased.
But if it is a large bone, such as a leg bone or thigh bone or similar, and only its surface is corrupted, then scrape it with a rasp only from behind until the blackness and corruption are removed, and then restore the wound.
But if the corrupted part is large, and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to close that and incise everything up to the place where the corruption has reached, and then treat it until it heals.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his thigh so that you may use this as an example and help in your operation.
There was a young man, about thirty years old, who experienced pain in his thigh, and from the inner parts, pus rose to the surface within the body until the pus reached the thigh; it was a matter of an abscess with a large swelling, and there was no external cause for it.
And then time was wasted with it because of the doctors' mistakes, until the abscess was opened, and much matter flowed from it. Its treatment was then delayed until the leg was fistulated, and many orifices were made in it, all discharging pus and the body's humors.
And then many doctors treated him for about two years, and none of them were skillful in the art, until I was called.
And I saw his leg and the matter flowing from those orifices in great quantity; and the man's body was quite emaciated, and his complexion was jaundiced.
And then I inserted a probe into one of those orifices and the probe reached the bone.
And then I quickly examined all the orifices and found that they reached to all parts of the leg.
And then I carefully incised one of those orifices until I uncovered a part of the bone, and I found it corrupted, and it was already rotten and corrupt and blackened; and a part of the leg was already corrupted, to the extent that it had penetrated to the marrow.
And then I sawed away what was exposed and prepared of the exposed bone.
And I judged that in the bone there was only that corruption which I had excised and sawed, and I had already removed it.
And then I applied the restoration of the wound with consolidating medicine for a long time, and it is not healed.
And then I again incised and uncovered the bone a second time over the first uncovering, and I found continuous corruption in the bone.
And I sawed away what appeared to me of that corruption, and then I was frustrated in making its cure and restoration, and it is not restored.
And then I uncovered it again and did not cease to incise the bone little by little, piece by piece, and I forced its restoration, and it was not restored until I had incised about a palm's breadth of it, and that I extracted with its marrow, and then I restored that with medicines, and it is lightly consolidated and healed.
And it is not necessary to iterate the operation on it and sectioning of it except for the disposition of its fragility and for the scarcity of its tolerance and its fear of death, because syncope afflicted him at all hours due to superfluity of evacuation.
And therefore he is healed by a complete healing, and there is nothing in place of the hard bone flesh; and its disposition in his body is made good and its strength has returned; and he is restored to his dispositions and experienced no impediment in walking nor harm in any matter.
But if it is a prominent bone in place of the flesh already removed, then it is necessary that you cut that according to this manner: and that is that you take a ligature and bind that to the extremity of that prominent bone, and command someone to extend that upwards; and place that woolen ligature thicker than the first ligature; and then tie that over the flesh that is beneath the bone, and extend the extremity of it so that you draw the flesh to the parts below, and you uncover the flesh over the place which you wish to saw so that the saw does not injure the flesh.
And place a piece of wood or a board decently beneath the bone, for when you do this, it is not forbidden that the saw should not cut the corrupted flesh.
And it is necessary that the sawing be done over the corrupt place little by little, because if the corruption is in the concavity of the bone and does not appear in its outward appearance to the senses, then force the sawing of it another time.
And if the bone is corrupt and not prominent, but one part is continuous with the other, and the corruption is in the middle or in part of it, then you uncover the flesh on all sides completely; and then place wood underneath, and then saw it from the first part where the corruption is until the sawing is continuous with the other part.
And let the sawing be according to the location of the corruption, little by little, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, incise that corrupt joint, and saw the bone where it is continuous with the other part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no reason for it but ingenuity/skill.
And if the corruption is in the bone of the hand or foot, it is very difficult; however, you must investigate the corruption in whatever way it appears to you, and you must open it, and clean it according to any disposition which is possible for you, and with each tool it should be rectified for you, when it does not harm you by vein or nerve.
And know that the incisors and saws for incising these bones are many, according to the location of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness, and their subtlety and size and smallness, and their hardness and rarity; therefore it is necessary that you prepare for every kind of operation an instrument convenient for that operation.
And know that this operation signifies to you the type of instrument of which you should make use; for with great study and long experience in the methods of this art, and witness of many illnesses, you will then have for yourself what is suitable in instruments for every illness.
And I am giving you in the end of this chapter the number of instruments which you will keep as simple tools with which you will proceed to your treatment which you will test against others. Form of saw:
Form of another saw:
Form of another large saw:
Shape/Form of a ray (or spoke): Let the head of this ray be according to the form of a star-shaped nail head, and its points be according to the form of the points of a [surgical] instrument (possibly a lancet or similar).
And it is only suitable that with this [instrument/ray] the heads of the joints are rubbed when they are corrupted, or the opening is very wide.
Form of a smaller razor:
Form of a wide razor (or possibly a "broad" razor, depending on the intended meaning of "lat").
Form of another saw, decently made: let the arc of it be made as high as possible and its sharpness of iron, and its member of suitably made wood. Its form/shape:
Form of a razor which has a concavity:
Form of another, subtle razor:
Form of another razor with a curved end:
Form of a small razor similar to a probe:
Form of another, smaller incisor:
Form of another incisor; this one resembles a ray, and its end is like a saw, and is used in many places in the treatment of bones:
Form of a ray which is suitable for the treatment of those who have perforated bones:
And its end is triangular and sharply pointed.
And it is made of Indian iron, and similarly, it is necessary that all the things we have said of razors, and of incisors, and of saws [apply to this instrument as well].
Concerning the incision of extremities and the sawing of bones.
Extremities may suffer [from corruption] due to intrinsic or extrinsic causes. If, after having treated the corruption with medicines, the treatment is ineffective, or if you see the corruption spreading through the limb without any apparent cause, then you must incise that limb up to the point where the corruption reaches, so that the patient escapes death or the greater harm of limb loss.
And the sign of this [condition] affecting someone is that the limb turns black as if fire had burned it, or the blackness spreads until the corruption reaches the limb and spreads throughout the body; therefore, treat it with incision.
Similarly, if the cause of the corruption is the impact of some poisonous thing, such as a sea scorpion, or a viper, or a shrew, and the like.
And if the corruption or injury is in the extremity of a finger, then you should incise the finger and not allow the corruption to spread to the hand.
And similarly, if it affects the hand, then you should incise it from the base of the hand, and not allow the corruption to spread to the forearm.
And if it affects the arm, then incise the arm up to the elbow joint.
And if the corruption passes beyond and you see it around the elbow, then in that case the patient's death is certain; and to administer any other treatment beyond that is a waste of effort.
And similarly, for the foot: when corruption affects the toe, then you should incise it up to one of the ankle bones.
And if it takes hold in the heel of the foot, then you should incise the entire foot. But if it ascends to the knee, then you should incise the leg up to the knee joint.
And if the corruption has already reached the knee, then there is no remedy for him but resignation, and to leave the patient to die.
And the manner of incising or amputating a limb is that you should tighten a ligature on the lowest part that you wish to incise, and tighten another ligature above the location; and let an assistant extend a ligature to the lower parts, and let another assistant extend a ligature above; and you separate the flesh which is between the two ligatures, thus spreading it open until all the flesh is exposed; and then it should be incised or amputated.
And it is necessary that a linen cloth be placed on all parts so that it does not touch the healthy area, and that the patient may receive a suitable dressing and hot poultice.
But if you encounter a flow of blood while operating, then carefully cauterize the affected area, or apply some blood-stanching powders; and then return to your treatment until it is completed.
And then bind the injured limb with a suitable bandage, and treat it until it is healed.
And I recount to you what happened to a man in his foot, this same accident which I have recounted to you, which is that a blackness occurred in his foot from a burn that resembled a fire burn.
And that corruption first occurred in his toe until it affected the whole foot.
And then that man prepared himself, because he saw the affliction spreading through the limb with such vehemence that he was overcome by pain and burning, and he incised that foot up to the joint, and it healed.
A long time later, the same corruption occurred in the finger of his index hand (pointing finger).
And then he came to me, and I tried to repel that excess with what I applied to his hand in the form of medicines, to cleanse his body; and the excess was not repelled and began to spread to another finger until it affected the whole hand.
And he asked me to incise his hand, but I did not want to do so, hoping for the repulsion of that excess, and even more fearing the incision of his hand might prove fatal, because the patient's strength was failing.
And after he left me, he returned to his land, and word reached me that that man prepared and incised his whole hand, and he was healed.
And I have included this account so that it may be helpful in cases of this illness, and that it may serve as a guide on how to understand and treat it.
Concerning the treatment of sinuses and the nature of clyster administration with medicines.
When an abscess occurs in fleshy members and the space of the abscess is extended until it forms a collection of pus, and then it is broken open and perforated, and the pus flows out, leaving a space empty like a vessel, and the skin covering it is like a thin cloth, and it has not reached a state of further corruption, nor does it affect the bone, nerve, or ligament, it is called a sinus, and not a fistula.
However, if the space is extended so that the corruption affects any member, then it is called a fistula, and not a sinus.
And its treatment is to incise that skin completely, just as it is swollen, especially when it is thinned and made like cloth, and ensure that it does not adhere to the location due to its corruption.
But if you suspect that the skin will adhere and that the corruption has not progressed further, and there is a thinning of the skin, then you treat that with a clyster.
And you consider the sinus, and if it is large, and the pus has a foul odor, then you should clysterize it with an Egyptian medicine which is made of oil, sour wine, and resin, taking equal parts, and these should be mixed in a vessel and heated over a fire until the medicine becomes thick and reaches the consistency of honey.
Then take what is necessary from this and dissolve it with water and honey; and clysterize the sinus with this, and constrict its opening, and leave the medicine inside for about two hours.
Then extract that with a syringe; and do this for as many days until the sinus is cleansed and the foul odor is removed.
And sometimes it is clysterized with ash water, when this medicine is not available to you; and you should take the ashes of vines, and put water on them; and then strain this and clysterize with it until you are satisfied that the sinus is clean.
And if the patient does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine or the ash water, then clysterize with water and honey in which crushed resin is mixed, and clysterize with wine and honey mixed, for it is the property of honey to cleanse and wash, and the wine makes it adhere to the sinus, especially when the wine has an excess of astringency and dryness.
And when you have done this several times and are satisfied that the sinus is clean, then clysterize it with something that will cause the flesh to grow there.
And you should take diafinicon ointment and dissolve it with rose oil and astringent wine; or clysterize with other medicines and ointments that have the properties which I have already written about in the treatise on ointments.
And if the orifice of the sinus is narrow, so that the clyster nozzle cannot be inserted, then gradually widen it with a small iron instrument, and place a [small, heated] probe wrapped in Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment inside until it is widened.
And similarly, if the orifice is wide, then bring its lips together with sutures and leave a space into which the clyster can enter without difficulty.
And if the orifice from which the pus flows is located higher up, then drain it at the lowest point so that the pus flows downwards, because when the pus is trapped deep within the sinus, the flesh will not grow there.
And if it is not possible for you to drain the sinus into the lowest possible point as desired, then make sure you prepare the limb with a preparation which allows the pus to flow easily, as is within your ability, ensuring that nothing obstructs the drainage of pus.
But the cloth that is over the opening of the sinus, change that every hour so that the pus that collects there can drain out. And so that you may know if the pus that flows from it is much or little, or if it is digested or undigested.
And with this, you should examine the location of that sinus, whether the patient feels pain there or not, and if there is an abscess there.
And as your treatment continues in this manner, and you see that the matter discharged onto the opening of the sinus has dried, or is about to dry, then on the next day or the third day, loosen it; and when you loosen the dressing, change the cloth to another and renew the ointment.
But if from the sinus nearby, a subtle virus emerges, then do not worry about its adherence, for its healing is approaching, because there are some men in whom the generation of flesh in their wounds is slow, and others in whom the opposite occurs.
And if from the sinus, for many days, undigested pus has emerged, then know that the sinus will not close; and if the closing of the sinus is delayed and the cause is prolonged, then you should adjust the drying properties of the medicines; and if the medicines are moist in their substance and in their effect, use dry ones, such as diachylon ointment,  when there is an excess of added moisture.
And the best remedy with which it is cured is to take diachylon ointment and dissolve it in rose oil, and add to it old, well-aged wine equal in quantity to its substance, and carefully mix it, and use this.
And it acts similarly in that case, when there is no pus: diachylon ointment, honey cooked until thickened, and use this; or take myrrh, aloes, and incense, grind everything and powder it over the honey while it is on the fire, and then apply this to a cloth and bind it over the sinus; or apply it with the honey that you have cooked until it is thickened, and powder it on a cloth and bind it on.
And sometimes, aristolochia longa, roots of lily of the valley (it is lily of the valley), and flour of barley and centaury are administered with it; use these simples or compounded, grind them, sieve them, and powder them over the honey which has been mentioned; and use this.
And if the sinus is prolonged, and is not healed by this treatment, then know that the corruption is in the bone, and it has spread to the bones or to other hard parts or ligaments; then you treat it with fistular treatment, as described above.
Of the treatment of paronychia, and of the treatment of a worn nail, and of the addition of a digit incision, and of its section.
Paronychia is an abscess which arises under the nail of a finger of the hand or foot, and easily spreads to other fingers; and as it is prolonged and its treatment is less valued, it becomes an abscess of hot pus, or it is corrupted, and pus forms until it corrodes the root of the nail, and easily corrupts the whole of it, and easily its corruption penetrates to the bone until there is a foul odour, and the extremity of the finger becomes swollen, and its colour becomes dark.
Therefore, when you have this with what we have said in the division and your treatment is not effective, then it is necessary that you incise with an iron all the superfluous matter that remains of the nail and immediately cauterize the wound there, because cautery is very helpful in this.
But if the bone is sound and the nail is healthy, and the additions of the nail, empty already, compress the flesh at the underlying parts, and begin to prick and hurt it, then it is necessary that you place a thin probe under the angle of the nail that pricks the flesh, and push it up and incise that flesh easily, and place upon what remains of the flesh corrosive and cauterizing medicines until it is all consumed; and then treat this with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption already penetrates the bone, then it is necessary that you incise that bone and extract it, for a bone that is corrupted will never heal.
And if you see the corrosion and corruption spreading into the finger, then you incise it at one of the joints, according to what has been previously mentioned, and immediately treat it until it is healed.
But if the nail suffers from percussion or friction, and there is intense pain in it, then you must first phlebotomize the patient, and immediately cut the nail with a sharp instrument with a transverse incision from above downwards, and take care that the incision does not reach the flesh that is under the nail, for you will cause the patient intense pain, and it will be the cause of the generation of superfluous flesh in the area; and then treat this area with something that relieves pain.
But a finger that is born in the hands of some men is very quickly fleshy all over, and very quickly bony, or very quickly grows a nail.
And some of them are born at the root of a joint, or their growth is in some of the finger joints. But that which is born in some joint of the finger does not hurt, and that which is born in the joints is very quickly painful.
And of those that are born fleshy, the incision is easy, and it is that you incise that one below its root with a broad instrument.
But of that which is born at the root of the joint, the cure is difficult; and therefore beware of its excision.
But in that which is born on a finger between the joints, it is necessary that you first incise its flesh with a circular incision down to the bone, and then saw it with one of those saws suitable for this, and then treat it until it is healed.
But consolidation which happens to the fingers between their joints, whether by the birth of a man thus born, or by the consolidation of a wound, or by burning with fire, or similarly, then it is necessary that you cut that consolidation until the fingers return to their natural form.
And then place between them cloths soaked in rose oil so that they are not lightly consolidated, and separate them, or place between them a thin lead plate until it is consolidated as necessary.
And similarly, if consolidation occurs in some fingers with the palm, then you cut that consolidation according to what is prepared and suitable to the shape of the member.
Concerning the incision of vices, these are varices (varicose veins).
Varices are veins, and they are twisted, thick veins full of melancholic superfluities which appear in many parts of the body, and most commonly in the legs, and especially in the legs of travelers, laborers, and porters.
Then it is necessary that you administer a purging of the body of black bile several times with strong expulsion, and then bleed the patient from the basilica vein.
But the treatment of them with iron is according to two methods: one is that they be incised and that black blood be drawn out, and the other method is that the vein be raised and completely extracted.
The incision is done in this manner: first bathe the leg with very hot water until the thick, feculent blood of the leg is resolved, and then bind the patient's leg from the highest part of the thigh to the part below the knee with a bandage, and then incise the vein in one, two, or three places with a wide incision, and then raise the black blood with your hand from the lower part of the leg upwards, and from above downwards, until the quantity of blood you wish to obtain has been released,  a quantity which will remove the patient's malady.
Then bind it up, and instruct him to abstain from foods that engender black bile.
And repeat the treatment by phlebotomy when the veins are full and this harms the patient.
But the elevation of them is according to this manner: you who raise the patient's leg, if there is much hair on it, then place him in a bath and bathe his leg with hot water until it reddens and the veins are distended; or, if a bath is not available to you, have him perform vigorous exercise until the limb is warmed.
Then incise the vein along its length, either behind the knee, or at the lowest point below the ankle.
Then open the vein with an instrument and scrape it on all sides until it feels sensitive, and it is from its appearance that one sees that redness tending to blackness.
And then, when you have opened the vein, you see that white which is like a cord.
Then you place a leech below it so that it is elevated and is drawn to the vein, and suspend it with a golden hook.
Then make another incision near that incision, three fingers' breadth away, and scrape the vein from the part above the vein until it appears.
Then elevate it and incise it at the back section near the heel, and then extract it and elevate it until it comes out through the second incision, and then extract it from the incision that is above it.
And do this until you extract it from the incision that is highest or most superior of all the incisions, until it is all extracted; and then incise it.
And if it does not obey you to be extracted and elevated, then introduce a strong double-threaded needle and tie it and extract it, or introduce a leech below it and rotate your hand on all sides until it is drawn out. And be careful that it is not incised; for if it is broken, it is made difficult for you to elevate it and it becomes harmful to the patient through that damage.
And when it is all expelled, then place on the wound site wool soaked in rose wine and olive oil, both unmixed and mixed, and treat it until it is healed.
And if the vein is constricted, having a tortuosity in which there is a wrapping around the parts, and it is not straight as we have said, then it is necessary that you incise it at each part of its tortuosity and at the places of its wrapping, and then suspend it with hooks until you elevate it entirely.
And be careful in your incision that you do not cut the vein and that you do not injure it, for it will be difficult for you to elevate it; and use your prudence in this.
Form of the incision with which the vein is cut:
It is not made as sharp as the hooks, nor is it of a sharp extremity, so that it does not injure the vein; and it is of a thick flexibility, for if it were thin, it would cut the vein by its thinness; therefore it has superfluous thickness as we have said.
Of the extraction of the vein of the leg.
This vein is generated in the legs in hot lands, such as Al-Ategi in the land of the Arabs and in the hot and arid lands of India, of little humidity, and in which neither grass nor trees grow.
And it is quickly generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And its generation is from putrefaction that comes from under the skin, just as serpents, worms, scabies, and maggots are generated between the skin and the flesh.
And a sign of the onset of this vein is that a vehement inflammation occurs in the leg; and then the area is blistered; and then the vein begins to emerge from the place of that blister, which resembles the root of a plant.
And when its extremity appears, then you should wrap around it a piece of lead weighing one drachm to two drachms, and bind it, and leave the lead suspended from the leg.
And as many times as any part of it emerges outwards, wrap it in lead and bind it. And if the growth is prolonged, then you should incise a part of it and wrap the remainder; and do not incise its root until it has emerged completely, because if you incise it, it is retracted and enters the flesh, causing an abscess and putrefaction in the place and a bad ulceration.
Therefore, it must be treated gently and extracted little by little, until it is expelled completely and no part of it remains in the body.
And from this vein it has emerged in some men to a length of five palms and fingers, and it has already happened to me that one of twenty palms emerged.
And if it is incised during its treatment, then insert a probe into its opening and perforate it with a long hole into the body, until all that is in it is evacuated, and treat the putrefaction of the place for some days with medicines; and then treat it according to the treatment of abscesses.
And this vein sometimes has many branches, and especially when it appears at the joint of the foot or in the foot, and many orifices appear in it, and a branch emerges from each orifice.
And therefore treat it as we have said in the division and with what has been said above.
Concerning the incision (or cutting) above worms generated under the skin, and it is called bovine sickness (or disease).
This illness is called in some lands near us bovine illness because it often happens to cows, and it is a small worm which is born between the skin and the flesh, and it goes throughout the body, ascending and descending, and is shown by the feeling of its movement from limb to limb until it breaks the skin and comes out.
And its generation is by the putrefaction of certain humors, just as worms, snakes, earthworms, and ascarids happen in the belly (abdomen).
And it is feared because of its malice, for when it goes in the body and is elevated to the head, and has reached the eye, then very quickly it enters it and destroys the eye, and this happens many times.
Therefore, when you wish to cure this and extract it, then it is not done except by its movement and appearance to the feeling (sensation), and then it is necessary that you tightly bind what is above it and what is below it with a strong bandage and constriction, and then cut over it and extract it.
And if it is deeply embedded in the flesh and you do not find it, then you place a cautery with fire over the place until it dies, and the greatest feared cause is its corruption, by which it corrupts the place as we have said.
But if you see it has reached the head near the eye, then bind above the eyebrow with a strong constriction, and then cut over it and extract it; and it is necessary that the patient use purification of his body with medicines evacuating bad putrid humors, and guard himself from foods generating putrefaction.
Concerning the incision for the illness nafir (or a similar ailment).
This illness is called nafir in our land, and it is a pain which comes in certain limbs, and then is moved from limb to limb.
And I have already seen that, as I will tell you. I was called to a sick woman in a village, and I uncovered her arm and saw a small swelling in the basilic vein of the arm, and after it had remained for an hour, I saw that swelling moving as if a worm were climbing upwards, but more lightly than a worm, as if it were quicksilver when it runs from place to place.
And then the pain left that place and fixed itself in the muscle, and remained there for about an hour.
And then it ran to the other side until it reached the other arm.
And then it occurred to me that it was moving throughout her body, as I saw; and I was greatly amazed at its movement and its speed from limb to limb. And I had seen this before with my own eyes in this manner, however I have seen many who find pain shifting from limb to limb. But I never saw it with my own eyes as in the woman.
And I did not think it was anything other than that because the woman was old, with a dry body and exposed veins, and in this [condition] that windy movement appeared.
And it is necessary that it not appear, according to this treatment, in those who are delicate and with moist bodies and hidden veins.
And if you want to cure him, and the patient feels that pain, then it is not apparent to your eye as we have said, then you press on it lightly and dry it until that constricted wind is released, and cauterize the area.
But if you do not see it with your own eyes, then you treat it with bodily exercise and with things that expel winds, and drive them out with fetid pills and with pills of serapium and the like.
On the extraction of arrows.
Arrows are diversified according to their types, and according to the places in the body where they land, for their diversity is such that there are those with large points, and small ones, and concave ones, and blunt ones, that is, solid ones; and those that have three angles, and those that have barbs; and those that have feathers.
And of the signs of the brain, it is when an arrow falls into it and penetrates the bone, and emerges from the cranium which is over the brain, for it causes sudden vehement pain, and scotoma (blind spots), and vertigo, and redness in the eyes, and inflammation and redness of the tongue, and spasm and confusion of understanding, and vomiting of bile, and the speech is quickly cut off and the voice is destroyed, and a white humidity resembling pus emerges from the place of the wound, and pus from it similar to the watery discharge of flesh.
And therefore if these signs appear to you, then abstain from the cure and the extraction of the arrow, unless it is outside.
But the signs of the arrow when it falls into the heart, are that it is near the left nipple, and one feels as if it were stuck in something hard, and not in something empty; and very quickly the movement of the arrow is similar to the movement of the pulse, and black blood flows from the wound, and there is coldness of the extremities, and cold sweat, and syncope; and therefore know that death follows without any doubt.
And the signs when the arrow has wounded the lung are thus:  frothy blood emerges from the wound, and the vessels that are near the neck are swollen, and the color of the patient is changed, and he breathes with great difficulty, and desires the intake of cool air.
And if the arrow falls into the diaphragm, which is in the chest, the pain is then near the lower ribs, and great swelling is produced with vehement pain and with sighing, and not all the muscles of the limbs are affected.
And if the arrow falls into the stomach, then very quickly some undigested food comes out of the wound.
And if the arrow falls into the abdomen, and is stuck in it, there emerges from the wound some pus, or the intestine, which is ruptured, and there is no hope in its cure without extraction of the arrow.
And if the arrow falls into the bladder, and urine emerges from it, and some matter proceeds from it to the external parts, and very quickly great pain comes over the patient, then know that it is mortal.
But the other members, such as the face, the neck, and the throat, and the shoulders and the armpits, and the vertebrae of the back, and the clavicle (furcula), and the hip, and the leg, and similar members, are saved according to the best dispositions when the arrow does not strike a vein or artery and is not a poisoned arrow.
And I recount this to you that I have seen of the nature of these arrows, so that you may signify by this the treatment for yourself.
The reason is, because in a man an arrow fell into the tear duct of his eye at the root of the nose, and I extracted it for him from the other side, below the lobe of his ear, and he was healed, and no harm happened to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew which fell into him in the lobe of his eye, below the lower eyelid, and the arrow was already hidden and I found only a small extremity with which it adhered to its shaft, and it was a large arrow of the sharp arrows of the Turks, with an iron head in which there were no barbs.
And the Jew was healed, and no harm befell his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man which had fallen into his throat, and it was an Arabic arrow, and this is the type that has barbs; and then I incised over it between two guides, and it was already submerged in his throat; and then I was subtle with it, and then I extracted it, and the Christian was healed.
And I extracted another arrow from a man which had fallen into his belly, and I thought that he would die from it; and therefore, since thirty days had passed and no change had occurred in his condition, I incised over the arrow and extracted it, and he was healed, and no harm befell him.
And I saw another man into whom an arrow fell in his back, and the wound had healed over him, and after about seven years, the arrow emerged at the root of the thigh.
And I saw a woman into whom an arrow fell in her belly, and the wound healed within her, and nothing changed in her condition, and the woman found no hindrance in any of her natural functions.
And I saw another man into whom an arrow fell in his face, and the wound healed and the arrow broke, finding no great pain there, and many similar to these.
And I extracted the arrow from the prince of the king's man, which had fallen into the middle of his nose and had already declined a little to the right side, and the entire arrow was hidden.
And I was called to his cure about three days after the arrow's penetration.
And then I found the wound from the arrow very narrow; and then I examined it with a fine probe, and did not feel it; but he felt a prickling under his right ear, and then I suspected that this prickling was caused by the point of the arrow.
And I plastered the area with a plaster which has attractive and digestive properties, trusting that the area would suppurate so that the location of the arrow would be revealed to me, so that I could operate on it.
And no significant event occurred at the site indicating that the arrow had reached that location; and I continued with the plaster on him for many days and no incident occurred; and the wound was healing meanwhile, and the patient desisted from its extraction for many days until one day he felt the arrow inside his nose and recounted this to me.
And then I applied a sharp, corrosive medicine to the wound for many days until it was opened, and with a probe I explored it, and found the tip of the arrow, which adhered to the shaft.
And then I adjusted the application of the sharp medicine to the wound until the tip of the arrow became visibly apparent to me, and I spent time with this for a period of four months.
And then, since the wound was enlarged, and it became possible for me to insert forceps into it and remove it, and I did not succeed in this way, then I did not cease to refine and devise a method for it, until one day I managed, with ingeniously crafted instruments, to grasp it with forceps, specially made, as the form of these will be shown at the end of the chapter, until I extracted it; and then I restored the wound.
And some physicians judged that the cartilage of the nose would not be restored, and I restored it and the wound healed, and the patient was completely cured, and I did not harm him in any way.
And I recount to you the manner of extraction of certain arrows so that you may apply this rule and understanding to that which I have not mentioned, for the details of this art and its definitions are not fully comprehended by narration, nor are these contained in books.
And skillful artisans compare the small with the large; and that which is present with that which is absent; and they find new operations and new instruments because of the unexpected occurrence of strange causes in their art.
Therefore I say that arrows are not removed from the members into which they are embedded except in two ways: either by traction from the place where they enter; or by the opposite from the other side.
And that which is extracted from the place where it entered, is an arrow penetrating a fleshy place, and is pulled and removed.
And if it does not yield to extraction at the time of discovery, then you must leave it for some days until the flesh around it softens, and the extraction and its removal are eased.
Similarly, if it is embedded in bone and does not yield to extraction, then leave it for a few days and repeat the attempt with traction and movement each day, and it will eventually be removed.
And if it still does not yield after a few days, then you must drill around the arrow in the bone on all sides with a fine drill bit until the space around the arrow is widened, and then remove it.
But if the arrow is hidden in the body and cannot be felt, then probe for it with a probe; and if you find it, then extract it with instruments suitable for its removal.
And if you cannot reach it because of the tightness of the wound and the length of the projectile, and there is no bone, nerve, or vein in the way, then incise the wound to widen it so that the arrow can be extracted.
And if it is held by barbs, then carefully free the flesh in which it is embedded by every means you can; and work on this, if you cannot otherwise free the flesh, by breaking off the barbs and twisting them until they release.
And when you are removing the arrow from wherever it is lodged, then use twisting with your hand and forceps in every way to make it yield; and proceed with great care so that the arrow is not broken, making its removal difficult.
And if you cannot remove it immediately, then wait a few days until the surrounding tissues soften, and then try again, for it will then be easier. But if you encounter excessive bleeding, then use the methods of treatment described in the relevant chapter.
And be careful not to cut a vein, nerve, or tendon, and employ every possible method to remove the arrow; and do this with gentleness, calmness, slowness, and firmness, as I have recommended to you.
And therefore, make the arrow straight so that the patient's position corresponds to the position of the arrow's entry wound, for this is most beneficial. But if this is not possible, then use whatever methods are available to you, given the circumstances.
But if the arrow is protruding from the opposite side, or if some part of it is already projecting outwards, or if the arrowhead is noticeably swollen due to the feeling of the part above the deep tendon and sometimes that prominent part; then you should cut around that; and the incision should be according to the size that the forceps can grasp; and then pull it out, for it will easily come out in this way.
But if it is lodged in the bone, then you should twist the blade against it until the arrowhead enters the bone, and widen the opening, and then extract it.
And if not, leave it for a few days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrow is still inside, then push it through.
But if the shaft has fallen off and you want to administer a push, then introduce, if it is blunt, a concave instrument so that the concavity fits onto the tail of the arrow, and then push it through.
But if the arrowhead is concave, then push it through with a strong instrument entering it, for the arrowhead is relieved by it.
And if the arrow is poisoned, then you should cut away all the flesh in which the poison is, if this is possible for you, and then treat it with what is appropriate.
And if the arrow has entered the foot, or the belly, or the bladder, or the side, and is close enough that you can touch it with a probe, and it is possible for you to cut around it, then cut around it and be careful not to cut a vein or nerve, and extract it, and then sew the wound if necessary, and treat it until it is healed.
Form of forceps with which arrows are pulled out:
Let the ends of them be like a bird's beak, which are made like a saw when they grip the arrow so that they do not let go of it.
And of these, many types are made, large, small, and medium-sized, according to the size of the arrow and its smallness, and the size of the wound, and the tightness of it.
like a ray, so that its entry into the concave arrow is eased and is pushed with that.
Of phlebotomy of the veins.
The veins for phlebotomy, of which the customary number is thirty, of which sixteen are in the head; that is, two pulsating veins which are near the ears, called alhasisain; two veins that are in the two apparent temples; and two veins that are in the two tear ducts of the two eyes, which are called aspicientz; and the vein prepared in the middle of the forehead, and the vein that is at the tip of the nose; and two guidegi that are at the neck; and two veins that are in the upper lip; and two veins that are in the lower lip; and — these are the veins that are called algelic —; and there are two veins that are under the tongue. But the veins that are phlebotomized in the arms are five; for of those there is one cephalic, and it is on the wild side (of the arm); and the people call it “the vein of the head”, and it is a blind vein, and it is a median vein, and it is composed of a branch of the basilic, and of another branch of the cephalic; and the people name that one “vein of the whole body”, and the basilic is the vein which is located on the inner side of the arm, and it is named “citillar”, and the common people name it “vein of the belly”; and the funis of the arm, and it is located above the cubital fossa, and it is that one in which phlebotomy is performed, and it is that which appears above the elbow by manifest appearance; and the salvatella, and it is the vein that is between the little finger and the ring finger, and it has two branches there.
And in the foot and leg there are three veins; one of these is that which is below the bend of the knee on the outer side; and the second is the saphena, and its location is below the leg on the inner side; and the sciatic vein, and its location is below the leg on the outer side; and in the leg there are other veins similar to those.
The benefit of opening the veins near the ears is for chronic catarrhs, migraines, headaches, and old, bad ulcers of the head.
And the manner of bleeding those veins is as I recount to you: that is, the patient's head should be raised, and the patient's head should be rubbed at the occiput in the location of both veins with a wide cloth with good friction; then the patient should tighten their neck with a bandage until the two veins and their locations appear near the ears in two depressed places on the head; and seek them out with your finger, and if you feel the pulse of those with your finger, then bleed with a lancet there.
Then you take the lancet knife, which is sharp, and you insert it under the vein in the fossa until the blood flows. Then raise your hand with the vein and fossa to the upper parts and incise the vein with a sharp incision. And let the length of the incision be the amount of two joined fingers or thereabouts; and let blood flow as much as you wish.
Then bind it with powders and leave it until it is healed.
And already and previously at the beginning of the book, the incision of these and their cauterization has been described.
But of the two arteries that are in the temples, bloodletting is helpful for chronic and sudden severe migraine, persistent ophthalmia, and a flow of acute superfluities effused into the eyes.
And the way to perform phlebotomy on these is as I recommend to you:  constrict the patient's neck tightly until the two veins appear to the touch by manifest appearance and their pulse is felt under your finger; and then you bleed with a lancet.
Then you raise the skin above the vein at the upper part with your index finger, and insert the phlebotomy instrument underneath, and raise the vein up; and incise it just as you have done with the other two veins; and let the blood flow according to your need.
Then loosen the constriction of the patient, and place your finger on the vein for an hour, and then place cotton and powder on it and bind it tightly above with strong constriction, and leave it until it is healed.
And already the recollection of them, and their incision, and the drawing [of blood] has been preceded in the beginning of the book.
Therefore, the benefit of phlebotomy of the frontal vein is for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein in old facial diseases and for migraine and rigidity and foul ulcers.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is as I recounted to you; that is, that the patient constricts his neck with a bandage until the vein appears; and then take the instrument which is named a lancet, of which this is the form:
Place the prominent point which is at the head of the lancet upon that vein and strike it with a hammer or with something else in that manner, and let the blood flow according to the quantity that you wish; and then loosen the constriction of the patient and bind it until it is healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a lateral phlebotomy, however it is not fitting that the phlebotomy be of acute extremity as are the other phlebotomies, rather it should be of a blunt extremity, and phlebotomize it according to the transverse, because the bone is near and would easily break there the phlebotomy when it is subtle [thin].
But the benefit of the two veins that are at the lacrimals of both eyes is for scabies of the eyes, for rigidity and swelling in the eyes, and for diseases of the face.
And the manner of the phlebotomy is that the patient should constrict his neck with a bandage, and then phlebotomize those veins, and you should be standing over his head.
And let the phlebotomy be made transversely, a little lengthwise with a small lancet, because in that place there is no flesh; and if the phlebotomy is thin, very quickly its tip is broken.
And then make the blood flow as much as is necessary for you, and place cotton over it, and bind it for one night, and then unbind it.
But phlebotomy of the vein of the nose is beneficial for acute fever and vehement headache, and for diseases of the face and migraine and rigidity that occurs in the face, and especially when it is chronic.
And the manner of his phlebotomy is that the patient should constrict his neck, and then hold his nose with your left hand, and take a long, thin lancet and insert it into the middle of the nasal bridge in a straight line, because the vein is not palpable there, and because the blood begins to flow immediately.
So that you gradually withdraw your hand with the lancet and allow the blood to flow according to your need; and then bind it for a night, because it is lightly restored.
But the help of phlebotomy of the two jugular veins is for constriction of the throat and the beginning of leprosy and many illnesses and impetigo and bad corrosive ulcers, as well as herpes.
And the manner of phlebotomy of these is that the patient should tighten each one at his neck with a bandage; and the practitioner should stand above the patient's head, and the patient should be sitting on a stool.
And then phlebotomize the vein lengthwise with a wide lancet little by little; and then extract blood according to a measured quantity or according to what you see is necessary; and then do likewise to the other vein.
And then untie the bandage and tighten the two veins with a moderate constriction so that the patient is not suffocated, and leave it until morning because the wound is healed.
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the temporal veins helps small abscesses and pustules of the mouth and corruption of the gums and bad ulcers and fissures, and bad ulcers that are in the nose and around it.
And the manner of phlebotomy of these is that you make the patient sit before you, and tighten his neck with a bandage, and then roll back his lips and look for two veins, of which one is on the right of the lip and the second on the left; and the demonstration of each is by the blackness of each of both, and this is more so because in the area of those are small black veins; and then incise each one with a cutting incision.
But if you have doubt, and you do not know which is which, then you should incise the larger of those, and the most obvious of those.
And do likewise for the two veins that are in the upper lips.
But of the two veins that are under the tongue, the benefit is for phlebotomy of the cephalic vein for throat affections, for diseases of the uvula, and for diseases of the mouth.
And the manner of phlebotomizing those is that you hold the patient between your hands facing the sun, and elevate his tongue, and look under the tongue, on one side you will see a vein and on the other side another vein, and the color of each is tending towards blackness.
And then phlebotomize each one; and be careful not to overuse your hand in phlebotomizing those, because under those are arteries.
And the veins that are phlebotomized in the neck are those which run customarily in all men, and the phlebotomy of them is done in two ways: either they are opened with a lancet or olive-shaped phlebotomy instrument of fine point; or they are incised with a cupped phlebotomy instrument, and it is called an alnessil, and this is its form:
Let its width be thus as you see, and it is suitable for opening concave, full, prominent, thick veins, and those that contain thick, turbid blood.
And this phlebotomy instrument is of lesser width and more subtle extremity, and is suitable for phlebotomy of subtle veins that contain thin, clear blood.
But the benefit of phlebotomy of the basilica vein, which is one of three veins: for it draws out the blood of illnesses that are below the throat and neck, and of what affects the feet and abdomen.
And it is fitting for the phlebotomist, when performing this phlebotomy, that he carefully guards against this and be very cautious, for below it is an artery, and if he errs and is imprecise in the puncture of the phlebotomy, he will cut that artery and cause a flow of blood; therefore it is necessary that he not phlebotomize it with a sharp phlebotomy instrument, but rather with a cutting instrument like a lancet.
And if the basilica vein does not appear in manifest form, then it is necessary that you leave it and that you move to another, or that you seek one of its branches; or that you phlebotomize at the end of the arm instead, for that is manifest; and incise it with a lancet-like phlebotomy instrument as we have said.
But if you wish phlebotomy in the same place, then before binding the arm, you must touch the location until you find the location of the pulse, and then mark it with ink; and then bind the arm and incise the vein with a concave incision using a lancet-like phlebotomy instrument as we have said; and be careful that the incision does not fall into the space of the artery's location.
And when you see, as you tighten the ligature, swelling in the place you have marked with ink, then that swelling is a swelling of the artery, and therefore avoid that place.
And if you see the blood flowing from the phlebotomy like a child's urine, and the blood is thin and red, then know that it is arterial blood; and then you should observe and place your finger on it for a long time; and then remove your finger, and if the bleeding is stopped (for many times it is stopped), then you should tighten the arm and leave it.
And watch the patient for movement, and let there be concern for him, and do not annoy him for some days until he is healed.
But if the bleeding is not stopped, and you see that you do not have medicine present for this, then you should incise the artery, if it appears to you; because its extremity is constricted, and the bleeding is stopped; or that you take bark from a fig tree, and pound it, and take one half and bind it tightly over the vein's location with a descending ligature and with powders until the next day.
And then if the bleeding is stopped, it is good; and if not, then treat it with that which was previously mentioned in the recollection of the place of the powders that stop the flow of blood.
And the stopping of his blood is difficult in many situations because of the small size of the wound and the possibility of binding the arm.
But from the dark vein, phlebotomy is helpful to draw blood from the upper part of the head and the lower part of the body; for this reason, because it is composed of branches of the basilic and cephalic veins, as we have said.
And it behooves the phlebotomist to be very careful in his phlebotomy, for below that is a nerve; and if he inserts the phlebotomy lancet and finds the nerve, stupor will befall him, and its healing is difficult, and perhaps he will never be fully healed. And this nerve often appears to the senses; and if it is hidden from some men and is subtle and not shown, then it behooves you to use the phlebotomy instrument with which you perform phlebotomy with a slanting incision, and avoid the nerve with your skill.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you should open the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein is that it draws blood from the head and helps with eye diseases.
And it is especially fitting in this case, if you wish the phlebotomist to puncture with an olive-shaped or myrtle-shaped phlebotomy lancet; because it is the safest of all veins, for there is neither artery nor nerve below it.
However, it is very quickly inflamed in some men, when it is not phlebotomized at the first puncture, but that inflammation does no harm.
The first of these is that you should know that phlebotomy is administered only for the preservation of health and for its hope and the prevention of illness, and that phlebotomy should be performed in one of the veins that are in the elbow, that is: cephalic, median cubital, and basilic; and that phlebotomy should be performed at the beginning of spring, on an empty stomach in spring and autumn, and in winter near mealtimes, when signs of repletion appear.
And let phlebotomy be performed on the third day or the first, after three hours of the day have passed.
But phlebotomy, which is administered, is more when it provokes convenience and necessity for it, whether by night or by day, at any hour and at any time.
And it is necessary that a child not be phlebotomized until he is fourteen years old, and a pregnant woman should not be phlebotomized except from the fourth month to the seventh, and old women who have passed sixty years should not be phlebotomized.
And if someone wants to be phlebotomized in any way, it is necessary that he cleanse his bowels before phlebotomy with a cleansing enema, if he has much retained waste in them, so that the veins do not draw the superfluities into the phlebotomy from the bowels, which are putrid, and that they not harm the principal members.
And let not patients with nausea, thirst, and indigestion be phlebotomized, nor those recovering from illness or drunkenness until this is remedied in them, nor patients with dropsy, and moreover, phlebotomy should be avoided during colic, vomiting, and abdominal pain, and during times of excessive coitus, labor, exercise, fasting, or vigils, and all causes that weaken the strength, whether corporeal or animal.
And consider beforehand, regarding the thinning of humors, if the blood is thick, with foods and drinks, and with medicines if that is possible for him.
And then enter a bath if no cause prohibits it, or be exercised by some activity so that the blood is thinned.
And perform his phlebotomy in the middle of the day, that is, around the third hour, as we have said.
And ensure that the patient's feet are protected that day from all accidental harms, both animal, such as anxiety, anger, fear, and all bodily harms, such as excessive labor and exertion, sexual intercourse, and similar things.
And at his bedside, let there be present things whose use is customary among men, with aromatics and perfumes, and with balsams and similar things according to what is possible.
And let the phlebotomist sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one who is to be phlebotomized.
Then, he should extend his arm, and the phlebotomist should rub it with his hand two or three times; then tighten the ligature with a strap and wrap it twice.
And let the constriction be moderate, for if the constriction is uneven, or if the constriction is excessive, then it prevents the flow of blood; or if it is too loose, then it prevents the proper outflow of blood.
And near the constriction, it is necessary that the one who is to be phlebotomized rub his hands together until the veins are swollen and clearly visible.
Then the phlebotomist should anoint his fleam with a little old oil; and then he should place the index finger of his left hand on the vein, below the place where he wants to perform the phlebotomy, so that the vein moves slightly, and the percussion is avoided, because some veins are like a fleeing cord during phlebotomy, and those that are full of wind, when you place the fleam on them, are contracted against the fleam, and the phlebotomist fails; and the fleam does not open the vein, and if it opens, it is too tight.
Therefore, the phlebotomist must be skilled and attentive to all these matters.
Then, apply the fleam; but if the vein is opened at once, it is good; and if not, repeat it again a little below that place, or above it carefully, if the place is not infected.
And if the place is infected, or the patient feels faint, then leave it for a day or two, and do not tighten the bandage, because it would quickly draw a hot abscess, nor should he enter a bath.
Then repeat the phlebotomy if necessary.
And if the opening is small and the blood flows subtly, and you fear that the desired quantity of blood will not come out, then repeat the phlebotomy in that same place, accurately and precisely adjusting the opening a little, and do this carefully before the place becomes infected, because in many men the place becomes infected from a small opening.
But if you see that it is already infected, then do not repeat it there, for no reason excuses you; and place on it some part of an olive pit, for it relieves the body of blood. And it is better in this place than oil and other oils.
Similarly, administer an olive pit in every phlebotomy with which you phlebotomize the veins due to the prohibition of blood letting, and they make this with theriac and sagapenum when one of these is placed on the place, because the blood is thinned and is resolved when it is thick.
And if a large abscess is generated at the site of the phlebotomy, for this happens many times, and especially to one who has not been bled except on that occasion, or with a small opening in the vein, then you should take a sponge soaked in slightly warm water and salt, and apply it tightly to the place for an hour, because it will be dissolved.
And it is necessary to do this near the exit of blood from that vein, along with it or from another vein.
And if some blackness or greenness remains in the place for some days, it does not harm; and if you wish, place on it some aloes and myrrh dissolved, or some mint juice or calamint, or something similar.
And many times abscesses and swellings occur after phlebotomy of the basilica vein.
And then place your hand on it, and if then you find softness under your compression, then that swelling is malignant and bad; and then beware that you place on it something of what we have said, because blood will quickly flow from the artery.
And make a plaster with something that has astringent properties, so that the place is hardened, and then treat it with the other treatment until it is healed.
And it is necessary that you extract blood from each person according to the quantity of their strength and according to the prevailing color of the blood as it appears.
Because if the blood is black, then you let it flow until it is red; and similarly, if you see it thick, then you let it flow until it is thinned; and similarly, if it is sharp (or acrid), until its sharpness is removed.
And it is necessary for one who is full and strong and needs bloodletting, that the phlebotomy of the vein be widened and the phlebotomy be wide. (or: ...and the incision for phlebotomy be wide.)
And in one who is weak, the opposite should be done, and it is necessary that you extract blood in several times, and that the opening be narrow.
And the best way to administer phlebotomy is that the section (incision) be transverse, not a puncture.
And this manner of phlebotomy is safer from blood flow and nerve injury, and is more laudable and safer than phlebotomy according to latitude and longitude (i.e., a lengthwise or vertical incision).
And to one who is accustomed to fainting during phlebotomy, it is necessary that you treat him before phlebotomy with a little bread infused in warm myrtle wine or simple oxymel; and extract the blood in three or four times.
And if there is coldness of complexion, then before phlebotomy take bread infused in syrup of myrrh or in syrup of honey aromatized with spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and the like, or in a very fragrant and aromatized syrup.
And if syncope occurs during phlebotomy, and it is caused by the loss of much blood, then it is necessary that he drink meat broth and a very subtly fragrant syrup; and use aromatics with vinegar, and let his feet be bathed with it.
And use the other remedies that we have mentioned in the section on syncope by evacuation (in the chapter on syncope).
And whoever wants to bleed his arm and dissolve his blood a second time, it is necessary for him, for whom phlebotomy is for the purpose of evacuation, and whose strength is weak, that he evacuate the blood little by little, that is, according to the amount of strength on consecutive days.
But whoever wants to bleed his arm and shed his blood a second time, and his body is strong, then let him do so about seven or nine hours after the first phlebotomy.
But whoever wants to draw blood from his body away from the part to which it declines (or flows excessively), it is necessary that he be bled on the second or third day.
But that body in which there is much already heated blood, and it is acute and causes fever, it is necessary that a large quantity of blood be shed from him at once, and the opening be enlarged until syncope occurs, provided that you have observed all the conditions of phlebotomy; and that you place your hand on his pulse below the bleeding site, so that death does not result instead of syncope, for this often happens when the phlebotomist is ignorant and negligent.
And it is not necessary, when you wish to untie the arm and evacuate the blood a second time, that the opening of the vein be already closed and the exit of the blood made difficult, that you press on it with vehemence and bend it slightly extended, for this is very bad.
Having left it until it is bled a second time; or remove it with the sharpness of a phlebotomy instrument that is coagulated blood in the opening of the vein; or place on it theriac alfarach, or  [some type of medicinal salve - likely another type of theriac], and compress it with light compression until the blood has come out.
And if the vein is abscessed, then leave it and do not touch it until the abscess is subsided.
And if necessity compels you to evacuate the blood a second time, and there is no excuse, then you bleed him in that same place or in the other arm in another vein.
And the vein called "rope of the arm" is phlebotomized instead of the cephalic or basilic, when they are not found or are hidden, because it is composed of them.
And the quality of his phlebotomy is that the patient should put his hand in warm water until the forearm reddens and the vein appears manifestly.
And then it should be bound above with a moderately tight ligature; and then phlebotomize according to the short transverse, neither laterally nor lengthwise.
And let the opening be wide, and perform your phlebotomy where you phlebotomize on the joint of the hand, a little above it.
And if the flow of blood is impeded, then put the hand back in warm water and let the blood run into the water until you achieve your objective.
But if you are in the summer days, then you are excused from putting the hand back in warm water, and it is more appropriate to place a bowl of blood in warm water in wintertime.
And phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all other veins, because beneath it there are no pulsating veins nor nerves.
And phlebotomy of the little vein of the right hand is beneficial for liver diseases.
And the manner of phlebotomy is that you should bind the arm tightly with a ligature or with your hand, after you have placed it in warm water, until the vein is swollen and clearly visible; and then phlebotomize it transversely; and if you cut it completely, that will not harm at all.
And be careful not to perform phlebotomy too far down the arm, for beneath that point are the nerves of the fingers, denuded of flesh.
And then return the arm to the warm water and let the blood flow into it, for if you do not return it to warm water, the blood will coagulate in the opening of the vein, and prevent further flow.
And when the blood has been drawn in the necessary quantity, then place oil and salt on the vein, so that it does not clot too quickly; and similarly you should do this in every narrow vein.
But the benefit of phlebotomy from the left arm is that it is beneficial for diseases of the spleen.
And perform phlebotomy on him similarly as you did on the other (patient).
And the benefit of phlebotomy of the saphenous vein is for diseases that are in the lower part of the body, such as diseases of the womb, and for the retention of menstrual blood, and for the diseases of sores and ulcers of the thighs and legs of long standing, and for similar diseases.
And the manner of phlebotomy on him is that the patient should put his foot in warm water and rub it until the veins appear clearly; and tie above the ankle joint with a strap; and the location of the vein is easily apparent below the little toe, and from it many branches are spread over the surface of the foot.
Therefore, phlebotomize the largest branch below the leg, below the ankle, near its articulation, for it is better and more salutary.
And if you phlebotomize that (vein) on the surface of the foot, then beware of the nerves that are below it on the surface of the foot, and perform your phlebotomy in a way that you phlebotomize across, as if you were going to incise it.
And let the phlebotomy be skillful.
But if the drawing of blood is prohibited; then you immerse his foot in warm water and allow the blood to flow there until it is evacuated.
And if the phlebotomist errs on the first attempt, then repeat the phlebotomy a little higher, for the location is safe; and do not fear to harm him, but be careful of the nerves as we have said.
And similarly do the same to the saphenous vein of the other foot.
And of the sciatic vein, the location, as we have said, is below the heel, under the ankle bone on the inside.
And the benefit of phlebotomy for him is for hip pain when it is due to hot blood.
And the method of his phlebotomy is that the patient enters a bath, and quickly and tightly bind his thigh from the hip to above the ankle above four fingers with a long, thin bandage, because it will not appear otherwise.
And then when it appears, then you phlebotomize that according to whatever method is possible for you and according to the transverse [vein]; and that is better; or incise it by incision or cut it by section, because its location is safe.
And it is often very hidden in many men; and if you find it, and it does not appear to the touch at all, then phlebotomize one of its branches, and that is the one that appears on the inside of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger.
And beware of the nerves, and let the blood flow in the quantity that you desire.
And then loosen the binding and place a cloth over the phlebotomy site and bind the area tightly, for it heals easily.
Concerning cupping and the qualities of using them.
Cupping instruments are made of horn, or of brass, or of glass.
And cupping is done in two ways: one of them is with scarification and extraction of blood, and the other is cupping without scarification.
And this cupping that is without scarification is done in two ways, for it is either with fire or without fire.
And cupping instruments, which are administered with scarification and bloodletting, are applied to fourteen places on the body, of which one where cupping is applied is the occiput, the back part of the head; and the middle of the neck on both sides together; and cupping of the chin below the mandible, below the mouth; and cupping of the two shoulder blades; and cupping of the loins, which is above the end of the buttocks; and cupping of the two elbows; and cupping of the two armpits; and cupping of the two thighs.
And cupping does not extract blood except from the small veins scattered in the flesh, and therefore it does not diminish the strength through them, as it does with phlebotomy; nor should cupping be done with fire or without fire in any illness caused by repletion until the whole body is evacuated.
But if necessity calls for cupping due to illness or because it is continuous, we administer it at any time, at the beginning of the month and at the end of it, and in the middle of it, and at any time.
Therefore, when you see any of these conditions, and especially if it is in the third or middle part of the month, then we order that cupping be done after two or three hours of the day have passed.
And the benefit of cupping the nape of the neck is that when it is applied it relieves heaviness in the head and that which is settled in the eyes; but this should be done after evacuation of the whole body.
And this cupping is in the place of phlebotomy of the cephalic vein.
And it is not advisable to use it on one who has a cold complexion, or in whom there is a catarrh, for it causes great harm to such a person.
And for this reason, it is not advisable to use it on the elderly, and on those whose heads are afflicted with cold illnesses.
But to the one upon whom this is continuously applied, forgetfulness is caused; and therefore you should instruct the cupper to place his hand a little below the cupping vessel, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
But cupping with alkehel (likely referring to a specific type of cupping or medicinal preparation) is in the place of phlebotomy of the dark vein (vena fusca) and the basilic vein: and for this reason it benefits asthma, and the constriction of the lungs, and the rupture of a lung instrument (perhaps a reference to a lung injury or instrument), and cough, and repletion (fullness/congestion).
And it is necessary that the alkehel cupping vessel be slightly raised, for if it is placed low, it generates weakness in the body and in the stomach.
And cupping with alhagdahan (another specific type of cupping or preparation) benefits accidental pains in the head and ophthalmia (eye inflammation), and migraine, and suffocation, and pains in the roots of the teeth; and it is in place of phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper not to press his hand on the scarification, lest he injure the artery and cause a flow of blood.
And cupping below the chin benefits canker sores in the mouth, and corruption of the gums, and similar oral diseases, and is in place of phlebotomy of the alar veins (veins near the lips).
But cupping that is done over the two shoulder blades benefits caphatan (likely a specific illness or symptom), which is caused by an excess of heat.
And cupping on the two inner parts of the thighs benefits as much as phlebotomy of three veins, that is, the basilic, median cubital (likely what "fusca" refers to here, given the context), and cephalic veins, because it draws blood from all those smaller veins that are in the flesh, and those small veins from the other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
And instruct the cupper not to proceed excessively in scarification, because the area is denuded of flesh, and underneath are nerves and arteries.
And there is a cupping glass with which one cups over the hips and it benefits hemorrhoids of the anus and deeper ulcers.
And it is necessary that you instruct the cupper that it be a large cupping glass, and that it be of brass, because the area requires strong suction; and thin cupping glasses are quickly broken and should be scarified with scarification.
But cupping of the legs diminishes pain subtly, for it draws blood from the whole body, and it benefits old pains of the joints and of the womb, and of the bladder; and it provokes menstruation, and benefits swellings and edema; and it stands in place of phlebotomy of the two saphenous veins, and of the two jugular veins.
However, they greatly weaken the whole body and cause syncope in many men.
And of the jugular cuppings, the benefit is similar to the benefit of cuppings of the two legs.
And the quality of the placement of the cupping glasses is that you place the cupping glass initially empty and draw by tempered suction, and do not prolong the placement of the cupping glasses, but place them lightly, and remove them carefully, so that the humors come to the place by equal admixture. And do not cease to iterate this and continue until you see the place redden and swell and the appearance of the blood's redness.
And then you scarify and iterate the suction little by little, and consider the disposition of the humors.
Because that man who is of tender flesh and rare pores, it is necessary that you scarify him once and no more, lest the place be ulcerated.
And command the cupper to amplify the scarification and probe a little, and temper the suction with facility.
And if the blood is thick, then it is necessary that you scarify twice, for in the first time the way of thinning is opened to the blood and its aqueous humor. But in the second [scarification], to the acquired scrutiny of the extraction of thick blood.
And if the blood is very foul, then let a third scarification be made so that it achieves the desired result.
Finally, when we want to extract the blood little by little or a small amount, one scarification is enough for us.
And if we want the extraction of much blood, we make many scarifications; and if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary that we scarify with a deep scarification.
And the term scarification in which there is only the depth of the [scarification] point.  (Or:  And the term "scarification" refers only to the depth of the point [of the instrument]).
And if the one whose blood is thick, dark, and viscous, and whose pores are constricted, the places for the cupping glasses should be anointed with emollient, opening, and resolving ointments; if it is in summer, such as aloe oil, violet oil, sweet almond oil, or poppy seed oil; and if it is in winter, then narcissus oil, lily oil, chamomile oil, or blood oil, and similar ones.
And if the superfluity is thick and cold, then let the oil be amaranth oil, or balsamita oil, or aloe oil, or anise oil, and similar to them.
But if the patient has large pores and tender flesh, then the use of oil should be avoided, and for such a person the areas for cupping should be washed with rose water, or cold water of nightshade, or poppy water, or borrage water, and similar things.
And the one whose blood is very humid, wash his cupping areas with sour wine, or with myrtle and sumac water, and similar things.
And for the one whose superfluities are thick, wash the cupping areas with old wine, or with sanzuc water (which is marjoram), or with a decoction of anise, or chamomile, and similar things.
And the cupping should be done before a bath; however, it should be administered about an hour or two before the bath, and he should sleep after the cupping.
What is required to regulate the patient (or perhaps, "the one to be cupped") before cupping or phlebotomy?
You should consider at the beginning: if the one to be cupped or bled is choleric, and has sharp, inflamed blood, then he should take cooling things, such as sour pomegranates, endive in sour wine, lettuce, succory, julep, and similar things.
And give him foods such as chicken, the meat of domestic birds, and foods seasoned with acids, and similar things.
And for one whose complexion is cold, he should drink syrup of almonds, or syrup of succory seeds, sumac, and very fragrant wine, mid-way between old and new; and he should be advised to use moderation in drinking and eating, and give him foods such as chicken, hempseed, peas, small birds, and pigeons.
And it is necessary that on the day of cupping and phlebotomy, his drink should be greater in quantity than his food.
And it should be given to drink at certain hours to some men theriac alpharac, or medicines of musk, that is, nutmeg, or theriac before cupping or before phlebotomy or afterwards, so that the principal members are strengthened and the blood is thinned; and they should not take those [medicines] hot.
But the cuppings that are without scarification should be cuppings that are placed on the liver, and on the spleen, and on the gout, and on the navel, in the areas of the knees, and the hip joint, because these parts do not tolerate scarification on them.
And it is not desired for those [cuppings] except the drawing of blood from a member, just as we place a cupping glass on the breast in the illness of a blood flow from the nose; and we use this so that cold, hidden flatulence is dissolved from the member, just as we place it on the belly and the navel; for this rarefies the member and warms it and diminishes the pain because it resolves flatulence.
And it is placed on boils when they occur with obstruction or pus, for by the virtue of strong attraction it quickly opens the obstruction and removes the pus from its place.
And similarly it acts when it is placed on the liver and spleen because of enclosed flatulence in them.
And these cuppings are administered empty with suction only; and sometimes they are administered with fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of lukewarm water in illnesses of the spleen.
And this is so that the cupping glass is filled and is larger; that is, with hot water alone or water in which herbs suitable for this are boiled.
Method of cupping administered with fire: let the width of the opening be two fingers, according to how we have formed it; and the length of the horn should be half a palm; and let it be on the side of it, in the place that is in the circumference, half of it; the hole should be small enough for a needle to enter it.
Let it be made of brass, copper, or tin, with thick edges, smooth, even, and polished so that it does not injure the limb due to its placement on it.
And let there be a transverse bar of brass or iron in the middle of it, on which a candle is placed with the fire.
And let this cupping glass be larger than the one we have described; and the smaller one smaller than that, according to the illnesses and the age of the one who uses it.
And the cupping glasses for infants and thin people are different from the cupping glasses for young people and those with large bodies.
And the way to place this cupping glass with fire on the limb is to extend the wick with a properly-sized wood fire in front of a small wax candle, and place that on the middle of the transverse bar in the middle of the cupping glass, so that the fire is lit around the part below, so that the patient's body is not burned.
And then it should be placed on the patient's limb, and the finger should be on the hole we have mentioned, until when we hold the cupping glasses and do not need to remove the finger and allow the vapor to escape through that hole, then the cupping glass will immediately be detached.
And then ignite the wick according to its manner, and repeat if you need to.
But in cupping, which is administered in the illness of pleurisy, with water, in which there is no transverse bar or hole, and it is not administered unless it is filled with water, and it is placed on the limb only.
And this is its form: And this cupping glass, the larger it is, the better it is, because it can receive a large quantity of water.
Chapter 97.
Leech application is not administered to many limbs, but only to those limbs where the placement of cupping glasses is not possible due to their small size, such as the finger and gum and similar; or on a limb devoid of flesh, such as the finger and nose and similar.
And the quality of using those is that you should find leeches in clean, fresh waters of a pool.
And then let them be left day and night in fresh water until they are hungry, and that no substance remains in their bellies; and then let the body be evacuated at the beginning with phlebotomy and with cupping; and then rub the patient's limb until it reddens; and then let them be placed upon it.
And when they are full and fall off.
And if it is possible to draw blood from the area with a cupping glass, it is more beneficial afterwards.
And if not, then wash the area with sour wine and then with warm water; and let it be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the flow of blood is prolonged after the application of leeches, and it is oozing, then dip a cloth in cold water, and place it over the area until the oozing stops.
And if the bleeding is excessive, then sprinkle crushed vitriol, or gallnuts and similar styptic substances, over it until the bleeding stops; or place halves of roasted beans on the area, and leave them there until the beans adhere to the area and the bleeding stops.
And it is necessary, if needed, to repeat the application of leeches, when it is possible to change those already applied.
And if leeches are contraindicated or unavailable, then rub the area with fresh blood or prick the area with a needle until blood flows; and then apply leeches, for they immediately attach themselves when they sense blood.
And when you want them to detach, sprinkle a little crushed aloe, or salt, or ash on them, and they will detach immediately.
Thus begins the prologue of the third part: On Restoration. This chapter is very often necessary in the art of medicine; and it is about the restoration of fractures and accidental dislocations in the bones.
O, son, know that foolish and common physicians boast of this chapter, those who never looked at the books of the Ancients nor read a single letter from them.
And for this reason, this manner of knowledge is kept private in our land; and I have never forgotten this in any way at all; and I have not acquired this except through long reading of the books of the Ancients and study to understand them, until I extracted the knowledge from them.
And I have also dedicated myself to experimentation and study throughout my life.
And I have described in this chapter everything that my knowledge contains and on which I have experimented; since I have shortened it for you and freed it from lengthy elaboration; and I have shortened it for the sake of brevity; and I have shown it clearly; and I have shown many forms of instruments that are used in it, as is done by way of explanation, just as I did in the two preceding chapters.
Chapter One.
Summary and collections on the subject of bone fractures, those which are necessary to preface before we begin the discussion of broken limbs and their various types. Therefore, I will state in the prologue of this chapter the main points of the discourse; and the chapters on which the practitioner must initially focus and base their understanding of the truth; that is, you and those who are prepared to know or learn this noble art besides you.
And therefore I say that when a fracture, dislocation, sprain, or fall occurs, then you should initially treat it with phlebotomy or purging, or both together, if no cause forbids it, such as weakness, or if the injured person is a child, or an elderly person in a weakened state, or if the time is one of extreme heat or extreme cold.
And then let the patient be content with a diet of cool herbs and the meat of birds and rabbits; and forbid fatty meats and filling foods and any food that fills the veins with blood, until you are certain that the inflammation is reduced, and you do not fear effusion of matter to the limb.
And then return the patient to their previous regimen, to which they are accustomed.
And so, as the broken bone begins to be restored, then the patient should be fed nutritious foods, rich and thick and heavy foods in which there is viscosity, such as foods made from wheat cooked with water, rice, heads [presumably heads of grain or similar], peas, cow stomachs, eggs, fresh fish, thick wine, and similar things. With this regimen, the consolidation of the fracture is made more easily and better.
And know that broken bones, when they are in young people and the elderly, cannot be rejoined and consolidated according to their nature because of the desiccation of their limbs.
However, nature joins and applies to the broken bone from every part some substance similar to glue, in which there is thickness that adheres and binds it until they are together conjoined and tied together until they come to the end of strength and firmness, like fire at the beginning, until nothing prevents it from its work.
And for this reason it is necessary that you give the patient foods in which there is heaviness, viscosity, and thickness, as we have said.
And know that the types of fracture are diverse according to the diversity of the limbs, for a fracture of the bone of the leg is different from a fracture of the bone of the head; and a fracture of the bone of the foot is different from a fracture of the bone of the arm; and similarly all the other limbs are different from one another.
And I come with a recollection of every type of fracture, explained in its own chapter distinct from the others.
Many kinds of fractures in themselves. And the types of bone fracture are diversified in themselves; for there is an arched fracture, and also those which happen in the stars; and sometimes a fracture is made according to the length of the bone: and these are the fractures of the sagitta (arrow) and stars and additions proceeding and non-proceeding, just as it is done in the quill when it is prepared for writing, and there is a fracture with a wound and disruption in the head, and there is a small fissure fracture.
And to each type belongs its own art or method in its restoration, as its recollection will be distinct in its place(s).
Many signs of bone fracture. And by this is a bone fracture known:  its crookedness, and the prominence and appearance of it to the touch, and also when we grasp it with the hand.
And therefore, when there is no apparent crookedness in the place, nor is this made evident by your touch when you touch the bone with agitation, and the patient does not find great pain, then there is no fracture here.
Perhaps there is a crookedness or small fissure; however, you should not move it with your hand and with total compression; rather, place upon it those medicines of which mention is made near that time which is suitable for the place; and then it should be tightened with a subtle bandage.
And know that if the place is arched and is not split in two, or something else does not happen to it in that place, as is observed in any part of its comparison, then you must begin at your hour the rectification of it before an abscess forms there.
And if a hot abscess forms there, then leave it for a few days until the abscess subsides; and then dress it according to any method you can, gently and skillfully.
And know that the restoration and healing of it is easier than of a bone in which a similar injury has occurred.
And then bind it as the instructions will dictate.
But if the bone is injured, then extension of that broken limb from two sides is necessary, if it is the hand or foot; or with your hand if the limb is small; or with two cords or with one cord and your hand.
And be in a position where you can place the limb in a dressing according to its natural shape; while the broken parts of the limb are extended, then you must force those additions back into place with skill and by any method you can.
And take care, according to your strength, that you do not cause the patient pain or injury through your operation; and force yourself, according to your ability, to apply one bone to its companion, according to their best fit.
And it is necessary that at that time you skillfully touch that with your hand, and if you see anything amiss, rectify it and adjust it to the extent of your ability.
And avoid vehement extension and compression, as many foolish physicians do, who often cause hot abscesses through their operation, or cause contraction in the limb, as we have seen happen through their operations many times.
And the quality of the binding of the calmed limb is that which I recommend; so that you know that broken limbs are diversified in their smallness and in their largeness and in their form.
And for those that are small, such as the arm and the finger and the wrist and similar to those, then it is necessary that the wrapping be of very fine soft cloth.
But those that are large, such as the thigh or the leg, it is necessary that in those there be a wide and firm wrapping, because the wide binding connects the large limb and binds it on all sides with even pressure, so that no blemish enters it.
Then begin, after your equalization evacuation, to place a bandage suitable for this, over the place of that fracture with three or four wrappings, according to what the limb requires; and tighten your hand a little with the bandage.
And then come with that to the highest part of the place of the fracture, and tighten less than you did your binding with which you bound the place of the fracture. And then extend yourself with a wrapping of the place of the fracture a little, and soften the binding little by little, until you take from the place a large part of it.
And then take another bandage and wrap it again over the broken place with a wrapping, and then come with the wrappings to the lower part of the fracture; and let your operation be in the tightening of the wrapping and in the softening of it according to what we have said in the first wrapping above.
And then place between the layers of bandage, linen or cloth with which the crookedness of the fracture is padded, if there is crookedness in it; and if not, place nothing there.
And then place another bandage over it, and then wrap over these bandages well-made splints immediately, if in the place there is no inflammation or hot abscess, and then place over it that which dries the abscess and which removes the inflammation; and leave that for some days; and then you tighten the splints over it.
And let the splints be of half a cane, smooth and well-formed wisely; or let them be of pine wood; or of palm branches; and let the width of each splint be according to this form and this figure:
However, it is necessary that the splint which is placed over the fracture be thicker and a little smoother than the other splints, and the length of the splint according to what is required for the limb in size and smallness; and then tighten over the splints with another bandage according to your first tightening; and then bind over it with thread decently as we have said of tightening, and it is that your tightening be according to the location of the fracture, the more it is distanced from the fracture, the less the tightening.
And it is necessary that the threads be moderate in thickness and fineness, and be of linen; and if the threads are thick, as I have seen in the operation of some fools placing their threads of twisted ropes, and it is a great error when the tightening falls out of equality.
And likewise, very fine threads are not convenient, because you will not achieve with those what you want through tightening, and it is not necessary that there be less than a finger's width between splint and splint.
And if the patient is harmed by the ends of the splints near the binding in those places, then place under those some carded flax or wool until that does not cause him harm.
Sometimes a fracture is accompanied by a wound, and a disruption occurs in the bone, and I will come to a recollection of that in the following chapter according to its singularity.
And know that not every broken limb is bound with splints on the first day; the reason for this is that, when the limb is large, it is not necessary to place splints on it except after about five days or seven or more, according to your certainty of the occurrence of a hot abscess.
And this is the manner of the plasters with which the Ancients restored [fractures], which are placed on fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
Method of a common, abbreviated plaster for the restoration of fractures, suitable for many complexions and especially for women and children, because it is something upon which neither heat nor cold prevails: and it is that you take the powder of the mill, which is the bran that hangs from the movement of the millstone on the walls of the mill.
And make it like this, except that you sift it with egg white, and apply the confection neither thick nor thin; and then use it.
Another method of a plaster restoring fractures, dislocations, and sprains: take of asafoetida, of labdanum, of acacia, of elecampane, and megrach (which is the root of wild pomegranate), of each one dram; of myrrh and aloes, half a dram; of aloechil, two drams; let all be crushed and sifted, and mixed with aloe water or with egg white if the patient's complexion is warm; and then use this plaster, for it is of good composition and restores slightly broken bones, and it benefits many people.
Another method of a plaster which benefits fractures and sprains: take megrach and marshmallow root, one dram each; of myrrh and aloes, half a dram each; of acacia, six drams; of Armenian bole, two drams.
Let all be crushed in a mortar with much pounding, and be sifted, and be mixed with water or with egg white and be administered.
A method for a plaster for joints and bones separated from their places, and if pain occurs in those and in fissures and fractures: let soiled wool be taken and be submerged in sour wine and cooked oil and be placed on the area.
However, in this plaster there is no restorative virtue, rather it draws out hot abscesses and expels pain effectively.
Another method of a plaster that restores a broken bone: take fresh fig leaves and wild poppy leaves; pound everything and make a plaster from them.
A method for a brief plaster administered for the restoration of a bone fracture and when you want resolution of the remaining abscess: take roots of marshmallow, chamomile, and violet flowers, barley flour, of each an equal part; let all be crushed and be mixed with wine, if the limb is not inflamed.
But if it is inflamed, then mix that with moist coriander water or with water and use it.
Another method for a stronger plaster in resolution than the first, when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of a limb: take roots of marshmallow and linseed, and of pomegranate, and melilot, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, of each an equal part; let all be crushed and be mixed with willow water or with fresh water or with wine, all this according to the quality of the limb and the restoration of its color.
However, Hippocrates did not say in his book that it should be placed on the broken limb during its restoration except a cerate made of wax and oil and nothing else; and he recommends that it be of medium consistency between thick and thin.
But in Gaul it is seen that they are placed on the broken limb during its restoration, and the substances which are drying with a little heat are thus, such as myrrh, incense, and similar to those substances that we have mentioned.
Method for a plaster that relieves injury and pain: take millet, chickpea flour, shaved human hair or bird feathers, and marshmallow, and salt, in equal parts; let them be crushed and sifted and mixed, and let a plaster be made.
But the amount of time the bandage should remain in place and when it should be loosened is that you consider whether no pain or itching has occurred, and if the bone is not broken or moved from its place, then you should not loosen it for many days. And if at the location there is intense pain or itching or inflammation, then you should carefully loosen or untie it at that time, and remove the plaster from it.
And take linen cloth and a moist sea sponge, and submerge it in lukewarm water, and with this wash the area until the itching ceases and the pain is calmed; and then allow the limb to rest for an hour; and then place on it soiled wool submerged in sour wine and oil or rose oil, and bind it on for a night until you are certain of a hot abscess, and that the inflammation of the limb subsides, and its pain is lessened.
And then repeat that subtle constriction and small plaster and do not tighten it with your first constriction, but refine it with that until it is healed.
And if you see that the abscess and the redness and the pain and the inflammation and all the symptoms have already subsided completely, and you need a plaster and constriction, then you repeat it as you did at the beginning, equally.
And if there is no occurrence in the limb of any of those causes that we have mentioned, then do not loosen it until after three or four or five or seven days; and sometimes all of this is left for twenty days, depending on what appears to you upon loosening the limb, as we have said, until the fracture adheres, and approaches the coagulation of the flesh upon it.
And then adjust the constriction more than in your first constriction, and adjust it to the thickening of the patient's flesh, as his recovery proceeds.
But if you see the place of the fracture drying and thinning more than it should, then know that nourishment is prevented from reaching it; and therefore moisten it with lukewarm water every time you loosen it; and let this be done every three days; and loosen the constriction a little, and by this operation nourishment will run to the limb, and it will heal easily.
But what foolish restorers of a limb fracture do sometimes, when it is not set properly at the beginning, and is set crookedly, is an error according to their operation, and a great risk, and if this were correct, the Ancients would have enlarged upon it in their books and would have operated with it.
And I have not seen any of them do this, wherefore it is more reasonable not to do it.
Chapter Two: On fractures when they occur in the head.
The types of fractures are many, and their forms are diverse, and the causes are distinct, for some fractures are made by the percussion of a sword, and the percussion breaks the bone entirely to the marrow, which is beneath the bone, just as an axe does in wood, and for this reason this type is called axial; or the sword cuts some part of the bone, and cuts its flesh, but the incision does not go through to the back of it; and this type of fracture is called *levatio absoluta* (complete elevation/lifting).
And the wound from these two fractures is either large or small, and there is a fracture that is a contusion or abrasion; and its cause is percussion with a blunt object or a fall on a stone, and similar things.
And this fracture is either penetrating, approaching the periosteum which is beneath the bone; or it is on the surface of the bone, and the wound from these two fractures is either large or small.
And there is a fracture that is hidden in the bone, as small as the thinness of a hair, and for this reason this type is called a capillary fracture.
And there is a fracture that is made either by a fall or by percussion with a stone and similar things, which causes some lamina of the bone to enter the inner parts, and is made in a concave place, just as happens to the sides of a ram when it receives a blow and part of it is driven into the inner parts.
And this happens mostly in the bodies of soft bones, such as the skulls of infants.
And in all these types of comminuted fractures, the pieces are like separated stars. And I will bring everything back to its place with repositioning.
And we recognize all these types of fractures by probing them and by investigating them with probes and by removing the corrupted flesh that is upon them.
And a hairline fracture is known because it is uncovered on the bone, and it is wiped clean, and then examined with a probe, because the fracture appears black.
But in the treatment of a fracture, consider first the patient's symptoms.  And then if you see by the symptoms that it signifies by manifest signs of danger, such as vomiting of bile, prostration, loss of consciousness, loss of voice, syncope, acute fever, and sinking of the eyes and coldness of them, and similar symptoms in the most serious cases, without a doubt it is not easily healed.
And if you see no serious complications, you expect recovery, then you begin its treatment.
The reason is that if the injured person has come to you at the beginning, as injured, and this is in the winter months, then you must study the setting of the bone before the fourteenth day, according to every circumstance.
And if it is in the summer months, then you must endeavor to set the bone before the seventh day, before what is under the bone is corrupted by the periosteum, and before the complications that we have recounted occur.
And if the fracture has already reached the periosteum covering the brain, and is with small, splintered pieces, then you must incise the comminuted and splintered part, as I will explain to you.
And it is that you shave the head of the injured patient, and uncover the bone according to custom and manner as best you can according to the nature of the injury, and that it be gentle on the patient.
And if you encounter, during the uncovering of the bone, a flow of blood or a hot abscess, then you must oppose it with what is necessary, and that is to fill the area with cloths soaked in rose-colored wine and oil, and let the wound rest until the abscess is settled, and you are sure of the flow of blood; and then begin with the encircling of the bone and its removal.
And this should be done according to one of two methods of operation.
And one method is that you incise the bone with a narrow incisor, and this is its form:  And then apply another incisor like this, a little wider than that one; and this is its form:
And then apply even wider incisors than the second.
And it is necessary that you have a number of different incisors, some of which are wider than others; and some of them are shorter than others and should be sharp at the ends, and should be made of Indian iron or steel.
And use them with ease in percussion on the incisor so that you do not strike the head and damage it.
And if the bone is strong, hard, then it is necessary that you perforate its circumference before you apply the incisors with the drills, which are called shallow drills.
And they are not called so except because these do not reach the limit of the skull bone adjacent to it, because the drill has a round end or edge below its sharp head, similar to a small edge or circle, which prevents it from being submerged and passing through the thickness of the bone.
And it is convenient that you take a large number of these drills, each of which is suitable for the thickness of each bone, so that you have available for all parts of the skull a drill whose end is sharp, its length and shortness being according to the thickness of that part of the skull.
And this is the form of three kinds of drills: The way to perforate the circumference of the broken bone is to place the drill on the bone and rotate it with your fingers until you know that the bone has been penetrated; then move the drill to another place, and place the holes such that the space between them is the size of the width of a finger or thereabouts.
Then incise with incisors the area between each hole in the bone, and make it as thin as possible in order to remove the bone, either with your hand or with some other instrument that you will have prepared for this purpose, such as small pincers and forceps.
And you must take great care that the incisor does not touch anything of the brain.
And so when you have encircled the bone by perforating it, and it is separated from the brain if it is continuous with it, and you have extracted it, you should scrape and smooth its roughness where it is attached to the bone with another instrument similar to an incisor, but it should be thinner and finer than the other incisors.
And if any small and jagged pieces of bone remain, then remove them easily with the instruments you have available; and then treat the wound with liniments and ointments that we have mentioned.
And the other method of operation is easier and less frightening, which Galen described and praised highly; and this is his account: it is necessary for you at the beginning to begin by uncovering the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most severe and most evident, until, when you have uncovered that part and placed under it the tip of that slow and sharp incisor of which this is the form:
And it is so that the lenticular part is smooth and does not cut anything, and the sharp part is split in two lengthwise, like a pair of tongs; so that the lenticular part is applied to the brain with its surface, the sharp part cutting into the bone.
And then strike the incisor on one side with a small mallet until it cuts through all the bone easily as it is rotated, and you are sure of the periosteum so that no accident befalls it in any way, even if the physician were the most foolish of all men and the most ignorant of them; certainly, and if he were sleeping.
Then, if any matter adhering to the bone or periosteum remains in any part of the bone, cut it away with the lenticular end of that incisor, and remove it easily, for it is removed without harm or fear.
And if the fracture of the bone does not penetrate to the periosteum, and what is excised or removed from the bone is its surface, and roughness and small splinters remain, then you must scrape away that roughness and remove those splinters with fine rasps, for which you have prepared a number, of various sizes, so that it is possible for you to use in every place the most appropriate and most suitable of them according to how you proceed with your operation on that broken bone and its shape.
And you must proceed in your scraping with which you scrape the bone, beginning with the broadest of those rasps, and then use progressively the finer ones, and do not cease doing this continuously until you come to using the finest and most subtle of all of them.
But in each of the other small, capillary fractures and subtle fractures, you must administer care according to how you proceed to their rectification.
And this is a cause that is not hidden from all those who have studied this art. And I stand by what we have written and shown in cases of large fractures.
And if the panniculus (skin and subcutaneous tissue) is retracted when you scrape the bone, then you must take linen cloth according to the size of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the opening of the wound; and then take another doubled or tripled cloth and immerse it in wine and rose oil and place this over the thin cloth and do this as lightly as you can, so as not to press on the wound; and then apply a broad bandage over this, and do not tighten it except enough to hold the wound in place only.
And leave it with this dressing for a day or two until you are certain of a hot abscess; and then untie it and apply medicines that counteract excessive dryness, such as flaxseed, barley flour, and powder of chamomile and birthwort, and things similar to those.
And it is so that you make a powder of these medicines to be sprinkled on the wound, once they are dry; and generally, apply to it any medicine whose property it is to cleanse and not bite (i.e., cause further irritation).
And take care, according to your skill, that the wound in your treatment remains clean; and let there be no filth of ointment or anything else; and do not allow virulence to increase in it; for when it is applied to the pannicle of the brain, it corrupts and putrefies it, and this evil causes great harm to the patient.
And it happens in the wound of the head, as the bone is purified from it, and especially when its care is neglected, and there is blackness on its surface; and therefore, consider then that if the patient suffers the consequences that we have mentioned, know that it is pernicious without any doubt.
And if there is no blackness except from the medicine that is placed on top, and it is by virtue of that medicine that this blackness is made, then it is necessary that you take one part of honey and three parts of rose oil, and with these you should moisten a cloth, and then place it over the wound; and then treat it with the appropriate healing remedies until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
Concerning the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose is not broken except in two parts or one of them sometimes, because in it there are two bones, for the lower part is cartilaginous, and is not broken, and there is only abrasion, twisting, and crookedness in it.
But if one of the two parts of it is broken, then it is necessary that you insert your little finger into their nose, and that you equalize that fracture inside with your index finger, and with the thumb outside, until the nose returns to its natural shape. And let this be done by you with ease, and be careful that you do not cause the patient any pain through your operation.
And if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and the finger does not reach it, then it must be set with the end of a rod of small thickness.
And if the fracture is in two parts, then you do the same for both.
And take care to restore it on the first day of the fracture, if possible; and if not, then around the seventh or tenth day you should remove the heated poultice.
And then insert into the end of the nose a pledget of linen cloth, if the fracture is in one part, or two pledgets if the fracture is in two parts, and let the pledget be of such size as to fill the opening of the nose.
And I say that some of the ancient restorers say that the pledgets should be soaked in wine and changed every day, but I have not seen this; rather, it is necessary that the pledget be soaked in egg white mixed with powdered barley; and then leave the pledget there until the bone is set and the cartilage is hardened.
And sometimes, instead of a pledget, a goose feather, wrapped in linen cloth, should be inserted into the nose; and this is especially useful if the nasal fracture is severe and the patient is not impeded from breathing.
And this method is not necessary for you; and if you wish, do this, and if you wish, use pledgets.
And if another time a hot abscess occurs,  apply a plaster to the nose with cerate or with cotton soaked in sour wine and rose oil, or with diachylon.
But if a hot abscess does not occur, then you should plaster that area externally with sesame flour and powdered lentils mixed with egg white; and then place clean linen over it, and do not bind the nose with anything.
But if the nasal bones are broken with a small fracture or are comminuted, then it is necessary to make an incision over them, and extract them with instruments suitable for this; and then close the incision, and treat it with whatever promotes granulation and consolidation, and with suitable plasters for this.
And if a wound occurs inside the nose, then you should treat it with pledgets and administer lead cannulas until it is completely healed.
Chapter 4.
Concerning the restoration of the jaw when it is fractured.
When the lower jaw is broken and the fracture is not accompanied by a wound, observe then if the fracture is only external, and is not broken in two and is bent inwards at the broken parts, then its diagnosis is easy.
And it is necessary, therefore, if the fracture is on the right side, that you insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; and similarly if the fracture is in the left jaw, then insert the index finger of the right hand; and push with it the crookedness of the fracture inwards, easily aligning the external parts, with your other hand on the outside of the bone; thus decently equalizing it.
And if the fracture of the jaw is already separated into two, then it is necessary that you administer extension from two sides according to the straightness until its equalization is possible.
And if there is concussion of teeth with disruption, then bind those which you hope will remain with gold or silver wire or silk; and then place on the broken jaw a cerate [a medicated ointment], and then place over it a doubled cloth, and place on the cloth a well-made large compress, or a piece of sole leather equal to the length of the jaw; and then tie that above according to how the binding appears to you and as the application suits, until it is healed.
And command the patient to use rest and tranquility, and give him food of sorbitious [easily digestible]  liquids.
And if you estimate that the alignment has been altered in any way, then you should examine it and unbind it on the third day; and then rectify what has been altered and apply a plaster with powdered barley, with egg white, or with bean flour, after you have removed the cerate, and place wool over the plaster.
And then, when this plaster is attached and adjusted, and the position of the bone is not altered, leave it; do not unbind it until it is healed and the fracture is held firm; for many times this fracture is healed in three weeks.
And if another time a hot abscess occurs, then administer what we have said many times in its sedation until it is healed, and that abscess is reduced.
And if the fracture is with a wound, then consider if a piece of bone is separated or splintered; then you should carefully remove those splinters with whatever is suitable for this in the removal of them from the wound.
And if the opening of the wound is narrow, then you should widen it with a fleam, according to the amount of your need.
And then, when you have removed those splinters, and nothing remains of them, then sew the opening of the wound if it is wide; and if not, place on it one of the plasters which is suitable for this and heals it, until it is healed.
Chapter 5.
On the restoration of the clavicle when it is broken.
Many times the clavicle is broken in the front part above the muscle, and this fracture is done in one of three ways.
Because it is either broken, or separated, or separated into two parts without splinters; and it is easy to restore it; or it is so that splinters occur in it, and it is difficult to restore it; or it is so that the fracture is with a wound.
And the operation in that case, when the fracture is without a wound, is that you have two assistants present, so that one holds the fractured clavicle and supports it, and the other extends the neck towards that part.
And then align the fracture with your fingers until its shape is as it should be, and there is neither little prominence nor concavity in it.
And if you need more extension, then you should place under the patient's armpit a pad of cloth or wool, and let its size be according to your need; and extend and elevate the clavicle and compress the pad with your hand until you align the fracture as needed.
And if you cannot pull the end of the clavicle to the outer parts, because it has reached the acromion, then the patient should be supine on their neck, and you should place on the muscle a moderately sized cushion.
And the assistant presses the muscle downwards until the bone of the clavicle that is on the acromion above is elevated, and then you rectify the fracture and align it with your fingers.
But if you feel splinters of the clavicle and they are loose, then you should make an incision over it and easily extract those splinters.
And if it is retained in the bone, then you should carefully incise it with one of the scalpels that you have prepared for this, after having placed under the clavicle the instrument that serves as a support; and this instrument is made of wood or iron, of which this is the shape:
And it is similar to a spoon, of which this is the concavity; and let its width be according to your need, according to the size or smallness of the bone.
But its length should be as long as is possible for you in the operation; let it have two ends like a spoon, and one end should be wide and the other narrow.
And if the disruption of the wound which you have incised when you extracted the splinter from the bone is wide, and there is a risk of a hot abscess, then you should close the two edges of the wound with sutures.
And if the disruption is small, or you fear a hot abscess, then you should fill the wound with cloths and powders according to the size of the wound's incision.
And if a hot abscess occurs, then dip a cloth in sharp vinegar and rose oil and wine, and place it over that.
And above all, ensure the linen cloth is not dislodged from over the broken bone; and for that reason it is necessary that you see the patient each day, so that when the bandage is loosened or you see the linen cloth is already dislodged, then you correct that and tighten the binding.
And then place the patient's pillow under his neck, and place a small cushion under his testicles at night; so that with this his afflicted area is elevated, and thus the fracture of the clavicle is elevated by the muscle; or his arm should be tied to his neck.
And do not untie the bandage unless there is a noticeable swelling or abscess at the site, until twelve days have passed.
And then renew the plaster if you see the need, and adjust the binding and restore it, and leave it until the fracture of the clavicle is restored and coagulated.
And it is strengthened and healed, according to the condition, in twenty-eight days, and sometimes in some men it is done in less time than that.
Chapter 6.
Concerning the restoration of a shoulder fracture.
The shoulder blade is broken in its lateral part, and not broken through, but only at the edges.
And so when the place of it is broken — and it is broken in the middle of the place — and is not known except by touch, then, according to what the figure of the fracture shows, forcibly prepare it and reduce it to its natural shape in every way possible to you.
Then place on the area powdered barley mixed with egg white and lion's wool; then place a powder of doubled cloth; then place over it a thin linen bandage according to the size of the whole shoulder blade or a little more.
But if under the bandage there is a cavity in any of the parts of the shoulder blade, then you should fill that cavity with lion's wool, and then tighten the bandage evenly.
Then bind it over with a long bandage with decent constriction and firmness of the bandage until it is not loosened from its place.
And examine the binding each day; and every time that it is loosened, bind it again and tighten it, and even out the bandage if it is loosened from its place.
And let the patient lie on his healthy side.
And the shoulder blade is restored in 20 or 25 days.
And so when that number is complete, then you unbind it, and you should know for certain that this is for bones whose beginning is not feared nor their dissolution.
And if it proceeds from the location of the hip bone and settles below the rib cage, then you incise over it, and remove it, and proceed as we have said in the fracture of the clavicle concerning the cauterization of an abscess if that occurs here.
Chapter 7.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured foot.
The foot is sometimes broken in the middle, and this heals slowly; but its extremities heal much faster, as they are scarred and comminuted.
And among its accidents, when the middle of the foot is broken, it inclines inwards and causes great pain, difficulty breathing, coughing, and strong palpitations and vomiting of blood; and the cavity in the broken bone is apparent and not hidden from feeling.
And its restoration is that the patient should be supine on his back, and a cushion placed between his shoulders; and then press on his muscles, and adjust the bones with hands on both sides, and be skillful in the operation and in the setting, in every way possible and appropriate, until the bone's shape is restored as it should be.
Then place a plaster and lint over it, and place over that a splint of thin willow or lime wood, or similar in lightness, after you have wrapped it in cloth; and then be skillful in tying it over the broken bone so that it is not disturbed; and use a bandage, sometimes round the back, and tighten it with a suitable constriction; and then check the bandage frequently, and tighten it when it loosens.
And if necessity demands loosening it because of corrosion or itching, or pain, or an abscess that occurs in the area, then you should carefully untie it, remove the plaster, and rectify what has occurred with appropriate treatment; and then replace the plaster, if it seems appropriate; and adjust the bandage until it is healed.
Chapter 8.
Concerning the restoration of ribs when they are broken.
Know that a fracture of the ribs only occurs in the thick parts which are two; and in their extremities, in the front part, no crushing occurs, except because they are cartilaginous. And knowledge of it is not hidden from the feeling of its investigation with the fingers.
And the restoration should be thus: equalize the fracture with the fingers as much as possible, until it is aligned as needed, and then plaster and bind the broken bone with a bandage, if that is needed.
And if the fracture of the ribs is inclined towards the inner parts, then the patient suffers vehement pain and a stabbing sensation, like the stabbing pain that occurs in someone with pleurisy, and this is because the bone pierces the membrane; and the patient experiences difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting much blood; and this is difficult to cure.
And already the Ancients were ingenious in that with many inventions.
And of them it is said: it is necessary that you give the patient foods that produce inflation and flatulence, so that the belly is inflated and distended, and the fracture is pushed outwards.
But we would avoid this so that it does not lightly cause a hot abscess, if it does not already exist; and if it already exists, then it helps with that.
And some of them said that a cupping glass should be placed on top and that it should draw strongly; and it seems reasonable, but it is feared that the cupping glass will draw superfluities to the place because of the weakness.
And some of them said: the place should be covered with wool that has been submerged in hot oil, and powders should be placed between the ribs until it is full, so that the bandage is even as it encloses that roundness; and then the patient should be treated with the treatment for pleurisy, with diet and medicine.
And if a violent cause constricts the patient, which he cannot bear, and the bone pierces the skin with a lacerating puncture,  threatening the patient's life, then it is necessary to make an incision over the area, uncover the fractured rib, and then place over it the instrument that preserves the lung, the remembrance of which is mentioned previously, and that we incise the bone easily and remove it.
And then we should join the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with sutures, and treat it with plasters until it is healed.
And if an abscess forms inside, then you should consider and insert powders into rose oil and place [it] over the area, and the patient should be treated with what is appropriate for the internal abscess.
And let him lie supine on the side on which he sleeps, until he is healed.
Chapter 9.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the spine and neck.
Sometimes a fracture occurs in the bones of the neck, and it is slow to heal, and similarly in the vertebrae of the back. And when this happens to someone and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then consider: for if you see his hands already softened and numbed and dead, and he cannot move them, nor extend nor flex them, and when you constrict them with your fingers or prick them with a needle and he feels no pain in them, then know that he is not healed, and in most dispositions, it is mortal.
And if he moves them and feels constriction in them with the fingers and puncture, then know that the marrow of the bone is safe and that the patient will recover with treatment.
And if he has something similar in the vertebrae of the neck and you want to know if he will be healed or not, then consider his feet.
Then if you see that they are already softened, the same thing happens to them as happened to the hands, and when he lies on his back, he experiences flatulence and defecation without his will, and sometimes he lies supine on his back and wants to urinate and cannot, then know that it is mortal, and then do not labor in his cure.
But if none of those things happen, the cause is better and lighter.
And his cure is that you should perforate the inflamed boil, that you place on the affected vertebra only pure rose oil, or with beaten egg whites; apply this several times a day until the inflamed boil is healed.
And then apply one of the comforting and stimulating plasters, and bind it tightly; and command the patient to use rest and tranquility and not to sleep on the side where he finds pain until it is healed.
And if it happens because of the attrition of a bone splinter, or some cause that is already separated from it, then it is necessary that you cut the skin over the bone and remove that bone; and then join the two lips of the wound with sutures if it is large; and then treat it with some incarnative ointment until it is healed.
But if the posterior part of the hip bone is broken, and it is the end of the hip joint, then it is necessary that you insert the little finger of your left hand into the rectum, and that you manipulate the broken bone with the other hand as much as is possible by gentle traction; and then apply a plaster and bandage, if you judge it necessary, and then bind it tightly.
And if you feel splinters of bone in it, then you should probe that area, and remove them, and treat the wound with the previously described treatment until it is healed.
Chapter 10.
Concerning the restoration of the hip.
The hip bones are rarely broken, and if they are broken, then their fracture is only a communication in the extremities of those bones and is located lengthwise, and inclines towards the inner parts; and the patient experiences pain and throbbing in the area, and the leg is numb when it is fractured.
And the restoration of it is that you extend your hand over it until it is over the fracture, which is the shape of it.
And if the fracture is only in the extremity of it, then you align that according to what is prepared for you by equalization, aligning it until it resembles its natural shape.
But if the fracture is lengthwise or inclines towards the lower parts, then you have the patient lie on their stomach so that the restoration of that fracture is prepared for you. And then when you have aligned it, place a plaster on it, and then place a splint of wood or bone on top of that, and tighten it with a bandage such that you do not fear a displacement of the fracture or a movement of the splint.
And align the concavity with something that fills it until it receives the bandage evenly, and instruct the patient to sleep on their back or on their healthy side.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you cease the extension of it and its restoration until the hot abscess is sedated, and place on it something that sedates it as has been previously described; and then return to its restoration, and bind it as is necessary.
And if it happens in the bones that they are shattered or comminuted, then you extract them.
Chapter 11.
Concerning the restoration of a fracture of the clavicle (collarbone).
The clavicle is that which is between the shoulder and the neck.
And if it is broken, then its restoration is in one of two ways, of which one is that you take a wooden splint of moderate thickness according to this form:
And let two bandages be tied at both ends, and then it should be suspended from a raised position.
And place the patient on a seat; and then lay their broken arm upon the splint until it reaches the armpit, in the middle of which the curve of the splint should be fitted.
And then suspend some heavy weight from it, or let the attendant extend it downwards; and then let the physician set the fracture with his hands, until the fracture is properly realigned.
And the other method is that the patient lies supine on their back and suspend the arm from their neck with a bandage; and then instruct two attendants that one of them should hold that which is above the fracture with their hands; and the other should hold the part below; and each of them should extend it in their direction.
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then you should tighten a bandage over the fracture and another bandage over that, and each of the two attendants should extend to their respective parts.
And thus, if the fracture is close to the extremity of the muscle, then it is necessary that half of the bandage be placed on the armpit and the other below the fracture near the elbow.
Similarly, if the fracture is near the elbow, then it is necessary that the bandage be placed on that spot and on that elbow.
Swathe that with ease and without trouble, and when it is swathed as necessary and applied with a good application, then tighten it unless a hot abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then leave the binding until the seventh day, and place on it soiled wool soaked in sharp wine and rose oil until the abscess subsides, and then you should tighten that.
And the manner of tightening it is that you place a plaster on the fracture, and then place a wrapping of new cloth over the plaster; and then adjust the arm on that support, and place your open hand on their muscle.
And place the cloth and tighten the arm on the support so that the arm is in a fixed position, unless some cause of the broken bone prohibits this.
And then use splints.
And it is [necessary] that you place on the fracture that splint which is wider and stronger than the other splints; and place between each splint the width of a finger, and let the length of the splints be according to the fracture with the addition of three fingers on each side.
And then tighten the splints with the bandage which I mentioned at the beginning of the chapter.
And it is [necessary] that your bandage over the fracture site be tighter. And the longer the fracture, the less tight the bandage should be.
And so if you see the placement of the splints and the bandage as we have said at the time when you restore the limb to its proper position, then you [proceed].
And if you fear a hot abscess, then you leave the bandage and splints in place until the seventh day, as we have said.
And then examine the bandage in all parts for three days so that no itching or inflammation occurs at the site;  or [it is] forbidden for food to reach the limb due to the tightness of the bandage; and therefore rectify all this as we have said.
But if you are confident that none of this will happen, then do not untie the bandage until after three days or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on their back, and their hands should be on their stomach.
And place over the splint a poultice full of wool evenly, and check every hour of the night and day that the shape of the broken limb is not loosened or dissolved, or that the bandage is softened; therefore, rectify all this with your skill.
And give the patient food according to the order which we have previously mentioned, so that the food is light at the beginning until the [wound] begins to close; and then it is fitting that you thicken his food.
Because it is customary for the splint and his leg to be bound for forty days; and then it is fitting that they be unbound and a bath be administered and it be medicated with ointments which rectify that.
And if the fracture is badly crushed, then you should not untie the bandage and splints from it until one month or until two months.
Chapter 12.
Concerning the restoration of a fractured arm.
The arm is composed of two bones which are called two forearms; of which one is small, and it is that which is next to the little finger, and the other is large and it is that which is placed below the small finger, on the lower side.
And very easily the larger forearm is broken alone, or the smaller, and very easily they are broken together.
And when the small forearm is broken above, then its restoration is easy, and its healing is easier.
And when the forearm is broken below, its fracture is bad, and its healing is difficult.
And worse than that is when both bones are broken together.
Therefore, if the bone that is broken is the smaller forearm above, then it is convenient for the physician, during its restoration, to apply slight extension easily until it is aligned.
But if it is the larger forearm that is broken, then it is necessary to apply more forceful extension.
And if both forearms are broken together, then you must apply the extension much stronger.
And it is necessary that you position the shape of your hand during its restoration and extension stretched out on a cushion, and the wrist of the hand should be at the upper parts, higher than all the other fingers, and the little finger should be lower than the other fingers, and the patient should be lying on a flat couch.
And let there be a cushion in front of him at his height or level, so that the patient does not suffer strain.
Then let one assistant extend the arm from the lower part with his hand or with a bandage, and another assistant extend it from above similarly.
Then the physician should manipulate the bone until he reduces it according to the best possible position.
And if in the fracture of the bone there are splinters, then you must forcefully reduce all pieces to their place with your skill.
And if a separated splinter appears that penetrates the skin and you have no hope of restoring it, then you should cut it off and remove it according to the method which we have described above.
But if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, I have already dedicated a special chapter to that, and therefore take care of it accordingly.
And if an abscess occurs early in your treatment, then you should apply a cloth with a cerate made of rose oil and white wax, of moderate consistency (neither too thick nor too thin), and bind the cloth tightly over it until the abscess subsides; and then remove the cerate and apply a plaster prepared from powdered molli (possibly a type of herb or powder) with egg white, and then apply a compress; and the compress that is applied over the fracture should be thicker and firmer.
And know that the number of compresses on the arm depends on the major disposition, whether the fracture is in one bone or in two bones together.
Then apply your bandage over the fracture site as firmly and tightly as possible, and if the bandage is closer to the parts above the fracture or to the parts below it, apply the bandage a little more loosely, as was previously mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.
And the cloths that are wrapped around the fracture should be soft and moist, not hard or rough, and the thread with which it is bound should be of moderate thickness, neither too fine nor too coarse, as we have already recommended.
And examine the limb and the bandage after a few days. And if any event occurs that requires correction, such as itching which happens in the limb, then you should bathe the limb with warm water until that itching ceases.
And leave the limb unconstrained until it rests, and then reapply the bandage.
And if the fracture is already softened and the bone is rejoined and similar to the others, then correct everything with your skill.
And consider further if the nourishment is prevented from reaching the limb due to excessive tightness of the bandage, for then it is necessary that you loosen it a little and leave it so for a few days until nourishment flows to it, and then tighten it again.
But if the patient experiences none of the conditions we have mentioned, then the bandage should not be loosened for approximately twenty days or thereabouts.
And then let the patient's hand be suspended by its own agitating movement, and make him sleep on his back.
And know that this fracture is healed in thirty days or in thirty-two days, or even quickly in twenty-eight days, and all this depends on the constitution and the disposition of the body's powers.
Chapter 13.
Of the restoration of a fracture of the wrist and fingers.
Know that fractures rarely happen in the wrist and the finger joints; instead, attrition [or wearing away] occurs many times.
And when a fracture or attrition occurs in the hand, then it is necessary that the patient lie down, and a pillow be placed under his arm, according to the level, and then place his hand on that extended pillow.
And then let the assistant extend the broken bones, and the physician join them until they are joined with a good conjunction.
And then it is necessary to apply a plaster and lint, unless a hot abscess occurs; and then place a bandage over it according to the size of the area, and you have already wrapped it in linen cloth.
But if the fracture is in the inner parts of the palm of the hand, then make a kind of ball of cloth, and instruct the patient to squeeze it with his fractured palm; then let it be bound tightly with a long cloth.
And let the bandage be of leather with cloth in which it is softened, so that the leather is applied to the palm; and tighten it as needed.
But if the fracture is on the outer parts, then it is necessary that you place a bandage above and another bandage below on the palm, so that the hand is open and straight; and then apply the splint, as the hand is bent at the wrist between the fingers with ligaments.
And if a fracture occurs in any of the knuckles of the fingers, then if it is the thumb, let it be straightened as needed and then bound to the palm and, if you wish, apply a small straight splint so that the fracture is elevated and not moved.
But if the fracture is in the other fingers, such as in the middle finger, or in the index finger, or in the ring finger, or in the little finger, then let it be straightened and bound to the finger next to it; or let them all be bound together consecutively, which is better; or place a small splint on it, as we have said for the thumb.
And consider, in your restoration, and close to it, the disposition of a hot abscess and oppose — with your operation — what is needed when any of those things occur, as his narrative reiterates.
Chapter 14.
Of the restoration of a fracture of the thigh bone.
The thigh bone is often broken and this is apparent to the senses depending on whether it is broken at the front or the upper part.
And its restoration is done in this way: a bandage is tightened above the fracture and another bandage below the fracture, and the patient is laid prostrate on their stomach and face.
Then the physician extends the entire bandage to its appropriate part, according to the nature of the fracture, when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is close to the hip joint, then let the bandage be close to the knee on the side of the kneecap, so that the extension pulls upwards, and the other bandage below the fracture.
And similarly, if the fracture is close to the knee, then let the bandage be placed near the knee, and let the extension be towards the lower parts.
And then the physician manipulates the bone with both hands until he reduces it to its natural form and the bone is joined by a good conjunction; then it is necessary to apply a plaster and a bandage, unless an abscess occurs in the limb. But if an abscess occurs, then you leave it for some days until the heat of the abscess subsides, and then return to your treatment.
The bandage should be made thus:  you should wrap a firm bandage around the fracture, and fold it two or three times, removing any excess; and then wrap the leg until it reaches the ankle and the hip joint.
And insert a long strip of material between the thigh and the leg near the knee on the lower parts, and let the ends of the material come from the upper part of both sides, and then wrap around the leg and thigh what is superfluous of the bandage.
And then place splints on the thigh at the site of the fracture, and place one splint over the bone of the leg.
And then fill the spaces between the leg and thigh with soft cloths, so that the bandage is firm.
And then begin with a firm bandage in the middle over the fracture site with three or four wrappings, and the further you move from the fracture site, the looser and softer your bandage should be.
And then extend the two ends of the material to the lower parts until it reaches the ankle, and tighten both ends of the splints on the other side so that the bandage is not loosened from its place.
And then leave the bandage there, in such a way that it does not cause corrosion, hot abscess, swelling, or anything similar to the limb; and if any of these things occur, then carefully loosen it, and rectify what has happened immediately, as we have said many times.
But if there is a piece of bone in the bone that protrudes, then you must reposition it as much as possible; and if not, cover it and reduce it, and treat it with what has been previously mentioned until it is healed.
And sometimes this fracture of the thigh is tightened beyond what is achieved by applying splints, just as we have described in the treatment of the arm.
However, in the restoration done in this way, lameness does not occur to the patient; and if it is restored alone, without the other leg being supported, then it is necessary that he limps on that leg constantly.
And know that the thigh is bound for forty days, or a little more or a little less, and all this depends on the diversity of complexions and other dispositions.
Chapter 15.
Of the restoration of the fracture of the kneecap.
Know that a fracture of the kneecap heals slowly, but often causes attrition (or wearing away).
But if a fracture occurs, then it is only a fissure or hole in its parts, and this is with or without a wound, and all this is accompanied by feeling (or sensation).
And its restoration is thus: that which is broken of its parts should be joined together with the said things until it is added and conjoined as much as possible by equalization, ease, and fabrication (or construction/setting).
Then apply a plaster and place a round splint over it, if you need it; and bind it above with a suitable bandage.
And then consider all the provisions which we have recommended in the other fractures, such as a hot poultice and similar things, so that every accident is opposed with what is convenient for it until it is healed.
Chapter 16.
Concerning the restoration of a leg fracture.
Know that in the leg there are two bones, of which one is large and is called by the name of tibia [shinbone]; and the other is slender and is called fibula.
And the same types of fractures occur to each of these bones of the leg as occur to the two bones of the arm, and therefore its restoration is done in the same way as the restoration of the arm, and the operation is the same.
And if the two bones are broken together, the leg is bent in all directions.
And if the thinner bone is broken, the leg is bent forward.
And if the thicker bone is broken, you will find it below, and it is among those things that are not easily visible to you.
Then administer extension, setting, and ligation of the splints according to that same method.
However, if the leg fracture is large with many splinters, the extension should be less and gentler, and alleviate it with your skill.
And in the leg there is some cause for operating on the bones, and when you are setting the bones and completing your entire operation, then you will take pieces of pine wood, which are placed under the bandages that are placed on the soles, and are usually made of palm branches; choose those of small thickness, and not the thin ones, and let their length be according to the length of the leg, from the knee to the very bottom.
Then wrap each one in two cloths according to its length, and place one on one side of the leg and the other on the other side, and they should extend from the knee to the lowest part of the foot.
Then bind the two splints in three places: at both ends and in the middle, for with this tightening the leg is prevented from bending to the right and left, and remains in a good position.
And now a small splint of wood, according to the length of the leg, has been applied; and let the leg be placed upon it so that it maintains that position without movement.
And especially it is necessary that you do this in a fracture, and when there is a wound with it properly.
And then consider the leg each day and study it with careful examination, and guard it from abscess and inflammation or other similar conditions; and if any of these conditions occurs, then attend to it with what is necessary until it is healed.
Chapter 17.
Of the fracture of the talus and the bones of the foot and toes.
A fracture of the whole talus does not often occur; but fractures of the bones of the foot do occur sometimes; and fractures of the toes rarely occur, and what occurs to them is more often attrition from ill-disposition.
And if a fracture occurs to the bones of the foot and sometimes those bones are elevated above one another, then have the patient place his foot on the ground prepared as before.
Then place one foot on that which is elevated of those bones, and then press down on them, and squeeze and manipulate them until they return to their places.
Then apply a plaster and lint on top, and place under the sole of the foot a small board to which two padded ends are attached.
Then bind that with the foot with a descending bandage, after you have wrapped it with cloths and other things that you need.
And when three or four days have passed for him, then you untie the bandage, for you will find the bones set, whether they were fractured or dislocated, and the operation on them is as you know.
But if some say they are fractured, then restore those, and manipulate them as I have recounted to you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. Then apply to the fractured finger a splint according to the length of the finger, and let it be a little longer than it; and place under the foot that board which I have recounted to you, and bind it with a suitable bandage.
But if that which is fractured of the bones is two or three or more, then you place on each finger a splint of its size wrapped in lion cloth, and bind the board at the bottom of the foot, and let it rest on one of the ends of the board outside the sole of the foot so that it holds with good retention.
And it is convenient for you that you not forget that you consider all the causes which I have told you in the other fractures of the accidents that we have mentioned; and oppose yourself to every accident with what is fitting.
Chapter 18.
Of the fracture of the woman's hip and of the pubic bone and of the man's penis.
When the hip of the woman is fractured, then make her lie down on her back, and gently incline her to one side a little, and let her be held from behind.
And then the midwife fills the hip with cotton, and it should be made into a kind of ball in her hip; and then the woman should be lifted, and her hip raised little by little, for all this is to be manipulated until the fractured part of the hip is in place, like a ball, and the broken bone returns [to its place].
And then place powders on her back, and when she wants to urinate, remove the cotton easily and let her urinate, and reposition and return it according to the method with which you set it initially, and then return to her first position.
And do this for seven days or thereabouts, for then it is restored.
And if you wish, take an ox bladder and attach a reed cannula to its opening; and insert the whole bladder into her hip, and then blow into the cannula forcefully until the bladder is inflated inside the hip, for this will help the fracture to return [to its proper place].
And then it should be filled with cotton and remain so for some days, as we have advised, until it is healed.
And when the pubic bone of a man or woman is fractured, then administer for its restoration and healing what we have recommended for the hip bone.
And that which is right is not hidden in these nearby fractures that occur infrequently, especially for one who has some study, use, and understanding of this my book; for that fracture signifies to you in the greatest provisions the correct way in its restoration and its binding, and therefore understand well.
But in the case of a fractured penis, take the white of an egg, and place the penis in it; and then place a cloth bandage over it, and let it be wrapped, and then let it remain for three days or thereabouts, and it will be healed.
Chapter 19.
Of the restoration of bone fractures when they are accompanied by a wound.
It is convenient for one who suffers a fracture with a wound, and especially if the bone is large, such as the thigh bone or the humerus, or similar to those, that you carefully consider and immediately phlebotomize him if the conditions for phlebotomy indicate it as we have said above.
And if the wound flows with blood, then it is necessary that you attend to its retention so that you pulverize crushed egg whites over it, if no other cause is present.
And then begin to set the fracture on that same day, and do not delay this, unless an abscess occurs.
But if a hot abscess occurs, then you should leave its restoration until the ninth day, until the abscess has subsided, and do not approach it on the third and fourth days at all, for you will cause bad accidents.
But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin, uncovered, then you must carefully reduce it and align it with your hands gently and with little extension.
But if extension is not prepared for you and the alignment of it with your hands, then you reduce it with your hands using this instrument; and this instrument is made of iron, its length being seven or eight fingers, and its width according to the size of the wound; and for this it is necessary for the physician to take three or four of these, according to the quantity needed for this in the treatment of every kind of fracture.
And let it be round, and let it be of little thickness so that it is not bent by the compression upon it during the operation.
And let it have a sharp end which has a margin at its edges; and let the upper part of it be of increasing thickness, and from the middle of it to the ends.
And this is its form:
And it is named in Greek "labre volentz atelarem," that is, a small spatula.
Because it is necessary that the sharp end of it be raised above the end of the prominent bone.
And push that in at once until the bone returns, and it is held in place with some device.
And then strive to align the ends of the fracture, and if the broken end of the bone is thin and does not accept the instrument properly, then you must cut the end of that bone until the instrument can grasp it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone completely with what we have recommended, then incise it with whatever is suitable from among the incisors which we have mentioned; or saw it with one of the saws in whatever way is possible for you.
And then scrape away what remains on the bone of roughness and small splinters.
And when the bone is reduced, and after the reduction the patient finds intense, persistent pain, then know that the bone is not returned to its natural place; and then do what you can to give the patient great relief.
When your restoration of the bone is complete, then submerge a cloth in black styptic wine, especially if it is summer, and do not place on the wound cerate or anything else containing oil, so that it does not cause putrefaction and corruption there.
And then administer stitches at the time of your completion of the bone's restoration, and leave the wound uncovered so that you may incise the opening with scissors and use bandages according to the size of the wound.
And guard yourself with all caution that you do not constrict the wound with the fracture, for many times foolish physicians have done this, and it has caused death or a corrosive or suppurating disease, that is, gangrene, in their patients. And if your constriction is light, soft, different from the constriction of other fractures.
And if the wound is large or a bad wound, and you fear some bad accidents which we have recounted, and you find pain in the place, then it is not fitting that you place stitches there, but apply a bandage of firm cloths instead of stitches and bind it with those.
And when after a day or two the wound begins to generate pus, then you remove the cloth which you had placed on it with wine, and then administer poultices, ointments with which it is our custom to treat wounds, such as tetrapharmacon ointment and similar ones.
And it is fitting for you to untie the bandage and examine the wound each day, morning and evening, until it is consolidated and healed, and it is necessary that the limb be positioned in such a way that the pus flows from it downwards with ease.
If many days pass and the wound is not healed nor is the pus removed from it, then know that here are hidden small things, wherefore it is necessary to investigate the wound with a probe. And of those hidden things, those which are separated, remove and extract them; those which are not separated and press on the limb and cause pain, you must incise them as far as it is possible for you.
And if a swelling or ulcer occurs in the wound, that is, a stye, or another kind of corruption and putrefaction, then it is necessary that you treat each of these with what is appropriate for it, of whose treatment a description has been given previously in its chapter.
And this is what my discourse should address and you should take note of: when a large bone is fractured, elevate the limb, such as the bone of the hip and the humerus and similar large limb bones, and do not attempt traction or extraction of it, for many times death occurs because of this; rather, leave it until it festers, for it will fall away by itself very quickly, within twenty or thirty days; and then treat the wound if it seems appropriate to you, and if not, leave it be.
Chapter 20.
Chapter 20: Of the treatment of a swelling that occurs at the site of a fracture.
Often this swelling occurs at the site of the healing of a fracture, and especially if it is near the joints, and it deforms the shape of the limb; and it quickly prevents the limb from its natural function.
Then consider if the swelling is recent and administer medicines that have styptic properties, such as aloes, and incense, and myrrh, and cerecloth, and acacia, and similar things;  so that you take some or all of these, and mix them with styptic wine, or with egg white, or with sour wine, and apply it to the swelling on a cloth, and bind it tightly.
And leave the bandage so that you do not untie it for many days; and then untie it and apply another, until the swelling is reduced; or bind a thin sheet of lead tightly over it, because lead has the property of reducing anything that is swollen in the limbs.
But if the swelling has already become hardened and constricted, and necessity compels its removal carefully, then incise it at its most elevated part, and excise the excess and prominent parts, or scrape it with a sharp instrument until it is reduced; and treat it until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Chapter 21. Of the restoration of a fracture when it is set, and afterward the limb remains thin and weak, not according to its nature.
When a bone fracture is set, and afterward the limb remains thin and weak, this is caused by many things: one of which is excessive loosening of the ligaments and their binding not as it should be; or by excessive tightness of the bandages so that nourishment is prevented from flowing to the limb; or by excessive application of embrocations; or by excessive movement not at the proper time; or by a lack of blood in the patient's body and their weakness.
And the cure for this is to give the patient nourishing food and to make his heart cheerful so that his blood is increased; and administer baths; and introduce joy and merriment to him.
And then apply a poultice to the limb, so that the poultice draws much nourishment to it, or continue embrocation with lukewarm water until nourishment flows and returns to its natural form.
Chapter 22.
Chapter 22. Of the treatment of fractured bones when they are set crookedly and the proper operation is prevented.
When it happens to a limb already healed from crookedness and prominence at the fractured bone and swelling, and because of this there is deformity of the limb, but nevertheless the limb is not prevented from its natural function, then you should not accept the opinion of one who thinks that limb is newly fractured.
But there have been many foolish physicians and healers who have done this in our land; and this operation is very blameworthy, leading to great fear, the sign of which is death.
But if the lameness and swelling are recent, then they should be bathed in lukewarm water in which are boiled emollient herbs, such as mallow leaves and roots, melilot, and similar things; and a poultice should be made with a softening poultice such as well-made diachylon; or a mucilage of mallow root should be prepared and mixed with white clay or wax oil, and applied as a poultice; or ripe figs should be taken and crushed with pigeon dung, and similar things from the medicines that are called  "emollients for consolidation".
And sometimes it is resolved with frequent light friction with moist hands, and movement of the limb in every direction should be administered at all times.
But if the crookedness has progressed and become severe and hardened, and there is need to treat it with iron, then it should be sawn off above the affected area and the continuity of the bone dissolved, and that which is superfluous to the swelling of the bone itself should be incised with fine scalpels, and relief should be provided to this with care and skill.
Chapter 23.
Concerning a discourse on dislocation.
A dislocation is the displacement of one of the joints from its place, because of which movement is impeded, and the shape of the limb is distorted, and it causes great pain and injury to the patient.
Therefore, when a dislocation occurs to someone, then it is necessary to immediately strive that it be reduced, and not delay that reduction, because if it is delayed, the place becomes inflamed and easily, by this, the reduction of the dislocation becomes difficult.
And for this reason it should not be moved or stretched during the inflammation, because many times it causes spasms and intense pain.
But when this happens, then you should attend to the phlebotomy of the patient, and then allow it to rest until the inflammation subsides; and then the limb should be bathed with warm water and oil, and then it should be reduced with ease.
And every limb should be treated with that which will bring about its recovery.
And I have already ordered the chapters on dislocation according to what preceded in fracture; from the most superior part of the body to the most inferior part.
Chapter 24.
Of the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
If the two jaws are dislocated, it happens quickly; and the dislocation of both is done in one of two ways: either they are removed from their places by slight movement, and are slightly softened; or they are dislocated by complete and total dislocation, so that they are loosened at the joint, to the point that saliva flows from the patient and they cannot retain it or close their mouth, and their tongue is entangled in their speech.
But when their dislocation is slight, then in most instances it returns by itself with little intervention.
But if the dislocation is complete and total, then a gentle reduction must be administered, and it should not be delayed at all.
And it is so that the assistant holds the patient's head, and the physician inserts the thumb of one hand into the root of the jaw dislocation inside the patient's mouth, if the dislocation is on one side; or that he inserts both thumbs together, if the dislocation is on both sides, and the other fingers of his hands are outside with which he pulls; and he commands the patient to relax their jaws and allow them to be moved from each side; and the physician pulls the jaw and pushes the jaw until it returns to its place.
And if the reduction is difficult, and especially if both jaws are dislocated together, then administer a vaporization with hot water and oil, until the reduction of both is made easier and do not delay the reduction of both at all, as we have said.
And then, when they are returned and pulled together, and the patient's mouth is closed and not softened, then place on it powders of cloth with cerate, and it should be made of wax and rose oil; and then it should be bound easily with soft bandages.
And let the patient sleep on their back, and their head should be between two pillows, so that it does not lean to the right or left; and do not force them to chew anything; rather, their food should be finely minced, until, when the pains are lessened and the jaws are healed, then let them eat what they wish.
And this should be administered with ease, and do not work on opening the mouth during eating and drinking and speaking, until the jaw is healed and mended.
And if the reduction of the two jaws is difficult when they are dislocated at some time and are not returned to their places, then many times fevers and continuous thirst occur, and very quickly the patient's belly is distended, and very quickly and purely choleric vomit is produced.
And when you see this, then know that it is dangerous; and many times he to whom this happens dies within ten days.
Chapter 25.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the clavicle and of the extremity of the muscle.
The clavicle is not dislocated inwards because of its connection with the ribs; and sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and this is evident to the touch.
And its restoration is that the patient lies on his back and extends his arms. And then constrict the area with your palm with firm compression, for it will return.
And then place a plaster and powders on it and bind it tightly.
But the extremity of that which is joined to the hip and is continuous with it, is not dislocated on any side; then it must be reduced and bandaged as we have said and as is available to you.
And then place a plaster, and powders, and a bandage on it, and instruct the patient to adhere to quiet and rest until it is healed.
And with this same treatment, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it is separated from its place.
Chapter 26.
Of the reduction of the dislocation of the muscle.
Know that a muscle is dislocated in only three ways, one of which is that it is dislocated from the upper part to the lower part.
And the second is that it is dislocated to the upper part of the muscle, and this is done slowly; and it is not dislocated to the rear parts by the shoulder; and it is not dislocated to the front parts by the nerves.
And it is mostly dislocated and protrudes outwards to the lower parts below the armpit, and especially in those who have little flesh, it is easily dislocated; but in those who have much flesh, it comes out with difficulty.
And it quickly happens to some men through a blow or fall, and their muscle is inflamed with a hot abscess, and it is believed to be dislocated because of that.
Then you should examine this carefully before attending to him, and then proceed with his cure.
And the dislocation is known when it is in the lower parts below the armpit; so that you distinguish between the dislocated muscle and the healthy muscle, because you find a manifest difference between them; and you find in the head of the muscle a concavity, and below the armpit, next to the touch of the head of the muscle, something like an egg, and the patient cannot bring his hand to his ear, nor move it in all movements.
If it is dislocated near the feet or upwards, and you then find a manifest swelling, and it is not hidden.
And the reduction of this dislocation is easily done when it is recent and the patient is a child.
And the reduction of it is that the minister raises his hand to the upper parts; and then places his hands below his armpit, and raises the joint strongly upwards to its place, and the minister raises his hand, and extends it upwards; and then places it below because it returns lightly.
But if by what we have said it does not return, and from the beginning that the dislocation happened, many days have passed, then it is necessary that the patient be bathed in warm water and a poultice be applied that softens and relaxes, such as boiled roots of marshmallow, fenugreek, and melilot in water, and it should be applied.
And then the patient should lie supine on his back and a wool ball, of a consistency between soft and firm, be placed under his armpit; and then the physician should place his heel on the ball, and raise the head of the muscle forcefully, and pull the patient's hand so that it is not pulled downwards, and another minister should hold the patient's head, so that it is not pulled downwards, for then it immediately returns to its place.
And if you wish, reduce it according to this method: that you have present a man who is taller than the patient, and he stands on that side, and inserts his shoulder under the patient's armpit and raises his armpit upwards until the patient is suspended in the air, and another minister pulls the patient's hand from below his belly. But if the patient is light, then it is necessary that something else be suspended with him, so that it weighs him down, because the dislocation returns immediately.
And it is reduced easily according to another method: that a long pole is fixed in the earth, the head of which is round in shape, like a mortar pestle, neither thick nor thin, and then it is placed under the patient;  after which soft cloths are placed on top of the pole, and the patient stands along the length of the pole, and then his hand is extended downwards on the other side; and his body is pulled strongly from the other side, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
And if its reduction is difficult for all the reasons we have mentioned, then use this treatment: that you take a pole the length of which is two arms, and its width is four fingers, and its thickness is eased at the armpit end in this manner:
And then soft cloths are tied over the rounded end so that the pole does not injure the patient.
And then it is placed under the armpit of the patient, and the hand or arm is extended over the pole down to the lower parts, and the pole is tied above the shoulder and the arm and the extremity of the hand.
Then the arm is placed on a rung of a ladder according to its width, and the hand is extended downwards, and the other body is suspended from the other side, for the joint enters immediately.
And when its reduction is complete, in whichever manner is possible for you, then you should place under the armpit a ball of wool of suitable size; and then apply a plaster prepared from powdered myrrh and egg white over the entire muscle, in such a way that it is wrapped around, and then bind tightly under the armpit with a suitable bandage; and the bandage should be wrapped over the plaster, and his hand should be tied to his neck, and it should be left, and the patient's hand should not be moved for seven days.
And the patient's diet should be light until the limb is strengthened, for this makes his healing easier.
And then the diet should be increased gradually over five or seven days and movement should be exercised; and therefore, if it is firm and not softened, then it is healed.
But if the joint is dislocated many times due to the dampness that affects it or another cause, then cautery with three punctures should be administered there, as previously mentioned in the chapter on cautery.
And if all this is done and after seven days the bandage is untied and the joint is not firm, and the plaster and the bandage are reapplied several times, and it is not firm and hangs loose and cannot raise that arm to the upper parts, then know that its nerves, which are at the head of the muscle, are either severed or stretched or softened, and know that the joint will never be fixed in its place.
For the dislocation that occurs between the foot and the ankle or the back parts, reduction is done with impulse and extension with the hands, until it returns [to its place].
And another bandage should be applied there, and treat it until it is healed.
And if during healing heaviness and slowness of movement occur in the limb, then the patient should use baths many times until that heaviness is relieved and it returns to its former natural state.
Chapter 27.
Concerning the treatment of hip dislocation.
Know that the hip joint is dislocated with difficulty and similarly returns with difficulty; and it is dislocated in all directions, and more so to the front than to the back, and its dislocation is not hidden from you because it is apparent to the sight or touch, according to whatever way it is dislocated. And when you align the dislocated hip with its socket, this is clearly evident to you, because the joint is concave and he cannot bend the leg, nor touch his thigh with his hand.
And it is necessary that you take care and reduce the dislocation immediately before a hot abscess forms, because if a hot abscess forms, its reduction is difficult, and it is not easily healed completely; and especially when it is in the posterior parts, because it is worse than all other types of dislocation, and of greater pain, and often causes death with it.
And its restoration, when it is possible to reduce it, is that his leg should be extended with two hands, and his thigh expanded, and the physician's hands should be on the hip and under it, and he should press the joint with the thumbs of his hands together, or with the root of his palm until it returns to its place.
But if the dislocation is in the front parts, then return it thus: bend the leg with your hand, until you strike the hip with the root of your palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to reduction, then administer vigorous and very strong extension.
And it is necessary that two assistants extend the arm, and let two other assistants hold that extension so that it is not disturbed during the extension.
And then let the arm be revolved in every direction, after it has been wrapped in a long, doubled cloth over his hand, or a bandage.
And when the physician touches the joint with his hand, anoint it with some oil so that this may assist in the lubrication of the joint with ease; and then push the joint with forceful pressure until it returns [to its place].
And after the reduction, it is necessary that he be placed upon a plaster which has styptic and drying properties with egg white, and it should be bound tightly with a descending bandage, and the arm should be suspended from the neck, and left thus for several days.
And then let it be unbound; and if the joint is formed in its place, then unbind his bandage and leave it thus.
And if you see the joint not well tightened, then reiterate the plaster and the bandage, and leave it thus for several days until it is tightened; and then unbind it.
But if there is severity in the reduction of the joint, and the patient's disposition is toward movement, then administer moist bathing and gentle friction, and compression, until he is relieved; or place on the joint alliaria, that is, a very fatty substance; and then let it be bandaged, and leave it on the bone day and night. And then remove that, and put him in a bath; and when he is sufficiently clean, then rub the joint with tempered friction, and then reiterate the alliaria, that is, a very fatty ointment, once, and a second time, and a third time. with the intervention of a bath, until it is softened.
And if you wish, place on it warm, moist cow dung and bind it tightly; and do this several times, because it is moist and returns it to its proper condition.
Chapter 28.
Concerning the treatment of dislocation of the wrist, that is, of the joint that is between the arm and the hand.
Sometimes the wrist is dislocated, and the reduction of its dislocation is easy, contrary to other joints; however, speed is necessary in its reduction at the time it is dislocated, before the place is inflamed or a hot abscess occurs there.
And the reduction of its dislocation is that you place the patient's wrist joint on a table, and the assistant extends the patient's hand, and the physician places his hand or his palm on the prominence of the joint, and pulls it until it returns to its place.
However, it must be considered whether the palm is already turned towards the belly of the hand; then the patient places the back of his hand on a table during extension and reduction. And if the dislocation is towards the back of the hand, then let the position of his hand be inwards on the table, so that the physician's hand falls on that prominence of the joint.
And so if it returns immediately, it is good; and if not, then constrict it with a plaster, allowing the inflammation to subside, and leave it; and do not repeat this, for otherwise, you will not be able to achieve reduction after several days have passed.
However, if the joint remains in its distorted position, and the patient experiences no pain except that the hand is weakened and cannot grasp anything, then you should know that the nerves are pinched or crushed; and then there is no remedy except to constrict it with a cautery near the injured area, and quickly apply something to it.
Therefore, when the injury is reduced, then apply the plaster we have recommended, and let it be left and tightened for five days; and then let it be untied and left, and let his hand be exercised.
But if its movement is impeded and some heaviness occurs, then soothe it with warm water and friction several times until it is relieved.
Chapter 29.
On the treatment of dislocation of the fingers.
Sometimes the fingers are dislocated in every part.
And when one of those fingers is dislocated towards the back of the palm or towards the belly of the hand, then straighten the finger and push the dislocation back with your thumbs until it returns to its place.
Then support the head of the finger, and hang it downwards from the part to which it is dislocated, and leave it like that for two days.
And then suspend it and extend it until it is straightened and set on that same day.
And when it is night, bind it according to that description, and do not cease to unbind it during the day and exercise it with movement, and bind it at night; and do this for a few days until it is tight/strong.
And do similarly if it is dislocated on the palm of the hand, and bind it to that part and perform your first operation until it is healed.
And similarly do this when it is dislocated in other parts.
Chapter 30.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the vertebrae of the back.
When a complete dislocation happens to any of the vertebrae of the back or neck, and many vertebrae are dislodged from their places, then in that case there is no cure, for death awaits the patient.
And a sign of this is that the patient's excrement is expelled involuntarily, and they cannot retain it; and often some of their limbs are paralyzed, or their two legs, or their two arms, or one of them; or a vertebra is dislodged from its place, for often it is dislodged and sometimes the displacement of these is in four parts.
Therefore, that is dislodged in the posterior parts and is called paralysis.
But the cure for it is that then you consider if the paralysis occurred from a fever, for then in that case there is neither cure nor healing at all.
But in that which comes from a fall or from a blow or similar to those, the Ancients already described the methods of cure with lengthy discourse, of which the most returns with profit; but I have already abridged that, of which little excuses the excess, for my proximity to my intended explanation, with which I have set forth and formed this from diverse instruments, with which I will show this and explain that.
And of those, only that which occurs in the two properly is cured with what I recounted.
And it is so that the patient is laid on his face on a soft cushion close to a wall, and a soft mattress is placed under him so that his feet are not injured.
And then a straight pole is placed, fixed in the ground at the end of the bed near his head, and another pole near his feet at the other end of the bed.
And the attendant holds the pole, and it should not be fixed in a pit; and another attendant holds the other in that manner.
And then wrap around the patient's head and below the armpits a strong linen bandage; and extend the end of the bandage to the pole which is near his head, and tie it there; and then tighten another bandage around his hips and thighs, and below his legs; and then adjust all the bandages and tie them to the other pole which is near his feet.
And then each attendant extends the bandage to the part of the pole, and the two poles and the bandages should not be moved from their places where they are fixed, but however, they are not fixed in the way we have said.
And the physician places his palms on the spine with strength until it returns, or places a board on it, and then adjusts his feet on the board until it returns.
But if it does not return by this method, then take a board whose width or length is about three braccia, and dig into the wall which we have said is near the patient a place into which the end of the board fits. And then place half of the board on the spine, and the physician places his feet on the other end, and pulls strongly until the spine is compressed and returns to its place.
And if you wish, open with a turner which is revolved by hand; and it is so that you place in the ground under the patient's head at the back of the neck two poles, the length of which is one arm's length, and under their head at the back of the neck similarly two poles; and let the length between each pole be one palm, and a hole is already made in each pole through which a turner fits, and each is firmly fixed in the ground so that it is not moved.
And let there be added a round pole on which is the turner, and let it be revolved in the two holes of the two poles.
And at its end is a hole into which the pole is fitted, the length of which is one palm, with that which is revolved; and in the two other poles is something similar to that.
And then tighten the ropes that you have tied to the patient's feet in the hole which is under their head, and the ropes that you have tied to their thighs in the turner which is under their feet.
And then beside each turner let a minister stand who twists the turner with his hand, and the physician adjusts the vertebra as we have said.
And then, once the vertebra is returned and the location is adjusted, you should apply a drying plaster with egg white, and then lint; and then place over the plaster a cloth bandage whose width should be three fingers or thereabouts, and whose length should be sufficient to cover the area of the curvature, and the healthy part of the vertebra.
And then it should be bound with the rope we have mentioned, and give the patient light nourishment until he is healed.
And if any swelling remains in the area at the end of the healing, then medicines should be administered that soften and smooth, with the administration of the bandage for a long time, which we have recommended; and a lead plate is applied to that area.
And sometimes swelling occurs in the area behind the vertebrae of the back, and it is caused by that dislocation; and it is that bone which already swells, so that no attempt should be made to treat it with this medicine, for it will very quickly cause death.
Chapter 31.
On the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the hip joint and the muscle joint suffer only dislocation, and not what happens to other joints of small movement and concavity.
And the hip joint is dislocated in four ways, for it is dislocated inwards, outwards, forwards, or backwards.
And it is mostly dislocated inwards, and rarely forwards or backwards.
And a sign of its dislocation inwards is that, when you align the patient's healthy leg with the affected one, the affected leg is longer and the knee more prominent than the healthy one, and the patient cannot bend their foot without pain, and it is the place where the pain is often accompanied by a hot abscess, because the head of the femur has already reached there.
And the sign of that to which dislocation happens outwards, is that its symptoms are contrary to these symptoms.
And a sign of that to which dislocation happens forwards is that he extends his leg completely, but however he cannot bend it without pain in the knee, and if he forces himself to walk he cannot do so forwards; and his urine is retained and his groin is inflamed, and he walks on his heel.
And a sign of that to which dislocation happens backwards is that he cannot extend his knee, nor can he bend it before bending his hip, and his leg is shorter than the other, and his groin is softened, and the head of the femur is towards that place.
But the reduction of the types of this dislocation is that you consider, then, if the dislocation is old and chronic, that it has already become set with time, and you administer its reduction, and it remains according to its disposition, then it is not entirely cured; and then no presumption should be made in that matter.
But in the case where the dislocation is recent, and is one of the four types of dislocation, then take care to return the joint and extend it inwards and outwards, and move it to the right and left, for it quickly returns and needs no other treatment.
But, if it does not return in this manner, then you must prepare a strong assistant and extend his leg from the lower part, either with your hands or with a bandage which is tied above the knee; and another assistant extend the hand of that one from above so that he places his hands below his heels; and then tighten a strong bandage around the root of the thigh, and let another assistant hold the end of the bandage.
And let the extension be from the inside of the groin to the area of the fork (presumably the pubic bone), or from the back to the area of the back.
And let the extension of all these be at once until the patient is raised with his body from the ground and remains suspended.
And this type of extension is common to all four (types of dislocation).
And therefore, if the dislocation returns with what we have said, it will be good; and if not, then it is necessary for every type [of dislocation] that which we shall say of its proper cure.
In the reduction of the hip itself, when it is dislocated, and the dislocation is towards the inner parts, it is necessary that the patient be supine on his sound side; and then place the ligatures on the root of the thigh in that place which is between the head of the thigh and the place which is below the groin; and then extend the ligature upwards from the part of the groin to the highest part of the fork (pubic area).
And then another strong attendant grasps his arms, and gently pulls the thick part of the affected thigh and extends it outwards with a forceful extension, because that will return it to its place.
And this type is of easier cure, with which this limb is reduced, than the other types.
But if it is difficult for you and does not obey the treatment with this type of cure at all, then it is necessary that the patient's two feet be bound together with a strong, light ligature, above both ankles and both heels.
And let the length of each (ligature) be the quantity of four fingers, and let the affected leg be extended more than the other by the quantity of two fingers.
And then the patient should be suspended from the head by a beam, and let him be indoors; and let his height from the ground be the quantity of two arms' lengths.
And then order a strong young man to reduce the head of the thigh, and let another young man support the patient, and the other young man, reducing the joint with strength and pushing, for the joint returns to its place quickly.
But in the proper reduction, when it is a dislocation to the outside, the patient should lie on his back as we have recommended in the case of the cold application; and let the ligature be tightened on the affected leg and on his feet.
And then two beams should be placed, one at his feet and the other at his head; and then let adjusted beams be placed in the middle of the mound placed on which wet cloths are wrapped, so that the patient is not harmed because the beam is between his thighs, so that during extension the lower parts are not pulled.
And then each assistant extends on his side, and the physician with his hand guides the reduction according to the art.
And when the dislocation is in the front parts, then it is necessary that the leg be extended slightly, and it is according to this same narration on a mound; and the physician places the palm of his right hand on the affected joint, and then compresses that with the other hand, and with that compression he puts that extended to the lower parts to the part of the knee.
And if the dislocation is in the back parts, then it is not necessary that the patient be extended to the lower parts, and he is elevated above the earth; rather it is necessary that he be placed on a hard surface, just as it is necessary for the elevation if his hip is dislocated to the outside parts, according to what we have said about his lying on two hips; and he is on his face and the ligaments are extended, as we have said, there is no great harm.
And it is necessary that compression be administered with a tablet on the place where the joint is.
Therefore, when the reduction is completed as it should be — and the sign of its reduction is not hidden from you, which is that you extend the patient's two legs, and when you see those equal and the patient tightens his leg and extends it without difficulty, then you know that the member is returned as it should be — and then you adjust the two thighs and apply a plaster and bind it so that the hip is not moved in any of the parts; and let the patient rest for three or four days.
And then untie the bandage and the plaster, and compare one leg with the other.
Then, if you see them equal in appearance, then you know that the dislocation is now healed, and then let the patient go.
And if you see any cause for softening, then you return and plaster that, and bind it according to your first binding, and leave it for three days.
And then untie it, and have him delay ambulation for a few days, until he is strengthened.
Chapter 32.
On the treatment of knee dislocation.
The knee is dislocated in three ways, for it is dislocated outwards, and inwards, and downwards more towards the back; and it is not dislocated forwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that you command the patient to apply his leg to his thigh; then you will know that the knee is dislocated.
And the restoration of all its types is that you make the patient lie straight, so that he extends his leg, if he can; apply your two hands to the front of his leg, and place his foot between your feet; then apply his knee to your palms, and hold those between your fingers on his knee with strength, and another attendant extends his foot until the knee returns to its place.
And the sign of its reduction is that his leg adheres to his thigh easily and without effort.
And then plaster it and bind the leg to the thigh, and then bind them together with a bandage for three or four days, and then unbind them.
And do not allow the patient to walk for some days, until he is healed and strengthened.
But if its reduction is difficult for you, then administer strong extension with the bandages of which the narrative preceded in the treatment of the hip.
Chapter 33.
On the treatment of the dislocation of the talus (ankle bone).
The talus is sometimes moved by a slight displacement, and sometimes dislocated completely, and its dislocation is made either inwards or outwards.
And the sign of its dislocation is that sometimes the swollen talus protrudes towards the side to which it is dislocated.
But the treatment of its displacement is a gentle reduction, and it is that it should be extended easily with the hands and pulled until it returns [to its place].
But in treating it when it is completely dislocated, you must have the patient lie down straight, and have a strong and capable assistant hold him from behind at the middle of his back.
Then you, with your right hand, take the foot from the upper part, and with your left hand, from the lower part of the foot at the ankle.
Then pull the foot towards you with your right hand, and then with your left, twice, and then extend with the left; and push the foot with the right towards the leg without effort.
And do this twice as we have described.
Then push the foot to the leg a third time, and you will be at the ankle.
Then it will return in one or two tries according to this method, and if you see the foot straightened, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation, for it will return.
But if the reduction is forbidden to you by what we have recounted, then make the patient lie on their back on the ground, and tightly fasten a strong rope to the ground, so that it falls between their thighs, and you will already have wrapped a cloth around them so that it doesn't hurt the patient.
Then let the patient's attendant hold their thighs, and let another attendant extend the foot with their hands or with a bandage tied around the ankle; and let each attendant extend against the extension of their partner, and let the rope remain between the patient's thighs, restraining it, so that their body is not pulled downwards against their extension.
Then the physician reduces the dislocation with their hands, and another attendant holds the healthy thigh lower down, because the dislocation easily returns.
And so when the dislocation returns and the success of its reduction is clear to you, then apply a plaster and bind it tightly with bandages, and bind the foot to the leg with bandages.
And it is necessary that you fear or guard against the nerves which are behind the heel, so that the bandage over it is not too tight and severely injures them.
Then leave it for two or three days; and if the bandage is loosened, tighten it.
Then unbind it on the third or fourth day, and forbid the patient from walking for forty days. But if he is forced to walk before that time, there is no certainty that the dislocation will not be loosened and worsened, and then it will not receive a cure.
And if a hot abscess occurs, then you must administer to its healing that which we narrated previously, in another place of treatment and application, until it is healed.
Chapter 34.
On the treatment of dislocations of the toes.
It is necessary that the dislocated [toe] be healed with slight extension without work; and that which is not difficult, is easier beforehand.
But if the dislocation is in some of the bones of the instep, then you must make the patient place his foot on a level place on the ground or on a table, and remain so as if he were walking.
And then you stand, and place your foot on what protrudes from the joints, and then press that with your foot with force until it returns, and you see that it is healed and no prominence appears in the place.
And then place under the sole of his foot a board that covers the whole foot, to which are attached two caps [possibly referring to some kind of splint or support]; and then tighten that with a decent and firm structure for three days; and then untie it and make him rest from walking for many days, until it is strengthened and its recovery is assured.
Chapter 35.
Of the types of dislocation that are made with a wound or with a fracture or with both together.
When any of those causes happen, and you engage yourself in its cure and in his restoration, many times death occurs.
And therefore it is not fitting that anyone presume upon his cure except one who is wise in the art, of long experience, merciful and compassionate, slow [to act], not rash nor presumptuous; and that he use in the beginning medicines that only reduce hot abscesses, and leave the patient to divine judgment, except for one in whom you expect salvation from destruction, with alleviation of the disease, and in whom some hope appears. And then strive immediately to reduce it at the beginning of the cause, before a hot abscess develops.
And then, if the limb returns as we wish, then administer a regimen which reduces hot abscesses and treat the wound with what is suitable for it of drying ointments.
And if the dislocation is with a fracture and the jagged ends of the bone are separated, then you must bring them together, and do in this what we have said in the simple diseases of what precedes in those locations.
And guard and avoid, according to your ability, that which enters the paths of fear as my preaching has preceded you; for this is better for you before your Creator, and more permanent for your glory, and more healthful to your true body than those in your time. Thus end the words of Albucasis perfectly, for which may God be blessed. Amen.
