Chapter Twenty on the treatment of the complication that occurs after some fractures.
This complication often occurs after the healing of a fracture, especially near the joints, which deforms the shape of the limb and may prevent the limb from its natural function.
Look, if the complication is soft, then use astringent medicines in it, such as aloe vera, frankincense, myrrh, spikenard, acacia, and the like, by taking some or all of these and kneading them with an astringent syrup or with egg white or with vinegar, and apply it to the complication in a poultice and tie it tightly and leave the bandage without loosening it for many days, then loosen it and repeat it until the complication is gone, God willing.
Or tighten a plate of sealed lead on it, because lead has a property that removes everything that protrudes in the limbs.
If the complication has hardened and intensified, and necessity urges its removal, then incise it from above and cut off the protruding excess or scrape it with some scrapers until it is gone, and treat the wound until it heals.
