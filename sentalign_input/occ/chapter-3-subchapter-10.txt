Chapter 10:
Restoration of hip fractures.
The hip bones rarely break, but when they do, the fracture is usually at the ends, extending lengthwise and inclining inward, causing pain and puncture in the area, and the leg becomes stupefied.
The restoration involves extending your hand over the fracture to align it as it should be.
If the fracture is only at the end, align it as much as possible until it resembles its natural shape.
If the fracture extends lengthwise or inclines downward, have the patient lie on their belly until the fracture is prepared for restoration.
Once aligned, apply plaster, then a wooden or leather splint, and tighten without fearing fracture puncture or splint movement.
Fill any concavity to maintain even pressure, and advise the patient to sleep on their back or healthy side.
If an abscess occurs, stop extending and restoring until the abscess subsides; apply treatments to sedate it, then resume restoration and tighten as needed.
If bone fragments are present or comminuted, remove them.
