Chapter thirty-five on cauterizing warts after cutting them.
If you cut the wart, heat the cautery iron that resembles the probe.
Then insert it hot into the same cut wart.
And press your hand until the cautery reaches the opening of the vessel from which the blood flows.
Do this once or twice.
If the warts are many, cauterize each one as we have described.
Then treat them with suitable ointments until they heal.
And if you cauterize it also with a large cauterization on cotton, it would be more effective in benefit.
