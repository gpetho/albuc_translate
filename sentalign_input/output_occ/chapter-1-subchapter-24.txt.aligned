On the cauterization of lung disease and cough.	On cauterization for pulmonary disease and for cough.	0.94348586
When cough and lung disease are due to cold humidity and the patient has no fever or tuberculosis and it is an old illness, then cauterize them with two cauteries on the furcula (collarbone) in the depressed places, lion-like and bulbous; and with another cautery in the middle of the chest between the two nipples; and let the cautery be a pointed type according to the previous form.	When the cough and pulmonary disease arise from cold humidities and the patient suffers from no fever or wasting but the disease is chronic, sear him with two cauterizations over the two clavicles, in the soft depressions ; and with another cauterization in the mid-line of the chest between the breasts. Let the cautery be claviform as described above.	0.83313835
And if you wish, let your cauterization be point-like with the cautery called puncta, the form of which is described earlier in the section on ear pain.	And if you prefer, make punctate cauterizations with the cautery called 'punctate'; its shape has already been described under pricking for earache.	0.82444423
And let there be points among them; and then treat them with the same method as before until healed.	Then treat as aforesaid until healed.	0.5711083
And if the cautery has three branches for the cauterization: in one session, you can make three cauteries in this form:	Sometimes also a trident cautery is prepared, in this manner, with which you can burn more speedily; for with this you can apply three cauterizations at once.	0.51356435
