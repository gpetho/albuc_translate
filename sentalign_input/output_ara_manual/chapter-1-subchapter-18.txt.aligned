On Cauterizing a Cleft Lip.	On cauterization of hare lip.	0.8086572
A fissure often occurs in the lip, called the harelip, especially in the lips of children, as it frequently happens. If you treat this fissure with what we mentioned in the section on incisions, and the treatment is not successful, then heat a small knife-shaped cautery iron in this manner.	There often occur fissures in the lip to which are given the name 'hairs'; they are particularly common in the lips of boys. When you have ineffectually treated these clefts with those things that we have mentioned in their section, then heat a small edged cautery of this shape.	0.80709636
Its concavity should be like the thinness of a knife. Then place it hot, quickly, into the fissure itself, until the cautery reaches the depth of the fissure. Then treat it with qayruti until it heals, God willing.	The hollow should be as sharp as a knife. Then quickly place it, hot, right on the fissure till the burning has reached the depth of the lip. Then treat with wax plaster till healed.	0.77237844
