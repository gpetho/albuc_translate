Chapter ninety-seven on the application of leeches.	CHAPTER NINETY-SEVEN. On the application of leeches.	0.8624683
Leeches are mostly used on organs where cupping glasses cannot be applied, either because they are too small, like the lip and gums, etc., or because the organ is devoid of flesh, like the finger and nose, etc.	Leeches are mostly used on those parts of the body to which application of cupping-vessels is impossible, either because of their smallness, such as the lips, the gums, and so on; or because the part is bare of flesh, like the finger, the nose, and so on.	0.8970414
The method of using them is to select leeches that are in fresh, pure water, free from putrefaction, then leave them for a day and a night in fresh water until they become hungry and nothing remains in their bellies, then the body is first evacuated by phlebotomy or cupping, then the affected organ is rubbed until it becomes red, then the leeches are placed on it, and when they are full, they fall off.	This is the way to use them: you seek some leeches that are in fresh water free of dirt. Then you leave them in fresh water for a day and a night until they are hungry and nothing is left in their bellies; then you purge the patient's body, either by venesection or by the application of cupping vessels; then you scrub the afflicted part until it is flushed; and then place the leeches on it. When they are full they will fall off.	0.7207581
And if it is possible to suck the place with a cupping glass, it is more effective in benefit, otherwise wash the area with vinegar, then with plenty of water, and massage and squeeze it. If the bleeding continues after the leeches fall off and it is oozing, then soak a linen cloth in cold water and place it on top until the oozing stops.	If it is possible to make suction with a cupping vessel, the effect will be greater. But if not, wash the part with vinegar followed by much water; then rub and put pressure on it. If the blood continues to run after the leeches have fallen off, and becomes an ooze, let linen dressings be wetted with cold water and apply them over the place until the oozing stops.	0.89802647
If the bleeding is profuse, sprinkle powdered alum or gallnut or similar astringents on it until the bleeding stops, or place peeled halves of green beans on the area and leave them until the beans stick to the area, then the bleeding will stop.	But if the bleeding be serious then sprinkle upon the place powdered vitriol or gall or similar styptics, until the haemorrhage is stopped. Or let split shelled beans be applied to the place and left until they stick there, and then the bleeding will stop.	0.8089576
And it is advisable, if there is a need to reapply leeches, not to use the same leeches if others are available. If the leeches refuse to attach, then wipe the area with fresh blood, or prick the area with a needle until some blood comes out, then place them; for if they sense some blood, they will stick to the spot. If you want them to fall off, sprinkle on them some aloe, salt, or ash, and they will fall off immediately.	If it is necessary to repeat the application, the same leech should not be applied but another one if you possibly can. If the leeches fail to stick on, the place should be wiped over with fresh blood or pricked with a needle to bring out a little blood; then apply them, for if they smell any blood they will immediately adhere. When you wish to remove them, sprinkle over them a little powdered aloes or salt or ashes, then they will at once fall away.	0.8964547
