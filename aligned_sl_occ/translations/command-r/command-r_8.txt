O, my children, now that I have completed this book for you, which is the ultimate guide to medical science, achieving its goal at its end and with its explanations and clarifications, it seems fitting to me to present this treatise on surgery to you as part of the practical aspect of medicine.
Since manual surgery is neglected in our region and our time, to the extent that it endangers medical science itself, and its remnants are suppressed; only a few brief descriptions remain in the books of ancient scholars, which have been distorted by others leading to errors and hesitancy, as their minds are closed and their abilities stunted.
It is my intention to revive and organize this treatise according to a systematic approach of explanation, clarification, and concision; additionally, through illustrations of cautery tools and other surgical instruments as well as with supplementary descriptions and preparatory steps, which are essential prerequisites for the procedure.
The reason why skilled artisans are lacking in this field during our time is that the art of medicine is lengthy and demands a prior extensive knowledge of anatomy so as to understand the nature of body parts, their forms, how they connect and separate; bone structure, nerves, tendons, their numbers, origins and insertions points; pulsating and quiet veins, as well as the locations where these may be found.
And for this reason, Hippocrates says that its name is great, but in practice it is small, and especially in the skill of the hand.
We have already mentioned this in the introduction of this book; for one who is not knowledgeable about what we have discussed regarding anatomy, may fall into error and cause death to many people, as I myself have seen numerous such individuals, who are learned in theory but lack practical knowledge and experience.
I witnessed a foolish and inexperienced physician accidentally cut into an abscess with scrofulous characteristics on a woman's neck; he severed some arteries in the neck, causing a great flow of blood, and as a result, the woman bled to death while her maids held her.
I saw another physician who was about to remove a stone from a man's bladder; the stone was large and it damaged his viscera during the procedure, ultimately causing his death three days later.
I was called upon to remove it, but I knew from the stone's size and the patient's condition that he would not survive.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
Here is the translation of the first source sentence:
And I was called upon to untie their bonds; the result of my work is tranquility and thus lessening of his pain.
However, when corruption has already spread to the limb and cannot be stopped, it continues to circulate within the affected member until the patient is in danger.
And I saw another physician who punctured a cancerous abscess, which became ulcerated after several days and caused the lord to become more seriously ill.
The reason for this is that the cause of cancer is usually an excess of melancholy humor; therefore, it is not necessary to treat the entire body with iron, but only those limbs where such treatment is required.
And for this reason, my children, it is necessary for you to divide the operation into two parts: one part that is associated with health and another more dangerous part.
And I have already indicated this in every part of this book where the operation is mentioned because it contains error and danger; therefore, you must keep such cases separate so that they do not come to light and discredit you.
And so, take up your weapons with solicitude and under God's protection; treat your patients with ease and firmness.
Use the best method, by God's grace, leading to salvation and praiseworthy recovery; leave behind those terrible diseases that are difficult to cure, and keep your weapons away from anything that makes you fearful, so that doubt does not escape your faith and your name: for greater is what remains of your glory, both in this world and beyond among your saints.
The wise man has already said in some of his teachings: Do not treat an illness with evil means, lest you be called evil doctors.
And I have divided this book into three chapters.
Here begins the division of the book, and first of the first part: The first chapter deals with the instruments of surgery, including those needed for cauterization and their various forms, along with other necessary tools for the operation.
The division of the second part. The second chapter deals with cauterization, piercing, cupping, wounds, and the extraction of arrows or similar objects; all carefully outlined along with instructions for the required instruments.
The third chapter is about restoration and dislocation, treating sprains and similar injuries. It focuses on the head and feet and outlines the necessary instruments.
I want to explain the quality of the iron for that cautery and the documents related to it, as well as in which condition it is prohibited to perform cauterization.
So I say that the discourse on the quality of cautery iron and its documents is long and prolix, subtle in knowledge, and hidden in secrecy; many wise men have spoken about it before and they disagree, so for me, a little of their discourses will suffice, fearing prolixity.
And thus I say that you will apply the cautery to all general complications, which are with matter or without matter, except for two complications, which are causative complications without matter.
In the case of a dry and cold complication with matter, there is disagreement; some say that cauterization is beneficial, while others argue the opposite, stating that cautery is not suitable for illnesses caused by qualities and dryness because the nature of fire is characterized by heat and dryness, which are counter to what is required to heal an illness that is dry and cold.
And he who argues against this, stating that cautery is indeed beneficial for all dry and cold illnesses found in the human body, does so because when you compare the human heart and its moisture to the composition of fire, you find the human heart to be colder.
And I say this based on the words of the aforementioned individual; my own experiences have already proven this to be true.
However, it is not appropriate to delve into this further for those who have already thoroughly explored and practiced the art of cauterization in previous chapters; they are aware of the diverse complications that arise within the human body, the disposition of illnesses in their organs, the causes behind them, as well as the varying symptoms and durations of these illnesses.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is my translation of the provided medieval medical treatise:
Furthermore, the action of caustic medicine extends to those parts of the body that are remote from it, and it quickly causes an illness in the affected limb that is difficult to cure and often fatal.
But fire, because of its sublimity and the goodness of its substance, does nothing but make [something] superfluous. And it is already known to us through experience and through lengthy service in studying the art for the truth of the causes; and for this I am excused from lengthening my speech. And if it were not that my book is not read by these indolent people in this remote place, which you keep secret with fire, and the quality of its operation in the bodies and its expulsion through which it expels diseases, [I would] speak philosophically demonstratively, which would sharpen your minds.
And you should know, my children, that they disagree about the time when it is appropriate to perform cauterization and consider spring to be a better time for it.
And I say that cauterization is appropriate at all times because the harm caused by delaying it due to weather conditions is outweighed by the benefit gained from what is drawn out by the cautery. And this is especially true for pains or necessary evils, such as abscesses and fistulas, which cannot wait without risking greater harm, as a small present evil is preferable to a larger future one caused by delay.
And this is not found in your books, my sons, for it is only valued by the common people and foolish doctors; that illness which has been healed with a caustic [remedy] never returns at all times, but they neglect that consequence.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Furthermore, apply superfluous cauterization in a medical setting due to the haste of its recovery and the potency of its therapeutic action as well as the greatness of its lord.
It is possible for the illness to recur at any time according to the constitution of the patient and the location of their ailment, as well as their health, the state of their body regarding superfluities in it, what has been prepared within them due to the aggregation of superfluities, and what they have acquired through food and similar causes; unless the disease for which cauterization is administered is a delicate one with few superfluities and humors, like toothaches and similar cases, it is unlikely that the pain will return. However, this should be done carefully in small amounts.
The common saying is that cauterization is the last resort in medicine, and this is true according to medical professionals; they believe it is not a cure that benefits from medicine or any other cause except for cautery itself.
The reason for this is the opposite; the intention behind calling cauterization the last resort in medicine is not always accurate. It depends on how cure methods are administered to certain illnesses and whether those medicines have been effective or not. Only when other treatments fail, at the end of the process, should one administer cautery, and it may indeed benefit the patient. And here we find that cauterization is the last resort of medicine, not according to the understanding of laymen and too many foolish doctors.
The ancients said that cauterization with gold is better than iron, and they say this only due to the equality of gold and the excellence of its substance.
And they said that the site of cauterization is not weakened, even if this is not absolutely true, for I have proven it and found that it does so only in some bodies without others; thus, cauterization with gold is good and better than iron as they say. However, when you perform cauterization using fire from gold, one must be careful because the amount of heat generated by the gold depends on its quantity due to the roughness of the gold, and it must be prepared to receive moisture; if you expose it to too much flame, the gold will melt with the fire, which is useful for the artisan who wishes to work with it.
And for this reason, one must practice cauterization with iron more lightly and precisely to achieve the correct operation.
I have already organized this chapter on cauterization according to the chapters, and I've placed those related to the head among the feet, so that when one seeks a specific topic in it, they may find it easily.
The first chapter.
This cauterization process introduces humidity and coldness into the brain, which is an accidental occurrence caused by two factors: one being sodden flux and the other being a multitude of traumatic flux, known as 'corissa', affecting the head and leading to discharges from body parts such as the ears and legs. It also results in excessive sleepiness, toothaches, and throat pain. Generally speaking, it causes all illnesses stemming from coldness, including paralysis, soddening (edema), apoplexy, and similar conditions.
The procedure for this cauterization is as follows: Firstly, instruct the patient to take a laxative medicine that will cleanse their head over three or four nights, depending on the strength of the patient's constitution and their age.
Then tell the patient to shave their head with a razor and have them sit on a chair with their arms extended between two others' arms, while placing his hands on his own legs.
Then place the edge of your palm's razor blade close to their nose, right between their ears. However, once you have reached the middle of your finger's location, mark that spot with a tent and then use an olive-wood cautery like this:
E aprop pausa aquel sobre le loc senhat am tenta, a manieyra que descent, am la qual la tieva ma sia constrengida petit a petit, e tu revolveys aquel.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And then take a little salt and dissolve it over the area, leaving it for three days.
Then place on him a poultice made of clay mixed with vinegar, and leave it there until the skin is destroyed by the fire. Then treat the wound with four-herb ointment until it is healed.
And they say that when the Roman plague broke out, a better remedy was found with a mixture of garlic and oil, for it is more effective and beneficial.
And some of them say that the spine should be cauterized at the base of the bone, and the cautery should be held there until some part of the surface layer of the bone adheres.
Then scrape away that which has adhered to the bone, and treat it afterward.
And others say that the cautery should be brought to the back and applied with strong pressure until it burns into the bone deeply. This is the form of small alpecin (type of medication): They believe that vapours from this place escape to the head.
And if the wound remains open for a long time, then it should be treated before it becomes hardened.
I have never seen these two types of cauterization used at all, but only in some cases out of fear; leave that, it seems to me, and prioritize the patient's well-being when it is necessary, for the head becomes weakened due to the interruption of continuity as we have mentioned with other body parts, especially when the patient's head is of a more sensitive nature.
The first type of cauterization is safer and better in my opinion; this method should be used, as it promotes the patient's recovery.

On the topic of head cauterization.
When there is persistent and long-lasting pain in the entire head of a patient that persists for an extended period, various treatments are applied such as herbs, cochias (a type of medicine), purgatives, ointments, poultices, baths, crows (possibly referring to a specific treatment or bird-related remedy), and similar remedies. If cauterization has already been performed with a hot iron but none of these methods provide relief, consider whether the patient's head is naturally strong and resistant due to its robust nature; if it is not fragile and experiences intense heat, then proceed with another round of cauterization using a different cautery instrument, applying it beneath the previous one. Then cauterize that area over his skull with a hot iron, while the iron is still divided in two parts (not fully cooled down). Cut the divided iron and expose it from its wooden handle to the measured length we described earlier, then cauterize that area with a hot iron at the back of the head in the spot known as the vessel - this is the location where a cupping glass would be placed. But lift your hand quickly during that process, without uncovering the bone, because the patient will experience an intense pain unlike any of the other head cauterizations.
Here is the translation of the provided source sentence:
Capitolo terzo." or "Chapter three.
On the cauterization of non-ancient hemorrhoids.
When there is a severe pain in the temples or the pain extends into the eyes, first evacuate with medicines that purify the head, and administer other treatments I have mentioned for different diseases; if all of these do not help, then cauterization on them can be done in two ways: either with acute, corrosive medicine, or with an iron.
The first type of cautery using corrosive medicine is to take a cloth made of alum, and soak it in water; then cut the ends of its two corners. Then make an incision in the area of pain on the temple using a lancet, being careful to do it at the spot that was pointed out beneath the crown, taking care not to make it visible.
Then press on it with a pad for some time using firm pressure, and leave it there for the space of three hours; then remove the cloth and draw out the alum, leaving the plaster in place for two or three days, and then apply to it cotton soaked in vinegar until the wound is healed.
And then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
And if you wish, apply some caustic medicines which I have written about in the second treatise on caustic medicines.
Now proceed with the cauterization in this way: Take a cautery that has this shape:" (likely describing or illustrating the shape of the cautery instrument).
It is called a 'claus clavilhs,' because its head has the shape of a nail with a slight curve and a small raised point in the middle.
Then place it on the painful area, keep your hand steady - so that the arc (of the cautery) below is not touched - and rotate the instrument slowly but swiftly.
If the amount that adheres to the cautery's face is such that it covers half of it, lift your hand a little so that the artery below is not touched and thus there will be no bleeding.
Then dip a cotton swab in salt water and place it on the area, leaving it for three days. After that, apply moistened cotton with ointment until healed.
And if you want to cauterize the end of the ulnar artery according to the cautery method, be careful not to make an incision into this rather modern external iliac artery.
Chapter four.
Regarding the cauterization of an ancient external iliac artery.
When you treat the external iliac artery using what we have mentioned for previous treatments and considering the different diseases, if the treatment does not work, and sometimes due to the disease which is not enough for the first cautery with medicine or fire cauterization method, then you need to ignite a knife-shaped cautery until it becomes white hot; this means applying it on the pain location along the length line of half of your finger or that one; and place your hand once and press it hard before incising the arch and preventing it from hitting the bone.
However, it is necessary for you to be careful not to damage the continuation of the mandible, which is important for chewing and that the ligament should not adhere nor pinch the nerve running through it, preventing spasm.
And regarding the custody and caution of blood flow from an incised artery, as there is a fear of this at the beginning of the operation, especially for those who do not know what they are doing and lack experience; leave the operation in them initially.
And I will provide a reminder of the treatment for accidental blood flow from archery wounds according to its manner, in this very book.
And if you see that this illness does not require such a strong treatment and the patient's body can tolerate it, cauterize them in the middle of their head as we have described before, and treat the wound until it is healed.
And if you wish to use the cautery we mentioned in the chapter on archery wounds with two irons, know that this is the better and more effective treatment.
Chapter 5: Of Wounds from Iron or Stone
On the treatment of earaches.
When there is pain in the ear due to cold and it is treated with laxatives and other remedies as mentioned before, but the pain persists, then apply the following cautery treatment. This type of cautery is called 'punctual', and its shape is...
Then proceed to apply the fire by making small circular motions all around the ear or at each specific point if pain is localized. Along with the cautery of the root of the ear, gradually as you have marked the place with ink.
And if the cautery of these points covers the entire ear, and those that follow it, then treat the places in between so they are healed.
It seems you have provided me with a section title or chapter number. Is there a specific text associated with this title that you would like translated? Let me know how I can assist you further!
Concerning the cauterization of torture."
Certainly! Let me provide you with the translation of each line into English:
Esquiva cauterizacio de la specia que endeve per siccacio o per spasme del nervi.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And place your cautery on the opposite side of the affected area, for relief will only come from the part that appears to be healthy.
The method of cauterization is as follows: you cauterize it with the cautery on the right side of the top of the ear, placing a small piece over the crown of the head, and another on the temple, its length being equal to the length of your pinky finger. Then, place your hand holding the cautery so that the amount burned is equivalent to half of the width of an apple seed.
This is the shape of the cautery, which is similar to that of a knife, its front side being flat. However, it is slightly more delicate than that; it should have a little less thickness in superfluous crudeness.
Then treat the area with what is previously processed so that it is healed.
It seems that you may be referencing the seventh chapter of a medical text or treatise. Is there anything specific within this chapter that you would like me to translate or explain further? I can provide more context if needed!
The title of the seventh chapter is "On the Cauterization of Old Apoplexy."
Here is my translation of the text line by line: The way of using the cautery is done as previously mentioned.
The cautery has already been applied to the opening of the stomach, and now it is time for the second part; then treat it with what you have at hand.
Chapter 5.
On the cauterization of forgetfulness done with flame.
Give the patient in the beginning large cups of wine and pills with fresh eggs.
Then shave the entire head of the patient and place on their skull a plaster as described in the treatise about plasters.
And leave some intervals blank; this is how one makes the cautery. Do this as often as you think it's necessary, following the order I have previously stated.
And so if they are cured by this, it's good; but in the opposite case, then do to them three cauterizations on the back part of their head, which descend from that uppermost portion of the head until you reach the lowest point of the neck. And place something with the thickness of a finger between each cautery, then treat the cautery with what has come out.
If you wish to treat the patient and their illness is tolerable, then perform cautery on one place only; but if it is more severe, cauterize them over both hips.
Then treat it until it is healed; and let the shape of the cautery be an olive, as given in the form above.
This appears to indicate that you have reached chapter nine of this treatise. Would you like me to translate more text?
On the cauterization of parasites and softening of the entire body.
Take care that you proceed with the softening of the head with irons and what we have said; then shave the patient's head, and cauterize it with a single cautery on top of their head, two cauteries over both temples, one at the back of their neck, and three more on the vertebrae of the neck.
And if it is necessary in the illness of softening the body due to excessive humors and tolerable patients, but the illness is severe, then cauterize them with four cauteries on their vertebrae, finally use a cautery that has been heated by hot coals from the fire, and lift your hand. And then treat that wound until it is healed, and let this be an olive oil cautery.
I would need more context to fully understand the meaning of "Capitol .x." Is there any additional information you can provide, such as the full text or specific references?
Here is my best attempt at translating each sentence:
No es cauterizat le epilemtic sino aquella epilemcia es per flecma."
And so it is necessary to modify the patient's brain at the beginning with years and another cure that we have mentioned in the division, when the illness is severe and can tolerate the exception of medicines.
And if the child does not tolerate medicines, then administer gargles and chewable medicated substances that modify the brain; this should be done for several days, with the improvement of their diet.
Then scrape the top of the patient's head and cauterize it with a cautery in the middle of their scalp as mentioned before. Use another cautery on their occipital bone (the back of the skull), and cauterize each corner or side of the head. If the patient is strong and can tolerate it, then use the aforementioned cauteries to cauterize him/her after applying paralysis and softening of the body on the vertebrae of their neck and back.
Use an olive-shaped cautery as previously described.
However, if the patient is a child, then use a delicate or small-sized cautery in this manner.

And then raise the patient's head, and then make a comfortable pillow for them using clothing, and then place that under their head.
And the patient is completely bedridden, unable to move from any part of their body.
Then apply a liniment; it is more appropriate to use old sheep fat for this. Heat it over the fire to warm it up appropriately, which is done according to the patient's tolerance. Then put it in the middle of their head on top of a pillow, and leave it there until it cools down.
Do this to the patient once a week and administer another treatment until they are cured; or if you wish, cauterize them with small points depending on their age, but make sure to hold a cautery in your hand that has been properly prepared: this is a special kind of cautery that moistens the brain evenly.
Then apply this clot soaked in sheep fat or goose grease.
It seems like there is more text to translate, could you please provide me with the remaining text?
De cauterisacio de aygua descendent en le huel."
When you have identified the onset of water in the brain through the signs I mentioned earlier in my explanation, then begin and give the patient to drink that which changes their head, and protect them from all humidity.
And let it soak in warm water for some days.
Then instruct them to shave their head and cauterize it with a cautery on the top of their skull; then cauterize it with two cauteries over both temples if there is an onset of water in both brains, or from one side if there is an onset of water in one brain.
Incise with a cautery all the veins and arteries that are under the chain; and let these cauteries be in such length at the latitude of the temples.
And protect yourself from blood flow when you are cauterizing; and if you see that there is blood flowing from them, remove it with whatever medicine is available to you.
And I will come with the wisdom which is in extraction of arteries and by their excision, and caution against blood flow.
And sometimes it is cauterized at the nape of the neck with two pointed cauteries that are made immediately.
This appears to be a chapter number or marker, but without further context or information about its placement within the text, it's difficult to provide an accurate translation or interpretation. Could you please provide some additional details or surrounding sentences for better understanding?
Regarding the cauterization of old tears."
When the tears of the eyes are ancient frequently and pass through the veins and arteries which are in the visible part of the head outside, and it is verified that this is superfluous phlegmatic humors, then cauterize that with a cautery which we have recounted in the chapter about boiling water on the eyes, and with two cauteries in the middle of the head, and two more cauteries below the temples on both sides, and two cauteries below the bones. And if you need additional treatment, then cauterize that area in the entire region of the tail of the eye above the edge of the eyelid with a small cautery.
Chapter 14.
De cauterizacio de fetor de nas.
When you treat the patient with what we have discussed in the previous section and their condition does not improve, you prepare and give them an herbal drink made from cockle for three nights. Then, shave their head and apply a medium-sized cautery, followed by an olive-sized one. Then, apply a carnation-sized cautery and two more on the eyebrows above each eye, leaving only a small space between them.
Be cautious not to burn or damage the surrounding area during the cauterization process.
As for the shape of the carnation-sized cautery, it is designed in this manner..." (followed by a description or illustration)

When the eyelid becomes soft due to illness or excess moisture, you proceed with cauterization using this 'lunar' cautery. This is its shape..." (followed by an illustration or description of the unique form)
And if you wish to cauterize above both eyebrows with two small cauteries on either side, let them be extended up to the temples. Let the length of each cautery match the length of the respective eyebrow.
Do not press the cautery too hard against your hand, but rather with just enough force to adhere the third part of the eyelid.
The Roman numeral XVI represents the number 16 in our modern decimal system. So, this likely indicates that you have reached the 16th chapter of this medieval medical treatise.
Regarding the eyelid of an infant, when hairs have grown within its slit-like palm, use a pointed cautery.
When hairs grow within the palms of an infant to such an extent that I prick them with a needle, there are two ways in which one can cauterize it: either by using fire or caustic medicine.
If you cauterize with fire, ask the infant to fix its gaze on something as if it were looking at those who comb its hair, while they are pulled and plucked; and if I hold it by the nose, then you must bind the child's hands with a cloth so that it may not be hurt any further until the hairs have been burnt.
Therefore, when the patient is born and baptized, place their head on your lap, then gently press down on their eyelid with your finger, making a sign resembling the shape of a myrtle leaf; this mark should start near the eyelashes.
Then place a cold compress made of pigeon dung or crushed feathers on their eye.
And then ignite the cautery, which should be shaped like this:" (likely followed by an illustration or description of the tool's shape)
Now cauterize the marked area in small, invisible dots, gradually burning away the surface of the eyelid until it appears like a myrtle leaf.
The sign of successful treatment is when you see the patient's eyelid contract and their eyelashes rise due to the needle puncture.
And so, lift your hand and leave the patient alone for three days; then place a compress made of fresh dung on them until the wound has healed. Then treat any remaining issues with ointment until they are cured.
But if it returns through the hair for some reason, and their eyelid softens, then do the cautery again on that spot just as you did initially.
But if the hair is on their eyelid, remove it and cauterize that area so that it heals properly and does not cause irritation.
The cautery with caustic medicine is what you should apply when the hair is long and has grown thick; make a piece of cloth in the shape of a myrtle leaf for this.
Then take one ounce of known and living tar, or wax, and mix these ingredients well together to prevent it from cooling down too quickly; spread this mixture over the cloth in the shape of a myrtle leaf and place it on your finger or both fingers; place under your finger cotton soaked in egg white, and have the patient's head rest upon your lap.
Put your finger over the medicine and press it down lightly without rubbing too hard since the patient will feel a burning sensation from the medicine which is like fire.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And then place a bandage on the wound until the inflammation is gone, and then treat it with guaiac ointment or another that heals it.
And if necessary, you must carefully ensure that none of the medicine falls into the eye during your procedure. If after a few days, the eyelid becomes softened and something from the eyelashes gets into the eye, then repeat the application of the medicine on the affected part of the eyelid as done initially, and it will heal.
This is how the leaf of myrtle looks like.
And you should know that human eyes vary in size and smallness, so your procedure must be adjusted accordingly.
The path of learning is never hidden from those who study this craft.
It seems you have provided the chapter number, but please clarify what you would like me to do with it or any other information related to it so I may better assist you.
Regarding the cauterization of a fistula in the tear duct of the eye.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And then place a poultice made of feathers or horsehair on his wound.
Then prepare the cautery, which is shaped like this:
It should be hollow, shaped like a reed or an eagle's feather, with the cautery made at one end.
And if you wish to penetrate further, do so from the other end. And if you want it to emerge again, make an exit as you would with a probe.
However, one that is hollow will serve better for the task at hand.
Then press on the fistula if it is open, trying to make it healthy and dry. And if it is not open, then make an incision to remove any hardened matter within.
Then place the well-lit cautery on it, and you must hold that with your hand a little below the cautery of the wound towards the nose, so as not to miss your aim or disturb the patient, then apply the cautery to the edges of the wound and burn them.
Here is the translated version of the provided text:
But if eleven days have passed and it is not healed, then apply an acute corrosive medicine on it until the bone is uncovered and scrape it according to what is appropriate in its chapter.
There is another way to cauterize a fistula which the first ones said: go to the place of the fistula and open it; then put in that fissure a thin thread-like candle whose shape is like this, And put into that one ounce of melted lead; then have your hand steady with care so that the patient doesn't suffer because the melted lead gets into his wound. You should apply on the patient's wound cotton soaked in egg white or water since the lead hardens the place of the fistula and heals it miraculously.
And if the fistula is healed with what we have said about the cauterization and cure, it's good; but if not, then it is necessary to administer a nasal syringe and reduce the fistula into the nose according to its appropriate place.

And so if the wound is incised and it has healed well, that's good; but if not, it is necessary to uncover the area and remove the corrupted bone as described in the following chapter.
Chapter 20:
On the cauterization of teeth and on softening arteries.
When arteries are softened due to moisture and teeth become aggravated, treating them with medicines is ineffective. Place the patient's head in your lap, then prepare the cautery tool of the shape described here, insert the cautery quickly into the tooth with a metal rod, and hold it there until the heat reaches the root of the tooth.
Then remove your hand, and repeat this process with the cautery tool several times as you see fit.
Then instruct the patient to rinse their mouth with salt water and hold it there for an hour; after that, let them spit out the liquid since the aggravated tooth is sealed, the softened gum is hardened, and any corrupting moisture has been dried up.
Certainly, here is my attempt at translating the provided text into English, line by line:
De cauterisacio de dolor de dent."
When tooth pain is due to coldness or the presence of worms or frost, and it cannot be treated with medicine, then cauterization is performed in two ways: either with cow dung or with fire.
Cauterization with cow dung involves taking fresh cow dung and wrapping it around the end of an iron rod or stick. Then you dip this wrapped rod into the hot cow dung and quickly place it on the painful tooth until it is cooled down.
Repeat this process several times until the healing properties of the fire reach the root of the tooth.
And if you prefer, immerse a woolen cloth or cotton in the aforementioned cow dung, place it over the aching tooth, and hold an ignited iron rod above it until the heat reaches the depths of the tooth cavity.
However, be cautious when using fire cauterization, especially with patients who have metal fillings or dental work, as the intensity of the heat may not reach the oral cavity due to the presence of these metallic obstructions.
Shape the cauterizing iron to fit the tooth, place it on the tooth and hold your hand over it until the iron cools down. Repeat this process several times over the course of one or two days until the pain subsides.
And now, let the patient fill their mouth with good saliva by pressing on the cautery [instrument], and let them hold it there for an hour, after which they should spit [the saliva out]; this is how the cauterization process works.
Cauterize whatever extremity you see fit according to your judgement.
This is how the cannula should be used:
I'm sorry, I don't understand your request. Could you please rephrase or provide more context?
Regarding the cauterization of external tumors:
When external tumors are caused by an excess of phlegm and cold humors, and they do not respond well to medicinal treatment but their digestion seems slightly improved, you should use a cautery in the following manner: it should have two open ends with one for smoke expulsion; apply this ignited instrument to the tumor once, and if further treatment is needed, ensure you do not go deeper than the base of the tumor.
If the tumor is small in size, then apply the cautery accordingly and let it remain for three days; place a piece of cotton soaked in saliva over the wound until it has healed from the fire's burn.
And then treat him with ointments, bandages, and linens until he is healed.
This indicates that this is Chapter 23 of the treatise, providing information on specific medical practices and treatments for various ailments.
Regarding the cauterization of vocal cords and the treatment of narrow airways."
When moisture affects the root of the lung and this is due to an alteration in complexion, it will be necessary at first that he be evacuated with laxatives; then cauterize there what they call the larynx on the affected side.
And be careful not to touch the larynx with the cautery or burn its cord, only slightly.
Cauterize there with another cautery at the junction of the neck in the last vertebra behind him. And let your cautery be nailed according to the preceding manner.
Then cure him with what has been prescribed before he is healed.
Chapter 24.
On the cauterization of lung diseases and coughs.
When coughs and lung diseases are due to cold moisture, the patient has neither fever nor expectoration of blood, and it is an old disease, then cauterize him with two cauteries on both sides above the joint in the depressed places called leontii and boyci; and another one in the middle of his foot between the two mammilla bones; and let your cautery be nailed as previously shown.
And if you wish, use the cautery called 'puncta' for your cauterization process, which is shaped similarly to that used in the treatment of earaches.
And if there are points on the patient's skin, then treat them with whatever remedy is prescribed beforehand for healing.
And once you have the cautery, which has three sides, the cauterization can be done with it. You can make three cauteries in this shape:
The roman numeral 'xxv' corresponds to 25. Is there any specific context or information you would like me to extract from this number?
On the cauterization of the 'titillic', which is the top of the assistant's head."
When the head of the helper is dislocated due to slippery humidity and is not firmly held during its return movement, it must be guided back into place as it usually returns on its own. Then, with a small movement, gently pull it towards you as we have shown; now you need to reduce the dislocation first by reversing the patient onto their back or side; then raise your forearm from inside the armpit upwards until you reach above the elbow of your left hand if the joint is dislocated inwards.
Then take the double-pointed cautery; this is how it looks like...
Now cauterize the forearm making sure it penetrates on the other side, and you will get a four-pointed cautery when done.
In some cases, the count is adjusted accordingly, and that is because there were eight cauteries.
Then place the cautery on top with warm brine, then let the patient rest, and do not move that body part for some time until it is comfortable again.
When the dislocation is in the upper parts of the body and this procedure is performed, then use a pointed or multiple-point cautery on the muscle. Because the joint is confirmed (or aligned), moisture is reduced, and the patient recovers.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text into English:
De cauterizacio del stomac.
When stomach pain is caused by excess moisture and the disturbance of its natural composition, leading to a buildup of waste in the body, if you continue with the treatment methods without consulting an expert, it is advised that the patient be placed on their back, arms and legs extended. Then cauterize the area with three cauteries: place one cautery below the feet, the size of a thumb with small nails, and two more cauteries on either side of this, forming a triangular shape; ensure they are not too close to each other as this will cause burning.
And if the depth of the cauterization is equivalent to about two-thirds of the thickness of your little finger.
The shape of the cautery should be designed as follows [draw], and if you wish, you may also use a larger cautery placed in the middle of the stomach with this circular shape.
Cauterize the stomach by applying this type of cautery to those who are afraid of it: and for those who require a more gentle approach, you may use a needle to puncture the stomach in the desired areas and then cauterize those points with the cautery; afterwards, treat them with the previously mentioned cure until they are healed.
Capitol .xxvii.
De cauterizacio del fietge fret.
When pain occurs in the kidneys due to coldness, moisture, or excessive flatulence that disrupts their natural function and leads to superfluous discharge, and when the patient has not been cured by what we have mentioned earlier, then it is recommended to place the patient in a supine position on their back. Take three cauteries of this shape and size and apply them to the kidneys beneath the hypochondrium, taking care that the patient remains lying down on his back.
And let the space between each cautery be equal to the width of a finger, and let the length of the cauteries be equal to the length of an upright body.
Do not press your hands upon the cauteries strongly.
And if the amount of medicine applied equals half the size of a coin and nothing more is required, and if the patient stands on his feet; or if not standing, then let him sit with legs extended and arms raised.
It is possible for you to cauterize these cauteries with a lancet-like cautery, when you possess the required skill and caution in this art.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Certainly! Here is my translation of the provided text into English:
De perforacio de apostema del fietge am cauteri." translates to "For the perforation of abscesses in the liver, use a cautery tool."
When an abscess forms in the kidney and you want to determine if it is within the kidney's tissue or its membrane, if it is in the tissue of the kidney, the patient will experience increased weight gain and pain.
And if the abscess is within the kidney's membrane, the pain becomes severe and often tires out the doctors treating it.
Therefore, have the patient turn onto their side and locate the spot of the abscess; then ignite the cauterizer which was assembled with rags as shown on the previous page. Cauterize the abscess with said cautery until all its matter has been burned away; do this before any healthy tissue is reached or damaged.
Then treat the patient for other abscesses until they are healed as well.
And it is not necessary to use this form of cauterization unless the one studied in medical arts is prolonged; and that has proven useful for many diseases; however, you should experiment with this operation a few times first as it can be quite harsh on the patient's body but will heal better.
Here is my best guess at translating each line of the provided text into English:
De cauterizacio de plauresi."
Diyssero les antics cauteri de las razitz de aristologia a plauresi frega segon aquesta manieyra esser fazedor, e es aquest que tu prenguas de las razitz de aristologia longa secca una razit pun longua que es trobada, e sia de la grossetut del dit.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And do not cover your hand with the cautery, instead let it be done by the servant in charge of this task.
And some ancient masters said that there are some men who use an iron cautery like a rod and ignite it, then they place it in the area located between the ribs, so we reach the abscess and cure it, as we have mentioned in the case of liver abscess.
There is no fear in this cauterization procedure, as the patient may develop an immediate complication or a delayed one with the formation of a fistula that will not heal.
Chapter 30.
On the cauterization of the mouth.
When you treat the patient's mouth disease with what we have mentioned regarding treatment division and do not observe improvement, then cauterize it according to three methods; all are correct and one of them is performing 3 or 4 linear cauterizations along the length of the mouth as was described for liver cauterization.
And the distance between each two cauterizations is the width of a finger or slightly more and the shape of the cautery should be similar to what was described for liver cauterization.
And do not press your hand against the cautery; let the patient lie on his back.
There is another way to cauterize, which is by igniting the cautery with two vents, as we have previously mentioned in the chapter on muscle dislocation. Lift the patient's arm, which is on the side of the injury, and place it above their head.
And let your elevation when lifting the arm be according to the length of the body, so that the cauterizations are made proportionally along the latitude of the body.
Then introduce the two vents, ignite them quickly, as you insert the patient's other arm from the other side.
Then withdraw the cautery; thus, four cauterizations have been made.
And if you wish to cauterize using a cautery with three vents,
Then take care of the cautery after it has stopped burning for too many days, as this is more comfortable for the patient than the other methods mentioned earlier in the treatment.
Quan dolor de juncturas son faytas per humors fregas les quals so enfundutz a quascun membre del cors, lahoras quan veno dolors en los pes, de costumava dels metges es que aquo apelen podragua propriament.
De cauterizacio de ydropici.
Cauteri no catz en ydropici sino en alcinte3 propriament.
When you treat the dropsical patient using the methods of cure we have mentioned in the division and your treatment does not progress well, it is necessary to cauterize him with four cauteries around his navel and one on his stomach, another one on the liver, another one over the spleen, two between the vertebrae of the back, one at the right foot and another one on the stomach. The depth of the cauterization should be proportionate to the severity of the illness.
Leave the cautery open for some time so that the wound remains exposed for long periods.
Do not discharge the patient from care after the cautery is applied; instead, keep him for two more days to expedite his healing process.
The shape of the cautery used to burn the abdomen should be like a nail according to its previous shape, and that which is used for burning the back should be an olive branch according to what precedes it in form.
Chapter 32. Would you like me to translate any text from this chapter?
De cauterizacio de pes e de las coyssas."
When the feet are affected by edema and filled with yellowish water (edema), it is necessary to cauterize the feet on the top of the foot in the area between the index finger and ring finger; raise your hand with the cautery but do not twist it, then lift your hand without lowering it back down again because the yellow water will drain out.
This sentence describes the shape of the cautery tool used in this medieval medical practice. It states: "Then make two cauteries on both thighs and perform a knife-edge cauterization with the end of the cutting edge cautery. This sentence provides further instructions on how to position the cautery tool during the medical procedure: "The length of the cautery should be from the knee up and down to the middle part of the thigh, with two cauterizations performed over each thigh.
This sentence refers to the post-procedure care: "Leave the wound open without any treatment for a long time, allowing any water to drain from it.
This line concludes the instructions on how to treat joint pain caused by cold humors: "Then cure him with those same methods that have been mentioned.
It appears that this is the chapter number or title marker for this particular medical treatise, indicating it as Chapter 33.
About cauterization of the belly.
When the belly is full of phlegm and humidity that weakens the virtues, it is because the digestive and retentive virtue has been removed from the stomach and intestines. This condition is treated with curing methods but sometimes patients suffer from an expulsion of virtues during cauterization, so proceed to cauterize again using a large cautery on their stomach as previously done for the stomach cauterization, use the ring cautery and four small cauteries in the navel area; also use a pointed cautery. Finally use one or two larger cauteries over the navel.
And if you see an abundance of humidity and the patient can tolerate it, then cauterize over the pubis and intestines; but apply two small cauteries lightly on their stomach near the groin area because this is a perfect cure that won't fail.
Chapter 34
About the cauterization of old hemorrhoids.
When it is in the nature of old hemorrhoids or one with thick humors or corrupted humidity and has been cured by what we have said before but does not fully heal yet, then cauterize using three small cauteries on top of the bones below both little ones (the coccyx) and a smaller triangular one. And use another two cauteries above the navel.
Here is the translation of the provided source sentence:
Chapter 35.
Regarding the cauterization of hernias, proceed with their removal.
When you remove the hernia, ignite the cautery that is assembled like a ray (of light). Then insert that ignited ray into the removed hernia and quickly place your hand over it before the cautery reaches the opening of the vein through which blood flows.
Do this once or twice, but if there are too many hernias, cauterize each one as we have described and then cure them with the ointments you give to patients until they are healed.
And if you cauterize with a large cautery on someone's body, it will be more severe later on.
Chapter 36.
Regarding the cautery of fistulas that form naturally in the parts of the body.
When nature does not obey the operation we have described in its place (i.e., the rectum), and the patient is fearful because of this, cure them with a cautery.
Therefore, when a fistula occurs in the anal region and is long-standing, causing corruption of healthy tissues and moisture, it is most appropriate to use a gentle probe to explore this condition. Then, with the aforementioned probe, determine the depth of the fistula.
Now ignite the cautery which is similar to a beam (of light). Then place the ignited cautery into this fistula, according to the depth that the probe has reached.
And repeat the process of applying the cautery as many times as necessary until those corrupted tissues are burnt away once or twice or three times, depending on how much is needed.
Be cautious of burning any nerves or veins; also, if the fistula goes towards the bladder's cavity or intestine's cavity, avoid those areas entirely. Do not perform this procedure unless the fistula is in fleshy tissue and you believe it to be non-penetrating.
Then treat the area until it heals.
And if the wound is closed, having discharged all matter, and remains thus for a long time, then you may know that it has completely healed.
And if the matter is not removed from him, then know that it has penetrated into his bone or has corrupted his marrow; this is due to certain causes which will be mentioned later in their respective places.
It seems you may have provided me with the chapter number for an ancient medical text, but please feel free to give me more information about it if that is incorrect! If you could provide additional details or context regarding this "Capitol .xxxvii," I can offer a more tailored and accurate response. For example, what language was the original document written in? Is there any specific content or topic covered within this chapter that we can explore further?
Here is my translation of the provided text:
When there is pain in the stomach due to friction or severe flatulence, causing the patient's condition to worsen, it is advisable to cauterize that area on the abdomen with a pointed cautery for each pain, and remember this procedure.
And we will lightly cauterize it with the second one a little below, so that three linear cauterizations will follow, and thus they will be larger further back for greater benefit.
Chapter 38.
Regarding the cauterization of the bladder.
When weakness and softening of the bladder occur due to friction and excessive moisture, causing the patient to be unable to retain urine, then cauterize that area below, starting from where the hairs begin at the pubic bone, with a cautery on the right side and another on their left.
And let the length of each cautery be according to the number of toes; and cauterize that area with a cautery at the lowest part of the back or two if necessary.
And let the pointed cautery be used as required.
The text you provided seems to be written in an ancient Romance language, possibly a form of Old Occitan or a similar dialect. Here is my best attempt at translating it line by line into English:

De cauterizacio de la dislocation de l'anqua.
When mucous moisture infiltrates the area of the hip joint and causes it to move out of its place due to this humidity, a sign of this condition is that one side of the buttock seems longer than the other when compared. And if the location of the dislocation is found in the region around these joints...
Then you must cauterize the patient in the area of their hip using a circular cautery, as you have marked with ink on this circle surrounding the affected joint and positioning the joint at the center of the circle.
And let this pointed cautery be used as was previously described for cauterizing the stomach.
And if this pointed cautery is not available to you, then proceed with the cauterization using three large olive-shaped cauteries instead.
Perform the cauterization according to the level of severity indicated by your patient's entire condition, and then care for them until they are healed.
The Roman numeral 'XLI' corresponds to the number 41 in decimal notation. So this likely indicates that this is the forty-first chapter of whatever medical treatise you provided above, assuming the '.xli.' portion was meant to be included as part of your initial request text. Is there anything else I can help with regarding this medieval medical document?
De cauterizacio de la vena sciatica translates to "On the cauterization of the sciatic vein."
When pain occurs in the hip region and is caused by coldness and moisture, treat the patient with what we have previously discussed and do not neglect this step, for it is an ancient practice. Then remove excess thick humors from the patient using foul-smelling pills or artificial/similar pills; cauterize that area afterward.
The method of cauterization in this case follows two approaches: cauterization with burning medicines or cauterization with fire.
There are two scientific ways to proceed, one of which is to cauterize the patient's hip area using three triangular-shaped cauteries arranged like this; make sure they penetrate deeply. The distance between each cautery should be equal to the thickness of a finger, and the cauteries themselves can be either olive-sized or larger.
In some cases, the cauteries may be placed on the top of the hip joint, making four cauteries in total.
If you wish, cauterize using the circle that outlines the shape in the hip dislocation cauterization procedure; ensure it fully covers and burns away all roughness of the entire area.
And this is how you perform cauterization on the hip when the pain is concentrated in the joint and has not spread to the groin.
But if the pain has spread to the groin, then you will cauterize with two cauteries on the thigh, placing them over the area where the patient feels the most pain; and use one cautery on the calf, slightly below the back of the knee joint.
If you use a cutting cautery, then the depth of the cauterization should be determined by the severity of the pain.
And if the patient indicates that the pain has spread to their feet, then you will cauterize with three or four points of cautery here, or more if it is deemed necessary.
If the patient indicates pain below the groin area, then you will use a cutting cautery here.
And be mindful during any cauterization that you do not burn any nerves or major arteries, for it could cause great harm to the patient.
I have seen one or two people who were cauterized on the calf and, as a result of the procedure, their leg became swollen with fluid that accumulated in the foot, eventually bursting and causing gangrene throughout the entire foot. And then there is a sudden release of fluids from the abdomen, and that brings death.
And if the pain is felt in two different parts, cauterize each one following this method.
The wise ones said that, for the cauterization of water, use a cautery tool like this: it should be shaped like a ring made of iron, with a circumference equal to half a palm; and its opening should be as wide as the bone of a date or slightly less.
Inside that ring, place another third one; the space between them should be equal to the size of a thumb; these rings should be open on two sides; and the length of these rods should be one or two thumbs long. Make sure these rods are properly fitted with iron edges within the rings, and this is how it will look:
Then ignite it in the fire until it starts to glow and spark, and place it on the affected area while the patient lies on their side. Thus, you will cauterize it with three circular cauteries at once.
Certainly! Here is my attempt at translating each line into English while maintaining the original medieval style:
Diys Albucasis: Oh, my child, we have rarely used this type of cautery due to the fear it instills in patients, and consequently, few people practice it.
May the good cauterization be upon those who endure it, and may it also heal their affected area.
May the cauterization with adhesive medicines be for you to make two circles having an iron ring pierced in which the goose feather of a door hangs; be its length on the wall as long as two nuts or such.
And if the space between any part is equal to the thickness of the finger; whether they are opened below or above, and that they contain each other in this way:
Then place on the part of the ankle the patient lying on their side, and press your hand on the part of the ankle; then take boiling water and pour it between the two circles, and let its temperature be slowly reduced by the fire, keeping it there for an hour, and let the patient endure this biting and adhesion — as this biting is like that of fire — until the biting stops.
And then lift your hand to the instrument and wipe away all the dirty water with clean water.
Then let him lie there for three days and place on it a poultice until the redness of the inflamed area subsides, and leave this for some days, and the inflammation will retreat; this is the last step in healing.
Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
And if the pain extends to the thigh or leg, make him stand in water as is done for the treatment of the hip equally.
This is the method of dirty water, and I have already written about it in the treatise on medicinal rectification. Take one part alkali and one part lime, both well extinguished, grind them together, and place them in a new pot with its bottom pierced by a small hole, according to the amount that fits into the tube.
And place beneath the bottom of this pot another inverted pot, and pour over that alkali and quicklime some clean water which covers them by one finger, then press these with your hand tightly for good compression, and let the fluid that flows from the clean water into the lower pot.
Then adjust all that water, and pour it over another live coals and other new alkalis, because then it will be of great use as a strong caustic agent, which is administered in many medical operations and in cauterizing other body parts, for the operation makes fire.
And for the caustic medicines, like vitriol, honey of cats, and vinegar with a taste similar to them, make sure they are mixed.
Guy recounts an operation and cure that healed a man's hip pain and sciatica; he praises it greatly, saying no other treatment is needed, as the patient was cured with this one procedure only, for the wound has healed completely, even though he bathed in ice-cold water immediately afterward.
It should be close to green ivy, and if you can't find green ivy, take a fresh fig; grind it with a little grease and place it on the hip where there is pain or on the thigh or leg, then bandage it.
Leave it on for three hours or the amount of time that the patient feels relief from the tightness.
And then place him in a bath; when his body is relaxed, put him on the ground, for the pain will cease and he will be healed.
And remember, it is not appropriate to use the cautery with these medicines but rather rely on the evacuation of the body.
Also, remember what the great physician, Escorides, said about using a goat's horn to cauterize the strait vein; it is advisable to do so when there are no other options available. The procedure should be carried out as follows: take wool and soak it in old oil, then place it between the toes of the foot and over the affected area.
Then take a dry goat's horn, ignite it until it becomes charcoal, and place it over the wool. Leave it there so that its heat spreads. Repeat this process and do not cease until the sensation of the sting reaches deep within; let the pain subside.
This method of cautery is called "cauteri de vaquas," or cow's cautery.
It seems that the text you provided contains a portion of a medical treatise, likely from medieval times, which discusses various treatment methods for joint pain and other ailments. The specific section titled "Capitol .xlii." appears to be missing or not included in your prompt. If you provide me with more context or additional information, I can assist you further in translating or interpreting the text.
De cauterizacio de dolor de dos.
Alcunas veguadas dolor es en le dos per tropas causas, cum per cazement o per percucio o per superflua evacuacio, e per causas ad aquellas semblantz, per infusio de materia frega e humida.
And this cautery is used only for this specific purpose which is done by the effusion of cold matter.
So now, proceed to evacuate the patient with foul-smelling pills and those similar to them, which are made specifically for three lines of pain across their back. Then make ten cautery marks on each line using either small or large cauterizations depending on how much the patient can tolerate and considering his virtue.
And do this cauterization with a pointed cautery.
And if you wish, you may use three or four nails as cauteries in the following way:
This appears to be a chapter number, indicated by the Roman numeral "XLV" which is equivalent to 45. The period before it might suggest that this is part of a larger document or book, where each section is numbered for easy reference.
On the use of cautery at the beginning of jaundice."
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And again [make an incision] at the last vertebra of the back and of its knots, which has already begun to rise above the other vertebrae.
And so when you see this [condition] and wish to prevent it, then cauterize that area with a circular cautery in the shape of: which takes up the entire affected part of the vertebra likewise.
And if you wish, cauterize in the surrounding area of the vertebra with the pointed cautery for two or three lines. And ensure that the points are close to each other [when using the pointed cautery].
Then treat the area so that it is healed with what we have said [previously in this treatise].
But be careful not to administer the cautery in areas of numbness caused by nerve spasms.
It seems that this text is divided into different chapters or sections, as indicated by the ".xliv" at the end. This likely refers to chapter 44 in Roman numerals. The period before it may signify the completion of a sentence or thought within this medieval medical treatise.
Based on the provided text, this chapter or section appears to be titled "On the Cauterization for Gout and Joint Pain." It seems that the treatise delves into various medical treatments, with this specific part focusing on the use of cautery in addressing gout and joint-related issues. The previous sections you translated likely outlined the process and considerations involved in this treatment method.
When joint pain is caused by frigid humours that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
And thus, when gout caused by cold is treated but the pain is not relieved, then the treatment must be repeated with cautery again.
And you will cauterize that area after the evacuation near the joint of the foot with several cauteries.
And your olive-shaped cautery, which is shaped like this [draws an illustration of the shape]:
And if it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then do so with a pointed cautery. And if the pain spreads to the toes or other joints, and this sometimes happens, then cauterize that area over each toe with three or four cauteries on either side, using this olive-shaped cautery.
And if it is necessary to use several of these cauteries, then do so and don't press the hand too hard against the cautery beforehand; only enough to cover the width of the cord.
And if pain spreads into the abdomen and back, apply the cautery method we discussed in the previous chapter.
If the pain is only in the muscles and it's called rheumatism, then prick around the navel as you would for an umbilical hernia, pricking these two lines.
And if the pain remains in these areas, prick around the navel over each knot and also on the wrist of the hand.
If the pain spreads towards the knees or the muscles after a few days, then cauterize all parts of the joints.
Do not discharge the patient from care without proper management and administration of medicine, for if good management is followed and the phlegm is discharged with this cautery treatment, God willing, they will be cured.
It seems that you have provided me with another source text to translate. Please provide the full text, and I would be happy to assist you further!
Here is my translation of your provided text:
When there is a rupture in the inguinal region and the intestines are protruding through the opening before reaching the hernia, this process begins from here. In such cases, it is advisable to instruct the patient to refrain from consuming solid food on that day and adopt measures aimed at reducing inflammation for the wound to descend below their belly.
Then support the patient between your two hands on their back and instruct them to push their belly inward so that the hernia or intestines do not protrude through the opening.
Then return him to the aforementioned position and feel for the rupture over the pubic bone, marking its extremity which resembles half a circle at the divided parts of the abdomen.
Then take up the cautery, whose shape is as follows: [Please describe the form of the cautery here]
Which has a round handle and emits sparks when struck. Then return the intestine or hernia to its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent the intestine from coming out.
You have already opened the space between the patient's thighs, placed a cushion under them, another servant is on their legs, and another one is on their chest holding their hands.
Then place the cautery on that mark with your hand holding the cautery upright, and insert it so that you reach the bone of the pubic symphysis in the middle of the abdomen; repeat again if you have not reached the bone during the first attempt.
Pay close attention to the position of the intestine during your cauterization process, ensuring you do not burn it, as this could lead to the patient's death or other severe harm.
Be aware that if you do not reach the bone with your cauterization, it means your operation has been unsuccessful.
Ensure that the cauterization for children is subtle, according to their size and proportions.
Then take care of the cauterization site for three days by applying an ointment so that the wound from the fire is cleaned.
Then take care of it with other medications until it is healed.
Let the patient rest on their back for forty days so that the wound is sealed and healed.
Make sure to provide the patient with nourishment according to their recovery time; if it is too quick, there might be intestinal prolapse due to straining during healing.
And when you want to get up after approximately forty days, then administer it appropriately and gently done, and keep him that way for another forty days.
And he must refrain from labor and excess in diet, as well as from loud voices, for when he follows this entire regimen of treatment, he will certainly be healed.
And I will tell you about the treatment for ruptures in other parts of the abdomen, and if it is at the beginning and you want to prevent its extraction, then cauterize that rupture with a round cautery according to its size, just as in the third part of this book; and treat it with what we have said above, which is not suitable.
And I have already said that some prefer to cauterize ruptures with a triangular cautery according to this shape, because it is marked with thorns:" (followed by an illustration or description of the triangular cautery).
And a thread is placed across the width above the rupture and another line on top of it; then place your hand with a spiked cautery, but the first cautery is lighter and better.

De cauterizacio de torcio.
When pain occurs in any body part due to injury or percussion and persists for a long time without responding to medicinal treatment, it is advisable to cauterize with a pointed cautery.
The choice of the pointed cautery for any body part should be based on its size and fragility as well as the location of the injury and the intensity of pain.
If the patient heals after the first cauterization, it is good; otherwise, repeat the process on them with a pointed cautery because, by custom, those pains are punctured from body part to another nearby until they are healed by cauterization.
Chapter 47.
On the cauterization of leprosy.
Lepers are occasionally treated with a pointed cautery for great benefit; however, it is of little use against leprosy caused by the rotting of flesh and the presence of black bile.
When you want to cauterize leprosy, consider whether it is contagious and apply the cure as we have stated in previous chapters; however, if you fear that corruption encompasses the entire body of the patient and their whole complexion, then cauterize them with five cauteries: one on the top of the head (on the median line), another underneath it, towards the front but below the hairline; two more on each side of the head (the horns) and a fifth behind, on the nape or neck.

And be careful of the nerves that are above the ankle, do not burn them.
Sometimes, cauterization is done with a cautery over the bone of the little toe and another one on the mouth of the stomach, as well as on the liver.
Know that the more closely you adjust the cauterizations, the more beneficial and effective they are; be aware that the patient does not feel pain from the cautery, just like their sores, because their body is already stupefied.
Make sure that the cauterizations are large or small depending on the body parts and joints, according to what was previously mentioned regarding the types of tools.
Then treat the cauterized area with a mixture of flour from ants, honey, and another remedy until it is healed.

It appears that the chapter title you provided translates to "On Cauterization of Stupor" in English. Would you like me to translate any specific sections or provide further information about this topic? I'm happy to assist!
When any body part is paralyzed or numb and does not heal with medicines, oils, and plasters, you then cauterize that affected limb using cauteries appropriate for its size or smallness.
And let your cauterization enter the wound a little. Then treat him with ointment until he is healed.
And some swellings are cauterized with fire, which reaches the hands and feet, and to the vertebrae of the back; this protects the nerves that move those members, and the swelling is reduced.
One should not presume to do this unless one is wise in the anatomy of the members and the emergence of nerves from throughout the body.

On the cauterization of wounds:
When cancer begins to develop and you wish to treat it, then use a circular cautery to burn the affected area while it is still fresh.
The wise men say that it should be cauterized with the last cautery in its place, but I have not seen this done before as I fear it may become an ulcer; I've only witnessed this a few times.
It is more effective to cauterize the wound in a circular motion as we've discussed before or with multiple pointed cauteries.
I apologize for the confusion earlier, I misinterpreted your request due to my lack of context regarding "Capitol .l.". Please clarify what you would like me to assist with or provide further details about this caption.

Here is my translation of your provided text:
Therefore, if you see that corrosion in a place where the cauterization with fire is suffered, then burn several small and large cauteries as appropriate for that location where there is corrosion.
Then proceed with the cauterization of the entire affected area while you eradicate all corrosion, leaving behind no cause for it.
Afterwards, clean the affected area for three days and apply on the cauterized spots a poultice made of oil mixed with trisyllabic words until all scars are eradicated and any corruption is gone.
Then cure it with flesh-building ointments.
But after three days if you see that the flesh is born healthy and there's no corruption present, then it's good; otherwise, repeat the cauterization on what remains of the corrupted areas.
And sometimes corrosion is treated with sharp medicine as it replaces the role of cauterization. But nonetheless, cauterization by fire is more effective at providing assistance.
And I have already mentioned the cure of it with sharp medicine in this section, so take that when you need it.
Capitol .liii.: Chapter 53.
On the cauterization of wounds and other similar treatments.
Small visible marks found in the parts affected by the sick person's foot are called wounds, and they can be caused by a severe impact on the side of the foot; cauterization for such wounds is done according to two methods: hot iron cautery and chemical cautery with caustic water.
For hot iron cauterization, you must prepare the cautery tool in the shape of an eagle's claw with a curve similar to that of a pen nib, which is made from iron according to the size and quantity required for the wound being treated; it should be very fine.
Then place that hot iron on the wound and move your hand around with the cautery tool following the outline of the wound until it reaches its full depth. Let it be for three days before beginning to move your arm again. Then plaster the affected area with a poultice of wild mallows boiled in salt, and let it stay on for one night; this will eliminate any inflammation.
And then treat the area with ointment made from generative flesh until it is healed.
If they are not converted and this happens often on the surface of their body, especially on hands and feet, then you should apply cauterization with hot water to them; take a tube made from horn or iron or vulture's beak and place it over the nail; then pour into the tube a small amount of boiling water, cover your hand, and rotate that entirely by hand, pressing hard against the end of the nail, expelling the boiling water through the tip of the nail; let the patient wait for an hour to feel the bite of the boiling water, and then remove it, as the nail with its roots will have been extracted.
And likewise do this to them again until you have removed all those that are in their body.
Then treat those wounds, now that the roots of the nails have been eradicated, with ointments that help generate flesh.
This seems to be indicating a new chapter or section in the text; is there another excerpt for me to translate?
On the cauterization of tremors.
When there is any trembling due to coldness in the nerves or due to a febrile condition caused by cold, or for any similar reason, you should cauterize that person with four cauteries or five on the vertebrae of their back, one between each vertebra; and with a cautery on their feet, and an olive-shaped cautery over their stomach.
And if the patient's trembling subsides and they recover quickly from their cold illness, [it is a good sign].
Chapter 5.
On the cauterization of white (i.e., cold) accidents to the body.
When white (i.e., cold) pustules or abscesses appear on the body that are made of thick and corrupted matter, then at the beginning of their appearance, they should be cauterized with a subtle cautery made from myrtle wood, whose end has been extended over fire; or with long needles; or with a lenticular (i.e., lens-shaped) cautery.
And in some cases, a silver cautery is used at the beginning of their expulsion according to this method; they are not burned, and the superfluidity is removed by doing so, [and] they recover from it.
However, make sure that this is done with proper evacuation through bloodletting.
This seems to be an indicator or marker for the text that follows it. It could represent a chapter, section, or specific topic within the medieval medical treatise. The number "61" suggests it is the sixty-first such division in the document.
Here's my best attempt at translating this line:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Therefore, when it happens to someone, then treat him with your hand at the orifice of the wound, and place your index finger over it tightly so that blood clots are stopped from flowing out through your finger, without anything coming out.
Then place the small and large olive-shaped cauteries on the fire for a long time, in great number, and blow on them until they are well ignited.
Then take one of those, small or large depending on the place and the extent to which the artery is broken, over that vein hastily after you have stopped your finger, and apply the cautery until it is seared and stops the flow of blood.
And if blood comes out of the wound when you release your finger and remove the first cautery, then take another one that has been heated among those which were prepared on the fire, and do not stop doing this until the bleeding is staunched.
Make sure you do not burn the nerve which is here, and that another evil does not befall the patient.
And know that when blood flows from the artery, it is not possible to stop its flow in those (cases) except by one of four methods: either with a cautery like the one mentioned before, or through extraction if it has not been extracted already, for when it is extracted and its ends are burnt, then the bleeding stops; or binding it firmly with gall or ligatures, or applying medications whose power lies in constriction; and they should be tightly bound with suitable bandages.
Moreover, he who manages restriction by tying with a cloth or through positioning the patient near sources of heat, will only succeed in causing inflammation.
But if it reaches a place where there is no doctor and medicine, then proceed by placing the index finger on the opening of that vein as we have said, and understand the great compression on him before the blood gets stuck in its main part above the wound; make sure to not bite the skin over the injury. Sprinkle cold water on it so much that the blood coagulates and thickens; then proceed with cauterization or medicine if needed.
On incision, perforation, cupping, bloodletting, wounds, and their likes.
We have already mentioned in the first chapter all those illnesses where cauterization by fire is appropriate and which medicine to use, as well as the occasions for it and their causes, along with necessary instruments and types of cauterizations; and I have ordered chapters from head to toe.
Under this chapter I will proceed in the same manner so as to provide relief for the afflicted one according to his request.
And before I begin this, my child, know that in this chapter we shall learn about the very same thing that was explained in the first chapter on cauterization.
And for this reason, my child, you must be extremely careful as the operation described in this chapter requires great attention to detail as it involves various procedures such as bloodletting, incision on veins, dealing with abscesses, excisions, cleansing of ulcers, removal of arrows and stones, and similar interventions. All these procedures are accompanied by fear, trembling, and in most cases, death itself.
I warn you, my child, so that this hesitation does not befall upon you, as sometimes one must take on the ways of men and employ methods to treat illnesses. There are times when one may become afraid of their own illness and this lightens the burden that leads to death, due to how much they suffer from it, as well as the length of time since its onset, which is a sign of impending mortality.
And among those is he who gives you his wealth and says, 'Be content with this,' while your health depends on him, and his ailment is harmful.
So you must not consent to him who comes to you in this manner; let your caution be greater than covetousness and greed; do not presume any cause over this unless there is certain knowledge that verifies it to you, and from whom you receive praiseworthy succession.
Use in the cure of all your ailments the prognostication and indication from him who has been restored to health, for in this you will find help towards acquiring fame and remembrance, praise and glory.
O children, may God breathe His understanding into you, and may He not withhold guidance and protection from you, for these are in His hands.
And I have arranged this chapter by distinguishing its chapters as it precedes in the chapter on cauterization, from the treatment of the head to the feet, so that you may find relief for what you seek and require.
Chapter One.
Of the cure for water accumulation in a child's head.
Know that this disease, which often occurs in children during childbirth, happens when the nurse forcefully pulls on the child's head.
And some cases occur for hidden reasons which are unknown.
I have never seen this disease in anyone other than children; all those whom I saw suffered an untimely death, and thus it appears to me as a sorrowful affliction.
I have seen a child whose head was filled with water; their head remained enlarged to such an extent that they could not lie down due to the size of their head, and as humidity increased, death came swiftly.
This accumulation of humidity occurs either between the brain and skull or below the skull on the nape.
When the operation is performed on that part where humidity accumulates between the brain and skull, and there is little pus, you should make an incision in the middle of the head with a latitudinal cut, which should be as long as two nuts to allow the humidity to escape. This is what we call the spatium.
And so, if the humidity is more abundant and the abscess is larger, then there are two incisions made in this manner:
And if the humidity is beneath the bones, this will be indicated by the hair on your head being parted and wet when you compress that area with your hand internally; it is not hidden from you. Make three incisions on the top of your head in this manner:
Then extract all the humidity from the incision; after this, bind the incisions with linen and feathers; then on the fifth day, pour vinegar and oil over it; next unbind the binding and cure the wound with ointment and balm, binding his head again in equal measure; and feed the patient dry food of little moisture until the member is comforted and healed.
There is another method of incision that considers the magnitude of the abscess and the collection of water, as some patients have more in their occipital region, or in front, on the right side, or on the left; therefore, pay attention to where the abscess appears and the accumulation of water, then proceed with the incision accordingly.
Certainly! Here is my translation of the provided text into English, line by line:
Chapter 2.
When an old cataract or wound on the eyes or feet does not respond to medicinal treatment, the final cure in such cases is the incision of those two arteries.
And therefore, when you wish to incise those arteries while the patient is shaving their head, rub the area with rough cloth so that the veins appear, then have the patient's neck tightly wrapped in a cloth; consider where the pulse of the vein can be felt; these places, which are above the areas behind the ears, may not always be obvious.
Then cover the vein with a cloth and incise each one using a sharp spatula coming from either side until you reach the bone, this will be across the breadth of the head.
And if you wish, insert the spatula under the artery and transect it at the incision made above.
Let the length of the incision be about two fingers in size because when any vein is incised blood is emitted with a pulsating ejection, leaping out with frequent bounds.
Mays si la arceria no apareys al cintiment, lahoras cove que tu mesures de la aurelha la quantitat del spazi de tres ditz, e aprop senha am tenta, e fen entro al os.
Here is the translated text:
Under consideration is a plague where some cause of death remains in the bone, then cut away that portion before it turns into an abscess.
Then strengthen the wound with feathers and soft cloth bandages, and treat it with ointments until it is healed.
Chapter 3.
On the extraction of arrows that are in the temples.
When someone experiences an ancient migraine or severe headaches due to moist and windy conditions in the hollows of their temples, or it is an old and similar condition that does not respond to medicinal treatments, we resort to extracting arrows from the temples, or cauterizing them as we have demonstrated.
The procedure for the operation and extraction of arrows is as follows: The patient shaves the hair from their temples; then locate the arrowhead, which is visible in the temple area, unless it is obscured by swelling due to the violent impact.
If it is obscured from view, then have the patient's neck secured with a piece of cloth; then rub the area with a rough cloth or soak it with warm water until the arrowhead becomes visibly apparent. And then you take the spatula which has this shape: Then you remove the thread with ease until you reach the arrow; then pull it out gently and extract the arrowhead from the upper parts, uncovering it from the layers of clothing underneath.
However, if the artery is delicate, you wrap it with the end of the ointment, and then cut off a portion based on the length of its extremities and how contracted they are, ensuring there is no blood flow, as without cutting them properly, the blood will not stop flowing.
Then evacuate some of the patient's blood, about one to three ounces.
And if the wound is large, make sure to stitch it closed in two places with strong double thread or cords, and avoid cutting any putrefied flesh before the wound has healed, as this could cause blood flow.
Then cut away any superfluous flesh that is between the two bindings, doing so either now or at another time.
And if you wish, cauterize it with a cautery or use a cautery knife to cauterize the extremities after they have been cut, and this will serve the same purpose.
It is better if the patient has a fever or has a warm complexion; because cauterization is one of those remedies that helps to dry out the excess humidity in the body, and therefore it is more beneficial.
Then it is necessary to extract the arrows that are stuck in the wound and clean the area thoroughly with decently prepared powder; then treat it with dry medicines to promote healing and prevent infection.
And if while treating the wound there is an unexpected flow of blood from the arrow's entry point, then you should quickly try to stem the bleeding by either using cauterization or packing the area with a cloth; apply pressure with your hand until the bleeding stops. And if none of the above methods are available to you, then place your finger on the wound to let the blood clot; rinse the area with very cold water until it numbs and becomes insensitive, and apply pressure as needed.
The easiest way to extract an arrow is to cauterize the vein with this special two-pronged cautery; mark both sides of the wound with a thread and then place several ignited pieces of wood on top until they come into contact with the bone, burning through it in two places. This will sever the vein between its extremities as they are not fully consolidated yet by the cauterization.
And this is the shape of the cautery:
Both edges should be sharp. However, if it has less sharpness than two edges, as it is sharp like two edges close to each part, and does not cut the flesh quickly.
Therefore, in those with some fatness, the heat of the fire is to be held back from them and the flesh should be cut lightly.
And this work is better than any other and lighter as well.
The space between the two edges should be equal to the thickness of your finger.
It seems that this text is divided into different sections or chapters, as indicated by "Capitol quart" which likely means Chapter 4. Would you like me to continue translating the next section?
On the treatment of acute and acidic sores on the heels.
When it is an acidic sore, and the affected area is on those veins that are above the crown of the head outwards, and you find no cause for its cure through medicine, and sometimes the face of the patient turns red and feels as if ants were crawling on their forehead, and the heels themselves become shrunken, moist so much that even their skin becomes noticeable, and the eyelids are scraped by the acidity of the tears, then the old remedy for this operation is now abandoned.
And you command the patient to scratch their hairline, then make three equally spaced incisions in their forehead according to its length. If the length of each incision is about two fingers: one incision should be equally distant to the length of the nose in the middle of the forehead; another according to the length of a small move by the corners of the eyes that are near the tear duct, and the third from there on.
Be careful not to cut the arches that are on both sides, and extend your hand from the continuation of both jaws. If the space between each incision is about three fingers wide...
And if you have a piece of sponge equipped with many dry cloths to absorb the blood...
Then insert the spatula of double-pointed ends into this, which has the shape of the incision... ...that goes from one temple to the second incision. Cut out all of the tissue between the two incisions down to the bone with a chisel and then make this incision from the middle one to the second incision. Then place this on the same space and insert another tool into the first incision, it is called a 'cutella', sharp on one side but not on the other.
Place the edge of this sharp side towards the attached flesh and its other edge between the bone and soft tissue; use it to reach the median sulcus, and with it sever all vessels that descend from the brain to the hips.
Let the incision be continued along that which appears of soft tissue, then do this within the median cleft up to another cleft.
And since there is an equal quantity of blood flowing, squeeze the places where clotted blood has formed.
Then place on each cleft a sufficient amount of old lint, and over these apply some powder moistened with wine and oil or vinegar, ensuring it does not become infected.
On the third day, remove all bindings and administer a large flush of warm water or decoction, then treat it with some unguent made from rose oil and others until the wounds are healed.
Capitol .v.
Of the cure for tears using purgatives and other descending remedies from within the head.
When someone experiences continuous and sharp purgatives, and the patient's eyes become weak and small, with their eyelids ulcerated and losing hair, accompanied by a severe headache and extreme exhaustion, then one should know that these symptoms indicate that the purgative substances originate from the sensitive veins within the cranial cavity.
And the best treatment for such cases is this: instruct the patient to press their forehead, and then make a small incision at the center of the forehead, running laterally from the left temple to the right one (starting from the left temple suture and ending at the right), ensuring it penetrates the bone; extend your hand towards the lateral ligaments of the temples which are involved in mastication. Once the bone is exposed,
Dry all the blood with a sponge or a dry cloth, and then fill the space between the two lips of the incision with old cotton wool or linen cloths. Then press down on it with powder mixed with vinegar and oil, to prevent the development of an enclosed abscess.

Capitol .vi.: Chapter 6.
From curing what falls into the ears."
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Certainly! Here is my translation of the given sentence: And then place some pieces of cloth or wool in the ear canal, and gently stretch out the ear flaps (pinna), as these conditions are often forgotten due to such causes.
And if it is not retracted (i.e., the pinna), then use an instrument called a 'gesti epicicarios' for extraction, which has this form:" [Here, a description or illustration of the instrument would be provided.]
If it cannot be extracted with the 'gesti', then proceed to use a thin hook with minimal curvature for extraction.
And if that fails, make a small metal cannula and insert the tip into the ear canal, sealing around it with wax and softened oil to ensure only the cannula is exposed. Then extract it with strong suction (e.g., using your mouth), as such cases have been described earlier.
But if it is still not extracted, take a bright silver coin or a similar metal object that has been used to capture birds (e.g., with a small amount of fat), place it on the end of a rod, and then wrap this assembly in cloth appropriately. And then gently insert [the medicated substance] into the canal of the ear, and remove moisture from the ear.
And so if none of these causes are forgotten [and considered], then you proceed to cut away that which has become an abscess or spasm.
The way of cutting away [the abscess or spasm] is to first bleed the patient from the cephalic vein and extract blood according to their virtue, then make that area stop bleeding between your hands, turning the ear toward the parted areas above it; ending with a small slit at the root of the ear below what was pressed by your grasp. And if the slit is of lunar shape and reaches bone, then you chisel away that bone once it has turned [black], using appropriate instruments; subsequently sew up the slit quickly, curing it until it heals.
And if the cause falls in the ear as one of those greasy things that grow and become inflamed, then administer to its cure and extraction; but if it does not obey your efforts at this [extraction], then you take thin soft wax shaped like so: And administer to him the excision of that grain which has fallen into the ear.
And do not do this when you think that it has already been moistened by the vapor of the ear; instead, break it into small pieces and then extract them with your fingernails or with gentle gestures, or through incision as we have said, for its extraction is alleviated.
Moreover, when water has entered the ear, causing the patient to sneeze at first, fill their ear with some old cotton, and wipe that ear in which there is water; if it is still forgotten, then good; otherwise, take thin sticks of juniper or pine according to the length of your finger, heat them a little over the fire, and the patient should insert one of those into the hole of their ear and jump on one foot from that side and hit with a stone against the stick which is inside the ear. Therefore, do not stop this until all the water has been removed.
Therefore, do not stop this until all the water has been removed. And once the water has been removed in such a way that you take a piece of paper or cloth and place one end inside the ear while extending its other end over the fire until it is burned for the most part.
And place another sponge and do this multiple times until all the water is expelled, then remove that with a cannula as previously mentioned about extracting stones.
When extracting a foreign object that has entered through the ear canal, if it is a small object, push it further in and remove it as we mentioned earlier regarding dividing objects; but if it is a large object causing an abscess in the ear, then manage its extraction with twists and turns, and this cause is less severe than other causes leading to ear problems.
In the extraction of worms born in the ear, when you treat it with what we mentioned earlier in the division and in the treatise on distillations, and if your treatment does not work, then you must observe the ear in the sunlight.
And so, if any cause of the worms appears here, then extract them with subtle twists or turns; but if no cause is apparent, take a cannula and place a narrow end inside while keeping the wide end outside, this being the shape of it:" (likely referring to drawing out the worm) Insert the narrow end into the ear according to the extent that the patient can endure; then apply a strong suction with your mouth and do this multiple times until all the worms are expelled.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And for your effusion, in which you pour medicinal oils into the ear with this instrument, here is its form: Make it from silver or brass, narrow, with a small hole in the middle, and flat on top.
And it should be as long as what fits in the cavity of the channel that contains it, according to what is necessary. If you wish, take the rod and wrap wax around its end appropriately, then pour oil into the cavity of the implement or juice from some herb, or whatever medicine from these that you want in the channel - which is inside the ear -, and then insert the rod with the wax at its top and squeeze it gently with your hand until the oil is expelled into the cavity and the patient feels the oil within.
What goes in the ear should be lightly scorched with fire beforehand. Make sure the cause you are dripping into the ear is not too cold, as these ear medicines cannot withstand that.
It seems this text ends with Chapter 7 indicated by "Capitol .vii.". Would you like me to translate any other part of the text?
De curacio de opilacio de aurelhas."
Here is my translation of the text:
E aquela que accideys en le preon de lu, la qual no comprehen le vezement, es en las majors disposicios de dificil sanacio.
And in the one where you have successfully completed the procedure, it is necessary that you place the patient's ear towards the sun and look into it. And so if you see any swelling present, open it with a thin spatula which has this shape:" (At this point the author may have inserted an illustration.)
If the end of it is small in width, with one side sharp and the other not, and the spatula has two longitudinal edges to avoid causing harm to the ear.
And if the swelling is due to flesh growing in the ear or its canal, then take some thin scissors and cut it open vigorously until all the flesh is exposed.
If the swelling is in the rim of the ear, then take a thin and pointed rod and warm it over fire slightly, and then insert this into the canal of the ear.
And so if you have detected the swelling with something that the patient hears easily due to its weight, apply pressure to it with ease; and be careful not to touch the nerves of the ear.
Under the ear, place a bandage of the second type with an amount equal to the width of the wound you have covered in Egyptian ointment. Do this for several days until you are sure the wound is healing well or take some cotton and immerse it in water then sprinkle on it finely ground starch and use that; but if you see that your ear has become gangrenous, then dig out the pus and replace with another type of poultice made from cerate oil while gently pressing upon the abscess until it bursts. And finally, cure him so that he is healed.
If there is bleeding, then quickly soak the dressing or bandage in cold water and place it on the ear; use another cure that will stem the blood flow described in the 'treatise of distillation.'
Chapter 8:
The cure for the infection that occurs on the eyelids.
Infections of the eyelids that sometimes become moist and at other times are dry.
Thus, you should have those infections at the sides of your face or ears and divide them with a spatula into their roots; then place them finely ground on the affected areas.
But if pain from a blood flux occurs, then you cauterize those areas with a subtle lancet-like cautery.
And the best cauterization method is when those incisions and punctures are carefully returned to their original position after removing any cause of their occurrence; and when they are cauterized with fire, those roots or causes are burned away and will not return.
It seems you have provided another section from the medieval medical treatise, which I am happy to translate for you:
Cure for the great swelling that occurs in the eyelids of children.
When small specks are found on the eyelids of children due to some cause resembling great strength and hardness, it is therefore called a 'great swelling'.
And this is an accumulation of dense moisture above and below the eyelid.
Therefore, the operation for them is as follows: if the swelling is not limited to the eyelid but extends to other parts of their body and it is soft everywhere; and its cause is considered light.
Make an incision across its width and then remove it from all sides with ease, lifting it up and cutting it off.
And if the shape is large, you adjust it with stitches; treat it until it heals.
And if it is small, you will not suffer any harm from it as its ointment restores it and promotes healing.
Here is my attempt at translating the provided text:
And then proceed with the incision, wash the wound with salty water; and treat the area with ointment until it heals.
Here is my best attempt at translating the text:
De la cura axcirnah en la palpebra desus del huel.
Axcirnath is a serious condition caused by growths in the eyelids' lining, mainly affecting children, which strains their eyes and leads to frequent coughing fits; they cannot withstand sunlight because of this, as tears stream down their faces.
And so you should make them wear glasses over their eyes all the time, and when they sleep as well; keep their eyelids moist under the eyebrows, which are already covered in inflammation, and there is an apparent threat of a burst vessel in the eye; also, whenever you press the area with your fingers, you can feel a pulsation within.
A surgical method involves having the patient rest their head on your lap and covering them with a cloth, then drawing a circle around it proportional to the size of an artichoke leaf, pressing down all along its circumference so that blood accumulates in the middle, and finally making an incision at the centre of this moist spot using a lancet to slice open the skin but not too deeply, similar to what is done during phlebotomy.
You must open the vein completely until you reach the vessel, as in its deepest parts there is always a clot according to the whiteness of the incision's shape.
Donc extratz aquella am draps los quals tu as envolopatz entre les tieus ditz a las partidas deforo e revolv entre la ma dextra e sinistre entro que sia dispargut.
And be careful not to tighten in the wound, lest you touch the bone with the spatula and worsen his condition.
However, if your artery does not appear at the beginning of the wound, but you find a small one near it that is easily accessible, then proceed to extract it as we have previously mentioned; and then soak some cloth in water and vinegar and place them on the affected area, pressing down firmly.
And ensure that you do not place any salt there, lest it worsen the moisture within the wound.
Then treat him until he is healed.
However, if an infected ulcer occurs in the area, treat it with frequent poultices until it is healed.
It seems you have provided another excerpt from this medieval medical treatise. Please provide me with the text and I will translate it for you.
On the methods of handling bones.
When hairs grow on the eyelids due to old age or because they have been burnt, causing discomfort to the eyes and leading to excessive tears, soft eyelids, and even destruction of the eye, which is called 'tactinir del huel' (I assume this means 'eye inflammation'), it can be treated in four ways: by cauterization with fire; by using sharp medicine as mentioned earlier in the chapter on cautery; by performing an incision and suturing to remove the hairs; or through the use of cannulas, which I will explain further.
Here is my attempt at translating the provided text:
Certainly! Here is the translation of your source sentence:
May it be that the shape is determined by the amount of elevation of the eyelid, for this already varies among people, as there are those who require a large incision on their eyelids according to the quantity needed to soften the eyelid.
Then make an incision along the two lines you have marked, starting from the larger tear duct towards the smaller one. And if your incision near the natural hairs is as wide as your thumb.
Then place the onion at one of the two ends of the suture, and then remove its outer layer completely. Adjust the stitching to tighten both lips with thread or fine woolen yarn, wipe away any blood, and use a few pieces of adhesive plaster over the eyebrows with some glue if you wish to do so, but it is not necessary.
Then remove the thread suture within three or four days and take care of it.
If you wish, leave the plaster without a suture and treat it with drying and contracting agents, as the eyelid is elevated due to the sealing of the plaster and its adhesion; however, stitching is better, and so say the ancient physicians.
But still, there is concern for the patient's condition, and it is a good course of action, without causing any fear in him.
Another method of examination is to look for the presence of something like a myrtle leaf shape on the eyelid. Then lift the eyelid with three separate but grouped hooks following this formation:
If obtaining the hooks is not feasible and this is not considered harmful, take a needle with thread, place it in the middle of the aforementioned figure, pass one end through the larger lacrimal, the other near the smaller lacrimal, adjust both threads equally between your fingers, then use these to lift your hand at an equal height, lifting the entire chain as described above.
Then adjust the two lips of the wound with stitches, treat what is inside until it heals.
But if an abscess occurs due to your incision or tear, you should drain that abscess with wax and similar materials, and use ointments.
And sometimes, on the eyelid, its hairs turn inward, in which case you must use what we have already mentioned regarding incision; however, stitching is more artificial in any case.
Ataxinir am cannas es segon aquesta forma: And it is necessary that you turn the eyelid and split the figure within as I have described; then, by art, make two thin tubes or sticks whose length matches the length of the eyelid, and their width should be less than the width of your thumb. And you have already split the ends of each part where you have inserted the threads.
Then add each thin thread over the superfluous parts of the eyelid and constrict the tubes from both sides with a strong force; leave it like this for some days, because the nerves will die due to the constriction and will be denied blood circulation so that they may fall off by themselves.
But if it takes too long, then break it with tweezers; afterwards cure the wound until it is healed.
Once it has solidified, the eyelid will be raised, and the hairs won't stick out.
And this is how you will make two tubes according to the above-mentioned method: The length and width must not be more or less than the required amount.
Here is my best attempt at translating each line of your provided text into English, maintaining the same format as you requested:
When raising the hairy skin with a needle when it is hard.
When the hairs are unnatural, hard, rough and prickly on the scalp, then the operation for it is that you take a fine needle and place it in some soft cedar or lion's fat, and then adjust its ends very carefully. And let the length of the threads be in quantity as much as one palm [length].
Then compose another soft thread underneath it shortly, and twist the ends of that if you wish.
Then have the patient put their head in your lap, and be close to the sunlight so that your work is clear, for it is a delicate and fine operation.
Then introduce the needle into the root of the adjusted hair that requires ingenuity, and make it penetrate the eyelid quickly while you extract it from the natural hair.
Then pull the hair out from above and place it in a safe place; let there be one or two or three hairs, but not more.
And then draw your hand towards that place where the hair has grown out of the eyelid with something foreign in it along with the natural hair.
But if you pull out the foreign object and the hair is not pulled along with it, then extract the foreign body from its surroundings using the needle that you have prepared for this purpose until you do manage to remove the said foreign object.
And then cover that area with a plaster (bandage) after you have removed the foreign object and extracted it using the needle; press hard on the eye when doing so until all its contents are released, and leave the eye closed for two or three days while the hair re-grows in the natural place of origin.
If the hair is shorter, then you should take a long artificial hair and attach it to one of the natural hairs; elevate this (the foreign object), or leave it where it is until it grows out over time before removing it.
I am unsure what you mean by "Capitol xiii". Could you please clarify your question?  Is there another part of the text that you would like me to translate or explain?
Regarding the treatment of a boil that appears on the eyelid."
When there is swelling in the eyelid and it becomes contracted, either on the right or left side, due to poor consolidation of a wound, incision, or cauterization, this condition is called "leporina." This type of eyelid contraction can be natural or accidental, arising from poor healing of wounds, incisions, or cauterizations, or resembling these conditions.
The method of performing the operation on the patient is as follows: make an incision in that area where there was poor consolidation, separate the edges or lips of the wound, place a piece of linen cloth between them, and secure it until they heal together.
It is not advisable to use treatments that dry out or constrict the wound, as this can cause a relapse of the swelling and make it worse than before.
Apply to the affected area remedies that have a softening effect, such as fenugreek. Prepare a mixture by soaking marshmallow root and flax seeds in water, or use a softened unguent called "diaphlegmatic," which can be liquefied with any oil. Immerse the cloth in this preparation and use it for treatment.
The key to your successful treatment is to ensure that you perforate any unhealed areas, following the original shape or form of the wound at its onset.
And this operation which we have mentioned is nothing but a slight correction of the helicexachrati (possibly referring to a type of surgical procedure), which does not restore the shape of the place as described before.
Chapter 14:
On the treatment of helicexachrati, which is performed on the eyelid below.
This type of helicexachrati surgery performed on the lower eyelid is properly called "alxacrati"; it can be either naturally occurring or caused by an accident.
Accidental cases may occur due to trauma, such as a blow or cut, by using a cauterizing tool, or through similar means.
The procedure for this operation is as follows: take a needle with double thread and insert it into the flesh, passing it from the left tear duct to the right one, ensuring that the thread reaches both ends of the flesh.
Then stretch out the flesh at both ends away from the needle and sew it with the needle, making wide incisions. And so the eyelid will return to its original shape if it is suitable; otherwise, take a blade and place it in the split form, using it to turn the eyelid back, creating two fissures on the side of the lower eyelid.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
E aquesta figura es letra grega: la landa.
And then remove that amount of flesh which is as wide as his thumb beneath him; this corresponds to the eyelid.
Then, adjust the separated parts and sew them with woolen thread; after that, apply the softening medications and poultices we mentioned earlier until they are healed.
If you have to cut there by incision or suture with a cauterizing iron, then make an even and smooth incision on the skin of the eyelid as described before. Then separate the poultice between the two lips, as we have mentioned earlier.
In the conclusion of this treatise on curing wounds, whether they are above or below the operation site, their treatment is arranged according to the manner in which they heal and these can be diverse.
And the skilled practitioner always devises means by which he can restore the injured body to its natural shape or something close to it and this malady requires an operation with appropriate instruments under optimal conditions.
The number fifteen, indicating that this is the fifteenth chapter of the treatise.
Of the adherence of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or to the cornea.
When this consolidation occurs in many men, so that the eyelid is stuck to the white of the eye and is prohibited from easily moving and performing its natural functions, it is necessary for you to insert the tip of a needle under the eyelid and lift it up or extend it with your thumb.
Then you should cut the adherence with a fine spatula, which should not be too sharp to avoid any incisions, being slightly blunt so as not to disturb the patient during the operation, and handle the spatula carefully to prevent it from damaging the eye with its sharpness.
And your incision should result in the excision of that adherence with ease, allowing for the return of the eyelid to its natural shape and healing all the adhesion.
Then, you should put some saltwater into the eye to wash it or distill into it some zinc dissolved in water.
Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with lint, place on the eye wool infused in egg white, and after three days use some consolidating substances until it is healed.
Certainly, here is my attempt at translating your provided text line by line into English:
De inscizio de ungla e de eminencia de carn dels lacrimals.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Under both species (of this disease) it does not begin except from the greater lacrimal, where it goes little by little covering the sight and prohibiting light and eye movement.
The way to proceed with the incision is for the patient to lean their head onto your lap, then open their eyes and lift the eyelid with your hand. Take a fingernail with a piece of cloth and extend it to cover the upper part. Then take a needle and insert into it a horsehair or cow/ox hair or something similar, or a strong thread, duplicate the end of the needle little by little and place it in the middle of the fingernail, pierce with the needle and tie the nail with thread; extend to cover the upper part, and remove with the hair the side of the nail that covers the pupil. And so you would cut it with the hair behind him/her.
Then you will incise the remainder at the root of the lacrimal with a delicate spatula or small scissors, leaving the flesh of the lacrimal intact to avoid continuous flowing tears after incision.
And sometimes the nail has its sole once extended or with bile, as we have said, then it is scraped with a lion's spatule which is shaped like this:
Make sure that you do not touch the corneal tunic with the spatula, and that it does not cause a rupture, ensuring that the pupil is not perforated.
Then place a small amount of crushed salt or vinegar-soaked gauze into the wound, leave it there until the next day, and treat it with an appropriate remedy to ensure it heals properly.
If the nail is not sensitive and you cannot insert the needle into it, or if it is not embedded in there already, then this particular type of nail condition can be treated with medicine. It will heal as I have previously explained in the section on divisions.
And if you wish to incise it, then open the wound of the patient and take a fine lion's spatula with a sharpened edge according to this form: with delicacy. If you find that it is softened and confined with rust, then apply to the wound some of your own urine mixed with vinegar-soaked gauze or with pure alum or crushed salt, leave the wound overnight.
And then repeat the operation by removing everything that is infected or damaged in him, but do not touch the abscess if it is still enclosed under the skin; instead, wait until you see its beginning and cure the abscess while it is still in this early stage.
And then repeat your operation on that area with caution until it is completely healed.
If the bulging of the tear duct causes great harm, it should be suspended using a string (or thread); make an incision in that area from one side only, and do not extend the cut too far to avoid cutting into the tears ducts.
And then, apply a mild distillation of rosewater and wash the eye until it is healed.
The number "xvii" in this context likely represents the chapter or section of the medieval medical treatise, indicating that this is the seventeenth part or topic being discussed. It serves as a structural marker to organize the content into different chapters or sections for easier reference and navigation within the treatise.
Regarding the incision of abscesses and the removal of flesh that has become infected in the wound:
Some wounds in the eyes may develop fleshy growths that cover the pupil partially or entirely and press against the eyelids, causing them to swell and become tight at the outer corners, resembling a banister's railing.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Here is the translation of the provided text:
When the incision is complete and all that flesh has been cut away, fill up the wound with powdered salt or distil into it powder of roasted roots and substances similar to those of corrosive medicines, and spread upon the wound from without as much egg white as will suffice for securing the wound closed.
And if there remains any cause for concern because of some inflammation and the blood appears to be infected, and you fear an abscess may arise, then open up the wound and treat that abscess with whatever will cure it, and thereafter repeat the operation on this [patient] until he is healed; similarly do regarding the adjusted flesh which occurs in the wound of this type.
However, you should know that any healing of the groin wound must be done by nature or accident, not with iron, and you shouldn't put your hand in any of these operations until you see that the member is able to bear such an operation.
Chapter 18.
On the collection of pus in the wound.
Pus is formed from the tissues and roots which are hardened on top of the wound and prevent its cure, and it impedes the healing of the wound over many days.
Therefore, it is necessary at the beginning to consider if the wound in which he is wounded is strong and there is no other disease in him, then you collect that (wound).
And you should instruct the patient to place their head in your lap, then suspend those veins with an ounce or two according to your discretion. And let that ounce be of fine cloth, made like this:
Here are two ounces greatly in one body according to this form:"
And then those veins should be gently gathered with subtle forceps, with care and precision, and wipe away the blood as you go, until you see those veins being emptied of their contents and are thoroughly cleansed.
Make sure you do not let the contents of the veins drip onto the patient's extremities or the spine; and if your operation is performed in midday under the sun, be very careful during the procedure to only incise those specific veins.
And when you have finished, then you shall distill the contents into a clear or red vessel so that with its sharpness it may corrode what has been extracted from the blood.
But if it is not possible for you to gather everything at that time, then apply a plaster made with what soothes his pain, and let him rest for a few days until his pain subsides and any suppurating wounds are healed.
Then repeat the procedure on him in the same manner until he is healed.
I apologize, I am unable to determine what you mean by "E aquesta es la forma de las forfexs". Please clarify your request so that I may provide an accurate response. It appears to be in the same language as the previous text but is missing context. Could you provide more details or ask another question related to it?
It seems like you provided a partial translation of the text, with only some phrases translated into English. Would you like me to continue translating the remaining sentences or provide further clarification about any specific part of this medieval medical treatise?
On reducing a dislocation of the nose.
When you treat a dislocation with cautery or acute caustic medicine and it is not preceded by the narration of its occurrence (i.e., the patient did not narrate when the injury happened), then do not become angry but instead open up the abscess to allow for its maturation, extracting all the moisture from it until the bone becomes visible.
And when the bone is exposed and you see corruption or discoloration on it, then you must scrape it with an instrument of this shape:
It is called an asper cap, and it should be made of iron. The head should be rounded like a nut, and it must be punctured with fine file marks or else smoothed with a chisel, as follows:
Place the instrument on the corrupted bone, and then turn it around in the described areas while pressing your hand gradually until you know that the corruption has been scraped off.
And this should be done several times, and then restore the area with drying and astringent agents.
Therefore, if the wound is consolidated, new healthy flesh has grown in, and the body is separated from the illness, remaining like this for forty days without any renewal or inflammation, then you know it is healed.
And if not, it is necessary to reduce the fissure to the shape of the nose and do so in this manner: you must uncover the bone either with an iron instrument or with acute medicine. And once the bone is uncovered, take this tribe according to its form:
Let the extremity of the iron be triangular, and its handle should be thin at first, extending towards the end like this.
Then place the instrument over the bone, which should be near the lacrimal bone; stretch your hand a little bit outwardly and then turn your hand with the tribe until it penetrates all of the bones. The patient will feel this when they pull their hands back due to the pain.
Therefore, restore the area with drying and astringent medicines as you have been taught.
Therefore, when the flesh and the area have hardened, then the matter which overflowed to the outer parts returns into the nose, so this is lighter for the patient.
It seems that you may be referencing a specific chapter or section of a book. Could you provide more context or details about this chapter number? Is it related to the medieval medical treatise we were discussing earlier?
I have considered several possibilities, but I was unable to find a definitive translation for this phrase in the context of medieval medical terminology or texts.
When the wound appears complete and there is no damage or reduction in the anus, it is appropriate to let go of the patient, then follow them up, and then place vents on their neck without scarification or suction for good evacuation; and then apply a liniment made with acacia, aloe, incense, and tragacanth over the wound, and then fasten the poultice firmly onto the wound with lots of powder.
The way to make the powder is by taking lion's skin cloths in pieces, each cloth duplicated into four folds; and make those bits.
Then place these pieces one on top of the other according to the amount that the wound requires. Then secure over these with a hard cloth firmly; and repeat the vents with suction without scarification, and then remove the vents and let the wound remain open day and night.
But if meanwhile the ligament becomes softened, it is appropriate to be more tight.
Then remove the bandage during the day and night as we have said.
And if you see the wound already reduced, well, and if not, then repeat the poultice with the powder and the binding and the vents until it is healed.
Chapter 21.
Regarding the incision of the prominence of the uveal tunic (or iris).
When there is a rupture in the uveal tunic (iris), and it becomes prominent like a grape stem with its stalk protruding outwards and forming a human figure, if you want to operate on this condition, proceed as follows: insert the needle into the root of the iris at the lower part towards the upper part, then place another needle from the side of the lacrimal gland with double thread attached. Allow one needle to penetrate while withdrawing the first; cut the site of the double thread and lift up the section of the iris along the circle formed by the needle, tying off the end securely.
Remove the needle, place it over a swab infused with hen's egg white, allowing the thread to soak up the substance and deliver it to the iris (uvea).
Then treat this with something that comforts and heals the affected area until it is cured.
And on some occasions (you will) surround the entire area with a circular piece of cloth over which is placed a large, prominent grain; this should be perforated with a fine spatula that reaches up to the surface layer of the eye, allowing white fluid to run out. The grain should then be removed promptly.
And then ensure that he is healed.
Chapter 22.
De curacio de alconati.
Aquesta malautia que es apelada alconati no es sino sania la qual es ajustada en le huel semblant a aygua dessendent e no es aquella.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And if it does not go down further, know that it is water.
But if the descent to health is not prepared as we have said, then make the patient lie down between your hands; then take fine sponge and place it on a linen cloth near the continuation of the conjunctiva with the cornea in the crown (towards the root), while the wound is forgotten about.
Once the wound is forgotten about (i.e., healed), then you may apply to it a distilled water in which you have mixed honey or an infused water with boiled fenugreek and honey.
And then, it is treated with the other known causes until it is healed.
It seems that this was the 22nd chapter of your medieval medical treatise. Is there another passage you would like me to translate?
On the treatment of water descending from the brain."
Sure! Here's my translation of the text you provided:
Now make sure that you position the patient between your arms on a stool and bind his waist tightly.
Then place your left hand near the patient's left eyelid if it is from there that the water comes out or use your right hand if the eye on the right side is affected.
Then take the cotton with your right hand if it is from the left eye that the water comes out or use your left hand if the discharge is from the right eye.
Now place the tip of the cotton near the edge for its thickness in the white part of the eye on the side of the smallest tear duct and then remove it with dexterity by turning your hand to that side.
Next, penetrate the white part of the eye and feel that the cotton has already reached due to resistance.
Ensure that the length of cotton you have introduced is equal to the distance between the pupil and the end of the black part, which corresponds to the edge of the eye; this way, with your other eye, you will be able to see through the clarity of the cornea the pupil of the affected eye.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And then rest for a moment; therefore, if the water has descended, you must remove that other one before an egg is thrown.
And when it is dry and does not descend, you must extract the egg easily, turn it with your hand little by little, then dissolve a bit of clear gem salt in the water and wash the wound inside; afterwards put out the end of the wound or cotton stopple or wool infused in rose oil and egg white, and tie up the wound with this.
May we and those of our time put on that raw onion with egg white.
And if you do not obey the egg to enter the wound because of its hardness -- for there are men whose wounds are very hard -- then take the spatula which is called *alberid*, and it has this form:
And so you will pierce with it that joint, but do not finish your hand in the hole, and there is nothing else except to make a way for the egg to enter gently.
And then introduce the egg as we have said.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And note its nature for it is delicate, and do not touch the top of his head on either the right or left side at all.
And it will be bandaged according to its position by the third day.
Then untie him from that dark place and bring him into the open air; let him see some things, and then re-bandage him by the seventh day.
And it is not necessary to do this during the hour of treatment, or soon after the infusion. Later, it is necessary to avoid this due to the ease with which water may pass too quickly through him, given his weakened state.
But if an abscess occurs suddenly, it is necessary to untie him before the seventh day and treat that which causes the abscess.
Then cover his eyes with a cloth and place a glass over the eye through which he can see; let him rest for some days in a dark place.
Then gradually move them out of the dark space, allowing them to talk about what they see.
And know that for the student, the vision of blood is not exempted from fear at first sight, and therefore you should be bold in operation.
We have heard from some of those who practice the Art of Surgery, and one said that they made fire in the armpit without piercing it by sucking out water.
But I have never seen anyone in our land who has perfected this technique, nor is it written about in any of the ancient books; it's possible that this method is new.
These are the ways of practicing sucking, for those who wish to learn this technique:
Whether they are made of horn or iron, and whether their ends are tapered or pointed, the acute end is always sharp.
It seems that this indicates a chapter division in the text, specifically Chapter XXIV (24). Is there another portion of the text you would like me to translate or explain?
Regarding the treatment of flesh in the nose:
When different flesh grows in the nose due to a cause resembling a scorpion's sting or a polyp; this ailment is called 'polypus' as it resembles that particular kind of sea creature. And his flesh is cancerous, scaly, of a dark color; and it is not flesh that is yellow but rather of a dark color.
So, for one who has this non-fraudulent and non-cancerous lion flesh (leprosy), you must make the patient sit between your two hands and place him in the sun, open his nose, and pick his scabs on that flesh. Then extract that from the divided parts outside, and with a sharp, thin spatula, separate what you have grasped of that thing from one division to another until you know that all the flesh has been removed; for if there remains in it any cause from which separation is possible, then take that out with one of the fine instruments with ease while there remains no cause. But if it should happen to him with blood or there is an evil abscess, then you must put on it what ought to be; or if it is one of the malignant abscesses, then treat and cauterize that thing so that it may be cut off from the blood and all the cavities may be scraped.
Then, if it has been cut in the nose, then apply vinegar and water or wine. But if the nose is open and you introduce moisture into the palate, then know that it has already healed.
But if the moisture does not penetrate as it should, then you know that inside there is still raw flesh over the highest bones of the nose to which the abrasion has not reached.
Therefore, it is necessary to insert waxed thread into it, of which there should be some thickness, and place several small nuts in it, leaving the length of a finger or less between each nut, then push the patient's nose with the rod or any other instrument that can reach inside.
And when you have done this, pull your excrement inside so that it reaches the nostrils' channels, and let it exit onto your collar, because veiled faces during this action are common among children at school, and it is a light cause for those who want to do it.
Then secure the two ends of the thread, one end hanging over the nose and the other remaining inside it, and then apply a lock of meat to the nuts that are on the thread, doing this until you know that the flesh has reached the nuts on the thread.
Then extract the bile and apply a caustic medicine to the nose, perform bloodletting with a cup for three days or more until the ointment corrupts everything that is rotten in the flesh.
At the end of this procedure, insert a leaden tube into the nose for several days until it is healed.
If you desire quicker healing, use this method.
This is the design of the purging instrument that distills oils and medicines into the nose:
E fay aquo de argent o de eram, la qual sia semblant a una petita lampesa uberta, ayssi cum petita conqua, e le meat semblantment.
Here is the translation of the first source sentence:
Certainly! Here is my attempt at translating each line of the given text into English:
From boils born at the ends of the nose.
Small bumps that are born at the ends of the nose, and it is important to note that these sores can worsen if left untreated for a few days.
And so it is necessary to treat them at the beginning of their appearance, and inherit all that has been advised. Then apply to the affected area either a cautery or medicine that will burn, depending on what is available.
However, if it has been left untreated and has become large, then consider if it is hardened, black in colour, and with little feeling; in which case do not touch it with iron as this is a deep-rooted abscess; those small bumps that you treat on this abscess will cause great harm to whoever it had.
And if the abscess is soft to touch and not black in colour, and you believe incision is possible on it, then evacuate the patient and make an incision without fear; treat the area with something that will constrict it until it is healed.
It seems you have provided me with some further text to translate, could you confirm if this is correct?
When it comes to sewing up the nose and lips or ear, in case continuity is lost due to some ulcer or alike.
Know that when there is discharge of continuity in one of these cartilages, it rarely matters in that operation except for some men.
Thus child, when you encounter any cause of these, consider whether it is a fresh ulcer with its blood, and then adjust the two lips of the wound with suture, and take care that it heals.
And if the lips of the wound are already separated and each is made healthy, then child you should cut off every part of its chain appearing within until no blood comes out. Then adjust the two lips with suture and tighten them, and over them sprinkle dragon's blood and powdered tin, and place a piece of daffynicon cataplasm or any other consolidating plaster on it, and leave that bound for two or three days, then untie it and change the plaster and let it be until scabs form, and finally cure with ointment so that it heals.
Mays la manieyra de la sutura es que tu agregues la solucio de continuitat o am agulhas ayssi cum havem recomtat en la sutura del ventre, o agregua la solucio de continuitat am fiel ayssi cum a tu e fayt saber.
It seems like you've provided me with a series of texts for translation, including the one starting with "Capitol xxvii." Please provide me with all the texts you'd like translated, and I'll be happy to assist!
For the extraction of that cause which comes in the two lips within the gums.
Motas veguadas endeve a motz homes en las partidas dedintz de las suas labias alcus apostemas durs semblantz a gras de errs, e alscunas de lors son mendres e alcunas son majors.
Therefore, it is necessary that you turn the lips and separate each of those hard parts from every direction, then fill the incision with dry sage to constrict the blood flow, and afterwards wash the area with vinegar and treat it with a styptic until it heals.

When dealing with swollen flesh over the gums, which the ancients called 'albulus', it is necessary to suspend that part using a thread or hold it with forceps and make an incision at its base, allowing the blood or pus to flow out until it heals.
Then place dry sage or other styptic/caustic powders on the affected area.
And if that flesh returns, make another incision and cauterize it; the cautery will prevent its recurrence.
Chapter 29: On Fistula in Ano
On the extraction of teeth with an iron instrument.
When on the surface of the separated inner teeth and front teeth and between the gums, rough scabs are formed, some with blisters, and some become blackened while others turn yellow or green, causing corruption in the gum which makes these weak teeth.
And so you must make the patient lie between your arms and place his head on your knee, then scrape off those scabs with a file until nothing but the dentin is left; this procedure eliminates the cause of blackening, yellowness, greenness or other discoloration.
If any of the above is unclear to you, then understand that this procedure applies only when blackening, yellowness and greenness are found at the start of the root; otherwise repeat the treatment on subsequent days until your goal is reached.
Know that teeth have many shapes of roots, varying in form and figure according to their preparation for your operation. And so the tool used to extract an inner tooth is different from that used between teeth. You must prepare these tools in various shapes which will soon be shown.
Chapter 30.
Tooth extraction.
If you cure the tooth of its pain with any tool and delay its extraction entirely, there is no reason that prevents the loss of it when it is extracted, as it is a noble substance among those excused from extraction.
But when the patient is forced to have that tooth extracted, you must be firmly certain which tooth is painful, because many healthy teeth cause pain and deceive the patient, and you extract one of those, but then the pain does not cease until the sick and painful tooth is removed, for we have seen this through facial operations.
So how should you be certain which is the painful tooth and know it well, then you must make an incision in its socket with a spatula that has some edge to it, so that it is separated from the tooth's gum on all sides, and then grab that with your aforementioned tweezers or subtle forceps at the beginning little by little until you extract it.
And then attach to it strong pliers for a good grip or sturdy handle, and place the patient's head between your knees so that you have him well held, and then pull on the tooth according to its shape in such a way that you do not break it nor give the patient any greater pain.
And therefore, if it is not forgotten, then take one of those instruments and place it under them on all sides with ease, and exert force to remove it as was done at the beginning.
But if the tooth is shaken or worn down, you should ensure that you wrap it with a piece of cloth and tighten the ends with a thin cord so that it does not get damaged when you grip it with forceps.
Make sure you carefully perform scarification all around the gums and be mindful of your strength to avoid breaking them and leaving a piece inside; this is because the subsequent pain will be worse than the initial one.
Be aware that you should not do what some ignorant barbers do in their haste and boldness during tooth extraction without administering what we have recommended; for many times, they cause severe illnesses upon men which are more difficult to treat than the initial ailment, with roots left inside or even extracting them along with part of the jaw bone as has been testified by many.
And then, after extracting it, you should rinse the mouth with vinegar or sour wine mixed with salt.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
The shape of the forceps and delicate pincers has its jaws at the beginning with a long thin extremity, short handle and thick, so that they are not bent when you have to act with them.
And there may be times when you have thick handles instead so that they are not bent even with short extremities.
And they are made of Indian iron with straight extremities and at the extremities there are teeth which interlock into each other gripping tightly, or sometimes the extremities have the shape of a bird's beak called a stork that is a kind of gannet and has a strong grip.
It seems you want me to continue translating the medieval medical treatise, but I am unable to determine which part of the text you would like me to translate due to an incomplete sentence at the beginning of your prompt. Please provide a complete section or line for me to translate, and I will do my best to assist you accurately.
On the extraction of teeth and removal of jaw bones that have been fractured.
When you have to extract a tooth that is fractured for any reason, it is necessary that you apply a poultice on the spot with lint until the place becomes soft; then introduce pincers or tongs whose extremities are like the beak of an avian called a stork or gannet, in the shape of forceps:
Let the ends of them be made within as with a file or sponge.
And if they do not obey you with this instruction take these forceps or pincers; but if that does not work either, then you must cut over the vein and strip away all the flesh and insert this instrument which is called an atali, it is a small lever of this shape:
It should be somewhat blunt at one end but small in diameter, and it must not be oiled lest it slip.
So if by this the vein is pierced, it is done; but if not, help yourself with these other instruments whose shapes are as follows: the shape of the first instrument has a triangular end that tapers to some thickness:
The form of the second instrument is that it should be even more pointed and triangular.
And you have already been helped with these instruments, having two levers of which this is the form, followed by the next: And other instruments which I will describe in the removal of teeth, for this operation is performed with an instrument resembling a large ounce and whose shape is thus:
Of the triangular deformed extremity, which is somewhat thick and not bound up lest it should be compressed.
And you must also know that the instruments for extracting teeth are in like manner similar to other instruments.
But the wise and skilled craftsman finds for himself, according to what the operation signifies and from the various diseases which afflict us, the appropriate instruments; because ancient physicians did not prescribe nor provide any specific instruments for the different kinds of ailments.
But if the bone of the jaw or other bones in the mouth are dislocated and you must push them back into place, then be careful to use what is suitable for this among the instruments and forceps we have mentioned for extracting teeth roots; and let someone assist with a tool that has this shape:
And if there is any small swelling that gradually appears and becomes constricted or trapped in the mouth so that it does not desiccate nor escape before the bone has completely perforated, then restore its place with appropriate medicines.
But if there is a slight dislocation in the bone, then cut away that part of the dislocated piece and its blackness; cure it while being careful not to injure anything else.
Sure, here is my translation attempt for each line of the provided text:
Of the cure of teeth, which are more prominent than others.
When teeth are prominent but not according to their natural form and shape, especially in women, and more so in elderly venerable ladies, you must consider: if one tooth is immediately next to another tooth, and it cannot be treated with any medication or lining of it, then extract that tooth; but if it is not attached to another tooth, then you incise that tooth with this instrument which has this shape; it should resemble a pig's tusk and be made of Indian iron with a very sharp point.
And let your incision be such that you incise that tooth over many days because of the hardness of the tooth, and that it does not harm any other teeth.
And if the prominent tooth is exposed to filing, then file it with an Indian iron file of this shape:" (likely referring to an illustration or diagram).
And it should be entirely made of Indian iron and its edge should be sharp; and it should have small points like those on a needle file, with which the tooth can be filed little by little over several days without harming or loosening any other teeth. And then you must clean it thoroughly at the end, and remove any hair with some kind of razor.
And if there is a wound inside [the mouth] and you touch the tongue with it, then you must smooth that area until its roughness is removed and flattened, so that the tongue does not hurt or corrupt speech.
I apologize, but I don't understand your request. Can you please provide more context or clarify what you would like me to do with "Capitol .xxxiii."?
On the restoration of damaged teeth using gold or silver wire.
When there is damage to the front teeth due to concussion and displacement from impact or a fall, and the patient cannot chew properly, you have treated it with astringent medicines, but your treatment has not been effective, then do not use silver wire for fixation as this turns black and will need to be replaced after some days. Gold wire, however, is never altered.
The wire should be of such fineness and thickness that it can fit between the teeth; its shape is such that you take the wire and make it twice as long as the space between two healthy teeth, then you twist both ends of the wire so they reach from one damaged tooth to a healthy one on the other side. And then repeat the procedure by inserting the tissue back into the opening you started with, and press your hand gently with care and wisdom so as not to cause further harm.
And your compression should be such that you squeeze the gallbladder, taking care not to extract its roots or teeth.
Then carefully separate the superfluous extremities of the gallbladder using forceps or scissors, and place them aside with care. Next, convert these and hide them between a healthy tooth and a damaged one to avoid injuring the tongue. And then release it as tight as a bowstring.
If it becomes untied or broken, tighten it again with another gallbladder in such a manner until its time is complete.
This is how the teeth are arranged and the shape of their alignment when two healthy teeth and two damaged ones are tied together:
And when it is done that a tooth or two are returned to their sockets and they regrow as we have described, and they remain healthy.
And do not do this unless you are an expert or wise.
In some cases, a piece of cow bone is adapted and shaped like a tooth; it is placed in the location where the missing tooth should be, tied securely as mentioned earlier, and left to stay there for an extended period.
Chapter 34.
Regarding the incision of the ligament that affects speech, prevent any talking.
This ligament that is attached to the tongue may be either naturally present in some individuals or it could have formed accidentally due to an injury which has already healed.
The operation involves opening the patient's mouth while keeping their head fixed in place; lift up their tongue and carefully incise the nerve ligament along its length until the tongue is released from its enclosure.
If there is any hardness or knot present in the area due to scarring from an old injury, then use a lancet and cut through that scar along its length as you have already cut through the ligament.
And be careful not to make a fissure in the bone, and that you do not cut here through arteries or veins, causing blood flow.
Then wash the traces of the incision with clean water, vinegar or fresh water; and place a piece of linen under their tongue; it is necessary to keep the patient with their mouth open every night so that they do not consolidate again.
But if there is blood flow, place crushed vitriol on the spot; but if the bleeding stops, then cauterize the area with a cautery iron suitable for this case. Then cure him with other remedies until he is healed.
I'm sorry, I don't understand your request. Could you please rephrase or provide more context?
On the extraction of a ranula under the tongue.
Sometimes, under the tongue, small blisters occur that are similar to ulcers, hindering the tongue's natural movement and causing great swelling within the mouth.
The treatment for this is to open the patient's mouth sixty degrees facing the sun and examine the blisters.
If you observe that the blisters are dark or black in colour, hard and insensitive to touch for the patient, then do not disturb them.
If they turn white and become moist, indicating suppuration, then place your thumb on them and make an incision with a fine-pointed instrument, dividing it into several parts; if blood comes out during the procedure, apply powdered gypsum or vitriol to stop the bleeding.
Then return to the initial treatment by applying a dressing of vinegar and salt; continue this alternate therapy with water until it is completely healed.
It seems that you may have forgotten something from your previous request! Could you kindly provide me the text to translate?
On the extraction of abscesses from both ears, or one that is located in the neck, as well as other abscesses.
When there is an issue in the throat area, these are glands that are swollen and appear outside, known as two ears. When you treat them with what we've discussed earlier in the division and it doesn't heal, then consider if the abscess is hard, dark-colored, and has little sensitivity; in such a case, do not touch it with an iron instrument.
And if it is of red color and the root is thick, then do not touch it with an iron instrument due to the flow of blood; instead, let it mature on its own, and later either you will cut it or it will break by itself.
And if it is of white color, soft, and its root is delicate, then it must be incised.
Before performing the operation on the patient, you must consider whether the abscess has already reached its full development or if it has diminished in any way. Then, expose the patient to sunlight and place their head under your shade; open their mouth, and have an assistant hold their tongue with a noble instrument of this shape: [describe the instrument's shape].
It is made of silver or steel and it must be as thin as a knife's edge.
Therefore, when you press their tongue and the abscess is shown to you, grab it with your instrument (vezement), then take hold of it and place it in the amnion, and pull it out as much as you can. Here is another cause of the disease that arises from the membranes; now make an incision in it with this tool, which has the following shape:
Here is another cause of the disease that arises from the membranes; now make an incision in it with this tool, which has the following shape: It is assembled like a forceps, but its ends are curved so that the hole of each one is in line with the other, very sharp, and made of iron.
If this tool is not available to you, make an incision with this spatulate instrument, which has the following shape: It is pointed on one side and blunt on the other.
And once you have incised one wound, incision the other in the same way, and then let the patient heal with cold water.
But if it bleeds, heal with decoction water from pomegranate rind or myrtle leaves and similar astringent causes until the bleeding stops, then treat it so that it heals.

Here is my attempt at translating the provided text into English:
And the abscess had grown so large that it now has two roots through which pus is discharged.
I treated it surgically by making an incision into one of its roots and extracting the object; a large portion was pulled out along with it. Then I made another incision in the area from which the other root emanated, after that I forced open the abscess's mouth and compressed his tongue inside. Finally, I placed a sponge into this abscess.
And after cutting out a large portion of it, there was only a small amount of blood flowing from the wound. So the woman's wound is now completely healed and she begins to drink water and eat again. I continued to make incisions in the abscess many times over a long period of time, until eventually another abscess appeared where the first one had been. I kept making incisions into this new growth as it prolonged.
Then I brought some burning hot iron and cauterized the wound, after that I left and walked away not knowing what God had in store for me.
It appears that you are referencing a specific chapter or section of a book or manuscript, as "capitol" often refers to a chapter in Latin. Could you provide more context so I can better assist with your translation?
De inscizio de huvela quan es apostemada."

Here is my best attempt at translating the text into English:
E quan tu vezes aquela segon la manieyra que yeu he dita de la sua blancor e longuesa:
And you must not cut into it beyond what is naturally appropriate without any addition, because if you cut deeper, you will take away his ability to speak.
Then for the incision, use what we have previously measured in a two-fold manner during the incision, and ensure it heals properly.
If the patient is scared of the incision process, you must employ skill and caution in cauterizing him without causing fear. The way to use the cautery on him should only involve hot water; place his head in your lap, then press his tongue with the instrument we mentioned earlier, then take the water described previously in the chapter on cauterization, mix it with a live coal, and fill the hollow of this instrument, which has such a shape:
The tip of the hollow part where the medicine is placed should be like that of a spoon with a rounded bowl; place the instrument with the medicine on his tongue, and have the patient lean onto his side so he may spit out any saliva or mucus from his mouth due to this intrinsic medicine, so as not to allow anything to descend through his throat.
And then place your hand on the medicine and squeeze it onto the uvula for a quarter of an hour until it becomes discolored and soothed by the action of the medicine.
And if you wish, take a cork and wrap it around the end of the tube, then dip the cork in the medicine and insert the tube with the cork into a sheath for as long as necessary until you achieve the desired cauterization of the grape, and after that let it be three or four days before removing it.
And if you need to repeat the application of medicine, do so and after the cauterization process clean around the grape with a cork soaked in wine, modify it with whatever is in the vicinity of the medicine, wash it with warm water and treat externally with an ointment or cream, and internally with mouth rinses until it heals.
And this kind of treatment is more effective than incision, yet longer to fear.
Some patients are cured of the uvula with something more subtle than cauterization and incision, as it is healed by subfumigation in this manner: Take cumin, hyssop, oregano, rue, Arabic incense, chamomile, broccoli and similar herbs, mix all or some of these ingredients together into a bowl, cover them with vinegar and boil; the bowl should be well sealed with appropriate wax and have an opening in its center upon which is placed an instrument like so: made of silver or brass.
Understood! Here is my translation attempt for your provided Latin-like text into English line by line:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
But if you do not have this instrument present, then take a reed and attach to its end an egg-shaped cover, so that the patient's mouth is covered, for the eggshell prevents steam from burning their mouth.
And this treatment is beneficial to health.
This may refer to the chapter number, indicating that it is the thirty-eighth chapter of a book or treatise. The use of Roman numerals for numbering chapters was common in medieval texts. Is there another sentence or paragraph you would like me to translate?
On the extraction of thorns, objects sticking in the throat, and other such causes.
Visible specks adhering in the throat, fish bones, or any other cause.
Therefore, it is necessary to extract what is visible, on which the sight falls; for you press the tongue with an instrument before the sun so that what is in the throat may be made clear.
And for that which is not visible and hidden in the throat, it is necessary to make the patient vomit before food is digested in the stomach; for often the cause attached to the throat may be forgotten by vomiting; or have the patient swallow a piece of bread crust, or the stalk of a lettuce leaf, or a lump of dry bread; or take a piece of dried sea sponge and tie it strongly with bile (gall), then have the patient swallow that, for when it reaches the place where thorns are extracted, they will be forgotten. And now take an eel and extract its gallbladder tied up, and put it inside and immediately extract it; or take a leek and immediately insert it and immediately remove it.
But if you have not forgotten those causes that we have mentioned, then use a leaden instrument in this shape:
And even if it is slightly thicker than a finger, at its end there should be a cavity that you can easily insert into their mouth.
And let the top of it be elevated above (the rest), and make sure that it does not touch their throat bone, so that you do not damage either the neck or the spine with it, or that the doctor touches it with his hand.
But if the patient can insert it better themselves, due to their knowledge of the location of the cause and its depth, and push it down, then let them take your hand on the instrument above until they are ready according to how much is needed, without forgetting.
It seems like you are referring to Chapter 39 of this medieval medical treatise. Is there anything specific within this chapter that you would like me to translate or explain further?
De extraccio de sancguisugua annexsa al golayro.
When the bloodsucking worm is used as medicine for what we have mentioned in the section on treatment with medicines and not manual therapy, then look at the patient's throat under sunlight since you have pressed their tongue down using the instrument we recommended to you.
Therefore, when you see the bloodsucking worm, remove it with a small pair of forceps or with delicate fingers in an appropriate manner.
And if it is not possible for you to extract it [the bloodsucking worm], then take a concave cannula and insert it into the patient's throat, place an ignited iron rod in the cavity of the cannula, and do this several times until the sanguisuga dies and comes out from the throat. Make sure that the patient abstains from water throughout the day.
Then take a vessel full of cold water and place their mouth over it, wash the patient's mouth with this water; make sure they do not swallow any of that water but rather pour out the water an hour later using your hand because as soon as the sanguisuga senses the water, it will die.
But if you do not forget what we have recommended, then fumigate the patient with incense or asafetida using the instrument which we recommended for fumigating the throat.

Chapter 40.
In which is the summary of this discourse regarding the treatment of abscesses and their incision.
Abscesses are special marks, of various shapes, depending on their origin; each one is discussed in this book.
They are different in their incision and opening due to two methods: one is specific to the type of abscess itself, and another based on the humidity it contains.
The second method is based on the location of the abscess in the body, as an abscess on the head differs from one on the buttocks, and another on fleshy areas unlike those on joints. Each has its own treatment procedure.
And there are some abscesses which should not be pierced, but rather wait for the maturation and drainage of the pus within them.
Other abscesses need to be drained when they are severe and not yet matured according to their size, such as abscesses that are close to joints, for an abscess near a joint prolongs the illness; because if you touch what is in its vicinity, the ligaments or nerves of that joint may become corrupted, which causes contraction of that limb. Or it might be an abscess next to a main organ, and if you delay perforation until maturation, it could damage the main organ. Or it is near the anus, so drain the unmatured one; and do not pierce it when it is raw and undigested, but rather the one that is close to the anus, so as not to press its core and prolong what is inside the anus, resulting in a fistula or something happening within the rectum which has not healed. It is important for you to know the right time for piercing an abscess, which is when it has matured.
Understand that it has matured when there is a cessation of pain and fever, along with a decrease in swelling and pulse rate, and the head of the abscess becomes pointed, as well as other signs.
And when you know that the infection has descended into a deeper location below the abscess and from there comes the discharge of pus during treatment for inflammation.
Whether the infection pierces through the length of flesh or body parts, be it on limbs or feet, and in places such as joints, nerve cords, sinews; also, ultimately, anywhere where there is no reflection (of light); for in those areas that do reflect (light), use perforation according to that limb.
But when the abscess is in a fleshy area, it's better to delay its perforation until its digestion has been confirmed according to what we've said above; for if you were to pierce it before that time, the poor body's course would be prolonged and most likely filled with filth, and its edges hardened and depth increased.
Yet some abscesses must be pierced according to the breadth of flesh or body part involved due to necessity, or in accordance with whatever that limb requires.
And make sure to administer a small piercing for small abscesses, large piercings or wide incisions for larger ones according to the diversity of their size.
And for other abscesses, in which it is necessary that the incision be concave and it is made thus, when it is done in such a way that it already stands out, just like one that occurs in lots of people with boils and scrofula."
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And on them (the cauterization points), a circular and crescent-shaped section is applied, similar to those.
But for those who do not have any such abscesses or lion-like superficial boils, you should only make a shallow surface puncture.
And when the abscess is large and has gathered a lot of pus, puncture it without hesitation and do not be afraid to extract all the foul matter at that moment; first remove part of it, then apply a cloth soaked in oil on top of the abscess the following day, and after this draw out more, and so repeat these steps several times until it is completely discharged.
Especially if the patient is a young child, or a pregnant woman, or an infant, or an elderly person in poor health, as often their animal spirit (vital force) is weakened by the discharge of pus and the disease may easily take them; so you should operate on them.
Take great care when considering this chapter and during the puncture of these abscesses; cleanse the wounds carefully and consider whether the wound is small or flat-shaped, then apply either leeches or slugs as required; if the abscess is large and there are many fissures from the incision then place a cloth over every opening to prevent them from joining together.
Under the abscess, if you cut a part of the cord or have hollowed it in the circle, then make sure to cover this with an old piece of cloth or some thread made from linen fabric, just as when you treat wounds or stitches without any humidity; fasten that after three days; and continue treatment by curing it with something for inflammation until it is healed.
If there is a flow of blood during your operation, administer warm water and vinegar on some linen fabric, then place this over the bleeding site multiple times.
If the bleeding continues, you should administer treatment and healing powders which I have recommended in multiple places of this very book and chapter.
If it is wintertime and the site of abscess is located near many nerves, then make sure to cover this with powder mixed in wine and boiled oil, and place that over these areas.
If it is summertime and the sites are fleshy, then place powder mixed in water and oil or wine and oil over these, and ensure to wash this thrice daily as we have said earlier, and thereafter open the abscess, clean it and administer treatment with what is suitable for healing until it is cured.
E aysso es aquo que es necessari de la cognicio de la curacio de apostemas universalment, mays segon la via de distinccio ja he dit de tot apostema en qual manieyra es via de la cura de lu per capitols singularment.
Certainly! Here is my attempt at translating the text you provided:
Of the incision of abscesses which appear on the nape of the neck.
On the nape of the neck are small abscesses, which are like nodules and contain thin membranes; their types vary.
They have heads, from which flows a liquid similar to lime juice. Some contain pus-like liquid, others resemble them; while some are stony hard.
When cutting them all open and extracting their contents, there is no fear; you must be careful not to damage the surrounding skin.
The operation to cut them open is done with an instrument of your choice that you find suitable; this is called a lancet, knowing what it contains.
If what is contained within is liquid, then make an incision along its length with this shallow cut following the shape of the nodule:
Start the incision at point B along to point G. Once the liquid is evacuated, scrape away the skin that contained it, leaving nothing behind, for any remaining cause will return.
Certainly! Here's a translation of the provided sentence:
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text into English:
And if there is an abscess with fatty lumps, then you must cut it open in this manner: If the incision has a cross-like shape, place your thumbs between the two lips of the incision and tear it along its entire length, and apply all your strength in removing the abscess from its lining.
But if the wound becomes irritated or inflamed, then follow what I suggested earlier.
Similarly, proceed with the treatment of an abscess that has formed a hard shell in this manner and perform the incision as previously described; however, be more gentle when making the incision on such abscesses because they contain less blood and fluid.
Sometimes there are some abscesses that form on the head of certain men with little to no fluid inside; this is because I once made an incision on an abscess on an elderly woman's head and found within it a hard, rough, white stone-like object which could not be broken, but if it were struck by anything, it would cause pain.
But in other abscesses that form on the head, this phenomenon does not occur as it does with the abscess described above, such as those that appear on children's heads or behind their ears; however, the incision for all of these should be made superficially.
And make an incision on those of the lower part of their body, in order to relieve the sick person's pain in the lowest parts.
Then treat those with what is appropriate for their healing process.
This appears to be a chapter number, which would indicate that the text you provided may be part of a larger work or series of treatises. Is there any specific information you'd like me to extract from this text? Perhaps you want me to continue translating it line by line or provide more context about its content and structure.
Regarding the excision of scrofula, which occurs in the neck."
Motas veguadas endeveno aquestas apostemas en le colh e en las aysselhas e en les angonars; e alcunas veguadas accideyso en las autras partidas del cos.
E so aquellas que accideysso en le colh, e so motas que so engendradas entre lor, e tota scrofula de aquellas es dintz la sua tunica propria, e ayssi cum en les nodis e apostema del cap, ayssi cum havem recomtat.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Therefore, in that case where you observe good placement during the touch (examination), and the color of what is evident is similar to the color of the tumor, and it is bad smelling throughout, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck nor to the veins or arteries, and is not deep, then it is appropriate for you to make an incision on that area with a dry superficial probe from above (the tumor) down below (to) the body's midline between line G. and line B., and remove all of its parts, and extract two lips of the tumour either to an ounce or several ounces if necessary, as we have said for abscesses in the head, and draw out that tumor little by little.
And it is with great caution that one should not incise the vein or nerve.
And if the tumour is not sharp enough for you to place your hand over the incision (site), or it disturbs the patient, and one incises what should not be incised; for if one were to incise a vein or artery and prevent oneself from operating further, then apply on the wound powdered sulphuric acid (or) other powders that block the flow of blood, compress the wound, and leave until such time as the abscess' sharpness has diminished and softened the wound so it begins becoming porous. When the blood is severed.
So return to your operation before you have completed it.
Then examine your finger with the small index to see if any cause of the other small sores is broken; therefore, open those and clean them.
And if it is in the root of the large sore vein, you must not then open that sore with its root. Make sure you hold it with a strong folded cloth, and that you release it until it falls by itself without harm.
Then fill the wound with old cotton that you have already dipped in Egyptian ointment, and then cure it.
And if you open that sore entirely, make sure that you adjust the two lips of the wound and cross them so that there is no superfluity remaining.
But if you see that there is superfluity remaining due to the size of the sore, it's necessary for you to understand that you must open its root, remove it, and apply a suture as said.
Certainly! Here is the translation of the first source sentence:
And then proceed with a perforation, apply ointments and similar substances to it, so that they may erode the part corrupted by putrefaction. And when you see the plague already cleaned, then cure it with an ointment made from generative flesh until it is healed.
The number 'xliii' in Latin numbers corresponds to the cardinal number 43, so this is probably indicating the forty-third chapter of the treatise. Is there any other text that you would like me to translate?
Regarding the incision of the apex of an accidental abscess in the throat." Do you have any other medieval medical texts that need translating?
The ancients said this incision was made at the apex, but I have not seen anyone in our land who has had it done." It seems this medical procedure is rare or perhaps even unheard of in their region. Are there any other interesting historical texts you'd like to explore?
And this is the inscription on their tombstone." Here, it seems they might be referring to an epitaph or some kind of memorial text. The previous line suggests these are ancient medical practitioners, so perhaps this treatise includes accounts from historical figures and their practices. Is there any specific aspect of this text you'd like further insight into?
When it comes to people with scurvy, one should avoid extracting the apex, as all their veins and major arteries are here." This line suggests that the medical procedure described earlier is considered risky for patients suffering from scurvy due to the proximity of vital vessels. It also hints at some basic understanding of human anatomy during this period. Do you want me to continue translating or provide more context on any specific part of the text?
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Therefore, when we want to do this, let us incise the epiglottis below three circles of its rings or four with small sections in latitude at what lies between two rings in quantity, such that the section should be made on bone marrow and not cartilage; and this place is appropriate for section since it lacks flesh and blood vessels are far from there.
And if the doctor is timid, then he should extend the cord of the bowstring with his fingers and make an incision into the channel, but avoid any blood vessels that may be in its way.
Then incise the folds as we have described before, and it is meant by section of the channel with a flame which came out of what has been cut and by the loss of voice.
And leave the wound open for some time.
When the hour is considered appropriate for perforation, join together both lips of the wound's cord and sew it up only as far as cartilage.
Then administer medicines that promote flesh formation until it is healed.

Therefore, I was confessed that she had not cut a vein nor arteries, and the wind came out of the wound, and I cured her before it was healed.
And the servant was not harmed, only hoarse in her voice, and after some days she returned to improve her condition.
And now I say that in the section of the appendix, there is no fear.
It seems that this text refers to specific chapters or sections within a larger work, possibly a medical book or treatise. "Chapter .xliv" likely indicates Chapter 44 in modern numbering.
Regarding the incision over an abscess that occurs outside the groin area, it is called a groin hernia.
This abscess called a groin hernia is a large abscess according to the body's constitution, and it occurs mostly in females.
And it happens in two ways, either naturally or accidentally.
In the natural case, it is not easy to cure.
The accidental hernia occurs in two ways; one resembles fatty lumps, and the other way is similar to an abscess caused by arterial blockage. In this case, there is fear. And one should not use force with them (the patient) unless they are young. You examine it and investigate it, and if you find it similar to a fatty tumor, and it is not suspended by any veins, then you cut into it like the nodes, and extract from it whatever contains its contents such as hair and pus; otherwise, thoroughly check its entire being, and then treat the area with appropriate medications until it heals.
The number 'xlv' in Roman numerals is equivalent to 45. It seems you provided me with a chapter or section title, which I am unable to interpret without further context. If you have additional information or text related to this chapter, feel free to provide it, and I can assist with translation or interpretation.
On the section of different types of nodules.
There are many varieties of nodules, and I have already mentioned all their types in the division (section).
And it is necessary that I recount here the difference between a nodule and an excrescence to dispel any doubt.
Therefore, I say that an excrescence has the qualities of heat, fever, and intense pain as long as there is a boiling up of excess humor; and it is a full state of putrefaction where, once the fever ceases, so does the pain and heat.
However, if there is no heat or fever but only a cough, then consider that this may be a disease of the lungs.
And according to the color of the body's complexion, and its onset is like that of a fever, whether it be strong or mild, there are two types: either it is fatty and contains moisture, and the colors of this moisture vary greatly as I mentioned in the division.
Therefore, when you reach the treatment of a cough, first examine it and inquire about its nature from the beginning with an instrument called a "intrames", according to which its form will be presented in the following chapter.
And this is the method of inquiry for abscesses and all diseases: you should take this instrument (intromes) and insert it into the moist part, which you find in the abscess, and slowly turn your words with it until you know that the instrument has penetrated deeply.
Then close your hand according to the size of the abscess and remove the intrames; observe what has come out in its trail.
And if the running moisture is forgotten (i.e., not taken out), no matter what its color may be, then you should incise it with a superficial cut as I have said for other abscesses.
If there is no humidity in the wound's discharge, then you know it is fat tissue.
Dry it over him by making an incision in the shape of a cross, according to this form: As I have taught you, suspend him from the incision and remove the sinew from all parts easily, preserving the skin or sack if possible over it and extracting that fat with the knot.
But if it is torn during the operation and you cannot extract that fat intact, often you must remove it in pieces so as to leave nothing of it behind.
For if even the smallest amount is left behind, the knot will return as before.
And if you wish to ensure that even the smallest part is not left behind, complete the wound with some sharp corrosive powder and bind it up, and place on that which has become a fistula a caustic plaster, healing him by another treatment until he is healed.
And if the knot is large, then you must sew its two lips together and cure him with that which causes flesh to grow.

The method of introducing enemas is as follows:
This is the method for introducing suppositories:
If it is iron or galbanum, of the cold extremes suitably prepared, they will speed up the action of the suppository when applied to abscesses.
These are the forms of enema, which are named after Albertus Magnus, and one of them is called 'Beroaldus'.
They consist of three spices, two of which are in large quantities and one in small.
The method for preparing the large enema is as follows:
The way of making emetics is as follows:
This is how to prepare the small enema:
They [the enemas] are appropriate for abscesses, ulcers, fistulae, and boils caused by various origins.
They [enema bags] are made round and large like a lion's head, with thick needles such as those used to sew leather pouches; they may be made of citrus wood or of clay, iron, or silver, but the best ones are made from citrus wood.

The ends of these scalpels that are used for cutting are sharp, while the other ends are not. They are designed this way to prevent accidentally cutting a vein or nerve during the scraping of nodules, ensuring patient safety and comfort. This approach facilitates healing and provides some relief by reducing inflammation associated with abscesses.

However, it's not entirely clear what "aquells" refers to in this sentence. Do you have any additional information or context that could help clarify the meaning?
The forms of cupping glasses, with which the flow of blood is stopped, come in three sizes; large, medium, and small; their shapes are as follows:
They are made of waxed citron skins, round with some length to them, and they are thin." It seems that the text describes medical tools or materials used in a medieval context. "Waxed citron skins" might refer to a type of bandage or wrapping material. Would you like me to continue translating this treatise?
Here is the translation of your first source sentence:
When it comes to cutting flesh or blood vessels all over the body, avoid doing so on bony areas like those of the legs and thighs; instead, choose fleshy regions such as the arms, chest, armpits, stomach, elbows, breasts, and similar parts with soft skin folds.
Some other times these procedures are performed with smaller instruments resembling small knives or scalpels designed in this way; they are used to cut blood vessels during phlebotomy or when incising veins and arteries.
On certain occasions, these instruments are made with circular blades shaped like this; they are employed for bloodletting or vein incisions as well.

Regarding the perforation of abscesses that arise from the boil.
These abscesses that develop from boils are of the type called scrofula, hard and containing a kernel which is like pus.
And for those that contain moisture, some of which should be incised with a crescent-shaped cut following this figure: from point G to point B. Once the pus within the abscess is evacuated, you then fill it with old linen and leave it open until the next day.
Then have this linen be changed and treated with appropriate ointment until it is healed.
And if the abscess is of the type called 'nodes' or 'scrofula', then you should incise it in the same way we described for treating scrofula.
If the plague has spread so that there is redness, then apply cauterization as we have mentioned before.
Capitols .xlviii.
De seccio de apostemas que accideysso per arceria o per vena.
When the artery is ruptured and the vein above it has become hardened (occluded), there will be many signs of inflammation and abscess formation: first, if an abscess arises from a rupture in the artery, then it forms right over the heart; also, when you press on this abscess with your fingers, you will feel a sibilant noise or hissing sound.
And that which occurs due to the vein appears circular around the area of the heart.
Incision over this abscess is an error and should be avoided, especially in those places where the flesh is softer such as the armpits, groins, neck and other fleshy parts of the body; also, if it is very large then its treatment with iron (a knife) should be avoided, but for an abscess on the extremities or head, one must avoid touching it.
Make an incision over that which is caused by the inflammation of the orifice of the artery on the vein and then open the section in its length; now open this with hooks (forceps), expose the artery so it can be seen, and strip off its surrounding sheaths.
And place a needle over this and make it penetrate to the other side; stretch out the artery with two double ligatures (thread made of animal gut), as you would when extracting two arteries which are in the temples.
And then stab the place which is between two ligaments with a spatula so that the blood in it is drained, and let the abscess be dissolved.
Then provide treatment for the condition where pus is generated as the ligaments fall apart; and then treat it with appropriate ointments suitable for this until it is healed.
If there is an abscess due to the cutting of a vein, then you must have your hand as close as possible to the abscess with a string, and then insert the needle under the place that you had under your hand, and make it penetrate; let its thread be doubled so that when you remove it from the other side, tie the abscess with a suture like I told you in Chapter 4 with two parts of two ends of the thread.
But if you are afraid of pulling out the thread, then insert another wire with that needle under the entire abscess until the incision of the first needle; and pull your wires in four places.
Then dry the abscess in its middle so that when what is inside it comes out, then you cut the excess of the string, and leave tied what belongs to it.
Then place a poultice on them, which you have submerged in wine and oil, and then apply the treatment made with herbs and ointments until they are healed.
Chapter 1: The abscess that occurs due to nerve inflammation.
Here is the first sentence translated into English:
And make a bandage in the areas of helpers or talus, or any place where the joints are swollen.
And if it is a severe abscess, resembling the colour of the rest of the body, and is in their major arteries, when it has intense strength, the patient feels similar to stupor.
And it is not an abscess that has accumulated in the front of the body, and thus should be left untreated, as it is swollen all over and does not go away with remedies applied either in front or behind.
Therefore, for those with pain in the joints, it is not advisable to use iron instruments, as they would likely cause further contraction.
Make a bandage on the head or forehead, treat it with a spatula. If there is a small abscess, then use the scissors to remove it from its roots.
And if it is large, then suspend it with a thread, peel it off, and then cauterize it; stitch the wound together and treat it until it heals.
Capitol .li.
Of the incision for an abscess that occurs in the stomach.
Attempt to remove moles from some men's bellies and other parts of their bodies which are called fungi due to their resemblance to mushrooms; the roots of these [fungi] are thin while their heads are thick; and already their lips have turned, and one is small, and another is very large.
And I have seen one such man, and in his belly were two parts resembling mushrooms that were larger, and there was no difference between them aside from their white, thin roots.
And the lips of these parts had turned inward and split open, with moisture constantly running from them.
So I incised them and found that one measured eighteen ounces while the other was six.
And the operation for their incision is as follows: if the patient's body is moist and the flesh is white, moist, with thin roots, then you should incise it using a wide spatula, and have cautery in your presence which has been heated over fire, because moles require extensive bloodletting; and when blood stops flowing from the wound, cauterize it.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And then adjust it in the lead wire's tightness. So, do not stop stretching this large piece of lead; until it is cut and falls by itself.
If it is of a large size, then there may be some cause for concern and fear during its removal, especially when it is located in the abdomen.
It is possible that you cut off half of it, and then cauterize the area to prevent its return.
And then treat the wound until it is completely healed.
Be cautious not to assume that you should cut off something that is of a dark color, has little feeling, and appears insubstantial; as it may be cancerous.
And I will come to remind you of this again.
It seems that the text has ended, so I cannot provide another line for translation. Would you like me to summarize the key points of the medieval medical treatise?
On curing protruding navels.
A protruding navel is caused by various factors: fissures in the cartilage above the abdomen or a hernia of the intestine/hernia sac similar to other hernias; it can also be due to bleeding from a vein or artery as previously mentioned, or trapped gas.
Mays si es per fissura del ciphac e per yssiment de la tela, lahoras la color del apostema es semblant a la color del cors; e es leon ses dolor, e aprop appar de divers situament. And if it is due to the hernia's emergence, place him in the position we have described with the greatest care and variety, and as you press where you said he conceals it, then return; and very gently lift him up, but be careful not to strain his intestines too much.
However, if it is due to moisture, then it is not hidden when you press with your hand; nor is it constricted or considered serious.
And if it is due to blood, then these signs will appear: the abscess turns black and fades away.
However, if it is due to flesh, then it will be a severe abscess, thick and hard, and embedded in a certain quantity.
But if it is due to windiness (gas), then touching him will be painless.
And for the operation on him, you must consider this: if the protrusion of the navel is due to arterial blood or venous blood, or windiness (gas), then you should be prohibited from treating him because there is fear and concern, as I have taught you in the chapter where I discussed abscesses caused by arteries and veins.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And if you have uncovered the wound, then take a thread and cut off its excess.
But if it is contrary to your arrow or vein, then surround the knot and return to your operation. Take two needles and put strong threads through them, then insert the two needles into the circle you have made around the abscess in a cross-like manner, making sure they penetrate. Then secure the abscess over the needles into four parts.
And if you wish, remove the needles and let the place be until the flesh dries out and falls off on its own; or cut away that which is thinned and will fall, then treat it with something appropriate for wounds so that it may heal.
And if the prominence of the navel is made of fleshy material or due to moisture, it requires that you hollow out the abscess as we have said and remove the blood or moisture found within it; then treat it with something appropriate for consolidation.
It seems like this text is a medical treatise written in an ancient language, possibly Latin-based. Would you like me to continue translating the rest of it?
On the treatment of headaches.
We have previously stated, in the division of types of pain and how they are treated with medicines, and that it is preferable to avoid treating them with iron instruments so as not to cause ulceration; we have also discussed pain originating from injuries and the cautious approach to their treatment.
The ancient doctors said that there are certain cases where pain can be completely eradicated from the body if it is located in an area where surgery is possible; this includes pain in the breasts or groin and similar areas of the limbs, especially when it starts small.
But when the pain is old and severe, it is not advisable to treat it yourself, as I have never seen such a case nor do I know of any successful treatment for it.
The operation on the patient, as we have mentioned earlier, involves you proceeding with caution and first purging them of black bile in some cases, then bleeding them if an obvious accumulation is found.
Then prepare the patient for surgery by arranging them in a suitable position, and prohibit any unnecessary movement during the procedure; carefully carve with a good, sharp knife, making incisions deep enough to remove all causes of the roots of the pain. Here is the translation of the first source sentence:

Then consider whether the cause of dropsy is from the intestines, in which case you should make an incision away from their navel by three fingers' breadth towards the right, above the pubic bone.
However, if the cause of dropsy is due to kidney disease, then your incision should be made to the left of their navel by three fingers' width.
And if the cause of their condition is bile, then your incision should be made on the right-hand side.
It is important that your incision is not made over the side on which the patient wishes to lie, as this may cause superfluous matter to run into that area.
Then pierce with your instrument the entire length of the incision, insert it into that incision, and lift up your hand with the spatula between the incision and the skin, stripping away any skin in an amount equal to a nail or thereabouts.
Then pierce the skin until you reach the empty space with your spatula, which is where water collects. Then extract it and insert an instrument of this form: It is similar to a slender silver cannula; it is made of silver or eram or leon lathe, at the bottom part there is a small hole and on its sides three holes: two from one side and one from another. Its end is cut in a way that resembles the shape of a pen's nib.
At its uppermost end there is a ring; when the instrument reaches the water, this instantly rises on it, thus evacuating an equal amount of water as long as you do not evacuate more than what fits inside during that time, because if you do, very lightly the patient dies due to dispersion of their vital spirit or they have five faints which announce death.
You evacuate an amount of water according to the quality of the patient and depending on what their condition, pulse and health suggest to you.
Then extract the instrument and retain the water, the reason being that it is immediately retained by the catheter which blocks the hole located above the navel, cut in the manner you were told to make this perforation.
On the following day if the patient tolerates it, reintroduce the instrument and evacuate a small quantity of water; do this for some days out of fear that you might leave too little water inside.
Here is my translation:
And cauterize on the stomach, and the melting [of the tumor] along with the extraction of water, according to what I have recounted in what has preceded.
Chapter 5: This chapter discusses various medical treatments for joint pain and other ailments. It covers the use of cauterization, water extraction, and the importance of proper positioning during procedures. The text provides instructions on how to treat gout, a common condition characterized by joint pain, especially in the feet. It also describes techniques for managing hernias and ensuring patient comfort during examinations or treatments.

Motas veguadas accideys aquest albater en la vergua e es eminencia de carn laga.
And one is malignant while the other is non-malignant.
Apply a thin ointment and cut off the non-malignant part until it is completely removed; then place on it a piece of Egyptian cloth that has been soaked in oil; finally treat it with ointment made from alum, and thereby cure him.
And if the tumor is malignant, with a dark colour, then you must apply a strong cauterization after the incision and before removal.
But if the tumor is on the foreskin of an uncircumcised penis and one part of it is inside the foreskin while the other part is outside, then you must remove the internal tumor at its beginning when it is still consolidated; after that you can treat what's on the outside because when treating both together by removing the foreskin, there is no guarantee that it won't be torn.
And if there is already a dark and wrinkled scar on the eyelids or the foreskin, then you must dig out all that which has been blackened and which intends to putrefy or which has already putrefied; after which apply over it something made of honey, which has been mixed with powder from pomegranate rind as well as pounded and sifted ants.
And then take care of him with the other cure until he is healed.
But if there should be a discharge of blood, then apply a lunar caustic in this manner:
As the caustic is helpful in two conditions together, it is for the discharge of blood and for corrupted wounds.
And if the head of the penis is corrupted and destroyed immediately, you should insert a lead cannula into the prepuce tissue so that the patient urinates through it.
In the case of an adhesion between the foreskin and the head of the penis (and this type of adhesion only occurs in those who have not been circumcised, and it is not required for them; however, when such adhesions occur due to a wound or abscess), you should scrape with a blunt spatula until the attachment is dissolved and the head of the penis is freed from all parts.
And if it is difficult to separate these parts exactly, then you should scrape with a spatula somewhere between the head of the penis and the foreskin; this is because, when the foreskin is thin, it can be pierced slightly due to its thinness.
And then separate the foreskin from the head of the penis using seven very fine threads, which have already been soaked in cold water so that they do not stick together again.
Then treat it with six styptics until it is consolidated.

On the cleansing of children and the cure for those who have accidents after circumcision.
Although circumcision is not a solution for continence like other illnesses, but rather our own operation and willpower, and it is specifically for children, we must assign to it the best possible treatment and the lightest path that leads to health.
Therefore, the ancients did not mention circumcision in any of their books because it was not practiced according to their laws, and it is only something we have acquired through experimentation. The reason for this is that I have found most surgeons and barbers perform circumcisions and cleansing with a novacula (type of razor) and lancets, and they use thread made from sinew for binding and a nail for incision.
Here is my line-by-line translation of the provided text: Here is my translation of the provided text:
Mays en la operacio am ungla, fort leu obazeys ferr e corromp la tua operacio. And the child's scrotum is naturally short, and many times it happens in such a way that there is no need for any modification, and I have seen this myself.
However, the modification that is done with scissors and a thread of linen has proven its goodness through my experience, for the scissors are designed with proportional cutting edges, ensuring that the sharpness above matches the one below; thus, when you press your hand down, two sharp edges work in harmony, incising precisely in one motion; additionally, there's compression applied to the thread, which takes on a shape containing the entire length of the child's penis, and this ensures no mistakes are made.
The first step in the operation is to have the child stay still, especially if he's one of those who understands a little, and you should only tie the thread around his penis lightly without causing any harm; then, let him rest for another day.
Then make the child feel comfortable in every way possible, considering his level of understanding. Have the child stand between your arms while you prepare everything, and ensure there is no sunlight shining on him directly; hide the scissors in your hand or under your arm so that the child doesn't see them or any other instruments.

Therefore, take your instrument and extend it with your nail in front of the abscess in that place, then insert it according to its equality.
And if you cannot hold it with your nail, then extract that instrument with a hook and insert it.
But if three days have passed and there remains what is inflamed under the penis with pus, then you should open it up before the abscess becomes hard, and remove that part easily, cutting it as much as you deem necessary.
And be careful of the head of the penis, for nothing should happen to it.
And then treat it with that which the plague consolidates from the powders, as we have recounted in the treatise on powders.
And if it is cut to an appropriate measure, then follow the directions above, this will not harm him.
And further treat it with that which we have said to heal it.

De curacio de urina retenguda en la vesiqua:
Here is my translation of the text:
And if it is not dissolved with what we have said and the cause on the patient is very strong, then you should administer extraction of it using an instrument called a syringe, which has this form: It should be made of silver and have a fine lead cone, like that of a bird's feather with the length of a ray being about one and a half palms long, and let there be a slender tube at its end.
And the method of extracting urine through this instrument is that you take a doubled thread and tie it at its end with either wool or cotton for a good binding; and insert the ends of the thread beneath the syringe, and use scissors to cut away any superfluous cause of the wool, then insert it into the tube with force. Then immerse the syringe in water and egg white.
And place the patient on a saddle-shaped cushion, and apply moistened oils to their bladder and genitals: olive oil and rose water.
Then carefully insert the syringe with ease until you reach the base of the penis; then bend the penis upwards towards the navel; then push the syringe inside it; and push it in until you reach the bladder, and make sure the patient is aware that the cause of their ailment has been reached, but this is not done according to a set order, rather depending on how tortuous the path.
Then extract bile with wool little by little, because urine is absorbed by wool.
Then remove it and use urine for treatment, using a syringe, do not stop doing this and continue to use the syringe until the bladder is emptied and the patient finds relief once more.

In the beginning, there is a concave space where something is pushed in, and it remains there according to its quantity without addition until some cause draws out the moistures from it, at which point they are drawn out, and when expelled, that thing is also drawn with them; similarly, when removed far away, as happens with a flaming wick used for setting fire to ships at sea.
So, if you want to extract moisture from the bladder, insert the end of the flaming wick into the moisture and draw out that which is pushed inside it by pulling on the wick above; for the moisture is drawn into the concave space of the wick.
Then insert the end of the wick into the penis as we have described in surgical texts and push out the moisture with that which you are pushing it; for this moisture reaches the bladder very quickly, causing great pain to the patient.
The shape of this subtle instrument which is used for catheterisation is as follows:
It should be made of silver or tin, with its upper part being shaped like a small feather; a few holes should be drilled into it.
And then take a bladder of mutton, place inside it the moisture you wish to crystallize in the bladder, and tie that bladder with two strong ligatures made of double catgut, scald that moisture over the fire.
And then insert the end of the crystallizer into the bladder.
Then squeeze your hand over the bladder containing the moisture with sufficient pressure until the patient feels that the desired moisture has arrived in the bladder.
If you do not have a bladder available, take a piece of parchment and fashion it into a circle; perforate this through its entire circumference; insert strong catgut through these holes such that they are wrapped around the circle as if forming a handle; then add to this circle whatever substance you wish from among moistures, odors, and waters.
Then bind this to the instrument as you did with the bladder and express it by hand until moisture arrives in the bladder.
It seems that you have provided me with a chapter number, which is Chapter 60 (*Capitulum lx*). Would you like me to translate the entire chapter for you? Please provide me with the full text in order for me to do so!
De extraccio de peyra."
Nos ja havem dit en la divisio las specias de peyra e curacio de lu am medicinas..."
We have mentioned the stone (lithotomy) which requires a lot of skill and precision in its operation.
The stone that is formed within the bladder itself is called a bladder stone.
I am just giving you an explicit explanation and summary of it.
So I say that the stone formed in the bladder mostly affects children; and its signs are that the urine excreted from the bladder is similar to water in its subtlety, and appears sandy; and the patient scratches their genitals, often cries out in pain, and it is severe; and with this, many have had their anus ruptured.
It is rare for children of that age to recover from this condition, and it is a difficult cure for the elderly. In young people, it is somewhat easier to treat because their bodies are still developing.
And for someone with a large stone, the cure is more straightforward; if it's small, the opposite is true.
So when we come to the cure of this condition, it is necessary at the beginning to change the patient's diet by making them eat things that cleanse their intestines; because sometimes this intestinal issue hinders the expulsion of the stone.
And then take the patient's legs and bend them and push them downwards, so that the stone descends into the bottom of the bladder or jumps out on its own a few times.
Then make the patient stop between your legs which are under his thighs, and their hands should be placed on top of theirs for the bladder to completely slope downwards.
And now pull that one out along with all of them outwards from you.
If you feel the stone in that space, then cut it out right away.
And if it doesn't come out completely with your touch, you should anoint the first finger of your left hand with oil (the second one in case the patient is a grown man), and insert that into their anus. Then pull out the stone with your finger as soon as you feel it. And turn that little by little towards the neck of the bladder.
Then push on it with your finger and expel that outwards from the place where you cut him.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And then introduce a spatula with this incision instrument, which has this shape: Make an incision in the area between the anus and the genitals, but not directly in the middle; rather, lean towards the left side of the groin. The incision should be made over that stone and your finger should be placed inside the anus. Make a transverse cut so that the outer part is wide, and narrow on the inside according to how much you can extract from that stone without any difficulty. Be careful not to go too deep with your finger as it may cause pain or injury.
Note that some stones have sharp angles or edges, making their extraction difficult due to this aspect.
And for those that resemble glands or are round in shape, their removal is relatively easier.
If it has sharp edges or angles, position it in the narrow opening (fissure) to facilitate its removal.
If you cannot extract it easily, then cover it with a tool and use your fingers to apply moderate pressure on it. The end of the tool should be similar to a file, which you can rub against the stone without causing damage. Alternatively, introduce a curved instrument underneath.
But if you cannot do that, then slightly extend the cut and if you see blood flowing, stop it with powdered vitriol.
But if there is more than one stone, then initially guide your hand into the bladder and make an incision over it; then push a little piece of it out; and do likewise if there are more than two stones.
And if the stone is very large, it is best to avoid making a big incision on it, as this can lead to one of two outcomes for the patient: either death or continuous discharge of urine, which happens because the wound has not fully healed.
But remove the stone if it is left behind, or use forceps to fracture and extract it in pieces.
Once you have completed the operation, fill the wound with juice from Aloe Vera and dragon's blood resin, then close it tightly. Place over it a cloth soaked in oil and wine, or in rose oil and water, to ensure that the infection does not develop.
And then turn the patient onto their back, and do not remove the bindings for three days.
And when you have unbound him, bathe the area with water and oil, then treat it daily with ointments of alum and sulfur until he is healed.
But if there is a cold, cauterizing and corrosive abscess occurs in the plague, resembling when blood is frozen in the bladder, and because of this urination is prohibited (and it is known by the discharge of blood with urine), therefore insert your finger into the wound and extract that blood, for if it remains it provokes the bladder to corruption of the bladder itself and putrefaction.
Then wash the wound with vinegar, water, and salt, and apply whatever remedies you see fit for his healing until he is cured.
Cover during all hours of treatment both the patient's thighs, securing the medicines that are applied to the affected area.
And if the stone is small and located in the urethra, having entered there, and urination is prohibited, then treat it with what I previously recommended to prevent cutting [the stone out], for procedures obscured by this treatment are accused of cutting; and now I expect you have acquired this, which is that you take an iron perforator, of which this is the form...
Of triangular extremity, sharp, embedded in wood.
Then take some thread and tie it to the rod that is placed under the stone so that it does not return to the bladder.
Then introduce the iron rod into the bladder by piercing it with ease until you reach that stone. And with your hand turn the piercing instrument on that stone little by little until you make it go through to the other side; for urine has been evacuated at this time.
Then press your hand on what is rough of the stone outside of the bladder because it has been cracked and filled with urine; therefore the patient is healed.
But if this healing procedure is not available to you for any reason that prohibits its use on it, then tie a thread under the stone and another thread over the stone. Then cut into the bladder through that iron rod between two bindings. And then pull it out. And then untie the ligature and clean the congealed blood found in the wound.
It is not necessary to leave the catheter in place; instead, it should be placed below the stone so that when the catheter is removed, the urethral orifice will close and prevent urine from flowing back into the bladder. The other ligature should be above this because as soon as the catheter is withdrawn, the cord retracts into its original position and seals the wound.
And for this reason, when you tie the catheter above, it is necessary that you lift the cord to its uppermost position; otherwise, it must return to its original state and seal the wound as we have described.
It seems that you have provided me with chapter 61 of this medical treatise. Is there any other information I can extract from it or any specific line you would like me to translate? Feel free to provide more context if needed!
On the extraction of stones from females."
Peyra en las femnas pauc es engendrada." translates to "Stones in women are rarely formed.
Mays si ve peyra ad alcuna de aquellas, lahoras dificil es la curacio de lu, e es prohibida per tropas manieyras." translates to "But if you see stones in any of these women, their cure is difficult and forbidden by various methods.
La una de lor es quar la femna fort leu es verges." translates to "One of them is because the woman is too young and a virgin.
E la segonda es quar tu no trobas femna be scient que descroba si meteyssa al metge quan es casta, o es de las femnas haventz maritz." translates to "And the second is that you do not find a woman who knows how to explain this matter well to the doctor if she is chaste or one of those women who have husbands.
La tersa es quar tu no hatrobas femna be sabent aquesta art, majorment la operacio am ma." translates to "The third is that you do not find a woman who knows this art well, especially the operation with the hand.
E la quarta es que·l loc de la seccio sobre peyra en las femnas es longinc del loc de la peyra, per que indigeys de seccio preonda, e en aquella es temor." translates to "And the fourth is that the place of the section for stones in women is far from the stone's location; there are dangers with any premature section, and there is fear regarding it.
But if necessity calls for it, then you should seek out a female doctor who is well-versed in this knowledge, and they are hard to find.
If you are unable to find such a person, then look for an experienced and skilled male doctor, or present the case to a knowledgeable female midwife, or a woman who is particularly adept in this field of medicine.
Thus make that presentation and instruct them to do as you command, starting with an inquiry about the stone; this is to ensure if the woman is a virgin, so they must insert their finger into her rectum and feel for any stones.
If you find it (the stone), have them remove their finger from her, then instruct them to make an incision over the area.
But if she is not a virgin, then direct the midwife to insert their finger into the patient's vagina and feel for any stones, while placing their left hand on her bladder and pressing firmly.
If the stone is found, then gently extract it from the bladder's opening down to where it branches off below with as little damage as possible until you reach its root in the groin.
E aprop inscida sobre aquella apposicio de la maytat del conh deves la razit de la coyssa de qualque part sia a lu parada e cent la peyra en aquella partida, e·l dit de lu no sia remaugut de la peyra coartan dejos lu.
And let the cut be small at first; then insert the rod into that cut, and if you feel the stone, adjust the cut according to the amount by which you know the stone will come out.
And know that the types of stones are many: some are small and large, smooth and rough, long and round, and have roots.
Therefore, you should know the different types of stones according to what I have described above.
If you see any bleeding, apply powdered vitriol to the area and hold it there for an hour until the blood has stopped, then resume your operation so that the stone is removed.
And ensure that you have prepared for yourself the instruments which I mentioned in my writing about stone extraction in men, so that you may be aided by them during your operation.
If you see bleeding and know that the discharge of blood is from an artery that has been cut, then place some powder on the area and bind it tightly with a cloth or bandage without re-tightening; leave the stone alone and do not extract it, for if you do so, the patient will surely die. And then treat the plague.
Therefore, when the sharpness of the wound has subsided after some days, and the area is healed, you can return to your operation before the stone is forgotten.
Chapter 62: In this matter it happens often that in one day there appears another fistula, from which stones come out little by little, as if the first had opened some passages for them.
On operation for strangulated hernia.
Strangulated hernia is nothing but an accumulation of moisture in the white membrane which lies below the scrotum, and it is called 'ciphac'.
And sometimes it is in the very fat of the belly which nature has prepared for the formation of another testicle (for there are men who have two), and this is the cord of the testicle between the white membrane we mentioned, and it is nothing but a cyst.
The cause of this hernia is the weakness that occurs in testicles, because for those it spreads such matter, and sometimes it happens due to a blow received on the testicles.
And this humidity has many colors; for its color is shifting to yellow or bloody red, or rust-colored, or it's blackish and feculent, or watery white, and this latter one is most serious.
The signs by which this accumulation of water is known are these: if it's in the white of the eye we spoke of before, then the aposteme is round and slightly elongated, like an egg shape; and when pus appears as moisture all over.
And if the humidity is in the proper fatty tissue of it, then the aposteme is round with a part divided off from the egg, and so one can judge that it's another egg.
And if the humidity is between the membrane of the pus and the white of the eye, then it measures less than a centimetre.
And as you want the knowledge of the color of the humidity, then probe the color of the humidity in the aposteme with a little stick whose form precedes it; and according to what is seen in the trace of the little stick, judge what is inside it.
Therefore, when we proceed to the treatment of the patient with iron [illness], it is necessary that we command the patient to undergo bloodletting if this is possible for you, and empty their body fully.
Then place him on his back over some kind of elevated surface, and cover them with many sheets.
Then sit on the patient's left side and instruct the assistant to stand at their right, who will extend their arms in two directions: one towards the patient's genitals and the other towards the navel.
Then take a broad spatula and separate the patient's genitals from their navel with a longitudinal incision, not very deep.
And the incision should be made according to the recipe at an equal distance from the line that divides the hair of the genitals and reaches as far as the white membrane.
Flay it, and observe, ensuring that you do not cut the membrane; your flaying should be divided into two parts, with each one suspended on its own thread, then examine them as closely as possible according to their quantity.
And then pierce the sac full of water with a wide perforation, and extract all the water.
And then separate between the two lips of the section with hooks, stretch the sac to its edges; do not touch the region of the genitals, and incise the sac in such a way that it is possible for you. And incise it with its totality or in pieces, especially its delicate side, for if you do not examine the incision meticulously, there is no guarantee that the water will not return.
However, if the womb proceeds from that region outside its place during your operation, then when you have completed the incision of the sac, return it inside again and adjust the two lips of the genital region with sutures; then treat this wound like any other until it is healed.
And if the womb is corrupted due to another illness, then it is necessary for you to tie the vessels that are above the perineum and remove the womb; then treat this as previously mentioned.
But if the water is divided into two separate compartments, then you know that these are hernias; therefore, incise this compartment as you have done in the other instance; and if it appears to you that it must be a surgical operation, then do so.
Here is the translation of the provided text and your source sentence:
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And sometimes this hernia is treated artificially with cautery instead of surgery; take a fine cutthroat knife as a cauterizing instrument and make an incision in the groin area, and set it alight according to what we have recommended while keeping the white ciphac containing water uncovered. Then take your cautery tool that looks like this: It is assembled in a Greek letter shape.
And then pierce through that ciphac, it is ignited until all moisture has evaporated.
Then extend the ciphac with hooks, and carefully scrape it with hooks, then finely cauterize it while ignited; make an incision as deep as you can to eradicate all of it; be careful not to let the fire touch the flesh.
Know that this operation is safer and further away from the risk of blood loss, and better than surgery.
If you encounter an abscess during surgery or cauterization, or experience bleeding, you must address this complication and treat it accordingly as described.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
Now you should make the patient lie down on a slightly elevated surface, then pierce the abscess in its lowest part with a flat knife, and make an incision as long as his body.
And if the opening is wide enough so that all the pus flows out.
Then place cotton and lint on the spot, leaving them there for all the remaining pus to drain. And then take care of it until the wound is healed.
But if there is any obstruction to the discharge of pus at that moment when you make the incision: and this is not done except because the white fat in the wound's orifice creates an obstacle, and prevents the evacuation of the pus, then you must put into the wound a feather or some instrument with which ear wax is removed; whose shape has been described previously; or place over the opening of the wound a small.
And know that the pus returns and persists for about six months or so; and when it increases again, then it must be pierced in the same manner as before, because thus the patient will spend his days.
Capitol .lxiii.:
De seccio sobre hernia carnosa e la curacio de lu.
Certainly! Here is the translation of your source text:
And I remember the operation and the types of ointments for abscesses.
So, I say that abscesses are born in places where the humors are composed and it is done for many causes: either due to acute acute excess, which overflows into the humours, or by percussion.
And it is the colour of the abscess that matches the colour of the body, and there is no pain associated with it, then it is a severe abscess.
And very rarely is the abscess calcified, which has a dark colour, and there is no feeling in it.
And sometimes it happens due to the blockage of arteries, and due to the inflammation of those that have already been noticed, or by the inflammation of veins.
What is due to the inflammation of arteries is known for the dispersion of the abscess when you press it with your fingers; and one must not touch it.
But the one that is caused by inflammation of veins is not dispersed by any means due to compression with your fingers.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Therefore, if the wound is already treated with these poultices, it should be uncovered and the ointment applied.
And if there is an adhesion due to any cause within the hip joint or between what lies among the vessels, it should be released and removed by making a circular incision.
However, if there is a birth of flesh in the place where the adhesion was located at the back, it should be removed along with all that belongs to it, and the wound should be cleaned as mentioned before.
Once your operation is complete, fill the wound with a piece of wool soaked in rose oil and wine, and then treat it with another appropriate healing ointment until it is fully healed.
This indicates that this information may be part of a larger work or treatise, specifically Chapter 64. It provides context to the reader, indicating that there might be other chapters or sections within this medical text.
On treating an inguinal hernia."
Vit is an abscess enveloped by some swelling that resembles a bud with softened testicles, and it makes exercising difficult as well as walking for the patient.
And in the treatment of this illness, there is fear due to which it is preceded by memory recall.
However, let us say that the operation takes place in the second stage when it was first performed.
I say that the patient needs to be laid down on an elevated table; then remove the supporter of the testicles from below them; and you will have the chain of genitals with your said assistants at the penis' base; and have those other ministers, and stretch them vigorously.
Then incise with a thin sharp spatula for cross-sectioning on the right of the vessels until those vessels are exposed.
And then excise all the parts as I have told you in an extraction of arches which are found at the temples.
Then place in those a needle with a double thread and tie it at the first of these places where you find the abscess, and then another time at its rear end. And then make an incision in that place at the mid-point along a straight line following the length of the body, and remove what has accumulated from putrid and corrupted moistures.
Then cure the plague with a cure that involves applying it to other wounds where healing needs to be encouraged through widening blood vessels, which is not harmful.
However, if it happens that all the vessels are affected, then remove the testicles or cause them to dry up by cutting off the vessels, so they are deprived of all nourishment due to incision of the vessels and are rendered useless, or become dried out, such that they provide no benefit.
It seems you may have provided an incomplete prompt; please provide more context to assist me in translating it accurately. Is there anything else I can help with?
On the cure for an intestinal hernia.
Le adveniment de aquesta hernia es per seccio que endeve en le ciphac extendut sobre le ventre de part dels angunars del mirac del ventre, per que deysendo les budels de aquella ruptura ad alcu dels budels:
This rupture is either of the ciphac or an excruciating condition for him, and this happens to these two species due to many causes: or percussion, or jumping, or heavy lifting, or similar.
The sign of this condition, when it is due to the extension of the ciphac, is that it happens gradually over a long period and does not occur suddenly. It is an abscess that forms inside the abdomen because the ciphac compresses the intestine.
The symptom is when it is due to the tearing of the ciphac, as at first it causes sudden and violent pain; there is an abscess with various appearances below the navel, which appears due to the expulsion of intestinal contents, and the body becomes bloated in areas outside the ciphac.
Sometimes the intestine is pushed through an external opening, and this condition is called a scrotal intestinal hernia.
Sometimes gas is formed, and sometimes a rupture occurs in the intestine, where it becomes trapped, which causes great harm to the patient; sometimes this leads to severe pain, especially when pressure is applied.
E en la curacio de las especias de aquesta malautia am ferr es temor, per que cove que sia esquivat le cazament en aquella.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And if it is necessary to make an incision according to the amount that you deem appropriate, let it be forgotten about.
Then peel back the skin around the area below the testicles, exposing the white, hard part of each one.
Now, insert your finger into the opening that is the testicle itself, which is between the white capsule and below the cord of the testicle, then remove the adhesion that is behind the testicle.
Then grab the cord of the testicle with your hand and pull it out, extending the white capsule to your left hand, and raise the testicle up towards the incision; instruct the assistant to stretch the testicle upwards, and you dissolve the adhesion that is behind using a complete solution.
And use your fingers to ensure there is nothing causing the hernia to be encapsulated within the hard, white capsule. But if you find any cause for concern, remove it back into the abdomen.
Then incise at the part below the testicles by section from which blood and pus flows as we have described in what we have said.
Then apply a piece of wool that has been soaked in oil to the wound; and place the ligature we have described (and sometimes the white cautery is applied, which we said immediately after incising it to stop the flow of blood, since many times this occurs) and leave the ligature until it falls off by itself.
But if the healing of it is delayed, then let lukewarm water be used to bathe it, and place on it until it falls off as we have said.
And then treat the wound with another specific method for healing wounds.
I am happy to help you translate this text, however, could you please provide me with the full context of "Capitol .lxvi."? I will need more information than just the title in order to accurately understand and translate it for you.
Thank you for providing additional context!

And treat the wound as we have mentioned until it is healed.
I'm happy to assist you with your request! Please provide me with any relevant information that I should be aware of in order for me to accurately fulfill your request, such as the text from *Capitol .lxvii.* or additional context if needed.
On the disrobing of patients.
Sometimes there may be ruptures or tears in the groins, as mentioned earlier, which cause swelling.
And do not leave the testicles without any support or restraint; if you do, it will be insufficient and the intestines will come out again in a short time.
If this condition is prolonged over time, a tear may occur in the peritoneum, leading to the descent of the intestines into the scrotum. This happens due to the extension of the peritoneum located in the groin area, as previously mentioned, which causes swelling and inflammation.
The treatment for this condition is to use cauterization, as described earlier in the text.
Sometimes, the treatment can be done with an iron instrument in this manner: have the patient lie on their back between two servants, who hold their hands. Then, dry the area of rupture and swelling by cutting it lengthwise to a depth of three fingers.
And then strengthen the white cloth that is beneath the chain until it is uncovered.
Then take the stick and place it over the prominent part of the cloth, pressing it against the abdomen.
Then tie the two prominent ends on the tip of the stick with a suture, adjusting it tightly between them.
Then remove the tip of the stick and do not insert it fully into the cloth, nor extend the wound or cause any other harm as I have already mentioned in the treatment of intestinal hernias.
Then treat it with the cure for wounds and when you make incisions in the veins, clean it thoroughly and restore the wound until it is fully healed; as the cloth is contracted and the prominence of the rupture is not properly aligned.
Cauterization is better in this case as it promotes healing faster.
This indicates that the previous text was section 68 of a larger medical work. Would you like me to translate any more sentences? I would be happy to assist if needed!
On the softening of the scrotum around the testicles." This appears to be the title or heading for another section in this medieval medical text. Should I proceed with translating any further sections?
Here is my translation of the provided text into English:
Adonc necessari es ad aquel que es preguat en la curacio de lu que fassa jazer le malaute segon le sieu dos, e enscida tota la codena la qual es mollificada sobre la codena natural; e aprop que ajuste doas labias am la sutura.
And if you wish, as in the beginning the superfluous part of the cord is softened with three or four cauterizations and closed with a firm suture.
Then make an incision between the sutures, and take care of other wounds until they are healed and no pus is discharged.
This indicates that you have reached Chapter 69 of the treatise. Is there another text from this chapter that requires translation?
The Latin term "castratio" refers to castration, which is the removal or suppression of reproductive organs, typically in males.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And so I say that castration is performed in two ways: either by attrition or by incision.
In the case of castration performed by attrition, the method is to make the animal submerge in warm water until its genital area becomes softened and relaxed while hanging. Then take those with your hand as long as they are dissolved and do not appear below the touch.
As for castration done by incision, you must hold the animal and press on the root of its testicles with your left hand.
Then tie up the testicles with a support bandage, and make an incision on each of them so that two testicles are processed.
Then you shall cut those, once extracted, skin them. And do not leave anything on the scrotum except for the thin capsule that is above the veins.
And this method of castration is better when done by attrition, as attrition leaves very little of the testicles behind so that the animal does not desire to copulate.
And then treat the wound until it is healed.
This seems to be an indication of a chapter or section number, specifically '70'. I am not sure if you would like me to translate this as well. Please let me know!
On the treatment of hermaphroditism."
Hermaphroditism in men occurs in two ways: the first is when there is a defect in the area where the testicles are located, and in this space, there appears something like female genitals with hair on them.
And sometimes, in some cases, urine flows from that area which is located between the testicles.
However, in women, there is one specific case: it is when the vagina of a woman appears on their pubic mound like two testicles from a man, slightly smaller at the opening, just like the foreskin of a man and with two testicles underneath.
The treatment is of three types: two for men and one for women. It is necessary that you extract those tight tissues before applying a compress to the area, and then proceed to treat the other wounds with regular medication.
In the second type of case in men where urine flows from between the testicles, there is neither a cure nor an operation for it.
Chapter 21. Would you like me to translate any more text? I can provide translations line by line or in larger chunks, depending on your preference.
Of tumors and flesh arising due to causes in women.
A small lentil-like growth is usually attributed to natural causes when it is stressed and becomes noticeable, and sometimes it becomes more pronounced in some women such that it spreads like in men and persists even after intercourse.
Therefore, take the excess of lentils with your hand or a cloth and dig it out.
And do not dig too deep, especially near the root of the growth, to prevent a flow of blood.
Then treat those with an ointment for wounds so that they may heal.
A fleshy growth that appears on the terrible part of the mother is a flesh that fills it, and it is usually seen as resembling a tail (and for this reason I shall call it 'tailed disease'); therefore, we should dig it out just like we dig out lentils, and treat it until it heals.
Chapter 72.
On the treatment of erysipelas.
Alratica is a condition where the woman's womb should not be perforated or have a small obstruction. Here, the text talks about two types of Alratica: one that is natural and another that occurs accidentally.
The accidental type of Alratica is caused by a pre-existing illness or condition in the woman, such as poorly positioned flesh (malformed tissue), subtle or thick scarring.
The accidental Alratica can occur in the woman's abdomen, sides, upper or lower parts of the body, and it is forbidden for her to engage in coitus, intercourse, or pregnancy, and menstruation must also be avoided.
The diagnosis of this condition is done by observation: if the obstruction is visible, it is considered apparent and direct; however, if it is not visible, then a manual examination or use of an instrument (ray) is required to detect it.
If the obstruction is caused by thick scarring located between the two lips (labia), then it should be cut and removed.
After placing powder on the two lips (labia), you should use your index fingers to gently press down on both sides of the vaginal opening (indicating pressure).
And the woman should be on her back with her thighs extended; then spread both lips forcefully so that this subtle membrane is broken and the obstruction opened.
Then take some wool, soak it in oil, and place it on the site; have a man come to her that day so that the incised area does not become hardened.
But if the membrane is thick and dense, then you should incise it with a broad blade or myrtle leaf.
But if the obstruction is caused by flesh, then suspend it with thread and incise it.
And if these medicines make the flow of blood cease without a bite, such as aconite, dragon's blood, and leeches, add white of egg to them.
Then insert a wide lead pipe so that the wound does not heal lightly.
And keep it for some days, administering a plaster of dry cow dung.
Then it is healed with another healing agent for consolidation so that it may be cured.
And sometimes it happens during childbirth that other tissues are torn; then you must cut into them in this way. If this is due to an abscess in the brain, take care not to contradict it or treat it with iron in any way.
This appears to indicate that the following text is chapter 73 of this medical treatise. Is there another line you'd like me to translate?
On the treatment of hemorrhoids, tailbone pain, and red bumps that occur in women's genital area.
Hemorrhoids are understood as dilated orifices of small veins from which blood constantly flows out and becomes old.
I have already spoken about the different types of hemorrhoids and their symptoms, as well as those that can be cured and those that cannot.
Therefore, I say that hemorrhoids and their tails when inside the anus and not visible to the eye should not be treated with iron.
But those that appear at the anus's opening and are visible to the eye can be cured.
And now you should place the woman in a position with her legs apart and use scissors or rough cloth to pull on those areas.
Then you must sprinkle over those areas the blood of a sacrificed animal from one of the specific powders and mixtures with stinging ingredients such as aconite.
And then soak their feet for an hour, and then place them in cold water.
And if the bleeding persists, then you must make a decoction of onion tops and outer peelings from walnuts and similar things.
And now take barley flour, mix it with honey and sour wine to make an ointment which you should place on their back.
And if blood has indeed been cut off, it's fine to do so, but otherwise you must attach two cupping glasses and perform scarification on the nipples.
And now take wool and soak it in either coriander juice or nettle juice or juniper berry juice mixed with vinegar, then attach this to the area, treating the wound with ointment until fully healed.
And once he is cured (let him) go.
Sorry, I'm not sure what you mean by "Capitol .lxxiv.". Can you provide more context or ask a different question?
On the piercing and accidental cutting of the uterus.
Special notes on the appearance of abscesses in the uterus, as well as tumors, ulcers, adhesions, herpetic lesions, fistulae, hemorrhoids, sores, and other types of abscesses. And I have already described these diseases and their types, as well as the signs of each one, along with treatments in separate sections.
It is necessary for me to mention in this treatise an abscess on the uterus that is cured with a cautery, and if you wish to know how this operation is performed with iron.
Therefore, consider that if the pain from the abscess in its early stages is sharp and accompanied by a percussion-like sensation, phlegm, and fever, and sometimes it turns red and you feel a throbbing over it, then do not proceed with piercing or cutting into it, but treat it with something to aid maturation until the intensity of these symptoms subsides.
And then you should make the woman lie down on a bed that has two pillows; recline her back and adjust her feet to the lower part of the belly, expand her thighs, place her arms below her buttocks, and tie each one with suitable bandages.
Then the midwife should move to the right side and use the tool with which she will open the mother's birth canal; its shape will be suitable for such a purpose.
And when you want to insert this tool, make sure that it aligns with the center of the mother's womb; what goes inside her should not be larger than the opening and thus harm the woman. If the tool is larger than the mother's opening, you should apply powders to the area around it so that any entry of a foreign object into her womb can be prevented.
Make sure you apply the thread that runs through the tool from its right side, and have the assistant hold it while turning the thread until the birth canal is fully opened.
And when the swelling appears and is touched with a hand, feeling warm and soft, then you must cut that part of his head using a wide spatula.
Once the pus is drained, you should apply to the wound a piece of cloth soaked in rose oil or green oil with some astringent properties, and place the compress on the incision inside the forehead.
Remove the mother (abscess) from outside, placing on top of it a clean piece of cloth soaked in water infused with mashed mallows.
After two days, the wound will be healed using an ointment that you must prepare for this purpose.
In some cases, the mother (abscess) and the compress are washed with a mixture of water and honey until they become crystallized, then with plain water in which horse radish or Aristolochia longa has been boiled, before returning to the ointment.
If the abscess has formed inside a boil, you must be aware that it cannot be cured with iron (a heated iron cautery), but rather by following the procedures described in this text.
Sure! Here is the translation of your provided text:
To instruct midwives on how to treat living embryos in a manner contrary to their natural state.
It is essential for the midwife to understand the signs of natural childbirth at the beginning. When you see the woman squeezing her legs together and wanting to smell the air, and she is encouraged by what is happening above her, hastening the expulsion of the embryo, then know that this birth occurs in a natural manner: the baby emerges headfirst, while the second one may be suspended or hanging from the umbilical cord.
So when you see these signs, you should ensure that the woman's abdomen is compressed so that the embryo can descend more easily. When it emerges headfirst, the second one follows suit, and they are both cleansed of any superfluous matter with a good cleansing.
There is another type of birth that is unnatural and impossible, which occurs when the embryo is expelled upside down with its body exiting before its head or its feet, or only one hand emerges from its foot, or its head appears along with a single hand, or it is born belly-first, and then suddenly it turns around onto its neck, resembling these unimaginable birth positions.
It is necessary for the midwife to be wise and skilled in all these matters, and she must guard herself against errors and deception.
I will now show you the entire figure of these, and explain the purpose behind them and how they should be interpreted.
When the fetus is positioned upside down on its head due to natural descent, and it presents a challenging birth for the woman with her strength already weakened, then perform an episiotomy or, if she has one, use her own placenta; also evaporate the conh of fenugreek coat with moist oils.
Then the midwife should insert her small spatula between their said labia and with it split the membranes, or else prick them with her nail until that which is in it of moisture runs out. Press on the woman's abdomen to help bring down the fetus.
But if it does not descend, then ensure that the woman is given an enema consisting of a mixture of horsehair mucus and fenugreek with ciza.
And then command her to be constricted and compressed as you give her snuff so that she might sneeze forcefully; close her mouth and nostrils for an hour or else the fetus will momentarily slip out.
And if both feet were neglected at the beginning, then you must bring them back with gentle ease. However, if the patient does not obey the instructions, place them on a stretcher and lift their feet up. Then lower the stretcher towards the ground; make sure the woman is held securely to prevent any fall during this process.
And if the feet are not turned back inwards and they die, make an incision on them and remove either dead flesh or tie the foot to their hand with a cloth, then take it out gently, for this has been forgotten.
When the fetus is on its feet, you must push it inside, then turn it into a small one, and equalize it. Then take one of its legs and straighten them little by little.
But if they are extracted between the thighs, you command them to express themselves and make them sneeze under such conditions; this will be forgotten unless God wills it.
Here is the translation of your first source sentence:
Here is the translation of the first source sentence: And then make him sit in a tub of cold water until it reaches his hypochondria.
And when you find that his limbs have been softened, then fumigate him with myrtle and place it on him. And when you have fumigated him for an hour, then make him sit on a stool, and make him sneeze and open his mouth, and take it away from him, pressing the lower part of his belly with light compression, for the wind will soon escape.
Examine the fetus in a lateral position, hanging from one of your hands. Engage in the reduction of his arm, but if you cannot achieve that reduction, then lift up the woman and make her walk.
And if she cannot walk, then let her lay down on the bed, and shake her legs with a vigorous motion, and subsequently administer gently the medicines which I have previously described as cataplasms.
And if childbirth has occurred, then make her rest on her forehead, and afterwards study the reduction of her arm, push the fetus according to its natural position, and make the woman sneeze and instruct her to exert herself so that it is delivered.
Examine the fetus on his neck with your hands expanded, and put its bandage at the back of its mother. Have the midwife hold onto the fetus's hand, then turn it little by little, which will facilitate its delivery.
And when it is done and how much is covered with ointment, then place on the wound what we have mixed from oil and medications.
Then instruct them to moan softly and gradually, and when you have done this, make them sit on a stool and order them to lean over the right side, then compress them; make them sneeze with this condition. The exit of the prepared fetus is on the side.
When you draw out the horrible matter from the mother according to this method, consider and then you incise the cervix with your nail until it is evacuated of humidity.
And if the fetus is suspended by its face or neck, then you incise its navel so that it may not be retained and die.
Then you remove the fetus from its parts inside until you cut that which covers it, and order the woman to compress herself several times, and the midwife will gently pull it out with her hands, if God wills it.
The exit of twins or many fetuses. Sapias que gemels motas veguadas so natz, e alcunas vetz naysso tres o quatre , mays aquo es estranh e tart s’endeve; mays v so causas foro natura, e no vivo.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
And if some of them are difficult with regard to their delivery and come to what we have said about unnatural positions, then treat those in the same way as we have described.
And if the midwife is skilled and does what makes it easier and more subtle, slowing it down, and being ingenious according to every position depending on how the birth is progressing towards health.
A reminder of what is formed in the womb from embryos and what happens during abortions.
Some twins are formed in the womb as one, two, three, four, five, six, and seven, and I have even seen a woman abort a set of ten, another of nine, all fully formed, which was caused by an error in the calculation made by the wise.
And all of this falls within the science of midwifery as it is close to their expertise, and therefore they should be consulted regarding these matters.
It seems that you have provided a section or chapter indicator in your prompt, which is "Capitolo lxxvi" (Chapter 76). Would you like me to assist with any further translation? I can provide line-by-line translations if needed.
When it is necessary to remove a fetus when dead
When you treat a dead fetus using the methods mentioned in the section on medical treatment and it cannot be resolved externally, and you are forced to use manual operation, it is necessary to consider whether the woman has good health and no conditions that may lead to complications.
Then ensure that the woman is placed in a supine position on her back, with her head slightly inclined downwards and her thighs elevated.
The minister or helper should hold onto two parts of her body, either grasping them tightly or using a cloth to bind her, ensuring that her body does not extend during the extraction process.
Then, you should moisten the mother's mouth with humid oils and a mucilage made from marshmallow root, fenugreek, and flax seeds.
The midwife should then coat her hand with these oils and mucilage, carefully insert it into the mother's birth canal, and locate the position where the fetal claws are present.
In this case: you must consider if the fetus is ready to be delivered head-first; if so, then grasp its claws by the heels, or at the neck, mouth, palate, under the beard, armpits, near the hypochondriac regions, or in other convenient places.
Mays si le deysendiment es sobre les pes de lu, lahoras en le pentenilh, o en le mieg de las costas: But if the wound is on their feet or legs, then in the groin area or middle of the back.
E cove que tengua le unci am la ma dreyta, e pausa la curvitat de lu en aquel loc le qual es entre les ditz de la ma senestra, e entrometa la ma am facilitat e fique le unci en alcu de aquels locs les quals havem ditz, entro que pervengua a la causa boyda: And hold the thumb with your right hand, bend it towards the space between the fingers of your left hand, and easily insert your hand into one of those aforementioned places until you reach the underlying cause.
E aprop pause e fique en la apposicio de lu un autre unci, o le tertz si es necessitat, per so que sia atraccio engual, e no sia extencio segon la sua rectetut tant solament: Then place and keep another thumb or even a third if needed in the affected person's position to ensure equal traction, not just extension following its straight line.
Ans sia maugut a tota partida, per so que l’eyssiment de lu sia alleujat ayssi cum es fayt en dent deves la eradicacio de lu: It should be bent in all directions so that its discharge is alleviated just as it is done with the extraction of teeth.
E cove en lu aquo que es entre lor que la extencio sia mollificada; e si alcuna partida de lu es retenguda, lahoras cove que la matrona unte alcus sieus ditz am oli e entrometa aquels espertament e revolva am aquels aquo que es retengut: And in it what is between them should be softened with extension; and if any part of it is retained, then the midwife must grease her fingers with oil and carefully insert them and stir up that which is retained.
Therefore, if the part of the wound is neglected and left untreated, the nails should be trimmed in such a way that they are shifted towards an area that is less important or significant; do this before all parts of the wound have been treated.
But if one hand is more affected than the other and it cannot be treated with a similar procedure, then wrap cloth around that hand; remove the affected hand after ensuring all parts have been neglected or ignored, and make an incision either at the wrist joint of the hand or at the elbow.
And similarly, do this to the other hand and both feet as well.
However, if the head of the wound is large and it occurs during extraction or if there is pus accumulating in the head of the wound, then you should insert something between the said spinal bones to split open the head and remove the pus; or use an instrument called an "alundat" to scrape out the pus. The shape of this instrument will be described like that of other instruments in the following chapter.
Similarly, do the same if the wound has a large head due to its nature: you should make an incision with an "algematu," or scrape out the contents using an "alundat," as mentioned earlier; then remove the bones with forceps.
Here is my translation of your provided text:
But if it is not complicated and there are no obstructions, then you can proceed to incise the head as soon as you find it feasible.
And if the abdomen is full of pus or there is dropsy present, it is necessary to puncture it in order to drain out the excess fluid.
But if the child is delivered through the feet first, its traction towards the mother's birth canal will be gentle and so will its direction towards her mouth.
If the infant's body is contracted in its belly and feet, you must first extract it using cloth wrapped around your hand to grasp it firmly and then cut open the belly and the feet until whatever was inside comes out.
But if the other limbs remain inside and only the head is delivered, then the midwife should insert her left hand; however, if the mother's birth canal is open enough, she should place her hand on top of the infant's nose, grasp it with both hands, pull towards the mother's mouth using these two, and subsequently put one or two fingers inside its mouth to draw it out.
And if the mother's birth canal is narrowed due to pus caused by an infection in her womb which happened during delivery, it must not be dilated further. Instead, one should apply a warm emollient wash. And apply plasters; keep the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
If the wound is on their side, then sew it up if you can: and administer what we have said for a living person's injury.
And if that is not possible, then cut it into pieces and extract [the wound].
Make sure you leave no cause for infection inside the incision.
And when you have completed all your operations, then administer what we have said about the cure for those abscesses which occur from a mother [abscess].
If there is a flow of blood, then immerse [the wound] in astringent waters and administer the other cure.
I have seen a woman whose fetus was dead in her womb, and immediately after that another pregnant woman, and the other fetus was also dead. There happened to her after some time an abscess in her navel; and it swelled up so that it became open, and she began to shake her arms.
And I was called upon to care for him, treating him for a long time, but the wound has not healed.
Therefore, I applied to him several plasters with strong adhesive properties and extracted a bone from his body. After some days passed, another bone was removed as well. I was amazed because there is no bone in the belly.
And then, I realized that it must be bones from the deceased fetus.
So I examined the wound and extracted many bones from her, as she was in her last month of pregnancy and had been suffering like this for a long time, with an arm of the baby protruding.
And I did not consider this to be strange, but rather it is a matter of science and a tool that assists the doctor in his healing practice.
Regarding the types of instruments required to extract the fetus:
A cup-shaped instrument, which is placed over the mother's womb:
This is the form of a book press where two cups are placed on each end of two posts. May this device be made of a more delicate material than the constrictor, and let it be crafted from ivory or wooden shaft.
And let the width of each wooden shaft be two fingers wide and the margin on both sides one finger in length; The length of each should be one palm and a half. At the middle point where the pair meet, there are two joints, which have been firmly fastened together; these joints are half a palm long and somewhat longer than two fingers in width.
These two additions are inserted into the mother's mouth, which has been opened with the aid of those two previously prescribed devices.
Here is another similar device that is more delicate and lighter:
It should be made of ivory or wooden shaft in the form of forceps. However, at the end of these two additions are further appendages; The length of each appendage is one palm and their width measures two fingers.
And when you wish to open the mother with these, have the woman sit down with her feet apart and expose what is between her thighs. And then open your hand with the instrument, just as you would with scissors, according to the amount you want of the baby's mouth, while the midwife does what is necessary.
The form of vertigo that the ancients described as:
A spinning sensation caused by an object moving around the fetus.
The type of friendship that is shattered when the head is severely injured.
Forceps are assembled with teeth at the end, like tongs, and sometimes they are made long like forceps according to this form, having teeth like those of a saw which are sharpened and hardened. A type of friendship that is fleeting or temporary.
A form of hook having one spine.
A type of hook with two spines or prongs.
A type of spatula with two ends, used for cutting off the baby's head.
Forma de dos espatums latz means "Two spatulas wide.
Totz aquels instrumentz so excersitatz, e quan mes so multiplicadas las specias de aquel e so preparadas deves le artifexs, quant es pus leugier a la sua opperacio e pus aut deves les homes per la sua quantitat translates to "All these instruments are prepared and exercised, and as more species of them are multiplied and well-prepared by the artisans, they become lighter in operation and serve people better due to their abundance.
This line is translated as "Do not be without any of these instruments, for the need for them cannot be excused." The text emphasizes the importance and necessity of having a complete set of medical tools and instruments at hand.
De extraccio de la segondina translates to "Regarding the extraction of the second-degree hernia." This appears to be a heading or title for the following medical procedure described in the treatise.
Here is the translation:
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text: All these herbs or some of them should be submerged in water on the stove, and place it over the fire.
Then place a cane tube in the mother's mouth, and keep it there until the vapors reach the mother's cavity.
Make her sneeze as we have mentioned before, and the second baby will be quickly pushed out.
But if this treatment remains incomplete and the baby is not born, you must instruct the midwife to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or an infusion of marshmallow root, then insert it into the womb and search for the second baby with that hand; once found, gently pull it out as described. If it is still attached to the mother's belly, you should follow our advice about inserting your hand, but when you find the second baby, remove it slowly so that the mother does not suffer from a strong traction. Wait until the baby is easily turned to the right and left sides.
And if the mouth of the wound is constricted, we have already recommended treatment with sneezing and herbal medication to treat the swelling.
However, if you do not forget all the causes we have recommended earlier, make sure not to tire yourself by repeating an act of abstraction. Instead, cover what is protruding from it at the mouth of the wound with a piece of cloth for the patient's thigh, and then anoint that with ointment and tetrafarmacon; this will rot it in a few days, and it will dissolve and be forgotten.
But when you rise, a bad odor rises to the head and stomach, harming the patient. Therefore, it is necessary that they be administered appropriate fumigations and remedies for this.
Some of the Ancients have already experienced fumigation with nard and dry figs.
The method of the instrument with which the woman is fumigated should be for retention of menstruation and the secondary fever:
It should be made of glass or silver.
And place the thin end in the bell and the wide end over the fire, and let the smoking be done over the embers of the fire.
And keep doing this until that is consumed, then do another one.
For the treatment of an unperforated infant's anus.
If an infant is born with its anus unperforated, which was discovered to be very narrow and blocked. Then ask the midwife to perforate its anus with her finger; otherwise, do it yourself with a sharp spatula, and be careful not to touch the rectum.
Then cover it with wool soaked in wine and oil, and cure it with ointment until it is healed.
But if you fear it is still blocked, then insert a cannula into the perforation for several days, and remove it when the infant wants to defecate.
And it can happen that the anus becomes blocked due to a blood clot or abscess; then you need to incise that clot and cure it with what we have said about treatment with lead.
De curacio de las fistulas que endeveno dejos.
Las fistulas que endeveno en la partida dejos pus bassa so nodacio e grossetut las quals endeveno prop del cul defora o en l’espazi de the una partida.
And it is either a fistula or wounds.
When that abscess is old and full of watery white pus or subtle rot, some nearby are caused by those fistulae penetrating.
And those penetrating fistulae are known for what comes out of them through the exit and windiness; sometimes patients call it an exit wound, but often they're barely visible.
Some of these fistulae are nearby in the space penetrating into the bladder and urethra; some penetrate the hip joint and reach the bone of the thigh.
To know if a fistula is penetrating or not into the anus, insert your finger into the anus and gently probe with something thin made of horn or iron into the fistula when it isn't twisted.
But if it is twisted, insert a thin lead or horsehair probe into the fistula until you feel the probe or hair with your finger.
And if you don't feel it at all and nothing comes out of the fistula like worms or wind, as we've said before, then you know it's not penetrating; you can begin treating it.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And in all those fistulas, it is not a complete cure as the treatment of such conditions are laborious and dependent on the skill and knowledge of foolish physicians.
But for those that are not penetrated and are fresh, a cure with an iron is hoped for as I will tell you, and this is something I have already experienced.
And if the patient's legs are placed between your arms with their knees raised towards their stomach and their thighs inclined towards their belly, then insert a lead or brass probe, depending on whether it is for a tortuous fistula, knowing well where to place the probe.
And if the patient feels it around their anus, then you must insert your finger into their anus.
And if you feel with your finger that the probe has already penetrated through to the other side, or something else that feels like flesh or skin in between your finger and the probe, then you can be certain that it is a penetrating fistula; and so do not attempt to treat this, as there is no cure for such a condition, as we have said.
But nonetheless, some may say that it is curable in some men later on.
Here is my translation of the provided source sentence:
And then treat those with scabs wrapped in bandages so that all the attached flesh does not come off, and treat them with medications that generate and consolidate flesh, and if it is healed, it is good; otherwise, it will never be cured by any other treatment.
And if the probe enters and does not penetrate into the finger which is in the anus, and between that and the probe there is a thin layer of flesh or membrane, and sometimes the fistula coincides with the surface of the canal, then dry out the canal from the beginning of the fistula, also dry the probe, and it should be introduced into the fistula until the section reaches the place where the tip of the probe comes through, and by means of the probe it is freed and caught.
Then cleanse those fistulated flesh that are assembled like the quill of a bird's feather and do not leave any cause.
But if a flow of blood sometimes comes between you and your operation while you are removing those flesh, then whatever it may be and however light the pus is, cauterize with fire or with sharp medicine, because cauterization with fire adjusts two good customs: adherence of that flesh adjusted, and excision of blood by extraction of humidity.
And then treat the wound that is covered with scabs or dressed with a piece of cloth until the place heals and then it cures the plague with hard ointment to produce and consolidate."
And in cases where medications with astringent and excision qualities are used, once the condition is restored it has been healed and there's no fear of recurrence.
But if the fistula has already penetrated into the region of the anus and is elongated from its surface, then insert your finger into the anus and examine it carefully.
And so if you cut open the fistula and find it is lined with a thin membrane or flesh, and it is close to being penetrated, then surgery is not required but rather trust in God's will and hope for recovery.
Which can be treated in one of three ways: either cauterize the area as we mentioned earlier; or cut into it to reach its cavity so that you may, if possible, insert your finger and cure it immediately; do not hesitate to operate due to fear of damaging the anus beyond repair by cutting too deep, lest God's will be ignored and recovery hindered; then treat him with what has been said above for he shall surely recover; or elongate the membrane and drain the pus that lies within close to the anus, as we have mentioned earlier, either with a knife or other sharp instrument, and then modify the fistulous flesh in the incision by perforating it; thereafter strive to achieve complete recovery from the plague through incisions; if the external opening is not consolidated, but rather the fistula remains open near the anus, it shall be easier for the patient. And sometimes the fistula is treated in this manner: when you insert the probe into the fistula and it reaches the side of the buttocks near the surface of the body with the chain, and on the margin of the buttocks, then take a perforated sharp probe, which is like a needle used to prepare corneas according to this shape:
Then insert the probe into that fold of four folds or around them; and next, insert the pointed probe with the fold into the fistula until it reaches the cavity.
But if it penetrates the margin of the buttocks deep inside, then you extract the fold from that wound as you insert your finger into the anus; and pull out the end of the fold and join the two ends together, pinching each one, and leave them like this for a day or two. When you cut deeper with the fold into the flesh, squeeze it so that the flesh between the two ends of the fold is pinched together.
Then treat the wound until it is healed and consolidated.
But if the orifice of the fistula is not penetrating, then make it penetrate in any way that you prepare, but do not put it into prison, as it is not for you to cut off the tailbone; and next, treat it so that it heals.
The shape of the spinous process is such that it has a divided fistula: its curve is very sharp and one part is blunt, so as not to cut into what is unnecessary, sometimes like this.
For the suturing of hemorrhoids that bleed during the incision of them.
Hemorrhoids are of two types: either they resemble coals between the buttocks or they are like fat from grapes. And there are small and large ones, some of which always bleed and are singular, others are numerous, some outside the anus, and some are at its extreme ends.
However, those that are outside the anus tend to be of a less moist nature; from them runs yellow water or a small amount of blood with constant pain and is according to the colour of the body.
And the cure for those that are inside the anus is to have the patient sit and press themselves until the anus opens, and the hemorrhoids will appear before you. Then you cut them with scissors or hold them with your nails (if you have them), and then cut the hemorrhoids at their roots.
Here is the translation of the provided text: And then treat those other ailments until they are healed.
And if the anus does not comply with the evacuation, then treat the patient with a small cauterization, and wash it with water that is in the bowel, which should facilitate gentle evacuation when the patient is pressed.
However, if the hemorrhoids are outside the anus, then their cause is mild, and you should take them with your nail or a hook, grab them, and treat them with what we have mentioned until they are healed.
For the one who requires an incision, you must administer their suturing in this way: take covered thread and insert it into a needle, then extract the hemorrhoids from the affected areas above; make the needle penetrate through the root on the other side, and wrap both ends of the thread around that area below the needle, doing so longitudinally. Pull the hemorrhoid firmly with tension and secure the thread by extracting the needle.
Do this for all of them, leaving one unstitched to allow excess blood to drain from it.
Then place on the buttocks a cloth soaked in rose oil or wax, and put that over their back, then tell the patient to rest. Leave it there for as long as needed; when it is done, treat any blisters with ointment or another suitable cure.
And since they are old and do not heal with that medicine, it is necessary for you to remove them with the edge of a spoon or your nail until they become moist and host a thin layer of pus on top, which prevents consolidation; then treat them so they may consolidate.
Then you wash them with a strong poultice of pus, more violently than the first time, until they bleed and become excoriated; then treat them so that they heal.
Know that 'alamermar' is key and it is nothing other than red nuts according to the color of the body similar to a clover head; they are made all over the body and especially in parts below the feet and calves, which you must anoint when there is pain.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And if you wish, cauterize it as previously mentioned in this chapter.
A wart is a small, rough, elevated growth with a pitted center that often appears on the skin of children.
The treatment for it is to extend and press that area, or to pierce it with a needle or a hair that has been heated. And if you wish, cauterize it as we have mentioned, using fire or sharp medical instruments.
A mosquito bite is a small, fuzzy, or pitted elevation on the skin's surface that itches when scratched, and it appears all over the body.
The treatment for it is to take a quill from an owl or an eagle, make sure it's sturdy, and place it over the mosquito on its edges so that the circle of the quill encompasses the insect's body; then, you rotate your hand with the quill to press down whatever is inside the circle of the mosquito, embed it into the flesh, and remove the mosquito from its root.
And if you wish, make this with an ivory or iron tube according to this form:
The upper part of the tube should be tapered and slightly hollowed out (it is unpierced) and wrapped in such a way that its appearance on the finger is smoothed and its revolution.
And if you wish to cauterize the ant as mentioned earlier in the chapter on cautery for hernia:
Regarding the form of instruments that will be administered to give cauterization:
Some cautery instruments are made of silver, copper, or melted and beaten ivory; sometimes these instruments are small and others large depending on what they will be used for: that which is administered to cure young children should be small, and those intended for people with tender bottoms should have smaller tips.
The form of large and thick cautery instruments:
The head of the large cauterization instrument to which the bag is tied should be wide in this manner, and have an indentation where the bag is tied as shown below.
Certainly, here is my translation of the provided text:
And it is a bag that shall be placed with medicines made from animal bladder or sheepskin, and its root shall be one palm.
And it shall be perforated with many small holes, just like a sieve; the space between these holes should be the thickness of a finger.
Then place in these holes strong raw bile, about ten drips or so; attach the bag to it; and when you place the bag on him, tighten its head with a stick between two points with great compression, and cauterize each hole with an iron: Note that what is important here is filling the bag with medicine, which should be heated according to the patient's tolerance; make sure it's not too hot or too cold.
Then the patient should be turned on their back, and raise his legs up with a man or a ladder underneath them; afterward, lubricate the end of the iron with oil, egg white, or fenugreek mucilage, or similar; then insert it into the anus gently, and have the minister grab the bag and squeeze it with both hands, emptying its contents vigorously into the patient's intestines; remove the iron, and let the patient rest their legs on a wall.
And if the medicine forces him to evacuate, let it be as often as possible; and if he sleeps for an entire night, it is more beneficial afterwards.
But if you treat his intestinal disorders with a cold bath and evacuation of the bowels, then repeat the cauterization until he is healed.
And if there are hemorrhoids or painful abscesses in the anus, then use a gentle and soft clyster, like those used for treating children.
On the treatment of wounds:
I have already mentioned in the section on wound treatment what is suitable for this book, and now I will speak of treating them with manual methods and medicines according to their completeness.
Therefore, I say that wounds are diversified according to the cause of their formation and the location where they occur.
And the causes for which wounds are sometimes formed include a blow from a rock, or incision with a sword or knife, or percussion with a lance, or with a club, or with an arrow, and similar cases due to various causes.
Mays las plaguas que so en les locz del cos so ayssi cum plagua la qual catz sobre le cap, o·l col, o·l pietz, o·l ventre, o·l fitge, e semblantz ad aquels dels membres.
And I am recounting the cure for certain wounds so that you may apply that reasoning and rule over other similar cases.
I shall start with the simple head wounds, for the discussion of more complex cases will come at the beginning of the third chapter.
Therefore, know that when a simple wound occurs on the head and there is no fracture, consider this: if it was caused by a blow from a stone or something similar, and the skull has only cracked slightly, but the wound is large, and you fear an imminent abscess formation, then cut and let out blood from the cephalic vein immediately. Do not delay; extract as much blood as their condition allows unless some reason prohibits phlebotomy, especially if little blood flows from the wound itself.
And phlebotomy should be the opposite of overfeeding; take care that the patient does not overeat and avoid giving them excessive amounts of wine or rich food.
However, if any condition prohibits the reduction of food intake, then lessen their consumption of meat and wine.
And if an abscess forms over the wound, insert into it rose oil alone or wine that has been boiled down to increase its potency.
But if you are sure of an abscess, then apply to the wound, if it is fresh, its own blood and a little of the powder that I will mention below.
And if the air has already changed there, then apply some ointment until it is healed.
But if the wound is large or due to an incision of space and skin, and its lips are not properly aligned for closure, then you should align them with sutures as I will recommend below.
But if the wound has already exposed the bone and membrane, and there is no retention of it but rather a small suspension, then you should incise that area and treat the wound with medicines; restore the flesh in its place without any codename, and instruct the patient to consume foods containing grease: such as capons, fowl, and meat so that they may compose themselves.
And if the other part of the wound is also putrefied and does not adhere to the bone, then you should incise all that rotten part and remove it, afterwards treat the area.
But if in these wounds there is an artery or vein from which a flow of blood may come out, and it is not stopped by medicines, then you should inquire about the artery; if you find that it is still uninjured, then you must incise it with a spatula or tie it off. If what we have said does not work for your needs, then cauterize until the blood has been cut off.
Certainly! I will translate the given text as you've requested:
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And then squeeze that one with pillows and leave it like this, and do not release it while it is like this so that the medicine is not lifted from him before he is healed.
And sometimes it does this alone with caution, when neither myrrh nor dragon's blood is available to you.
And perform this meticulous operation on large wounds when it is appropriate to place them under pressure and they are fresh with their blood, wounds that have not been altered by the air.
But if the air has altered them, especially in summer time, then it is not appropriate to use this compress; instead treat them with what we have said before and apply some digestive ointments or a mixture of barley flour with water and honey until they stop festering; and then cure them with another treatment so that they are healed.
But if there is an open fracture of the bone, even small, then you should remove it with a styptical.
And I will tell the cure for fractures of the head, which is venomous.
De las plaudits del col."
Mays si la plagua accideys en le col, lahoras no es en lu differencia en medicacio, e entre la plagua del cap quan es simpla.
Here is my translation of the provided text: Do not place any cold substance on the wound, for the nerves are delicate and their connection goes up to the brain, which is the highest of all body parts.
If this is to be treated with light medicines, it should be washed with warm water, sometimes infused with rose oil or plain oil, and touched with other healing stones according to this manner, and humidified.
But if the wound is big, then stitch it or tighten its lips, and cure that with powders until it heals.
But if the wound is deep or reaches to its lowest part of hardness, then pierce it in its deepest place.
But if the artery has already been cut and there is bleeding, then separate or dry it up, tie it off, or cauterize it if need arises from that.
But if the vertebrae of the neck have been cut and only the veins of the neck are saved, then adjust the lips of the wound with sutures over the spine of the neck without touching it; rather push that aside and return it to its natural form, then strengthen it with a decent bandage, leave it loose for some days; and cure it with ointments in which there is stypticity (astringency) and excitement until it heals.
Mays si la plagua ja en le os a fayta enprecio, lahoras percuireys aquella, e lahoras si en lu ha fragmentz de hos, extratz totz aquels que podes de lor; e aquo que a tu no es apparelhat, leyssa aquo entro que la plagua se poyrisca, e sia separat e la egrecio de lu sia alleujada.
And if the plague is recent, then sprinkle powder over it which has been prescribed for you. However, if the plague has formed a fistula, then treat it with what is mentioned in its respective chapter.
If it is a lance or dagger wound and you wish to know its depth, then consider whether air comes out when the patient blows through their nose; in that case, be aware that the plague is deadly.
And if there is no great depth to the wound and the plague is still fresh with its blood, then place on it powder during the first hour, but do not strain that person so as not to cause the blood to be held back in their body and return to the heart, which would aggravate their illness; instead, apply an attractive ointment, and let them rest twice a day.
And if the ointment is not available, then you should place on the wound opening as much flax as possible to draw out the moisture; make the patient sleep upon that wound so that what is inside of it may run out.
Here is my best attempt at translating the text:
But if the healing of it is delayed and has always been open, then know that a fistula has already formed; therefore cure it with its appropriate treatment.
And if the wound is due to an incision from a knife or a dagger, and it is simple in nature on the surface of the foot or back, then treat it with what was mentioned earlier regarding suturing, if it is large, or with powder, if it is small.
But if there is already damage to the bone and some pieces are missing due to the injury, then you should turn the wound outward and try to extract those pieces if they are separated. If they are not separated, then leave them inside until the wound dries up a bit, as their extraction will be easier.
And for other accidental wounds in the remaining body parts, the guidance for healing is the same as what has been mentioned above.
On wounds of the abdomen:
The discomfort that occurs in the abdomen can be either severe, mild, or moderate.
A small rupture can be difficult to treat in other ways, and if their reduction is more challenging, it's essential not to delay the procedure because a delay will lead to further swelling and make the insertion of the hernia into its place much harder.
Therefore, the best hernia to treat is one that's medium-sized because in such a case, reducing the intestine back into its place is not challenging as it would be with the two previously mentioned types.
Be aware that there are four different ways to suture the abdomen, and of these methods, two are common and appropriate for other wounds in the body.
The other two suturing techniques are more general but can be adapted for various body wounds; however, they are particularly suitable for abdominal surgery.
I recommend that you study each of these methods in detail and clarify any doubts with your mentor or teacher.
In cases where a small wound prevents the hernia from being reduced due to its size or if swelling has occurred because of cold air exposure, it falls into one of two categories.
Certainly! Here is the translation of your provided text into English:
And sometimes it happens that blood appears in the urine, and it is better than plain water for reducing inflammation.
Once you see the inflammation being resolved, you moisten the intestine with water in which old bread and mallows have been soaked, for this will soothe its interior without causing much discomfort.
But if it is necessary to treat the interior with this cure, then you divide the wound slightly with an instrument that has sharp edges.
And the first cure is better when it is properly applied so that there is no need for incision, and it does not lead to excessive drying out or deficiency.
As regards the instrument, take note of its shape:
One part is sharp and curved, while the other part is blunt; its tip is fine but not as thin as a spatula, rather it is slightly rounded.
And when the wound is enlarged and the intestine has come out, it must be covered so that its reduction occurs in accordance with its natural shape, back into its proper place if at all possible, as this is best.
Mays quan la disrupcio es ampla, e es en la partida pu bassa del ventre, lahoras cove que tu fassas jazer le malaute sobre le sieu dos, e pausa las suas cambas pus autas que·l sieu cap; e si es en la partida pus desus del ventre, lahoras tu pause le cap de lu e·l pietz pus autz que las partidas dejos.
And if the rupture is in one of the two parts of the abdomen, then keep your attention and consideration constantly focused on this so that the part where the plague is located is higher than the other.
And thus, do this for large wounds as well as for medium-sized ones.
For small wounds, apply your preparation and then instruct the patient to place their hands beneath where the rupture is located, with the palms of their hands facing towards each other and the fingers touching over the wound; thereafter remove any foreign object from the site of surgery before proceeding.
This is the common method of suturing: once you have taken the needle and the appropriate number of threads for the size of the wound, leave one end of the thread on the tip of your ring finger; hold the needle with a firm grip in one hand but do not put any wax on either end of the thread or any other substance that is meant to keep its ends together when you are threading it through tissue from one side of an incision site because this could cause infection if left there too long during surgery—instead make sure both sides have been cleaned properly beforehand (with alcohol etc.). Once you've tied these two ends securely around something solid like bone within the body cavity itself–such as ribs which offer good support due their shape fitting neatly inside abdominal cavities - now you should begin making your stitches by pushing them through first one side then another until all four corners meet up nicely forming perfect squares.
Under the thickness of the finger bend a double thread around the needle and sometimes in two parts together, then join both lips and the wound by suitable approximation; then allow the thickness of the finger and insert another needle into it, then link that with a thread like the first one was bound to the first needle; do not stop doing this if necessary with needles until you have completed all the suturing of the wound.
If the needles are moderate between thickness and fineness because fine needles only slightly penetrate the flesh and thick ones are difficult to insert into the skin; therefore they should be moderate in terms of both thinness and thickness.
The needle should not be inserted at the two ends of a fresh wound for this reason: that the flesh is not pierced lightly and that the wound opens up before it has healed.
And they should not be prolonged in terms of suture because this prevents the wound from healing.
Then pierce the ends of the needles so that they do not harm the patient while he sleeps and place over the suture powdered spices that cover the ends of the needles, and leave them there until you know for sure that the wound has healed.
And this type of suture with needles is most appropriate for small wounds, as it requires only one or two needles around the wound.
The second type of suture is called 'cominal': it involves stitching all four edges, two ends of the gape, in one go with a needle that has fine thread wrapped around, depending on its fineness and thickness.
Then, once the needle has pierced these four edges, return the needle from the same entry point it began with, so that the thread is pulled out of the higher opening of the wound, resulting in a suture like that of cloth, where the cloths are tightly bound.
Place between each suture an amount equivalent to the thickness of the little finger.
This suture is known as 'sutura sabo' by doctors.
With this type of suture, I closed the wound of a man who was stabbed in his abdomen with a knife, and the rupture of the wound was larger than a palm, with intestines protruding about two palms' width from the intestine's middle section; and so I reduced those after the intestine had been exposed for twenty-four hours through the wound.
And the plague was consolidated in the space of fifteen days or so, he cured him and he recovered; then he lived for many years and remained in good health.
And other doctors had judged that he would not be cured; but a miracle occurred, for I did not treat him with any ointment or medicine, only by applying warm cotton twice a day to the affected area and washing it diligently with honey water until he was healed.
But I will tell you about two specific types of suturing techniques, according to the teachings of the Bible.
It is you who starts the suturing with a whip stitch, inserting the needle from outside to inside.
And so, as the needle pierces the wound and passes through it in both directions along the length of the entire cut, leave the tip of the suture on one side where you inserted the needle; then pass the needle from inside to outside at the other end of the incision.
And when you have completed that step, make the needle pass again on this same side from outside to inside; leave the tip of the suture here and then pierce the other end with the needle from inside to outside.
And use your instrument for penetration, with which you will penetrate the hip joint at the end of the femur where it is attached to him so that everything penetrates.
Then start from this side, and stitch that end of the hip joint on the other side, remove the needle from the suture which has penetrated, then reduce it in that suture and sew the end of the hip joint that is on the other side with this end of the femur; remove that one from the suture which is on his part.
Do this once and then again, and do this another time so that you sew everything that is outside according to that example.
The summary of this method of suturing is that you sew with a stitch of small stitches with which the hair is sewn, so that you suture the hip joint once from the side of the end of the suture, and then again until it is completed.
Moreover, the second type of specific suture which is called by name Guillain's and this concerns him and for his dissection, it is that you sew this according to semi-suture with which some physicians suture it, so that they bring together every part to its corresponding part on him appropriately by nature; and apply one end of the other to him and the end of the femur to the other end of him, and this is done as I explain to you.
Make sure you keep the needle at the tip of your closest eye, make it penetrate from outside to inside that sole, and let both ends of the suture pass through; then turn the needle around and make it penetrate from outside inwards on both sides of the suture.
Then turn each one of them and make it penetrate from inside out on the other side of the sole at both ends, that is on the opposite side.
And this way of suturing is better than the common light suturing method, which I have previously mentioned.
This is the speech of Wally.
Some people call this the abdominal suturing method, which is done with two needles in which you insert a thread through each one of them; and as for what needs to be done by you, start by making the needle penetrate from where it came out on the other side, following the same way that I suture skins.
And bear in mind that when the incision is right in the middle of the abdomen it becomes more difficult to suture than on other areas.
Moreover, the treatment of plague is similar to that of other diseases.
Which is caused by the fact that when you acquire a fresh plague with their blood before it affects the air, reduce the intestine and cook it and sew it properly, then place on it some incarnative powder.
And if the air has already affected the plague, then place on it some hot embers which are in your presence until they become hard and coagulate the bile, and let them be consolidated there for a while; then treat it like other diseases until it is healed.
But if you do not have the medicines at hand, then place on it something else, because it begins to shake its arms and legs violently, an old one with a broken leg, and change that twice a day, as you were taught, until it is healed, for you would need no other medicine in most cases when dealing with simple plagues.
However, if you fear that the plague may spread to vital organs, ensure that you immerse a lion's skin in high-quality olive oil or rose oil, and place it around the area between the armpits and leave them there.
If the patient feels pain or putrefaction in their intestines, as this often happens, then you should apply black stiptic wine to crystallize it, especially if the gangrene has reached the intestine and is being forced inside his cavity.
Know that an inflammation of the large intestine is more easily healed than one in the small intestines.
And it is difficult to heal when the intestine called "gegunu" does not receive any cure for its plague; this happens because of the great number of veins in it and their size, as well as the thinness of the gut's body and how close they are to the nervous system.
However, if what proceeds from the plague is a hernia, and it's fresh, reduce that according to your recipe for reducing intestines similarly.
But if it has crossed to the other side and already turned green or black, then you should open that with a lancet on the place where it's darkened, so blood flows out of it, as there are veins and arteries in the hernia.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is my attempt at translating each line into English:
When there is a small rupture in the intestine and it is possible to restore it in some men, as I have seen in one man who was struck by a lance wound on his right side, which caused an old and fistulous ulceration with gases and flatulence coming out of him.
I then pursued the cure of him because I did not see that he was recovering, but kept applying a subtle ointment inside until it healed and the area became firm.
And when I saw that the area was already firm, I told the patient to avoid any new accidents or injuries in his stomach; and not to eat anything harmful or drink excessively, nor should he take baths or engage in strenuous exercises as recommended.
Some experienced individuals have said that when there is an ulcer in the intestine and it is small, it should be treated like this: you must take wheat grains with large heads; then adjust the two lips of the ulcer and place a grain from those which has its mouth open on top of the two lips of the ulcer; so once they are placed over them and their mouth is closed, cut off the head of the grain as it will adhere and not dissolve.
And then place another ant near the first one, and do not stop doing this until you have made ants according to the quantity of the entire wound.
Then reduce the size of the wound and remove any dead tissue from it; let those additional heads remain inside the cavity until the cavity is healed, and do not cause any harm to the patient.
It is possible to tie the wound with a fine thread made from the intestine of an animal, as it can be passed through a needle; take the end of these threads of intestine and ensure they are well-trimmed, then tie one end of them together using another piece of thread, enclose this, and then insert that thread into the needles and sew up the wound with them, reducing its size.
This method of suture using ants is not only a matter of faith but also hope.
However, if the wound is large and extensive, especially in one of the delicate cavities, then it should not be considered a cure but rather a temporary measure, as it will not heal them completely.
On the treatment of ulcers and fistulas.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And it is moist in some men, which leads to swelling; and often this moisture is absorbed within a few hours. Sometimes this moisture becomes solid, and it is small in amount, thick in substance, but light.
I have already shown all those causes, their symptoms, and the cure for them with medicines in the division (or book).
And now I will inform you of the treatment for a fistula, which is done through manual operation.
Know that fistulas can occur in any part of the body; they may affect large veins and arteries, nerves, the liver, intestines, bladder, ribs, vertebrae, or composite joints such as those found in hands and feet, and also those that are close to major organs.
Therefore, these types of fistulas are among the diseases that are difficult to cure and do not respond well to treatment; managing them is a tedious task fraught with challenges.
If there is any fistula that does not affect these specific areas and you have hope for its cure, or wish to gain insight into it, then take a piece of brass or iron; if the fistula follows a straight path, insert this instrument.
However, if the fistula has a curved path, then use a flexible lead instrument; as its own weight is light and can be bent to navigate through twists.
And if the fistula has very bad symptoms (motz horrificis), it is not possible for you [the doctor] to operate on them.
Close the fistula's opening by its openings (orrifici), because the moisture that comes out of it will harm other parts and spread.
Then examine very carefully to determine whether there are nerves involved or not, and if the fistula's cavity is shallow or deep, and it has a lot of pus coming out (motz orrificis). You must do this with all your strength, using thorough questioning, explaining to the patient what you're doing. And as for understanding the cause of pain via touch [palpitation], and other signs like those in abscesses, proceed similarly.
And once you have thoroughly examined all these signs, proceed to the treatment accordingly: consider whether it is a fistula that is close and superficial or in a salt location, far from joints, nerves, arteries, veins, or any of the other locations I've mentioned.
Then dry up the fistula as described before, removing whatever is in that cavity and made of corrupted flesh, anything born inside the opening of the flesh, hair or similar, and cure it until completely healed.
Here is the translation of your first source sentence:
And do this with some ointments so that the acute medicine corrodes all that is rotten in the cavity of the fistula's corruption.
Then restore it with fire, which generates healthy flesh so that it may be healed.
But if it is not healed by this method, then you cauterize as we have explained.
However, if the cause of the fistula is bone and you must ascertain this fact, then inspect it and dry it as we have explained, provided that you do not obstruct any vein or nerve or main limb as we have said.
But if the bone is exposed and there is any corruption or blackening in it, then you remove that part until all corruption is hosted; and then treat it with something that encourages flesh so that it may be healed.
And if it is not healed and discharges again as before, then know that you have not achieved the complete eradication of corruption; therefore, uncover it a second time and carefully perform its resection and cleansing with your last thin probe, and then restore it.
And so if he is cured, it's good; but if not, then know that the corruption has reached the distant depths of his body, which cannot be reached, and therefore you must do nothing but let it go.
And if the corrupted bone is small or it's accessible to you, then remove it with subtle forceps suitable for this purpose.
And if multiple bones are affected, carefully extract all of them and don't leave any cause for your strength to suffer.
But if any hindrance occurs due to the moisture and there is neither fear nor mistake in your incision, then incise those ligaments or flesh that are nearby, and deliver the bones.
But if you have no means to roast the bones at this time, place on the wound something that will cause it to dry up, and leave it there until it is close to those bones of flesh and ligaments, ensuring the wound is not consolidated but instead constricted in the section you have incised during your operation.
Later, if you fear for the patient's condition, place over them a poultice made of bread soaked in oil, or a poultice of Egyptian ointment, or one of the green salves, for when those ligaments dry out and the bones are separated from it, the extraction is alleviated.
Mays si es un gran os ayssi cum le os de camba o de coyssa o semblantz ad aquels, e aquo que de lu es corromput es la facia de lu tant solament, lahoras ratz aquella am resio tant solament derriera entro que sia ostada aquella negror e corrupcio, e aprop restaura la plagua.
But if the part that is corrupted in him is a large portion, and the corruption has reached the marrow of the bone, then it becomes necessary to amputate that part completely, cut open the place where the corruption has occurred, and then treat what remains so that healing can occur.
I recommend that you bring in another man to assist you, placing him on the patient's thigh as an example and aid for your operation.
It is of a young man in his thirties who suffers pain in his thigh; the affected part within is close to the body's core where matter has spread to the thigh; this matter is an abscess and a large one at that; there is no external cause.
And so the time was extended due to the mistake of the doctors as the abscess grew, and he lost a lot of matter; his recovery was delayed because his leg became fistulated, and there were many orifices on him from which pus and bodily fluids would flow.
Many doctors treated him for almost two years without success or skill; it was then that I was called upon.
And I saw his leg and the matter that ran from him through those holes in great quantity; and already the body of that man was completely debilitated, and his colour was yellow.
Then I inserted the tube into one of those holes, and it reached his bone.
And then I examined all the holes thoroughly, and found that they came from different parts of his leg.
Then I cut and dissected over one of the holes through which I uncovered part of his bone, and found it corrupted, already earthy, rotten, and blackened; and part of the leg was already corrupted where the corruption had entered into the marrow.
Then I cauterised what was uncovered and prepared from the bone that was exposed.
And I believed that it was not in the bone but rather this corruption which I had cut away and cauterised, having already removed it.
Then I applied the restorative process to the wound with consolidating medicines for a long time, but it was not consolidated.
And then I re-opened and uncovered the wound for the second time over the first opening, and found continuous corruption of the bone.
I secured what appeared to be the end of that corruption, and then I was forced to perforate for his treatment and healing, but it is not healed.
And so I uncovered him once more and did not cease to carefully scrape away the bone bit by bit and perforate for his treatment, but it is not healed until I incise around a palm's width of it, extracting its marrow. Then I restored that area with medicines, and it was consolidated lightly and healed.
No further operation or excision is necessary for him except due to the condition of his flesh and because of the limited endurance of his strength and his fear of death, as he faints at all hours from excessive evacuation.
Therefore, he is fully healed and there remains nothing in place of the hard bone; his flesh has been well-arranged within his body, and his strength has returned to him; he is restored to his natural condition and does not do anything contrary while walking or cause any harm.
Mays si es os eminent en loc del cors ja trauquat, lahoras cove que tu secces aquel segon aquesta manieyra: e es que tu prenguas liament e strenh aquel en la extremitat de aquel os eminent, e comanda ad alcu que extenda aquel en sus; e pausa aquel liament de lana pus gros del primier liament; e aprop lia aquel sobre la carn que es dejos le os, e exten la extramitat de lu per que atires la carn a las partidas dejos, e tu descuebras la carn sobre le loc le qual voles serrar per que la serra no leda la carn.
And place a stick or board underneath the bone appropriately, for when you do this it is not forbidden to saw off the corrupted flesh.
Cover the sawing area over the corrupted site slowly, because if it is inside the bone cavity and does not appear on its surface to our senses, then force another incision.
And if the bone is corrupted but not prominent and one piece continues with another, or corruption is in its middle part or at its edge, then you must cut away all flesh from every side; place a stick underneath it as well, and saw off the first section where the corruption lies before continuing to serrate through the other section.
The sawing should be small depending on where corruption lies as we have said.
And if corruption is in the joint, then cut away that corrupted joint and saw through the bone at its continuation to another section.
And if corruption is in the continuation of two joints but not on them, then this is rational rather than natural.
And if the corruption is in the chest of the hand or foot, it is most difficult; yet you must inquire into how the corruption appears to you and remove it as best you can without causing damage to veins or nerves.
E sapias qual es inscididors e las serras a inscidir aquestz osses son motz segon le situament dels osses, e la preparacio de aquels, e la grosseza de aquels, e la subtilitat e la grandeza e la parvitat de aquels, e la duricia e la lor raritat; per que cove que tu prepares a tota specia de operacio estrument convenient ad aquella opperacio.
Here is my best translation of the provided text:
And I shall now list for you, at the end of this chapter, the number of instruments that you will use with simple substances and with which you will proceed to your prohibition, which you will experience on others. Serra saw form:
Form of yet another saw.
Form of large saw:
Form of chisel: Let the head of this chisel be like the shape of a star key, and its points follow the form of awl tips.
And it is not necessary that with this [tool] the joint heads be rubbed when they are corrupted, or it has a large wide mouth.
Form of smaller razor:
Form of wide razor:
Form of another well-made saw: make its upper arch and sharpness out of iron, and its wooden handle should be appropriately crafted. The way he lies down:
Position for when there is a hernia that has formed in the hollow of the groin area.
Another more delicate position for a hernia:
Position of another hernia, which is on the curved part of the side:
Position for a small hernia resembling a tent:
Another position for an incision that is less severe or smaller in size.
The position of another incision, resembling a crack with its end being like a saw and appearing in many places along the bones:
The position of the crack, which corresponds to where there is a hole in the bones:
And its end is triangular with sharp points.
And it is made of Indian iron, covering all the causes that we have mentioned regarding cracks and incisions.
De inscizio extremitatz translates to "On the incision of the limbs," and de la serratura dels osses means "and the locking of bones.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
E le senhal de aquel al qual accideys, es que·l membre es fayt negre entro que sia cujat que foc la ja comburit, o se poyreys aprop la negror entro que la poyredura quella ane entro aquel membre que siec lu e que prengua tot le cors; e donc coyta te am inscizio de aquel.
And in a similar manner, if it is due to the impact of certain poisonous causes such as those from the scorpion of the sea or the viper or the adder and others like them.
And if the corruption or impact is at the tip of the finger, then you must make an incision in the finger and not allow any space for the corruption to spread into the hand.
Similarly, if it reaches the hand, you must make an incision at the base of the forearm and prevent any space for corruption to reach the arm.
And if instead of that, you make an incision on the arm near the elbow at the joint.
If the corruption goes beyond this and encircles the elbow, then it is the death of the patient; to administer another remedy besides this for their cure would be a waste.
Similarly, do the same for the foot when corruption affects not just the toes but also the sole of the foot; you must make an incision there and ensure it does not reach the ankle.
And if it reaches the arch of the foot, you must make an incision along its entire length. But if you can go in from above, then cut open the thigh down to the joint of the hip.
And if the corruption has already reached the hip bone, then there is no cure but release; let the patient go and face death.
The way to cut open a limb or perform an amputation is as follows: you should tie a ligature above the area that needs to be cut, and apply another ligature at the desired location; extend the ministers by tying one on below each joint, and have the other minister extend their ligatures upwards. Then separate the flesh between the two ligatures with a sharp instrument until all the flesh is exposed; after this, it can be safely cut or amputated.
Make sure to cover the entire area with clean linen cloth so that it does not touch the wound, and have a tight-fitting bandage brought to the patient, as well as some poultice for any abscesses.
But if bleeding occurs while you operate, then cauterize the wound immediately or apply some styptic powder to stem the flow of blood; and afterwards return to your medical procedure until it is complete.
And then bind the affected limb with a suitable bandage, taking care that it is healed.
I advise you to treat a man who has suffered an injury on his foot, this accident which I and you have noted, it is indeed a severe case of necrosis on his foot due to burning akin to fire damage.
And this accidental corruption first started on his toe, which spread to the entire foot.
Therefore, that man should be prepared for the surgery to treat his injury with great caution due to the severity of pain and burning he experiences, and proceed to incise his foot up to the joint, aiming for a cure.
This accident has caused the same corruption on his left hand's index finger for quite some time now.
Therefore, you should come to me, and I will perforate this superfluity by applying my medical treatment upon his hand, thus purifying his body; but the superfluity is not relieved yet, it has now begun on another toe that continues up to his arm.
He asked me to incise his hand, but I did not wish to do so due to my fears of the spread of this superfluity, and more importantly, because an incision on his arm might be deadly given how severe his condition is.
And after he recovered from my treatment, he returned to his land and I was informed that the man had indeed prepared and cut open his entire hand, and he was healed.
I have not added this narrative for any other reason but to be of assistance regarding what each part of this illness is and what it signifies, as well as how it should be treated.
On the treatment of sinus issues and the importance of enemas with medicinal herbs.
When an abscess occurs in any fleshy part of the body and the space occupied by the abscess is prolonged so as to form a collection of pus, then it breaks open and perforates, discharging its pus, leaving behind an empty place like some hollow vessel, and what is spread over it with fine linen cloth, not having reached ultimate corruption, nor impressing upon any bone or nerve or ligament, such an affliction is called a sinus, and should not be named a fistula.
However, if the space is prolonged so that corruption sets in any member, then it should be called a fistula and not a sinus.
Its treatment is that you should cut away the whole affected part of the body in the way it has spread out, and especially when it is thinly coated with a linen cloth, making sure not to leave any behind at the site because of its corruption.

And then remove that with contempt; and do this for so many days until the cavity is cleansed and the pus has dried up.
Sometimes enemas are administered with water and ash when this medicine is not available to you; it's about you taking the ashes of a beech tree, putting them in water; then use that and administer an enema to him until you realize that the cavity has dried up.
And if the patient has no tolerance for Egyptian medicine or water and ash, then administer an enema to him with water and honey mixed with ground juniper, and also with wine and honey blended; since the property of honey is that it cleanses and washes, and the wine makes the cavity adhere, especially when there is a surplus of astringency and dryness in the wine.
And when you do this sometimes and realize that the cavity has already dried up, then administer an enema to him with water which makes flesh grow in it.
It is about taking the 'unguent dyafinicon' ointment and dissolving it with rose oil and astringent wine; or that you administer an enema to him with some other medicines and ointments which have properties that I have already written in the treatise on ointments.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Under similar circumstances where the hole is spacious, tie up its sides with thread and leave space for the introduction of an enema if necessary.
And if the patient's wound from which the arm protrudes is elevated to higher parts of the body, cauterize it in the lowest spot possible for the arm to enter it, because when the arm is constricted in a deep cavity, tissue may form inside.
And if you cannot cauterize the cavity near the lowest part as desired, prepare the member so that the arm can flow out of it slightly according to what is available and make sure that there isn't anything stopping the arm from coming out.
Moreover, he who is above the navel opening, you will support at all times in order that this one does not allow what was put into his arm to come out. And so you may know whether what flows out of his arm is much or little, digested or undigested.
And you must consider the place of this navel, whether the patient feels pain there or not, and if it is inflamed.
And when your treatment for such a condition is prolonged in this way, and you see the matter that was discharged over the navel opening already adhered or appropriately adherent, then on the third day you will remove the bandage or dressing, and upon removal of the wound covering, change the cloth for another one and renew the ointment.
But if over the navel there is a small subtle space, then do not despair of its adhesion because it is appropriate for healing, since only some men are those who take long to produce flesh in their wounds, and others have the contrary effect.
And if much undigested matter has come out of the navel for many days, then you know that it will not adhere; and if the adhesion of the navel is long delayed as well as the cause [of its delay], then adapt the medicines to drying out, and if the medicines are humid in their substance and in their virtue, they dry likewise like the ointment of dichondra when there is excess addition of wax.

De curacio de panarici et unguis attritae et incisione digiti additi et sectione.
Panarici is an abscess that appears beneath the nail of the little finger of the hand or foot; it rarely affects other fingers and when prolonged and hard to heal, or has become a phlegmonous ulcer or is corruptive, then with forceps extract what corrodes the root of the nail and often corrupts all the rest; and soon spreads its corruption to the bone in such a way that the odor becomes fetid, the extremity of the finger dies, and it blackens.
And so, when you have done what we said in the previous division and your cure is not successful, then it is necessary to cut away all the superfluous matter that remains of the nail and after this cauterize the wound immediately; for the cautery is very helpful in this condition.
But if the bone is sound and the nail healthy, but its additions have already compressed the flesh to the separated parts within and began to press it and wound it, then you must place a thin rod under the angle of the nail that pierces the flesh, and drive this into it by cutting away the flesh with ease, and place on what remains of the flesh corrosive caustic medicines so that it is all consumed; then cure it with ointment until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already reached the bone, then you must cut into the bone and remove it, for there is no cure when the corrupted bone remains.
And if you see the corruption and decay spreading to the finger, then you must cut into one of the joints according to where it is pressed and remember its location; then treat it until it is cured.
But if the nail receives a blow or injury and there is severe pain in it, then you must first bleed the patient, and then dry the nail with a sharp spatula by cutting it transversely from top to bottom, taking care not to penetrate too deep into the flesh beneath the nail, for this will cause intense pain and may lead to excessive scarring of the skin at that spot; afterward, treat that area with something that relieves pain.
This small finger, which is naturally shorter in some people, has very little flesh and bones within it or underneath its nail.
Some of them are born at the base of a joint, or their origin is in one of the joints of these fingers. May he who is born in any parts of the finger not be ill, and as for him who was born in the joints let him suffer greatly.
And for those who are fleshy at birth, the incision is light, and you should insert the rasp with its broad side.
May he who is born in the root of a joint be difficult to cure; therefore, beware of cutting into him.
May he who is born in the finger's knuckles require that you insert your knife at the beginning into his flesh with a round incision towards the bone, then saw with one of those saws suitable for this, and then cure him until he is healed.
May the unification that happens to fingers between their hidden parts or due to the man's birth who was born like this, or due to the consolidation of the plague or by fire combustion, or anything similar, then it is necessary for you to cut into that unification until the fingers return to their natural form.
Then place between their sheets some rose oil to prevent them from uniting lightly, and separate those, or place a thin lead plate between them until they are united as needed.
And if there is a consolidation or hardening of tissue in some cases with the palm of your hand, then you must dry out that consolidated area according to how it has been prepared and adapted to fit the shape of the affected limb.
Regarding incisions for varicose veins," or "When it comes to cutting open varicose veins...
Varicose veins are thick, coiled vessels full of melancholic excess that appear in the limbs of the body, and they occur most commonly in the legs, especially those who walk or work a lot, or carry heavy loads.
Therefore, you must administer a strong black-bile purge occasionally by forcing expulsion of the excess, and then bleed the patient from their basilic vein.
There are two ways of treating them with iron [implants]: one is that the incision be made and that black blood be drawn from it; the other way is to raise the vein and extract all of it.
The procedure should be done in this way: First immerse the leg in hot water until the thick blood from the limb is loosened and thinned; then bind the patient's thigh to the highest point of their groin down to below, with a bandage that goes underneath rather than on top. Then cut into the vein at one or two or three places, make an extensive incision, then gently draw out the black bile from below the leg up towards its upper end until you have extracted enough and removed all the disease-causing properties.
And then bind him, and command him to refrain from foods that generate black bile.
Repeat the cure through bloodletting when the veins are full, and this makes the patient feel better.
The lifting of their limbs is done in this manner: you who scrape the patient's leg, if there are hair on it, then put him in a bath and immerse the leg with warm water until it reddens and the veins become prominent; or if one has been exercised by strong exercise, without a bath being present, then scarify the limb.
Then squeeze the tendon on the right side of the vein by cutting it on its length or behind him you must dislocate it, or at its base you must cut it.
Then open the tendon with hooks and peel off the vein from all parts until you reach the nerves, and it must appear as you see this thread declining towards blackness.
And thus you will extract it, and from the tendon you see this white thing that is its cord.
Then place that thing under it so that it is elevated and separated from the tendon, and suspend that with hooks through a lion's body.
And then cut another section close to that section in three places, and then remove the skin from the area above the vein until it is visible.
Then lift that [vein] and make an incision in the posterior section behind the ankle, then extract it and lift it out through the second section, and finally remove it from the section above.
Do this until you extract it from the section that is the most superior or highest of all sections, once everything has been exposed; then make an incision in it.
And if you don't obey and extract it by lifting, then insert a needle with a strong double thread and tie it to the vein and pull it out, or insert a rod underneath and rotate your hand in all directions until it is loosened. Make sure it is not cut [the vein]; for if it is torn, it will be difficult for you to extract the entire piece and this may harm the patient.
And once the entire vein has been extracted, place over the wound some wool soaked in wine and oils (rose oil and non-rose oils), and treat it until it is healed.
Under these circumstances if the vein is contracted with a twist and does not follow its natural course as we have said, then it must be cut in all places of twisting and at the points where it is enveloped; then suspend that part with hooks until you elevate it completely.
Be careful not to cut into the vein or harm it, as it will be difficult for you to elevate it later; use your discretion and act wisely in this matter.
The shape of the instrument that cuts/sections the dried vein is as follows...
It is not as sharp as the hooks nor does it have a pointed end so that it doesn't harm the vein; and it has flexible thickness, for if it were thin, it would cut into the vein due to its thinness; rather, it should be of excessive thickness as we have said.
The extraction/removal of the leg vein is described below...
This vein is generated in the legs, in low-lying lands just as it happens in Atagia (in Arabic lands) and in the lowlands of India that are dry with little vegetation and where there is neither grass nor trees.
And it is easily generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
And the generation of it is due to putrefaction, which leads to the condemnation from within the body of serpents and worms, bringing in scary things and maggots that breed between the wound and the flesh.
A sign of the onset of this condition is the appearance of an inflamed vein on the leg, and subsequently, the area becomes blistered; then, from that blistering place, the vein begins to emerge, resembling a plant's root.
Once the extremity of this condition appears, take a piece of lead weighing one drachma and tie it to that area; then, attach the lead to the leg and let it hang there.
Every time you notice any movement outside the affected area, wrap it in lead and secure it. If the condition persists for a long time, then cut open one of its parts and wrap up the rest; but do not cut into the root cause of it that is external, because if you cut into that, it contracts and enters the flesh, causing an abscess and putrefaction at the site and a severe ulcer.
For this reason, it is necessary that his wound be treated thoroughly and removed little by little, ensuring that nothing remains inside him at the rear end, and not leaving any cause within the body.
And from this vein, I have heard that it extends in some men for a length of five to ten inches, and I have even come across one that measures twenty inches.
And if it is cut during the hour of its medication, then insert a pipe into its hole and perforate it with a long rod through to the body, ensuring that all matter is evacuated, and apply putrefaction ointment on the area for some days using medicine; then treat it for the cure of abscesses.
And sometimes this vein has many knots, and mostly when it appears at the joint of the foot or on the foot itself, and comes out with many holes, and I have heard that from each hole, a branch sprouts.
Thus treat it as we have mentioned in the division, and with what has been said above.
On the topic of cutting worms that form under the skin, which is known as bovine disease.

And it is feared for its malice because when it goes into the body and rises to the head, reaching the brain, then it greatly opens in him and enters and destroys the brain, causing many fevers.
So when you want to cure it and extract it, you must first observe its movement and appearance by feeling it, and then apply strong bindings above and below it with bandages, thus compressing it and extracting the excess.
And if it is embedded in the flesh and you cannot find it, then place a hot iron with fire on the spot where it remains until it dies out, and the major feared consequence is its corruption which corrupts the place as we have mentioned.
But if you see it reaching the head near the brain, then bind strongly over the eyebrow with a tight bandage and compress it to extract the excess; and it is necessary for the patient to undergo body purification with evacuating medicines that remove bad humors, and be cautious of foods that cause putrefaction.
On the surgery for nasal diseases.
Aquesta malautia es nompnada en nostra terra nafir, e es dolor la qual ve en alcus membres, e aprop es permudada de membre en membre.
And I have already seen that person whom I will recount to you. I was called to attend a sick woman in a village. I uncovered her arm and observed a small inflammation on the vein of the upper arm; since it had been ruptured for an hour, I saw that inflammation gradually extend itself toward this [inflammation], but more slowly than could be expected, as if it were molten silver flowing from place to place.
Then [the inflammation] proceeds away from that place into the muscle, and here I stop for one hour.
Then it runs across to the other body before arriving at the other arm.
Then I recount to myself that it was revolving through her entire body as I saw it, and I am exceedingly amazed by its course and speed from limb to limb. And I have seen this before in my patients according to that same pattern; yet I have seen many others who experience pain being transferred from limb to limb. But I did not see this in my patients as I did with the woman.
And I do not think it is anything other than this because the woman was elderly, with dry skin and exposed veins, and in her case, this condition presents itself as windiness.
It is necessary that this secondary treatment does not appear in those with good and humid bodily constitutions, who have enlarged veins.
And when you want to cure the patient and they feel pain during treatment, then it is not visible to you as described earlier; instead, press on that spot gently and softly until the windiness is expelled, and cauterize the area.
But if you cannot perceive it with your own eyes, then treat it by evacuating the body and using something that dispels windiness, and apply those foul-smelling pills and pills made of serpent's flesh or similar.
On arrow extraction:
Arrows vary according to the species of animal they are meant for and the part of the body they target, as some have large points while others small ones; some concave or blunt; some solid; with three edges on some; some with barbs, and some with feathers.
Sure, here is my translation:
And so if these signs appear to you, then refrain from the cure and extraction of the arrow, unless otherwise.
But the signs of the arrow when it is in the heart are: if it is close to the left nipple, and you feel that it has penetrated into hard tissue, not soft tissue; and also, if its movement resembles the pulse's motion, and black blood flows out, with coldness of the extremities, a pale complexion, and fainting spells; therefore, know that death descends swiftly thereafter.
And the signs when the arrow has pierced the lung are: notably, foamy blood flowing from the wound, and the vessels near the neck becoming inflamed, with a change in the patient's complexion, heavy expiration of breath, and a craving for cold air.
And if the arrow strikes the covering membrane in the foot, and pain occurs near the little toes, causing a large abscess with severe pain and sighing, but without numbness to all members of the muscles.
And if the arrow strikes the stomach, often some undigested food will come out of the wound.

And I will recount this to you based on what I have witnessed of these arrows, so that you may understand their significance in terms of treatment.
The reason being that in the case of an arrowhead lodged in a man's eye socket at the root of his nose, I extracted it from another part [of the body], making an incision behind his ear, and he healed without any harm done to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Jew, which had pierced him in the corner of his eye, below the eyelid, and the arrow was hidden, only its small tip protruding to which the shaft adhered; it was a large sharp Turkish arrow with a lion head but no ears.
The Jew healed, and there was no unfortunate damage to his eye.
And I extracted another arrow from a Christian man, which had struck his throat and was an Arabic arrow with ears [barbs]. Then I made an incision over it between two tendons; the arrowhead had already embedded itself in the throat. So I carefully maneuvered around it and then extracted it, and the Christian healed.

Here is the translation of your first source sentence:
Here is my best attempt at translating the text:
And I saw another man in whom an arrow had lodged in his face; the wound has healed and broken the arrow without causing much pain or any similar symptoms.
I extracted the arrow from the nose of the king's principal man who had been struck in the middle of his nose; it had already slightly bent to the right and was entirely hidden.
I was called upon to treat him precisely three days after the arrow had struck.
So I found the wound of the arrow to be very narrow and proceeded to feel around for it gently; I did not find it, but he felt a prickling sensation beneath his right ear, so I presumed that this was due to the tip of the arrow.
I bandaged the area with an ointment that is both attractive and digestive in nature, trusting that the wound would become infected so as to reveal to me the location of the arrow, which I could then dry out.
No significant event occurred to indicate that the arrow had reached its current location; I continued applying the ointment for many days without incident, and meanwhile, the wound healed while he suffered no further extraction of the arrow over several days until one day when I felt it within his nose and brought this to his attention.
Here is the first line translated:
And then I adjusted the opening of the wound by applying that sharp medicine until the end of the arrowhead became visible to me, and I continued doing so periodically over four months.
And then, as the wound became enlarged, and it was feasible for me to insert the scissors into it, I did so carefully without neglecting any details, and I persisted in my efforts and ingenuity with various engineering techniques until one day I successfully employed a set of specially designed forceps (as will be described later in this chapter) to extract it; subsequently, I repaired the wound.
Some physicians believed that the cartilage of the nose could not be regenerated, but I managed to restore it and the wound was fully healed; the patient recovered their health completely and did not suffer any long-term effects.
I recommend to you the process of extracting certain types of arrows, and I suggest you establish guidelines and provide further clarification on aspects that remain unaddressed, as this subject matter extends beyond what can be fully covered in a narrative format.
Skilled craftsmen should make comparisons and draw distinctions between what is present and what is missing, and they must develop innovative techniques and tools when faced with unusual cases or circumstances that arise in their practice.
And thus, I say that arrows are not expelled from the body in which they are embedded but rather through two methods: either by the attraction of the location where it pierced or by the opposite force exerted on another part.
The arrow that is expelled by the same place it entered is made of iron, and it proceeds to another fleshy area, being withdrawn from there.
If you do not obey the timing of when to remove it, then know that you should leave it for a few days until the flesh around it swells and the attraction and expulsion decrease.
Similarly, if the arrow is embedded in bone and you do not follow the timing, leave it for a few days and then repeat the process of attraction and motion daily until it is finally expelled.
And if you do not follow the timing after a few days, it is necessary that you drill into the arrow's circuit in the bone from all sides using a thin wire until the area around it is enlarged, and then extract the arrow.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And if you cannot operate on them due to the constriction of the wound and the length of the arrow shaft, and there are no bones, nerves, or veins here, then make an incision into the wound so that it can be enlarged and the arrowhead can possibly be extracted.
And if they have an arrowhead lodged in their ears, then release the flesh that it is attached to from all sides with as much care as you can manage; and devise a plan for this, because if you cannot operate on them due to the evisceration of flesh around the ear and the twisting of the arrow shaft, then obey.
When you are performing the extraction of the arrowhead from any location it may be in, then use twisting motions with your hand and forceps on all sides to make it obey; and do so with utmost precision to ensure that the arrowhead is not broken and that its removal does not cause difficulty for you or further injury to them.
And if you are unable to perform the extraction immediately, then leave it for a few days until the surrounding areas have recovered somewhat, and then repeat the procedure when the area is less inflamed. However, if you encounter excessive bleeding during the procedure, then apply the methods we have discussed previously for wound care and healing in another chapter.
Here is the translation of the provided sentence:
And therefore, you should make the arrowhead contract so that the patient is positioned according to the diagram, which indicates where you must place the arrowhead on them, as it is more beneficial. If this is not possible for you, then do what you can according to the diagrams.
But if the arrowheads are bent outwards by the opposite side or have already caused some damage to the outer parts, or create swelling at the end of the arrowhead due to the sensation of the part above the wound and sometimes it protrudes; then you must cut that part off; and make the incision according to the amount that can be grasped with forceps; and then extract it, as it is easier for removal.
If it is retained in the bone, then you must twist and turn it according to the direction that the arrowhead presses against the bone, and enlarge the hole so that it can be removed; and then extract it.
Otherwise, leave it there for a few days, and then try again until it comes out.
And if the shaft of the arrowhead is stuck there, then you must push it in with your hand.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
If the arrow is concave, then you push that with a strong instrument entering it because the arrow is relieved by that.
And if the arrow is poisoned, you must ensure that all the flesh around the wound is concave, as far as it is possible for you to do so, and then treat it with whatever seems appropriate.
And if the arrow strikes the foot or penetrates into the belly, bladder, side, and is close enough for you to touch it with a tent-pin, do so if possible, then drive in the pin and take care not to cut any vein or nerve; extract the arrow, then sew up the wound as seems necessary, and treat it until it is healed.
Instruments like pincers that draw out arrows:
Their ends are like the beak of a bird, made with a serrated edge so that when they grasp the arrow they do not release it.
There are many different kinds, large and small, few and many, according to the size of the arrow and its thickness, as well as the width of the wound and the tightness of the tissues.
This sentence translates to "Thus, with the aid of an instrument, ease its entry into the concave cavity and apply stimulation".
On phlebotomy of veins.
The veins which are customarily used for phlebotomy, as noted in Chapter XVI, are two pulsatile veins located near the ears called 'auricular'; two herbs that appear on either temple; and two veins situated under the eyes by the tear ducts, referred to as 'observant' or 'watchful'; additionally, there is a vein prepared at the center of the forehead, one at the tip of the nose, two jugulars in the neck, two veins above the lips, and two below. These are known as the 'angelic' veins; furthermore, there exist two veins beneath the tongue. The veins that are phlebotomized in the arms number five; one is a 'cephalic' vein and another is known as the 'wild side'; it is called "the head vein", and is numb or non-pulsating. It consists of a branch from the basilica, along with a branch from the cephalic vein which the people call “the body’s main vein”. The basilica is referred to by some as the “domestic vein”, known also as the “whistling” vein, while others refer to it as "the belly's vein". Then there is the ‘bracelet’ vein, situated over the wrist bone; this is the one that becomes apparent through its pulsations. Next is the 'savior' which lies between the aforementioned auricular and a smaller vein called 'pus petit'; it has two branches.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Le juvament de las venas que so aprop las aurelhas es a cataris antics e emigranea e sahafati e ulceracios del cap malas antiquas.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Now you take the lancet knife, which is sharp, and then insert it below the vein in the arm until the phlebotomist comes to bleed him. Then lift your hand to the vein and arm at their junction, and make an incision in the vein with a sharp instrument. Let the length of the incision be about two fingers in size or thereabouts, and let as much blood flow out as you wish.
Then apply some strengthening powder and leave it until the wound heals.
And at the beginning of this book, we have already discussed the incision of these veins and their subsequent cauterization.
Of the two arterial veins that provide sustenance to the phlebotomy, one is an old emigrant and a wicked so-and-so, while the other is a frequent visitor with acute overflow of the heart's superfluities.
The way to phlebotomize these veins is as I recommend to you: constrict the patient's arm with their collar until both veins appear by tactile sensation and are manifestly demonstrated below your finger; then you can proceed.
Under the vein at your index finger's knuckle, lift up a length of cord and insert the fleam below it before lifting the vein itself. Cut into that vein as you have done with the other two; let blood flow according to the quantity you need.
Then release the tourniquet from the patient and place your finger on top of the vein for an hour; afterwards, put cotton and powder over it and bind it with a strong compress, leaving it until healed.
A reminder of the principles stated previously, along with the necessary incisions and extractions that are discussed at length in this book’s introduction, has already been made.
Therefore, the practice of venesection (flebotomy) involving the vein on one’s forehead is also relevant for those suffering from ancient facial illnesses such as headaches and seizures, as well as putrid ulcers.
And the way this is done is as I recommend to you: The patient should bind their neck with a bandage so that the vein appears, and then take the instrument called the fleam, which looks like this... [here an illustration of the device was probably intended]
Pauses the protruding point which is at the top of the hole above that vein and strike it with a stick or some other instrument in the same way, then let the blood run out to whatever extent you wish; but before that undo the wound of the sick man and press on it until it be healed.
And sometimes it is opened with a lancet, however, the lancet should not be of sharp point like the other lancets but rather of flat tip, and cut across it because the bone beneath is close to the surface and would easily be broken by the thin lancet.
But the swelling of the two veins that are near the temples because of the inflammation of the ears due to boils and blisters in the ears, also occurs with diseases of the face.
And the way of carrying out the venesection is that the patient holds his neck with a bandage and then they are cut on those areas while you stand at their head.
And the venesection is made across along with a lancet which should not be very sharp because there isn't much flesh in that area and if the lancet is thin then its tip might easily be broken.
And then draw out as much blood as you deem necessary, place a compress on those spots, secure them for one night, and then release the bindings.
The bleeding of the veins in the nose is effective for acute fever and violent headache, as well as for diseases that occur on the face, such as erysipelas and an old ulcer.
And the way to perform this bleeding on him is that the patient tightens his neck and then has their nose in your left hand; take the thin bleeding tube of moderate length and place it in the middle of the head of the nose, according to its straightness, for here the vein does not seem obvious at first touch, but when the blood begins to flow immediately.
Remove your hand from the bleeding tube gradually and draw out as much blood as you need; then cover it for one night because it heals quickly.
The bleeding of the two temples is suitable for contraction of the eye and the beginning of leprosy, various diseases, itchiness, and bad corrosive ulcers such as herpetic sores.
And the way to perform this bleeding is that the patient tightens both temples with a bandage; the practitioner should stand over the patient's head and have the patient seated on a chair.
And then carefully bleed the vein along its length with a small, narrow fleam gradually; and then extract some blood in an amount suitable for the season or as you judge is necessary for this case; and then do likewise to the other vein.
Then untie the binding and tie both veins with a moderate tourniquet so that the patient is not suffocated; leave it there until morning when the wound has healed.
The benefit of bleeding the algid veins is that it brings about small abscesses and pimples in the mouth, corruption of the gums, and bad ulcers and cracks; and for bad ulcers located in the nose or around it.
And the quality of this kind of bleeding is that you should lay the patient before you and bind their neck with a bandage, then turn up their lips and look at the two veins which are to be found one on the right lip and another on the left; these are recognised by the blackness of each side as it appears most prominent where small black veins run around them; so there make an incising incision on each.
But if you still have doubts about which one is which, then you should make the incision on the more prominent and obvious of them.
And make sure that two veins are visible above her lips.
The two veins below her tongue are useful for the venous cutdown of the cephalic vein to access areas that are in front of the neck, for diseases related to the tonsils, and oral illnesses.
The way to perform phlebotomy on these is for the patient to sit between your two hands facing the sun, and lift their tongue up so that you can see below it; from one side there will be a vein and from the other another vein, and the colour of each is leaning towards blackness.
Then phlebotomize each one; be careful not to miss your hand while doing this phlebotomy because below those are arteries.
And the two veins that are phlebotomized in the elbow run throughout all men, and phlebotomy of them is performed according to two methods; either put a myrtle or olive wood fleam to subtle inclination; or use a cutler's lancet, and call it "alnessil", and this is its form:
sia le latz de lu ayssi cum vezes, e conveneys a obrir las venas concavas plenas procedentz apparentz grossas, e ad aquellas que conteno sanc gros torbat.: Place the patient's side in this way and proceed to open the concave veins that are full and appear large, targeting those that contain thick, muddy blood.
E aquest fleubotomi es de menor latitut e de pus subtil extremitat, e conveneys a fleubotomia de venas subtils que conteno sanc subtil citri.: This bloodletting method is of lesser depth and has a more subtle extremity; it should be used for the thinner veins that contain lighter-coloured, citrus-like blood.
Mays le juvament de la fleubotomia de la vena basilica la qual es una de tres venas: quar extratz le sanc de las malautias que so dejos le guolayro e·l col, e de aquo que siec le pietz e·l ventre.: Furthermore, the recommendation for bloodletting from the basilic vein, which is one of three veins, is to extract blood from patients suffering illnesses below the throat and neck, down to the feet and abdomen.
E conveneys al fleubotomador, quan fleubotomia aquella, que guarde be aquella e sia sobre-temor en aquella, quar dejos lu ha arteria, e si erra e ajusta en la punctura del fleubotomi, inscidira aquella arteria e accidira fluxs de sanc, per so que cove que no fleubotmes aquella am fleubotomi pungent, abantz sia sectant cum alnessil.: And it is recommended to the bloodletter, when performing this procedure, to be careful and exercise caution around this vein as there is an artery nearby; if you make a mistake and pierce that artery during the bloodletting process, it will cause bleeding, thus requiring surgical intervention with a scalpel.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Mays si tu voles la fleubotomia de lu meteyssa, lahoras cove denant la strictura del bras que toques le loc entro que conogues le loc dels pols, e aprop senha sobre lu am tencha; e aprop lia le bras e secsa la vena am seccio concava am fleubotomi alnessil ayssi cum havem dit; e guarda te que caja la percussio per alcu spazi del loc de la arteria.
And when you see that the ligature is tightened and there is swelling in the spot where you have marked it with a stitch, then know that this swelling is due to arterial inflammation, so avoid it.
And if you see the blood flowing during venesection like the urine of a child, and the blood is slender and reddish in color, then know it is arterial blood; and at that time, treat it by placing your finger on it for some length of time; then remove your finger, and if the blood appears to be cut off (because many times it does appear so), then tighten the arm and leave it.
Take care of the patient's mucus discharge; let it be a cause of apprehension for him and do not treat it until several days have passed since he became well.
But if the blood is not cut off and you see that there is no medicine available for this, then cut the artery, if it appears so to you; because its extremity is contracted, and the flow of blood is cut off; or take some fistic acid, mix it with wine, and take half of it, and bind that on the place where the vein was compressed by a ligature and by powder for an entire day.
Here is the translation of your provided text:
And bloodletting from him is difficult in many positions due to the small location of the wound and the possibility of tying his arm.
More often, venipuncture from the median cubital vein is beneficial for bloodletting from the upper part of the head and below the chest; because it consists of branches of the basilic and cephalic veins, as we have said.
And beware to the blood-taker that they are overly afraid during the patient's bloodletting, because beneath it is a nerve; and if one punctures this area of venipuncture and hits the nerve, numbness will happen to them, and their recovery is difficult, and perhaps they won't fully recover. And often this nerve appears in sensitivity; and if it is hidden for some people and subtle and not shown, then be careful that you place your blood-taker's arm with an elbow section, and avoid the nerve with your strength.
And if the vein is between two nerves, then you split the vein lengthwise.
The benefit of bloodletting from the cephalic vein is that it draws out blood from the head and treats diseases of the brain.
And in this case specifically, if you wish for the phlebotomies to be performed using an olive or myrtle branch phlebotomy tool, as it is the safest of all veins since there are neither arteries nor nerves nearby.
Now, it is worth noting that some individuals may experience bruising or hematomas after the first phlebotomy puncture, but one should avoid striking this bruise again during subsequent punctures.
Firstly, it is crucial to understand that phlebotomy should not be performed solely for the purpose of maintaining health but rather as a preventative measure or in response to potential illness; thus, one must consider the timing and context carefully. Phlebotomies can be carried out on one of the veins located in the arm: cephalic, basilic, or median cubital vein. It is best performed at the start of spring, before breakfast in spring and autumn, and during winter just after dinner when there are signs of fullness.
And it is done phlebotomy (bloodletting) on the third day, or when three hours have passed since sunrise.
Bloodletting should be performed when it is deemed necessary and appropriate due to the patient's condition, regardless of whether it is day or night, at any hour and in all circumstances.
Children should not undergo bloodletting until they are fourteen years old, and pregnant women should only be bled between the fourth and seventh months of pregnancy. The elderly who have passed sixty years of age should also avoid this practice.
If a person wishes to undergo bloodletting for any reason, it is necessary to cleanse their intestines beforehand using a lion's purge (a type of strong laxative). This is especially important if there are retained stools in the intestines, as it prevents the veins from absorbing excess waste during the bloodletting process. This precaution ensures that no harm comes to the body's vital organs.
Patients suffering from nausea due to intoxication or overeating should not be subjected to bloodletting, nor those recovering from illness or debauchery. Additionally, individuals afflicted by dropsy (a condition causing excess fluid retention) are exempt from this practice. Furthermore, it is crucial to avoid bloodletting when experiencing severe abdominal pain, vomiting, and any condition that weakens the body's core strength or vitality.
And then consider the elevation of spirits before this, if the blood is thick, provide him with food and drinks, and medicines if it is necessary for him.
Then enter the bath if no cause forbids it, or engage in some exercise to make the blood more fluid.
Perform the bloodletting on him in the foot around the third hour of the day, as we have said.
Make sure that the patient's foot is protected from any harmful animal encounters on that day, such as distress, anger, fear, and all physical accidents like unnecessary work and punishment, along with anything similar.
At his bedside, ensure that there are sources of fragrance and pleasant odors commonly used by men, such as aromatics and perfumes, along with balms and similar items according to the extent of your ability.
Have the bloodletter sit on a cushion that is higher than the cushion of the one who will undergo bloodletting.
Then pull out your arm and wipe it with your hand, the bloodletter will do this two or three times; then tighten the ligature with a strap and wrap it around twice.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
And then apply a tourniquet, so that the person who is to be bloodlet needs to rub their hands together until the veins are swollen and visible to the touch.
Then the bloodletter should grease his phlebotomy tool with a little old oil; and then place his index finger of the left hand on that vein from which he wants to take some blood, in order for the vein to stand out slightly, and gently tap it so that among the veins you find one that escapes just like a cord - that is the one where phlebotomy must be performed. And this is full of windiness; when placing the tool over it should contract around the instrument which is revealed by the bloodletting; and he should uncover his hand, and open up the vein with the tool if it isn't already opened yet but narrow.
So in this case the bloodletter should be firm and diligent with all these causes.
Then remove the bloodletting tool and if the vein is already exposed then so be it; otherwise you should repeat this procedure elsewhere in that area a little or over there with haste, unless the area isn't afflicted by pus.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And then repeat the bloodletting if she desires.
And if the opening is small and the blood flows gently, and you fear that it won't drain enough, then repeat the bloodletting at this point with precision, making adjustments to the incision to increase its size a little; do so quickly before the area becomes inflamed, for when the spot is inflamed in many men, you must make very few incisions.
However, if you see that the area is already inflamed, do not repeat the procedure on it, as this offers you no benefit; instead, apply some oil from your flask to that part, for it will ease the heart of its blood. And this place is better suited to oil than other oils.
Likewise, apply the oil mixture to every bloodletting site where you've restricted the heart's flow of blood, and do so with alfenac myrrh and dragon's blood when one of those has been placed on the spot, for the blood is refined and stirred up when it is thick.
And if a large abscess forms at the bloodletting site, which often happens, especially to those who have not been bled before or to whom you've only just opened up the vein slightly, then lance it and apply a sponge soaked in warm water and salt brine, lightly scraped, and hold this there for an hour, for it will dissolve.
And now it is necessary for them to draw out some of the blood from that vein with a lancet, either from there or from another nearby one.
And if there remains in the place for a few days any black or green discoloration, do not note this; and if you wish, apply to it some aloe and myrrh solution, or some juice of mallows or calamint or something similar.
And in many cases, an abscess or swelling may occur; this requires a phlebotomy of the basilic vein.
So place your hand upon it, and if you then find any degree of softness there, your pressure upon it must be maintained until the prominence is bad and evil; and in this case take care that you apply to it something of what has been said, for from the artery blood will flow forth with great violence.
And make a plaster with something astringent so that the place may be hardened, and then treat it with any other remedy until it is healed.
And you must draw blood from every man according to the amount of his vigor and with regard to the prevailing color which appears above the blood.
Here is the translation of your provided text:
And for someone who is full and strong but requires the extraction of blood in one session, it is advised to enlarge the phlebotomy site on the vein and for the phlebotomist to be wide.
And for someone who is feeble, the opposite should be done; it is advised to extract blood in small amounts over several sessions and for the phlebotomist to use a narrow instrument.
The best method of phlebotomy for drawing blood from the vein is to make a transverse cut, not a puncture.
This method of phlebotomy is safer than the traditional longitudinal cut as it reduces the risk of bleeding and nerve damage, making it more preferable and safer overall.
And for those who are prone to fainting during phlebotomy, it is recommended that you give them a small piece of bread infused with wine or simple oxymel beforehand; then extract the blood in three or four sessions.
If the patient's complexion is cold, give them beforehand bread infused with myrrh syrup or spiced honey syrup infused with pepper, cinnamon, ginger and similar spices, or fragrant and strongly scented aromatic syrup.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And use other causes that we have mentioned in the division of syncope due to evacuation.
And for those who wish to heal their arm and purify their blood once again, they should be bled where phlebotomy is done through evacuation, and the nature of it is cold, thus evacuating blood gradually, only according to the quantity of nature on consecutive days.
For those who wish to heal their arm and purify their blood a second time, and if their body is strong, then do it about seven or nine hours after the first phlebotomy.
For those who wish to draw out the blood from their body in the opposite direction of where it flows downward, they should be bled on the second or third day.
If a body with an excess of hot blood and is aggravated experiences febrile conditions, then it should be bled in one go and a large quantity of blood should be drawn out, and the observation must be increased so that syncope does not occur; you will have preserved all other phlebotomy conditions; place your hand on their pulse and observe when the heart stops sending blood, so as to prevent death instead of syncope, for many times this happens due to ignorance and negligence on the part of the phlebotomist.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Here is my translation of the text:
And if the vein is inflamed, then leave it alone and do not touch it until the inflammation subsides.
And if the necessity arises to let out the blood gradually, and there is no excuse not to do so, then you may bleed that person on that spot or on the other arm in another vein.
When the vein known as the 'cord of the arm' is punctured in the place of the cubit or the basilica, either because they are not found or are hidden, for it is composed of those.
And the quality of the phlebotomy for the patient is that they should immerse their hand in cold water while the fistula becomes red and the vein appears prominently.
Then bind it tightly with a soft but firm ligature; and then perform the phlebotomy according to the small transverse dimension, not longitudinally or along its length.
Whether the opening is wide or your phlebotomy is such that you bleed it at the wrist, a little above the joint of the hand.
And if the flow of blood is hindered, then immerse your hand in cold water again and let the blood run into the water until you achieve what you need.
If you were in the days of summer, then you are excused from immersing your hand in cold water; but if it is winter, then place the body in warm water to temper its blood.
And the phlebotomy of this vein is safer than all other veins, as there are no pulsating veins or nerves here.
And the phlebotomy of the ulnar vein on the right hand corresponds to diseases of the liver.
The procedure of phlebotomy involves lightly binding the hand with a cloth or your own hand, after immersing it in warm water until the vein has become engorged and is clearly visible to the incision site; then make a transverse cut and if you deeply pierce this vein, no harm will come to the patient.
Take care not to harm your own hand during the phlebotomy, as only nerves lie there, stripped of flesh.
Then immerse the hand in warm water again and let the blood flow into it; for if you do not re-temper it with warm water, the blood will congeal at the incision of the vein and its outflow will be obstructed.
And when blood is extracted according to the required amount, then you place oil and salt over the vein so that it does not become immediately hardened; similarly, it is necessary for you to do this in all narrow passages.
Since the benefit of phlebotomy on the left arm is more appropriate for diseases on that side.
And it is similar in phlebotomy on him as you have done on the other.
The benefit of the cephalic vein in phlebotomy is for diseases that are on the upper parts of the body, just as with diseases of the head, and for retention of menses, and for diseases of the lungs and old ulcers on the thighs and legs, and also similar to other diseases.
And the method of phlebotomy on him is that the patient puts their foot in warm water and rubs it until the veins appear; tie over the ankle joint with a strap; and at the place where the vein comes out, mark it under your finger, which will spread like tree roots across the surface of the foot.
And therefore, a phlebotomist should use the largest branch and place it below their calf at the point of insertion because it is better and safer.
And if you perform phlebotomy on the surface of the foot, be cautious of the nerves that lie beneath it on the sole of the foot, and place your phlebotomy instrument across it as if you were about to incise it.
And let the phlebotomy vessel be ready.
But it is forbidden to raise the blood; instead, you must immerse their foot in warm water and allow the blood to flow into that vessel until it is evacuated.
And if the phlebotomist misses on the first attempt, repeat with the phlebotomy instrument a little higher up because the area is safe; do not fear harming them, but be mindful of the nerves as mentioned earlier.
Likewise, proceed with the other foot in the same manner.
And for the sciatic vein, the location, as mentioned earlier, is below the calf near the ankle of the popliteal fossa.
And the benefit of bloodletting for him is relieving hip pain when it is caused by excess blood.
The procedure of bloodletting is as follows: the patient should enter a warm bath, and then quickly and firmly bind their upper thigh from the side of the hip down to the ankle with a long, thin bandage that does not constrict.
And once it appears, you may then perform bloodletting in any way that is feasible and suitable for you, and what works best; either incise or section it, as the area is healthy.
This condition is often found in men and is easily treated; if you find it, and there is no discomfort upon feeling it, then perform bloodletting on one of its branches, which appears at the back of the foot between the little toe and the ring finger.
Be careful not to damage any nerves, and let out as much blood as you deem necessary.
Then untie the bandage and place a compress over the bloodletting site, securing it firmly but gently, as it will heal quickly.
De ventozacio means "Regarding cupping" or "On the topic of cupping." Cupping was a common medical practice during medieval times, so it is likely that this treatise will discuss its application and benefits.
Ventozas are either warts, or a disease, or made of glass.
Ventozacion is done in two ways: one way is by scarification and bloodletting, the other is ventozacion without scarification.
This ventozacion without scarification is done in two ways as well: either with fire or without fire.
There are 14 locations on the body where ventozas with scarification and bloodletting are administered. The first is in the alnocrati, which is at the back of the head; the middle one in two parts of the neck; ventozas under the jaw below the mouth; ventozas of two spatulas; ventozas on the forehead; ventozas from two phials and are made from two arms; ventozas from two nails, and those from two thighs.
Ventozation does not extract blood from the large veins but rather from small ones scattered throughout the flesh, thus avoiding extracting virtue through them as happens with phlebotomy; nor is it necessary for ventozation to be done with fire or without fire in any illness caused by fullness until the whole body has been evacuated.
Mays si necessitat provoca a ventozacio per malautia o per continua, aministrem aquella en tota hora al comensament del mes e en la fi de lu, e en le mieg loc de lu e en qualque temps sia.
And thus, when you encounter any of these situations, and especially if it is during the third or middle part of the month, we command that cupping be performed after two or three hours have passed.
The purpose of cupping at the nape is to relieve heaviness and pressure in the head, which often stems from an excess of humors that have settled into the veins; it is best for this to be done as a complete evacuation of the entire body.
This cupping site is located at the venipuncture point for the cephalic vein.
It is not advisable for someone with a weakened constitution or suffering from a cold to undergo this procedure, as it can cause them great harm.
Therefore, this should not be done on the elderly or those with weakened constitutions, especially if they are suffering from chronic illnesses.
However, there is often an oversight in this procedure, as the cupper may forget to place their hand lightly over the cups after application; you must instruct the cupper to do so, lest it cause an injury.
Cupping on the forearm is done at the venipuncture points for the basilic and brachial veins; this can lead to asthma, constriction of the airways, damage to the respiratory organs, coughing, and congestion.
And now it is necessary to apply a small amount of ventosa alkehel (a type of medicinal ointment), because if it is placed underneath, it can cause weakness in the body and stomach.
The ventozacion of alhagdahan (a form of cupping therapy) is beneficial for relieving headaches and eye pain, as well as treating migraines, premonitory symptoms, and toothache. It serves as an alternative to basilic vein bloodletting.
Make sure to instruct the cupping therapist not to apply excessive pressure during the scarification process, as this can damage the arteries and cause bleeding.
Placing the ventosa (cupping device) under the chin is useful for treating mouth ulcers, gum infections, and various oral diseases. It serves as an alternative to bloodletting from the veins located in both lips.
The ventozacion (cupping therapy) performed over the two temples provides relief for headaches, which occur due to an excess of heat.
The ventosa placed between the two thighs aids in bloodletting from three veins: the basilica, fusiform, and cephalic veins. It draws blood from all these smaller veins located closer to the skin's surface, with their numerous small branches reaching into larger veins beneath, allowing for extraction at the three main veins.
And instruct the cupper not to proceed with scarring, as the area is devoid of flesh and only nerves and arteries remain.
It is a cupping glass that has been applied to the thigh and directed towards the hemorrhoids of the anus and the pus-filled ulcers beneath.
Instruct the cupper to use a large glass cup made of iron, as this area requires a strong suction due to its sensitive nature; and ensure they have thin, delicate cups ready for those with weak veins who may be prone to scarring.
Apply smaller cups to the legs for careful treatment, as they draw blood away from the entire body and relieve ancient pains of the lungs and heart, as well as the bladder; they induce menstruation, treat gout, and provide relief for both headaches and migraines; they serve in place of two phlebotomies on either side, along with another two at the elbows.
However, they must be used cautiously as they weaken the entire body and may cause fainting in some individuals.
The advantage of cups at the elbows is akin to the benefit gained from applying them to both legs.
And the quality of cupping position is that you place the cup at the beginning with an open end and suck for a short time, and do not prolong the duration of cupping; rather, place them lightly, and remove them carefully, so that humors come to the surface equally. Do not cease to repeat this process, continuing until you see the area turn red and swell, and when blood appears.
Then you make incisions and continue the suction gradually, being mindful of the condition of the heart.
For any man with delicate flesh prone to scars, it is best to make incisions only once and not more, so as not to cause ulcers in that area.
Instruct the cupper to deepen the incisions slightly and lengthen them, while easing the suction.
If the blood is thick, it should be incised twice; for in the first incision, the path of refinement for the blood and its moisture is opened. But in the second, there is careful inspection during blood extraction to remove its grossness.
And if the blood is very cloudy, then a third scarification should be performed so that it can be obtained.
Finally, when we want to extract blood little by little or in small amounts, one scarification is sufficient for us.
And if we want to extract a large amount of blood, we make a series of small scarifications; but if we know that the blood is thick, then it is necessary to scarify deeply.
The term "scarification" only refers to the depth of the incision.
If the person has thick, hard, dark incisions and their pores are tight, then the areas for cupping should be gently lubricated, widely opened, and swiftly resolved; if it is summer time, use aloe vera oil, violet oil, crushed almond oil, or goose grease; but if it is winter, then narcissus oil, lily oil, chamomile oil, or fresh blood, and others of the like.
And if the superfluidity is thick and dark, then use red sandalwood oil, mint oil, aloe vera oil, or dill oil, and others similar.
Here is the translation of the text:
And for someone whose blood is of a very moist nature, wash their bellies with sour wine or water from myrtles and sumacs and similar plants.
And for someone whose excesses are more severe, wash their bellies with old wine or water from costmary (which is sweet marjoram), or a decoction of dill, chamomile, and the like.
Make sure the application of bellies is kept in place before bathing; then make sure it is administered immediately after the bath for an hour or two, and ensure they sleep with the application on.
What should be regulated when it comes to applying bellies to someone who has been bled before the application.
Consider this at the beginning: if the applier of bellies or the person who is to be bled has a choleric disposition and has sharp blood and inflammation, then they should take cooling substances, such as sour pickles, endive in sour wine and lettuce, wild radishes, peppermint tea, and similar things.
And let their food be things like chickens, the flesh of fat birds, and foods seasoned with sour sauces, and the like.

And it is placed on the abscesses when they occur in their navel or stomach, because by virtue of strong attraction, a man's navel and removes the stone from its place.
Similarly, it is done when it is placed on the liver and spleen to alleviate windiness in those organs.
These fomentation is administered with suction only, and some are administered using fire.
And sometimes they are administered full of cold water in diseases of the spleen.
This is why the fomentation is filled and made larger; it is only cold water or water in which herbs suitable for this purpose have been cut.
Form of fomentation administered with fire: the size of the hole should be about two fingers wide, according to how we have formed it; and the amount of pressure is half a palm in length; and on its side, at the place where it surrounds the affected part, there must be one-fifth more than what can enter into it with a needle.
It is made of goat or calf skin, with thick edges, smooth and clean, so that it does not injure the limb because of its position over it.
And it is in the middle of a wooden or metal bar where a candle with fire is placed.
And this window is indeed much larger than the one we previously mentioned; and it will be smaller for those who are not very sick or of a certain age.
The windows for children and exhausted individuals will be different from those used by the young or robust adults.
The process of placing this window with fire on the body part involves setting up a small wooden grill that is adequately positioned in front of a small wax candle, and then placing it over the middle of the crossbar at the center of the window, ensuring the fire does not burn the patient's skin.
Once it is placed on the patient's body part and our finger is positioned as mentioned earlier, when we have the windows ready and do not need to move our finger for steam to escape through that opening, then the window will be sealed.
And then move the wooden grill according to your needs, repeating this process if you require more of these windows.
Mays en ventosa que es aministrada en la malautia de plauressi, am aygua, en la qual no ha vergua transversa ni trauc, e no es aministrada sino que sia umplida de aygua, e es pausada sobre le membre tant solament.
And this is its shape: The larger this wind tunnel, the better, so it can receive a large quantity of water.
I assume you mean Chapter 97. Is there any text from Chapter 97 that I can translate or interpret for you?
Leeches are not applied to every part of the body but only to those members where cupping is impossible because of their small size, such as fingers and toes, or parts deprived of flesh like the nose and lips.
And note that leeches found in putrid, dirty water are of inferior quality.
Leave them in dirty water day and night until they are famished, without leaving any food inside their stomachs. Then empty the patient's bowels at the start with bloodletting and cupping, rub the affected member until it reddens, then place the leeches on it.
And when they have filled their bellies and stop.
If it is possible to draw off the fluid from this spot by cupping, this will be of further benefit.
And if not, then wash the area with vinegar and then with boiling water; let it be rubbed and squeezed.
And if the body's blood has been drawn out by leeches and it continues to ooze, you wrap a cloth soaked in cold water around it until the bleeding stops.
And if the blood has increased in volume, then sprinkle ground vitriol or substances with astringent qualities over it until the bleeding stops; alternatively, apply hot bean poultices to the area and leave them on until the beans adhere to the skin and the bleeding ceases.
And now, if another round of leeching is necessary, it is possible to use new ones.
And if the use of leeches is not permitted, then rub the area with fresh blood or insert a needle into it until blood flows; subsequently, apply the leeches because they attach themselves as soon as they sense any blood.
And when you want them to detach, sprinkle a small amount of ground aloe, salt, or ash over them, and they will fall off immediately.
Ayssi comensa lo prolec de la tersa partida: de restauracio. Aquest capitol es motas veguadas necessari en la art de medicina; e es restauracio de fractura e de dislocacio accident en les osses.
O, my child, know that this chapter is scoffed at by foolish doctors and the common people, those who have never studied the books of the Ancients nor read a single letter from them.
And for this reason, the practice of these scholars in our land has been kept private; I have never forgotten anything from it at any time, and I have not added what I have learned, but rather through a long study of the books of the Ancients and an understanding of their works, I extracted this knowledge.
Then I applied my knowledge to experiments and studies throughout my life.
And I have already described in this chapter all the knowledge that comes from my science and what has passed through my experience; since I have briefly written it down for you others and freed myself from a long explanation, and summarized it at the end of this summary; and I have shown it at the end of this declaration; and I have drawn in these illustrations the forms of instruments used therein, as is done by way of clarification, just as I did in two preceding chapters.
Chapter one.
Summae et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememinationem membrorum fractorum et diversorum si uniscuiusque. Here is my translation of the provided text:
Under the circumstances where there is a fracture, dislocation, or twist in the leg, you should immediately treat it by opening a vein to let out blood, or remove blood from any other part of the body if necessary; however, do not do so when prohibited for reasons such as weakness caused by low vitality, youth (children), old age (in decrepit condition), very hot weather, or extreme cold.
He should then be fed with a diet of fresh herbs and small bird meats, such as pigeons or quails; avoid fatty meats and over-indulgence in food, especially those foods that cause blood congestion, unless you are sure the wound is protected from external infection (a clean wound), and there is no fear of the matter spreading to other body parts.
Then return the patient to their regular lifestyle, as they were accustomed to before falling ill.
When the broken bone starts to heal, it is necessary for the patient to be fed with nourishing foods that are rich in protein and heavy in weight, such as sticky porridge made from flour cooked in water, rice, beans, calves' feet, tripe, fresh fish, eggs, etc. This kind of diet helps coagulate blood faster around the fracture which expedites healing process and makes it more effective overall.
E sapias que les osses trinquatz quan so en les homes que so en la primiera vilura e en los decrepitz, no es possible que sian continuatz e sian consolidatz segon lur natura per la exsiccacio dels membres de lor.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
And for this reason, it is necessary to restrict the patient's diet; a diet that consists of heavy and viscous foods, as we have mentioned before.
Know that the types of fractures vary based on the different body parts; a fracture in the tibia is different from one in the skull, and a fracture in the foot is distinct from one in the spine; similarly, all other body parts differ from each other.
I will provide you with a detailed recollection of each type of fracture in its own separate chapter.
There is also variety within the same body part for fractures. The types of fractures within the same body part are varied; there is the curved fracture and one that occurs in the joints; some are made according to the length of the bone: such as complete or incomplete fractures, transverse or oblique, comminuted fractures, depressed or not depressed, like when a skull is prepared for writing on it. There is also disruption and contusion of the brain, as well as small fissures.
And this is always an ordeal or torture in treating them, as will be recalled when their places are mentioned separately.
Sign of bone fracture. And this is known as a bone fracture due to the bend in it, and that bump or elevation felt when touched, and its appearance under pressure from your hand.
And if there is no visible bend in the affected area and you don't feel much pain upon touching and moving the bone, then it is not a fracture.
It is possible that there could be a bend or small crack, in which case you should not press on it with your hand and apply compression; instead, place on it one of the medicines mentioned below at this very moment, and bind it tightly but gently.
Know that if the affected area is bent and not split into two or has any other accidental damage, but only its corresponding parts are separated, then you should start to straighten it immediately before an abscess appears.
And if the patient develops an abscess, then let it be until a few days have passed and the abscess subsides; Then dress it in whatever way you can with lightness and ingenuity.
Know that the restoration of the patient's health, their treatment, is lighter than when this accident occurs.
And then strengthen them according to how they will remember it.
But if the bone is affected, it's necessary to stretch this broken limb at its two ends, be it an arm or a leg; use your hand if the limb is small; or use two ropes or one rope and a hand.
And be in a position where you place the limb's location according to its natural shape, while the broken parts of the limb are stretched; then it is necessary that you make these additions return with ingenuity and in whatever way you can to their places.
And take care, according to your strength, not to cause the patient pain or injury due to your operation; and make sure, as much as you can, that you apply one bone to its companion in their best forms.
Under these circumstances you should now place your hand on him, and if you see any reason for doing otherwise then correct this and adjust it according to the strength of your skill.
Avoid vigorous extension and compression as this can cause complications like infection or abscess formation due to the surgeon's carelessness, or it may lead to contraction of the limb as we have observed in such cases of their operations.
The quality of the limb's restraint is as I recommend it to be; know that broken limbs vary in their size, magnitude and shape.
And for those who are small like the arm, wrist and similar areas, it is appropriate that the wrapping be made of very fine fabric.
For those who are obese or have large areas like the thigh or leg, it is necessary that the wrapping be made of strong and hard material. The binding should connect the large member with a tight grip all around, ensuring no dirt can enter.
Then begin, start your evacuation procedure by placing a suitable dressing on the location of the fracture, using three or four wraps depending on the importance of the member. Tighten your hand slightly to secure the dressing.
Then go to the upper part of the fracture site and tighten less so that your grip doesn't hinder blood circulation. Extend the wrapping slightly on the fracture site and loosen the grip gradually as you move away from the area.
Take another bandage and wrap it around the area again, this time starting from below the fracture site. Your operation should be similar to the previous one in terms of tightening and loosening as you move away.
Under the twists of the foot place a lion's paw or cloth that matches the curvature of the fracture, if there is one; otherwise, do not pause on it any cause.
Place another bandage over them and shape these coverings properly as well, whether there is a wound or a boil in that place, then put on it whatever reduces the boil and removes inflammation; leave this for several days; then you can tighten the stars [bandages?].
Let the bandages consist of half-canes on either side and shaped in this wise manner, or made from wooden rods or palm branches, and let each bandage be as wide as this form and figure suggests:
But note that the rod placed over this fracture should be thicker and closer together than the other rods; let the length of each bandage correspond to the limb's size and dimensions, then tighten them with another bandage according to your first binding; bind this well with thread as we said before on this topic of binding, and know that the more distant a point is from the fracture site, the less tight the binding.
Here is the translation of your provided text:
Fine threads are not suitable as they will not allow you to achieve the necessary tightness with them and there should be less than a finger's width between the threads.
And if the patient is weakened by the tightness of the threads at their extremities in those places, then place beneath them pads made from coarse flaxen cloth or felted wool so that it does not cause injury.
Some bone fractures are caused by blows, and occasionally there is a dislocation of the vertebrae; I will return to this in the second chapter with further details.
Be aware that not every broken limb can be straightened with threads on the first day; this is because when the limb is large, it should not be bound with threads immediately but rather after a few days or more, depending on your assessment of the risk of abscess formation.
This is how plasters were applied in the manner of the Ancients, which they placed over fractures, dislocations, and sprains.
The common way of applying a plaster for bone setting is suitable for young children and women with delicate constitutions as it does not provide heat or cold: take some fine powder, this being the flour dust that accumulates on the walls of the mill due to the motion of the millstone.
And prepare it in this way, but add egg whites and beat the mixture until it is not too thick or thin; then use it.
Another recipe for restorative plasters suitable for fractures, dislocations and sprains: Take equal parts of assafetida, ladanum, acacia, enula [elecampane], and myrobalans (or the root of wild pomegranate), with ten parts each of myrrh and aloe; twenty parts aloes [sic] oil. Grind and sieve these ingredients, then mix them either with aloes [sic] oil or egg whites if the patient's condition is open/ulcerated. Then apply this plaster, which has a good composition and will heal bones broken slightly, and benefit many people.
Another recipe for a plaster suitable for fractures and sprains: Take ten parts of myrobalans (or wild pomegranate root), five parts each of aloe and myrrh, six parts acacia gum and two ounces of Armenian bole [iron-rich clay].
Grind all ingredients together in a mortar with great care, then sieve them and mix with either water or egg whites before administering.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
In this poultice, there is no restorative ingredient; it primarily serves to cure ulcers and expel pain.
Another type of poultice that restores blocked conditions: take leaves from the fig tree and wild poppy; mix them together, then make a poultice from these ingredients.
A condensed method for applying a poultice to aid the restoration of broken bones and to heal abscesses: take roots of marshmallow, chamomile, and violet flowers; add flour made from rye, all these ingredients are finely chopped and mixed with wine, unless the bone is scraped.
But if it is scraped, then make this with moist cilantro water or simply water.
Another method for a stronger poultice to aid the healing of hardened abscesses that impede the restoration of an injured limb: take marshmallow roots and flax seeds; add bulrush pith, meadow-sweet, marjoram, violet flowers, chamomile, all chopped together then mixed with willow water or clean water or wine, whichever is most appropriate for the condition of the limb and its discoloration.
Mays Ypocras no diyssec en le sieu libre que sia pausat sobre le membre trenquat deves la restauracio de lu sino cerot fayt de cera e de oli e no autre causa; e recomtec que sia migier entre grossitut e subtilitat.
In Wales, it has been seen that they are placed on the broken limb for its restoration and due to dryness caused by coldness there is also some lack of warmth in them as with myrrh, turpentine and similar things like those causes we have mentioned.
A way to make a plaster that soothes injuries and pain: take millet seeds, cecity peels, human hair cuttings or bird feathers, marshmallow root, and salt, all in equal parts; grind them up and sift them through a fine mesh, then the plaster is made.
The amount of time the bandage should stay on and then be removed is determined by considering if there's no pain, swelling, or bone breakage, ensuring it hasn't moved from its place; in such cases, you don't need to change it for many days. If at the site there's severe pain, swelling, or inflammation, then you must treat it immediately by unwrapping and removing the plaster.
Take a piece of cloth and a moist marine sponge, dip it in lukewarm water, and use this to wash the affected area until the swelling subsides and pain is eased; then let the limb rest for an hour; afterward, place soft wool soaked in vinegar or rose oil over it, wrap it up, and leave it overnight ensuring no abscess forms, reducing inflammation of the limb, and easing its pain.
And then repeat that subtle pressure and apply a small plaster, do not tighten it with your initial tightness, but make it delicate as the wound heals.
And if you notice that the abscess, inflammation, pain, and all other symptoms have completely subsided, and the wound requires a plaster and a bandage no longer, then repeat this process as you did initially.
And if no harm comes to the limb from any of the aforementioned causes, then do not remove the bandage for three or four days, or five, or seven; in some cases, it is left on for twenty days as per the healing process and the recovery of the limb, as mentioned earlier, until the fracture heals and the flesh coagulates over it.
Then adjust the bandage tighter than your initial tightness, accommodating the swelling of the patient's limb as their condition improves.
But if you see that the fracture site has dried out and is no longer receiving any nourishment, then know that it cannot heal properly. In this case, moisten it with cold water every time you remove the bandage; do so every three days. Loosen the bandage slightly to allow better blood flow to the limb, which will aid in its healing process, and it will recover faster.
Furthermore, the mistake that foolish bone setters make when they do not set a fracture at the beginning as it should be done, and instead set it crookedly, is an error according to their operation, causing great fear, and if this were done properly, the Ancients in their books would have written about it.
I have never seen anyone among them do this, which is why it is more reasonable not to attempt it.
Chapter Two: On Fractures Occurring in the Head.
The types of fractures are many, and their forms are diverse, with distinct causes. Some fractures occur due to the impact of space, where the force completely dislocates the bone from its socket, similar to how it affects the trunk of a tree, and this type is named 'ascial'. Others result from space piercing part of the bone, cutting through the flesh but not passing beyond; this kind of fracture is called 'levatio absoluta'.
The severity of these two types of fractures can vary, with some being minor and others more severe. One type is caused by the impact of a heavy object or a fall onto a hard surface, similar in nature.
And this fracture is penetrating, approaching the fatty tissue just beneath the bone or is on the surface of the bone; and the damage caused by these two types of fractures can be either severe or minor.
When it comes to fractures that are impacted within the bone, at its core or in the thinner parts of smaller bones (like those found in the hands and feet), this specific type is called a 'capillary fracture'.
Fractures caused by blows or the impact of stones and similar objects, which drive bone fragments into the surrounding tissue, are known as 'comminuted fractures'. They occur in hollow bones like those found in animals when they receive strong impacts on their joints.
These fractures primarily happen in the bodies of people with weak bones or those prone to osteoporosis; they are also common in children's heads.
All these types of fractures share similar symptoms: the affected areas become swollen and hot to touch; this is especially noticeable when treating open or compound fractures. I shall now provide further details on the treatment of these conditions.
We know all these types of fractures by their detection, through physical examination and asking questions about the injury; we also identify them by observing any damaged or corrupted flesh on top.
Under special circumstances when there is an exposed skull and it needs cleaning or covering with lint due to the fracture appearing black in color.
When treating fractures, one must first consider the patient's initial condition and symptoms. If you observe signs indicating severe complications like vomiting of bile, fainting, loss of consciousness, vocal impairment, syncope, acute fever, swelling of limbs or a general worsening of these symptoms in severity, then the treatment is unlikely to succeed.
If you notice symptoms that aren't severe or unusual, it is safe to assume a positive outcome and begin the treatment process.
The reason for this is that if the patient was infected at the beginning of treatment and it occurred during winter, you should expect a potential complication around day 14 based on all observed conditions.
If the infection occurred during summer days, be cautious and prepare to remove bone fragments before day 7, ensuring no fat corruption occurs near the bones, and watch for any of the previously mentioned complications.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Under the circumstances where you shave the head of an infected patient and expose it as much as possible, according to usual practice based on the shape of the infection, making sure that the weight is light upon the patient.
If you happen to detect bone involvement, a blood flow issue, or a severe infection and want to treat it cautiously, oppose the affected area with what covers it, fill the area with linen bandages soaked in wine and rose oil, let the infection rest until the abscess subsides, ensure that bleeding has stopped; then begin circumcising the bone and removing it.
This could be done in one of two ways:
The first way is to insert the bone with a narrow straight chisel like this and then apply another one slightly wider than the previous. This is its shape:
Then you would use an even larger chisel than the second one.
You will need a good number of different chisels and some of them should be wider than others; furthermore, some should be shorter than the rest, being sharp at their ends, all made out of iron or steel.
And use them to facilitate percussion on the incision so that you do not cut into the skull and cause brain damage.
If the bone is strong and hard, you must first drill into it before administering the incisions with the trepans, which are called non-penetrating trepans.
And they are not called that (non-penetrating) but rather so because these do not reach the limit of the skull bone beneath it, for when the trepan has a round edge or margin on what is below the top of the head like a small circle or rim, which prevents them from being submerged and passing through the thickness of the skull.
It is advisable that you take a large number of these trepans, each suitable for the thickness of different skull bones, ensuring that they all have pointed ends and their length or width corresponds to the amount of bone thickness in those skulls.
There are three types of trepans: The first type is used to drill into broken bone by placing the trepan on top and turning it with your fingers until you feel that the bone has been penetrated; then, switch to another location and insert whatever lies between all threads for about the thickness of a ray or similar object.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text into English:
And make sure with all caution that the scissors do not touch any part of the navel.
Then, once you have encircled the perforating bone and separated it from the navel if it is attached to it, and extracted that part, you should trim and file down its roughness on the side where there is bone using another tool similar to scissors but make sure it is thicker and more delicate than other scissors.
And if any parts of the small bones and sinews remain, then take them out easily with what you have as an instrument; and treat the wound with liniments and ointments which we have mentioned.
Another way of operating is light and distant from fear, which was described by Gaulius and praised highly; this is how he describes it: It is necessary for you at the beginning to start exposing the part of the bone in the place where the fracture is most intense and visible. Once you have exposed that part and placed beneath it the tip of these delicate scissors with a curved shape...
If the lens-shaped part is sharp and does not cut anything, and the curved part of it is in two directions forward in length, sometimes; then let the lens-shaped part be adjusted to the navel with its cutting edge directed towards the bone.

Here is the translation of the provided text:
E si fractura del os no penetra entro al pannicol, e aquo que es abscidit o es ostat del os es la facia de lu, e roman en lu asperitat e satagias subtils, lahoras cove que razas aquella asperitat e erradiques aquellas satagias am razoris subtils per les quals tu has preparat le nombre, de diversas quantitatz per que sia a tu possible administrar de aquels en tot loc les pus convenientz de lor e le pus dreyt de aquels segon aquo en que te perduzeys la tua operacio aquel os trencat e la figura de lu.
And now you must administer to yourself a portion of the reason with which you cut the bone at the beginning, using first the larger of those scalpels, and then use the finest one, without ceasing this action until you reach the innermost and most subtle part.
In any other minor fracture, where there are small and subtle breaks, you must apply a cure according to what has been lost in the correction process.
This is a reason that is not improved upon by all those who have studied this art. Take note of what we have demonstrated in the case of major fractures.
And if the skin is torn when you extract the bone, then take a cloth of similar size to the wound and submerge it in rosehip oil, place this over the wound; next, take another folded or tripled cloth that has been submerged in wine and rosehip oil, placing it on top of the first cloth with as little pressure as possible so as not to harm the nerves; finally, apply a broad bandage and do not tighten it more than is necessary to cover the size of the wound.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And you should make these powdered medications be applied over the wound, like so if they are dry; and universally administer any medicine that has cleansing properties and prevents biting.
Take care to ensure that the wound is clean before you begin treatment; avoid using ointments or other substances, and do not allow any virulence (harmful bacteria) to accumulate there. This is because when these things are placed over the brain's membrane, it becomes corrupted and aggravates the illness, leading to further malicious harm for the patient.
If the skull on the head becomes damaged and the bone is altered, especially when its treatment has been neglected or the cure has not been properly administered, and there is a darkening of its surface; then if any of these afflictions befall the patient which we have mentioned previously, you must know that their condition will worsen significantly.
But if there is no darkness present but rather from the medicine applied on top of it and this medicine's nature causes such a darkening effect then make sure to use some wax, honey in one part, rose oil in three parts, mix those together with a piece of cloth, and place that over the skull. Then treat the patient further with medicinal spices until they are healed.
Chapter III.
On the restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Know that the nose is not broken but rather the two thin bones of the nasal bridge have been separated or one of them has been slightly displaced, as there are two such bones in it; since the part below [is] cartilaginous and cannot be actually broken, only deformed and rendered crooked.
However, if one of the two bones is actually broken, then you should introduce your little finger into their nose and with your index finger correct that fracture from within while applying pressure to it externally until the nose returns to its original shape. And this should be done with ease by you, take care not to hurt the patient during your operation.
And if the fracture is in the higher of the two bones and your finger cannot reach it, then you should use a needle that has been slightly thickened at its end.
And if the fracture is in both bones, then you should do likewise.
And treat his restoration on the first day of the fracture if it is possible; otherwise, you must wait for the pus to subside.
Then insert a piece of linen cloth into the end of the nose, if the fracture is in one part, or place two cow's horns, if the fracture is in two parts, and let the horn be of such size that it fills the hole of the nose.
And some of the ancient restorers say that the horns should be wrapped in leather and changed every day, but I have not seen this done; instead, it is better if the cloth is dipped in egg white mixed with powder from a mill; then leave the horn in place until the bone is set and the cartilage has hardened.
And sometimes a quill can be inserted into the nose instead of a horn, especially if there is a risk of infection as it is wrapped in linen cloth; this method should be used when the nasal fracture is severe and the patient is not restricted from breathing.
And this is not a necessary step for you to take; if you wish, you may use the quill, and if you prefer, you may proceed with the horns.
And if another abscess occurs, apply a plaster made of wax or pitch infused in vinegar and rose oil, or use diaquilon.
But if there is no abscess present, you must plaster the area with a mixture of wheat flour and powdered resin combined with egg white; then place on it a poultice of lion's fat, and do not blow your nose for any reason.
But if the nasal bones are broken with a minor fracture or have become crushed, you must separate them and extract any small fragments using suitable instruments; then sew up the wound, treat it with an ointment that promotes flesh generation and hardening, and apply plasters appropriate for this purpose.
And if there is an ulcer inside the nose, you must treat it with cow dung and insert lead tubes until it is completely healed.
It seems that "Capitol .iiii." refers to Chapter 4 in this medieval medical treatise. Is there another portion of the text you would like me to translate or explain?
On the restoration of the jaw when it is dislocated."
When the jaw is broken but there is no infection in the fracture, check if the break is only on the outer part and not split into two pieces with a curve inside; then this fracture is minor.
And now, if the fracture is on the right side, insert your left index finger into the patient's mouth; similarly, if the fracture is on the left jaw, use your right index finger instead; then push with that finger against the swelling of the inner part of the fracture while pulling gently from outside using your other hand; do this carefully to align both parts.
If the jaw fracture has already split into two parts, then you must apply an extension to both pieces while trying to restore its original straightness as much as possible.
And if there is tooth damage and disruption to the jaw, tie those teeth you wish to keep with gold or silver wire or with silk thread; then place wax over the broken jaw and cover it with a double layer of cloth, placing on top a large, appropriately-made bandage or a piece of sole leather as long as the jawbone itself. Finally, bind these together so they stay in place but avoid any further damage to the patient.
And command the patient to rest and remain calm, and give them a light diet, removing any harmful foods.
If you notice that the patient's figure is distorted in any way, then cut and bind them on the third day; and proceed to rectify what has been altered, apply powder of mallow, egg white, or bran flour, for you will have removed their cerotae, and place woolen cloth over the plaster.
And so when the plaster is attached and adjusted to them, and the bone's position is not altered, leave it be, do not remove the plaster until they are healed and the fracture has strengthened; for many times this fracture will heal in three weeks.
And if another case of deep abscess occurs, then administer the treatments we have previously mentioned several times until they are healed and the abscess is drained.
And if the fracture is accompanied by a wound, consider whether it is a separated bone fragment or splintering; you must carefully remove those splinters with an instrument suitable for their extraction.
Under these circumstances if the wound is narrow, then widen it with a fleam according to how much you need.
Then when you have finished these procedures and no improvement has been made, then if the wound is wide you should sew it up; otherwise, place on it one of the plasters appropriate for this condition until it becomes healed.
Chapter 5.
On the restoration of the collarbone when it is broken.
Here is my best translation of your text into English:
For when it is broken or separated, and also if the bones are not completely split into two pieces but still somewhat joined together in an unnatural way such that no ligaments are injured; or again, as sometimes happens, if there is a fracture with injury to blood vessels but without much displacement of bone parts; in these cases where there is little damage done to flesh and sinews surrounding it healing will take place quickly while those fractures accompanied by severe damages involve greater difficulty during treatment because they require more complicated procedures.
And the operation for this kind of fracture (with injury to blood vessels) requires two assistants: one should hold and support the broken part while the other extends or stretches out the patient's neck towards that area.
Then bind the fracture with these same splints, making sure it takes on the correct shape and does not stand out too prominently or sink into any hollows.
And if you need more extension, then place a pillow made of cloth or wool under the patient's chin, its size depending on how much extension is required; extend and raise their neck while shortening the circumference with your hand so that you can bind the fracture properly.
If you cannot draw the end of the neck to the broken parts outside due to it being attached by tendons and ligaments (which would prevent such movement), then have the patient lie on their back with a medium-sized pillow placed beneath their neck.
And the minister presses on the patient's muscles at these points until the bone of the furcula is elevated, which is above the breastbone. Then you correct the fracture and bind it with the aforementioned dressings.
If you feel that the pieces of the furcula are jagged and uneven, it is necessary to make an incision over it and extract those jagged fragments with ease.
And if it is retained within the bone, you devise an incision of it with one of the incisions you have prepared for this purpose. Because you had placed below the furcula the instrument that serves as a lever; and this is the instrument made of wood or iron which has this shape:
It is similar to a scoop with this concave shape and its width should be according to what you have needed of it: in accordance with the size or narrowness of the bone.
But its length should be as long as it is feasible for you during the operation; let there be two ends, and one end should be wide while the other is narrow.
And if the rupture of the wound you have incised when extracting the jagged fragment from the bone is wide and you are certain of suppuration, then you should adjust both lips of the wound with sutures.
And if the rupture is minor or you fear infection, then fill the wound with cloth and powders according to the size of the incision.
And if an infection occurs, dip cloth in vinegar, rose oil, and wine, then place it on the affected area.

And do not loosen the ligature unless you notice an abscess or inflammation in the specific location within twelve days.
Then renew the plaster if you see that his condition is improving due to this treatment, tighten it in place, and restore what has been broken until the fracture of the fork (collarbone) is healed.
And let it be tightened and healed according to the month within twenty-eight days; in some men, this can be done in less time.
The Roman numeral "VI" typically represents the number 6, so this may indicate that it is chapter 6 of a larger text or document.

Regarding restoration or treatment of shoulder fractures."
Spatula tart is broken in its place inside him and it's not totally broken of him, but only its edges.
And when his place is broken - and it's broken in the middle of him - and it's not known except by touch, then according to the figure of the fracture make you its preparation and reduce that according to its natural shape with all kinds of ingenuity that are possible for you.
Then place on the spot powder of eggshell and beeswax; then place a cloth pad over it, doubled; then lay upon him a thin slice of smooth board according to the amount required for the whole spatula or more if necessary.
But if you leave the board with a concave spot in any of the places of the spatula, then fill that concavity with beeswax, and then raise the board according to evenness.
Then strengthen above with a long bandage with decent tightness and the stability of the board until it is not moved from its place.
Consider the binding every day; and whenever it is loosened, bind it again and tighten it, and level the board if it has moved from its place.
And turn the patient onto their side.
The spatula is replaced after either twenty or twenty-five days.
And when this number of days has passed, you untie the bindings and know for certain which bone has been neither damaged nor dislocated.
And if you proceed to the place of a broken bone and apply an iron chain there, then you cut into it, open it up, and do as we have said in dealing with the fracture of the humerus: treat any abscesses that may occur.
The text you provided does not contain the phrase "Capitol .vii.". Could you please clarify what specific information or translation you would like regarding this? I'd be happy to assist!
On the restoration of a broken foot.
The foot, in some cases, is broken at its middle and this tends to happen; but more often it is the ends of it that are dislocated and crushed.
Regarding the complications of such an injury: when the middle part is broken, it tends to cause severe pain in breathing and coughing, as well as difficulty with urination or vomiting blood; the broken bone ends can be felt within the cavity.

Chapter 8.
Regarding the restoration of ribs when they are fractured or dislocated.
Know that fractures of the ribs only occur in thick or prominent areas along the back, and dislocations do not happen at their tips towards the front because they are cartilaginous there. And its diagnosis is not hidden from your feelings, you must examine it with these said tools.
And the restoration should be such that it aligns the fracture with these said tools as best possible, ensuring it is aligned as needed, then plaster and strengthen the broken bone with a splint if required.
If the fracture of the ribs extends towards the armpits, then the patient will experience severe pain and stabbing sensations, much like that experienced by someone with pleurisy, and this is due to the bone piercing the membrane; they will also suffer difficulty in breathing, coughing, and vomiting large amounts of blood; this condition is difficult to cure.
And the Ancients have designed many ingenious devices for this purpose.
And regarding this, he says: it is necessary to remove the food of the patient that produces inflammation and gas, so that the abdomen becomes inflated and extended, pushing the hernia out.
We would have hoped that this would not be a light cause to produce superficial abscesses, but if it already happened, then it helps with that.
And some of them said that it should be placed on top of the gas and then squeezed strongly; this seems reasonable, but there is a fear that the gas will push the superfluous fluids to the weak spot.
And some said: the place should be covered with wool that has been soaked in warm oil, and powders should be placed between the ribs before filling it up, ensuring that the bandage is tight like a round covering; then the patient is treated for pleurisy with food and medicine.
If a strong cramp afflicts the patient who is not suffering, and the bone breaks through the covering with a puncture wound, we fear for the patient; then it is necessary to make an incision over that spot, exposing the broken rib, and place upon it an instrument that retains its shape (a splint), as previously mentioned, and easily cut away the bone, extracting it.
And then, when we align the two lips of the wound, if it is large, we use sutures, and treat it with plasters until it heals.
And if there is an abscess inside [the wound], treat it by dipping in rose oil powder and place it over the area, ensuring the patient is cured with what covers the abscess inside.
Let him lay on his side while sleeping until he is healed.
It appears that this text has moved to a new chapter or section, indicated by the "Capitol .ix." heading. This likely signifies Chapter 9 of the treatise.
On restoring fractured vertebrae of the spine and neck."
Sometimes it happens that there is a fracture in the bones of the neck, and then it affects their coating, and similarly with the vertebrae of the back. And when this happens to someone and you want to know if they will recover or not, consider this: if you see their limbs already weakened, numb, and lifeless, unable to move or exert strength; and when you squeeze them with your fingers or prick them with a needle without causing any pain, then you should know that they are not healed. In such cases, it is considered fatal.
And if they can feel the pressure of your fingers and are pricked without pain, then you know that the neck bone is saved and the patient will recover.
And if you see similar symptoms in the vertebrae of the neck and want to know if it will heal or not, then consider the patient's feet.
When you see that their feet are already numb and the same happens to their limbs, then when they lie down on their back, watch for windiness and a lack of self-control in their bodily functions; sometimes, they will be turned over onto their back and want to urinate but cannot. In such cases, it is considered fatal, and you should not attempt to treat them.
However, if none of these causes occur, the cause is better and more minor.
And the treatment for it is to pierce and drain the abscess by placing some ointment or a compress soaked in warm broth on the affected vertebra; apply to that area several times a day until the abscess has drained.
Then apply one of the invigorating and strengthening plasters, pressing it gently onto that area; instruct the patient to rest and remain calm, and not sleep on the painful side until they are healed.
And if it happens that the thigh bone becomes dislocated or any other cause arises which separates it, then you must cut above the joint and extract that bone; then rejoin the two edges of the wound, with sutures if necessary; and treat that area with an ointment made from plant juices until healed.
But if the lower part of the thigh bone is broken and it's at the end of the shaft, then you must insert your left index finger into the anus and align the broken bone with your other hand as best as possible by manipulating from outside; then apply a plaster and splint, using both if required, and bandage that area tightly.
And if you feel shattered bones in them, then operate on that area and remove it, treating the wound with a treatment that precedes healing.
It seems like you're referring to chapter 10 of a medical text or treatise. Could you provide more context or information from this chapter so I can translate it accurately? Feel free to share the full text if needed!
On the restoration of the hernia."
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And for their restoration, you should stretch out your hand over that area above the fracture as shown in the illustration.
And if the fracture is only at their extremity, then you should bind that part according to what appears suitable in the equation, making it equal to what assembles their natural figure.
However, if the fracture is in their back or has affected the lower parts, then you should make the patient lie on their stomach so that you can prepare for the restoration of that fracture. And once you have bound that part, place a plaster over it, then place a wooden or metal splint on top, and secure it tightly without fear of piercing the fracture or dislodging the bone.
Bind the cavity with something that fills that space so that it maintains the tightness according to equality, and command the patient to sleep on their back or side.
However, if there is an occurrence of an abscess, then you should cease the extension and restoration process until the abscess has been subdued, place on them whatever alleviates it as previously mentioned; then return to their restoration, securing that part accordingly.
And if it happens that the bones are broken or shattered, then you treat them.
Here is my translation of the text:
De restauracio de la fractura del adjutori.
Adjutori is what we call that area between the elbow and the head of the shoulder.
And if it is broken, its restoration can be done in one of two ways. One way is by taking a wooden splint of medium thickness and shaping it like this: [describe the shape and dimensions].
If it is tied at two ends with ligatures and then suspended from an elevated position, [describe the procedure or its purpose].
Let the patient sit on a chair, then extend their broken arm over the wooden splint so that it reaches its wrist in the middle, where the curve of the splint is attached. [Explain the purpose or provide further instructions].
Suspend something heavy over that to provide counterweight, or have the assistant pull on it from below; as the physician applies pressure with both hands to the fracture site until the bone sets back into place as it should be. [Further instructions or explanations].
The other method is to have the patient lie on their back with their neck supported, and suspend their arm from its collarbone using ligatures; two assistants are then positioned, one above the fracture site supporting it with their hands, while the other stands below the patient; each assistant extends their arms in opposite directions. [Describe what happens next or provide a conclusion to the procedure].
And if you want the extension to be stronger, then pull on the fracture with one ligament and apply another ligament above it, while each of the two assistants pulls in opposite directions.
And if the fracture is close to the end of the muscle, then you should place half of the ligament over the wrist and the other below the fracture near the elbow.
Similarly, if the fracture is close to the elbow, then it should be placed on that spot and above that elbow with the ligament.
Secure it with ease and without effort, and when it is secured according to what is required and applied properly, then pull on that part without causing an open wound.
But if an open wound occurs, then leave the bandage in place for seven days and apply a poultice of moldy wool soaked in vinegar and rose oil over the wound until it heals, before pulling on that area again.
The way to pull on it is by applying a plaster cast over the fracture and then wrapping a bandage of new cloth around the cast. Adjust the arm with that aid and place their hand open over their muscle.
And place the cloth and bandage over the arm support so that the arm is in a position of alignment; unless some cause prohibits this due to a broken bone.
And then use crutches.
And make sure you place over the fracture that crutch which is thicker and stronger than the others; leave a finger's breadth between each crutch, and let the length of the crutches be according to the break with an addition of three fingers on either side.
Then secure the crutches with the binding method described at the beginning of this chapter.
Ensure that your binding over the site of the fracture is extra tight. And if the break extends further, make the binding looser accordingly.
Therefore, when you see the positioning of the crutches and binding as we have described here, in that hour you should restore the limb to its original position.
And if you fear the development of an abscess, then leave the binding and crutches in place for seven days as we have described.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
But if you are confident that there will be no cause for this, then do not remove the ligature before three days or more.
And let the patient's sleep be on their back, with their hands placed on their stomach.
Place a clean woolen pad on the assistant, and ensure at all times during the night or day that the figure of the broken limb is not loosened nor its bandage dissolved, therefore correct this with your virtue.
Place the patient's food according to the order given before, so that their diet is light at first and then gradually becomes heavier as they start to recover.
It is customary for the assistant and servant to be close by for forty days, after which they should be released and allowed to take a bath, and administered with ointments that will aid in the healing process.
If the fracture is in an exposed place, then you should not remove its bandages and splints for ten days or even two months.

De restauracio de fractura del bras.
Arms are composed of two bones which are called the ulna and radius; of these one is small, this is the bone that receives the little finger, and the other is large, this being the one on which the little finger rests below.
And sometimes only the larger bone is broken or just the smaller one, but often both are broken together.
And when it is the smaller bone that is broken above, then its restoration is light and healing of it is lighter.
And when the larger bone is broken below, its fracture is bad and healing of it is difficult.
But worse still is when both bones are broken together.
So when the bone that is broken is the smaller one above, it is best for the doctor to apply little extension with an easy splint while it heals.
But if the larger bone is what is broken, then it requires more forceful extension.
And if both ulna and radius bones are broken together, then you must apply an even stronger extension.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And place a cushion in front of them at their waist or chest level, so that the patient does not exert themselves.
Then have the minister extend the patient's arm from below with their hand or a cloth, and another minister extends it in a similar manner from above.
Then the doctor should smooth out the bone, reducing it to its best possible shape.
And if there is damage or deformation of the bone, then you must carefully replace each piece in its correct position with your skill.
If you encounter a badly damaged bone that is beyond repair and does not align with your hopes for restoration, then desist from further attempts and remove it as we have described above.
But if the fracture is accompanied by an open wound (plaga), I have already addressed this in a separate chapter, so take care of that first.
And if an abscess (apostema) develops at the beginning of your restoration process, then you must apply a plaster made from rose oil and white wax, ensuring it is somewhere between thick and thin, and firmly wrap the plaster over the affected area until the abscess subsides. Then remove this plaster and place an ointment prepared with powder of mallows and egg white on top; let the plaster that covers the fracture be thicker and stronger.
E sapias que·l nombre de las stelas del bras so vi en las majors disposicios, o sia la fractura en un focil o en dos focils ensemps.
Then place your tourniquet over the fracture site as tightly and forcefully as possible. The tighter you apply pressure above or below the fracture, the softer you should make the tourniquet according to the guidance at the beginning of this chapter.
And the bandages that are wrapped around the fracture should be soft and damp, not hard or rough. The tourniquet that is tightened should be made of material that is precisely halfway between fine and coarse, as we have recommended.
And consider the limb and its movement after several days. If any cause of correction occurs that is necessary for the limb's movement and this pain happens to the limb, then it will be beneficial for you to immerse the limb in warm water until this discomfort ceases.
Leave the limb unrestrained so that it may rest, then replace the tourniquet.
And if the tourniquet has been loosened and the bone is already softened and resembles those [bones], then rectify everything with your skill.
Consider carefully if the tourniquet is too tight and thus preventing nourishment from reaching the limb; in this case, you should loosen it slightly and leave it for a few days to allow circulation of nutrients, then tighten it again.
But if the patient does not experience any of the causes we have mentioned, then it is not necessary to treat them within approximately twenty days or so.
Then the patient's hand should be suspended to restrict its agitated movements, and make them sleep on their back.
Be aware that this fracture heals in approximately thirty days or thirty-two days, but with strong care, it may heal within twenty-eight days, and all of this depends on the patient's constitution and the strength of their body.

On the restoration of fractures in the fingers and those mentioned above."
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
And when there is a fracture or dislocation of the hand, it is necessary for the patient to be laid down and supported by pillows according to their comfort, then place his hand over the extended one.
Then the minister should extend the broken bones, and the doctor will adjust them until they are aligned properly.
And then it is necessary to apply a plaster and packing material (such as cotton or wool), unless an abscess occurs, in which case you should be cautious; place a cloth according to the size of the affected area, and wrap it with linen cloth.
However, if the injury is located between the parts within the palm of the hand, make a circular pad out of cloth and ask the patient to grasp it with their injured palm. Then secure it tightly with a long strip of cloth.
And use a leather strap with cloth attached to it for elevation, ensuring the leather is in contact with the palm. Secure it properly as needed.
If the fracture is located on the outer side of the hand, place one bandage above it and another pad below in the palm, so that the hand is open and straight. Then apply a compression wrap, similar to how you would wrap a cat's paw with bandages between its fingers.

On restoring fractures of the hip bone."
The bones of the hip have been shattered and are clearly broken, as evidenced by their conversion to powder in front and above.
To restore the patient's health, we strengthen one ligature over and another under the fracture; let the patient lie on his belly and face down.
Then the minister should extend all ligatures to their limit according to quality when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
But if it is near the root of the hip, then let the ligature be tied below at the end of the penis so that extension can take place there, and another ligature under the fracture.
Similarly, if the fracture is close to the end, then let the ligature be tied near the anus and extension take place in lower areas.
Then the doctor should put both of his hands on the bone and reduce it to its natural shape and join the bones by a good joint; you must then apply plaster and keep it tight unless gangrene occurs in the limb. Here is my translation of your provided text:
The stricture should be made like this: cover the fracture with a hard bandage and fold it over two or three times, removing all superfluous material; then wrap the leg from above to below reaching down to the ankle and the bottom of the calf.
Insert a long piece of wood between the calf and thigh near the fracture site; then bring the ends of this over the higher point on either side so that they cross above, and wrap what is superfluous around the leg and calf again.
Then place splints over the site of the fracture on the thigh, placing one star-shaped splint over the bones of the calf as well.
Fill the spaces between calf and thigh with soft linen cloths to ensure the structure of the bandage is maintained.
Begin the tight bandaging over the fracture site with three or four turns; the further you move away from this point, the less tight and heavy your binding should be.
Extend the two ends of the stick to the lower point where they reach the ankle; then tie both sets of splint ends on the other side so that the bandage is not loosened from its place.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Mays si en le os es pessa del os la qual pongua, lahoras cove que tu engualhes aquel segon que a tu es possibla; e sino, fen sobre lu e remau aquel, e cura am aquo del qual es precedida la rememoracio entro que sia sanat.
And sometimes this fracture of the hip is strengthened by being adjusted with stars (i.e., set using astrological guidance), as we have said for the arm in the treatise on fractures.
However, when restoring the limb in this manner, do not cause a limp for the patient; and if it is restored alone without applying the other leg, it is necessary that there will be a limp on whichever side it always was.
Know that the hip is strengthened in 40 days or a little more or less, and this time frame varies according to different bodily constitutions and other dispositions.
This seems to indicate that the previous statements were part of Chapter 15 in an unspecified book or manuscript. I cannot provide a translation as it is just a chapter title marker, but I am happy to continue translating the treatise if you provide more text.
On the restoration of the fracture of the knee joint.
Know that a fracture of the knee joint often results in atrophy.
However, if there is a fracture of the knee joint, it is only a fissure or tear in its parts, and this is what we call 'plague' or has been called so; everything stated above applies to this as well.
And the restoration of the patient is done in such a way that what is broken or separated within their body parts must be aligned, brought together, and joined as closely as possible through approximation, ease, and craftsmanship.
Then apply a plaster or bandage over that round area, if deemed necessary by you; secure it firmly with a suitable binding.
Next, consider all the treatments and recommendations we have provided for other types of fractures; these are similar to those for swelling or inflammation, in that they act as preventive measures against any unforeseen complications during healing.
It seems you have provided the Roman numeral XVI (16), which may indicate a chapter or section heading in the medieval medical treatise. If there is more context or text related to this, feel free to provide it for further translation or interpretation!
On the restoration and treatment of leg fractures."

And if the bone is dislocated from its most fragile part, then bend the leg toward the front of the body.
And if a thicker bone is dislocated, pull it downward gently, as this type of injury often requires special care.
Then proceed to administer extension, correction, and alignment of the bones according to their natural alignment.
Beware, however, if the leg bone fracture is comminuted with multiple splintered pieces, ensure that extension is applied more gently and less forcefully, relying on your skill to ease any discomfort.
And in the case of any operation on the leg that involves the arm, such as when you align bones and perform a full surgical procedure, take wooden pieces made from pine wood and place them beneath the affected area, securing them with palm branches; tie these together using smaller twigs, ensuring they are not too thick, and make their length according to the length of the leg, extending down to its lowest point.
Then wrap each of these in two layers of cloth according to their length, placing one on the front part of the leg and the other on the back side, ensuring they extend down to the base of the foot.
Here is the translation of the given sentence:
And a wooden board has been administered, according to the length of the leg; it is placed on them to keep that area immobile.
But take care to do this in the case of fractures; it is called 'plaster' specifically.
Then examine the leg each day and study it from behind with care; keep an eye out for abscesses, inflammation, or other similar issues; and if any of these occur, apply what is necessary until they are healed.
The number '17' in English corresponds to the Roman numeral XVII. Is there another line from the treatise you would like me to translate?
On the fracture of the talus bone and bones of the foot, as well as those described.
The talus bone is rarely subject to fracture; rather, it is the foot bones that are prone to fractures on occasion; and as for the toes of the foot, they only suffer from dislocation or misalignment.
And if the foot bones suffer from a fracture and become elevated against each other as a result, then let the patient place their foot on the prepared ground like this.
And then place one foot on what is elevated above those bones, and then step on them, press down, and push those bones back into their places.
And then put an ointment plaster on top of it and cover it with a bandage; place below the belly of the foot a small table whose two sides are flat.
And then lift that foot with a downward stretch, as you have wrapped it in bandages and other materials required.
And when three or four days have passed, you can then untie the bindings; for you will find that the bones have been pushed back into place, whether they were trapped or dislocated, and so your work is done here.
But if some say their bones are trapped, restore those bones and push them back into place as I have shown you in the restoration of the fingers of the hand. Then place the trapped finger on top of a stick that is as long as the finger itself and has a slight bend to it; then put this foot on the small table I described earlier, and lift that foot with an appropriate stretch.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
And it is important for you not to forget that you should consider all the causes I mentioned to you regarding other fractures and accidents we have discussed, and apply them accordingly.

Regarding the fracture of the woman's pubic bone, the boy's penis bone, and the man's penis.
When a woman's womb is constricted, then make her cease in the lying-in chamber and then incline her slightly to the back part of the spine, and let her be held from behind.
Then let the midwife fill the womb with cotton, and it should be done in her so that she feels it; then let the woman be shaken, and raise her back little by little, for all this has been forgotten before being placed opposite the opening of the womb as expected, and the bone returns to its original state.
Then place powders on her back, and when she wants to urinate, wet the cotton to facilitate it; then let her urinate, and return everything as it was at the beginning, then restore her powder as before.
Do so for seven days or thereabouts; for it is restored.
And if you want, take a sheep's bladder and tie it over the patient's neck with a piece of sugarcane; then insert the entire bladder into her womb, and then blow into the cane with force so that the bladder is inflated inside the womb, for the fracture returns to its original state.
And then it should be filled with cotton and stay like that for some days as we have recommended, until it is healed.
When the bone of a man's or woman's arm is broken, then administer what we have recommended for restoring and healing the hip bone.

But for the man's penis when it is broken, take a goose quill and insert the penis into it; then place over it a wrap of cloth, and let it be wrapped up, and then leave it like that for three days or thereabouts, and it will be healed.
The nineteenth chapter.
On restoring broken bones when there is a wound.
For someone to whom happens a broken bone with a wound, and especially if the bone is big like the thigh bone or the arm bone, or similar to those, you should treat and remove blood from that area as soon as possible, if the conditions for bloodletting are present in your patient as we have said above.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And now begin to heal the fracture on that very day, and do not delay it, lest there be an abscess.
If an abscess occurs, then wait to begin the restoration process until the tenth day, after the abscess has healed, and do not approach him on the third or fourth days at all, for you will cause great harm.
If the broken bone is protruding from an open wound, it is advisable to pierce and realign it with your hands as gently and minimally invasive as possible.
If the displacement is not accessible by hand and you need to reduce it, use this instrument; it is made of iron, with a length of seven to eight fingers, and its width should be tailored to the extent of the injury. The physician must have three or four such instruments at his disposal for treating all kinds of fractures.
And let it be round in shape, and of little thickness so that it doesn't bend during compression when performing the operation.
And it has a sharp tip at its end, which is serrated along the edges; and its upper part should be slightly thickened, while from its middle to the ends it should be divided into segments.
This is how it looks:
And in Greek, it is named 'labrum voluntas artellarum', which translates to a shallow dish.
It should be placed so that its acute end is elevated above the prominent bone.
Push that against a depression behind the bone and secure it with a suitable bandage.
Then try to align the ends of the fracture between them; and if the broken end is fine and does not fit well with the instrument by itself, you must push that bone segment in so that the instrument can have a firm grip on it.
But if you cannot reduce the bone completely using what we have described, then cut that with one of the knives we mentioned or saw it with a saw in whatever way is possible for you.
And then remove what remains in the bone of roughness and small scratches.
And when the bone is reduced, and then the reduction causes the patient great pain again, you should know that the bone has not returned to its natural place; so do this, as it will greatly benefit the patient.
Once you have completed the restoration of the bone, then immerse a cloth in black styptic wine and apply it; especially if it is summer, do not place on the wound any kind of ointment or oil, so as to avoid causing decay or corruption.
And then give the patient stars at the time of completing the restoration of the bone, and leave the wound uncovered so that you can cut away the flesh with scissors and use appropriate dressings according to the size of the wound.
Take utmost caution not to strain the wound with the fracture, as many foolish doctors have done this and brought about the death of their patients or caused them severe illness; only harm comes from it. And if your binding is light, soft, different from the binding of other fractures.

Here is my translation of the provided text: And for those swellings that are separated downward and extracted, those that remain unseparated from them and cause the member to be afflicted with pain, make an incision in them as you can.
And if there is swelling in the wound due to abscesses or other types of corruption and putrefaction, it is necessary to apply the appropriate water for its cure, as described earlier in this chapter.
Now, let me explain what you should do when the bone is dislocated: it protrudes from the limb like the bones of the hip or thigh and resembles those in larger limbs. Do not attempt to pull it out forcefully, as this may lead to various complications that can cause death. Instead, leave it alone for about twenty or thirty days, and then treat the wound if you see fit; otherwise, just let it be.
I apologize but I don't understand your request. Would you like me to translate another paragraph of the medieval medical treatise?
On the treatment of knots that form on the scar of a fracture.
Certain complications can arise with these knots on the healed fracture scar, especially when they are close to joints and distort the shape of the limb; sometimes, it may even hinder its natural movement.
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
And leave the bandage tight without loosening it for many days; then loosen that one and apply another, while still applying pressure to the swelling; or place a lead plate over it appropriately, because lead has the property of reducing everything that is inflamed in the limbs.
When the swelling has become hard and tight, and it is necessary to incise and open it widely, then cut into that part of him which is highest, remove the superfluous and protruding matter, or drain it with some instruments while still applying pressure; and treat it until it is healed.
I am unsure what you mean by this request. Could you please provide more context or information? I'd be happy to assist once I understand your query better!
Concerning the restoration of fractures, when it is restored but what remains of that limb stays weak and frail without returning to its natural state.
When a fracture of the bone is restored but the limb remains weak and frail, it occurs due to various reasons: one being an excess of fluids in the ligaments and their attachments failing as they should; or due to excessive tightness of the ligaments which prevents proper nourishment from reaching the limb; or because of too much superfluous bandaging; or unnecessary movement at the wrong time; or a lack of blood flow caused by weakness in the patient's body.
And the cure for this is to give the patient something soft and gentle to eat until their blood has multiplied within them, administer baths, and surround them with warmth and joy.
Then place clay on the affected limb, ensuring that the clay draws out and absorbs any excessive nourishment from it, or continue to apply thick, lukewarm water compresses until the nourishment flows back into its natural state.
The number "xxii" likely represents chapter 22 in this medieval medical treatise. Is there any specific text from this chapter that you would like me to translate or explain? I can provide further assistance if needed!
Regarding the healing of broken bones that have been improperly set, avoid any operation or attempt to move them for fear of causing further damage."
When there is a recurrence of deformity and swelling in the healed member, as well as pain and tenderness at the fractured bone and joint, and if due to this, the shape of the limb is affected, but however the limb is not restricted from its natural movement, then it is not necessary for you to take heed of those who believe that this limb has recently been broken.
But there have been many false doctors and healers who have done this in our land, and such an operation is highly deplorable as it leads to great fear with the outcome often being fatal.
But if there is lameness and stiffness that is recent, then it is necessary to apply poultices with tepid water in which are mixed softening herbs, such as marshmallow leaves and roots, as well as others like them; and have the patient use a plaster with a softening ointment such as diacylum well-prepared; or let him take a mucilage of marshmallow root and be anointed with goose grease or almond oil, and be plastered with it; or they may eat fat figs and be wrapped in pigeon feathers, and likewise with the other medicines which are called consolidating poultices.
And sometimes it is dissolved with gentle and frequent friction that should be done with the most humid substances, and you must administer some movement of the member at all times.
If the tortuosity has already advanced and is done strongly and turned into a stone, and requires the use of iron to cure it, then it is necessary to stop its growth and dissolve what continues from it, and remove with fine knives that which superfluously ties up this bone, and facilitate ease in that task with care and study.
It seems you may have provided an incomplete sentence or fragment of text. Could you please provide more context or clarify what you would like me to do with this information? I'd be happy to assist you further!
On the topic of dislocation.
Dislocation is the displacement of any joint from its place, preventing its mobility and distorting the figure of the member; it causes great pain and injury to the patient.
So when any dislocation occurs, it is necessary to quickly pierce and reduce the member back into place; one must not delay this reduction as if delayed, the joint will become inflamed and very hard due to inflammation, making it difficult to reduce the dislocation.
Certainly! Here's my translation of your provided text:
Here is the translation of the first source sentence:
And every part [of the body] should be treated with this [treatment] of which the description will follow in its place.
I have already arranged the chapters on dislocation according to what is followed in fractures, from the uppermost part of the body to the lowermost.
Chapter XXIV.
On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
When both lower jaws are dislocated and the dislocation is made in one of two ways: either they are pushed out of their places by a small movement, being slightly softened; or they are completely dislocated with great force, so that they are softened at the point of the joint, where the patient's tongue runs over and he cannot keep it back nor close his mouth, and his tongue is wrapped around itself.
But when the patient's dislocation is small, it often returns on its own due to minor causes in most cases.
But if the dislocation is complete and severe, it should be reduced gently and not delayed at all.

And this should be administered with ease, and you must not work over the perception of the mouth regarding eating and drinking and recitation, while the jaw is still broken and healing.
And if it is difficult to reduce the dislocated jaws when they are displaced and have not returned to their positions, then great care must be taken as fever will likely occur alongside frequent sweating, and often the stomach of the patient becomes agitated, causing them to vomit bile.
And when you see this happening, know that it is a sign of impending doom; for most patients who experience these symptoms will pass away within ten days.
The number twenty-five in Roman numerals is represented as "XXV". Would you like me to convert any other numbers for you?
On the reduction of the dislocation of the furcula and the end of the muscle."
Furcula is not dislocated from the inside of the thigh due to its connection with the feet; sometimes it is dislocated outwards, and this can be felt.
And to restore the patient, have them lie on their back and extend their arms. Then squeeze the area with your palm using strong pressure, for it will return to its place.
And then apply an ointment and powder plaster over that area, binding it firmly in place.
The extremity of the one whose shoulder is cut and connected to that place will never be dislocated again; it should be reduced and bandaged as we have said, according to your equipment.
Then apply an ointment and powder plaster, and use a bandage to secure it tightly. Instruct the patient to maintain tranquility and rest until they are healed.
With this method, the extremity of the muscle is reduced when it becomes separated from its place.
It seems that you have provided me with the chapter number of the medical treatise. Is there anything specific related to Chapter 26 that I can assist you with? Perhaps translating another sentence or providing a summary of its content?
De la reduccio de la dislocacio del muscle.
Sapias que·l muscle no es dislocat sino segon tres manieras, de las quals es la una que sia dislocat a la partida del titillic a la partita dejos.
Here is my translation of the provided text:
Here is the translation of the given text:
And it is not rare for some men to experience a blow or fall, resulting in the rapid development of an abscess in their muscles, and they become paralyzed due to this dislocation.
Therefore, you should push this inside the area above his testicles, and then proceed with the treatment.
And the dislocation is known when it occurs near the testicles; so that you can differentiate between the dislocated muscle and the healthy one, as there will be noticeable differences between them; and you will find at the head of the affected muscle a concave area below the testicles which feels like an egg, and the patient cannot reach their hand to their ear or move it at all.
If the dislocation is below or above the foot, you will find it evident to the touch, and it won't be hidden.
And this type of dislocation has an easy reduction when it is recent, and the patient is a child.
The reduction process involves the attendant lifting the patient's arm above their head; then placing your thumbs below their testicles and raising the joint with strength to its place; as the attendant raises the patient's hand, stretching it upwards; then allowing a gentle return.
Here is my translation of the first source sentence:
Here is the translation of your first source sentence:
E si voles, reduzeys aquel segon aquesta manieyra: e es que tu fassas esser prezent un home le qual sia pus lonc que·l malaute, e estia de la part de aquel latz, e entrometa le sieu muscle dejos le titillic del malaute e eleve le titillic de lu a las partidas desus entro que·l malaute sia suspendut en ayre, e autre ministre tire la ma del malaute de las partidas dejos del sieu ventre. If the patient is feeble, then ensure that no other cause aggravates him, as the dislocation may quickly recur.
And it is reduced in another manner: by placing a long pole on the ground with its head shaped like a mortar pestle (neither thick nor thin), and then placing the patient atop it; next cover the top of the pole with some linen sheets, have the patient stand according to the length of the pole, and extend their arm towards one side while the other is extended below them on the opposite side; and stretch out their body from that side with force, as this will swiftly return the joint to its proper place.
And if it is difficult to reduce due to all the reasons mentioned above, then try this treatment method: take a wooden rod that is two arms' length long and four fingers wide, its thickness should be comparable to a man's thumb.
Then cover the rounded end of the rod with linen sheets to ensure it doesn't injure the patient.
Place the wooden rod underneath the patient's thumb and extend their hand or arm over it towards one side; then tie the rod to their helper's forearm as well as the patient's arm, securing its end around the tip of the patient's finger.
Now place the arm on a step of the ladder according to its latitude, and have the hand extended towards the parts below, while the other body is suspended from the other side, for the joint will soon dislocate.
And once you have completed the insertion of [a body part] according to each possible manner, it is necessary that you place a titillic on top of the affected area with an equal amount of force; then apply a prepared plaster made from powder of moli and egg albumen over the entire muscle, so that it covers everything, and then strap the titillic tightly but decently. The ligature should be wrapped around the plaster, and the patient's hand should be attached to their neck, left loose, and not disturbed for seven days.
And it is advised to keep the patient's diet light, so that their body may be more comfortable and recovery can be eased.
Then their diet should be increased after seven or five days and some exercise should be performed. If the patient remains firm and is not softened [by said exercise], then they are healed.
If the joint is dislocated due to excessive moisture or another cause, then it must be treated with a pointed cautery in three spots, as previously mentioned in the chapter on cauteries.
Understood! Here is the translation of your first provided sentence:
Of the dislocation of the one that is made between the feet and the navel or the parts behind it, reduction is done with a push and pull with hands until it returns.
And apply the same treatment to the other side, and cure it until it is healed.
And if the healing process slows down in the member and its movement becomes delayed, then let the patient use warm baths until that heaviness is alleviated and it returns to its original state.
The Roman numeral xxvii corresponds to 27 in English, so the text may be referring to chapter or section 27 of this medical treatise. Is there another line from the text you would like me to translate?
On curing the dislocation of the hip joint." Is there anything else I can help you with today?
Know that the hip joint is dislocated with difficulty and returns with difficulty; and it can be dislocated in all directions but mostly towards the front or backwards, its dislocation is not hidden from you when examining it manually or by touch regardless of how it is dislocated, and when you align the dislocated hip bone with your hand, this becomes evident to you as the joint is concave and cannot bend the arm nor reach with that muscle.
Here is my best translation of the text:
Here is the translation of the provided text:
If the dislocation is at the front part, then return it by bending the arm back towards their hand while striking the elbow with the edge of your palm.
And if the dislocation does not yield to the reduction, then administer a vigorous extension with great force.
And have two assistants extend the arm, with each assistant holding one end of it to prevent the arm from being pulled away during the extension.
Then rotate the arm around in all directions, wrapping it with a folded cloth or bandage along its length.
When the physician touches the joint with their hand, grease it with some oil to create a slippery surface that aids in lubrication for the joint's movement; then manipulate the joint with vigorous impulses while returning its position.
After the reduction is complete, apply a poultice made with a mixture of styptic herbs and egg whites; secure it tightly in place, then hang the arm from the patient's neck, leaving it suspended for several days.
Then it is unbound; thus, if the joint has been properly reformed in its place, untie the bandage from them and allow it to remain free.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
Here is my translation of the provided text: And then remove that, and place him in a bath; when he is immersed, you rub the joint with a warm friction, and then repeat this procedure every hour, for the second time, and the third. A wooden bathtub, which is narrow in shape.
And if you wish, place over him an oozing cowhide soaked in warm water and spread it on that; do this several times, for the hide is moist and returns to its natural state.

Regarding the treatment of a dislocated shoulder joint, which is between the arm and hand.
Sometimes the wrist is dislocated and its reduction is easy; however, it differs from other joints in that speed is required when reducing it at the time of dislocation, before the area becomes swollen or infected.
The reduction of the dislocation is for you to place the patient's wrist joint on a table and have the assistant extend their arm; the doctor then places their hand or palm over the prominence of the joint and pushes it until it returns to its proper position.

On the treatment of the said dislocation."
Alcunas veguadas so dislocatz les ditz a tota partida.
When any finger is dislocated from the back of the palm or its belly, then hold the finger and push on the dislocation with your thumbs, until it returns to its place.
Then support the head of the finger, and suspend that part which is dislocated above it, leaving it like this for two days.
Then suspend that part and extend it until it is straightened in its place.
And when it is night, bind that part according to this account, and do not cease from loosening it during the day and exercising with movement, then bind it at night; do this for a few days until it becomes straight.
Do something similar if it is dislocated in the belly of the hand, bind it to that part and perform the first operation as described before, until it is healed.
Similarly, do this when it is dislocated in other parts of the body.
I'm sorry, I don't understand your request. Can you please rephrase or provide more context?
On the treatment of dislocation of the spinal vertebrae."
When someone experiences a complete dislocation of one of the vertebrae in their back or neck and several vertebrae are moved from their original positions, there is no cure because death overtakes the patient.
The sign of this is that the patient's discharge occurs involuntarily and they cannot control it; often some parts of their body or both legs or arms become softened, or one of these limbs is dislocated from its socket, as sometimes there is a dislocation and other times it is the removal of those [limbs] into four pieces.
Therefore, it has already been torn apart into the back parts and is named jaundice.
However, the cure for him is to now consider if jaundice occurs in childhood, as then there is neither a cure nor full recovery from it.
However, in the cases where it results from injury or strike or something similar to these, the Ancients have already described ways of cure with great detail, among which the best is rest; however I've abridged that [cure] for which little excuses its length due to my proximity to my intention and thus this brief exposition, with which I've set out here and will expand upon later.
And of these, only the inflammation that occurs on the back itself through this, which I advise, is cured.
And if the patient is extended on their back near a wall, and they are covered with a wet cloth to prevent their feet from being exposed.
Then a straight stick is placed, embedded in the ground at the head end near his head, and another stick around his feet at the other end of the pallet.
The minister holds the stick, but is not standing in a pit; another minister holds the other [stick], according to that form.
Then wrap a thin cord around the patient's head and let it hang loose; extend the end of this cord to the stick that is near his head, and tie it there; then tighten the other rope over their hips towards their back, and pass it down their legs; finally, adjust all the ropes and tie them together on the other stick that is by their feet.
Here is the translation of the provided text:
And the doctor places his palms on the patient's spine with strength until they return to their normal state, or he may place them on a table and then adjust their legs onto the table for their return.
If they do not return to their normal state with the previous method, then take a table whose length or width is approximately three yards long and carve out a space in the wall nearest the patient where the end of the table can fit. Then place the middle of the table over the spine and have the doctor stand on the other end, pushing hard until the spine is realigned and returns to its proper position.
And if you wish, open a vice that is operated by hand; it should be such that when the patient's head is placed on the ground, two sticks of wood are positioned behind their neck with lengths of one arm each. The space between the sticks should measure roughly four fingers in width, and there should be holes drilled into them for the vice screw to pass through. Each stick must be firmly planted into the earth so as not to move.
Additionally, there should be another cylindrical stick that fits into the vice screw itself which is rotated in the holes of both wooden sticks.
And at the end of it is a hole in which the shaft is formed, the length of which is one palm to that which revolves; and on the other two shafts there are similar ones.
Then strengthen the ligatures that you have tied on the patient's foot in the hole where their head is, and also tighten the ligatures that are located at the other end near their feet.
Then at each end place a minister who will turn the shaft with their hand, and meanwhile the doctor adjusts the spine as we have explained earlier.
Then after the spine is repositioned and the area is adjusted, apply a hot poultice with fresh egg albumin on it; then pack it tight and place over the poultice a piece of table-top thick cloth whose width should be three fingers or thereabouts and its length to match the size of the affected part of the spine.
Then it should be bound with the kind of ligature we have mentioned before, and make sure that the patient is fed a subtle diet until he/she recovers.
E si roman alcuna iminencia en le loc en la fi de la sanacio,
Here is my best attempt at translating the provided text:
Sure! Here is my best guess at translating the text line by line into English:
Of the treatment of a dislocated hip.
Know that the joint of the hip and the junction of the muscle can only be dislocated and not damaged like other joints with small displacements and concavities.
The hip joint can be dislocated in four ways: it can move outward or inward, forward or backward.
It is most often dislocated outward or inward, but rarely forward or backward.
The sign of dislocation outward is when you align the patient's affected leg with their healthy one, it becomes longer and the knee is more prominent compared to the healthy side; the patient cannot bend their foot inward and this area may be swollen due to a build-up of pus as the head of the hip bone has already arrived here.
The sign of the patient who has an outward dislocation is that their symptoms are opposite to those mentioned above.
The sign of the patient who has a forward dislocation is that they spread their leg as much as possible but cannot bend at the knee due to pain; if they attempt to walk, they cannot step forward and must use crutches. Their urine flow may be interrupted, leading to swelling, and walking is only possible using crutches.
And a sign of the one who experiences dislocation in their hip joint is that they cannot extend their thigh, nor can they bend what was previously bent at the knee; their leg becomes shorter than the other and the knee softens, with the head of the femur displaced from its socket.
The only reduction in the types of this dislocation is that you consider it, then if the dislocation is old and ancient, having been like that for a while, you administer its reduction and leave it as it was disposed; in which case there isn't total healing and therefore no further treatment should be performed on it.
But in the case of someone with a recent dislocation, which is one of four types of dislocations, you should consider returning the joint to its place and extending it inwardly and outwardly, as well as on both sides; for often this alone suffices and no other treatment is needed.
If it does not return with this method, then you must prepare a strong minister (helper) who will extend the patient's leg from below or by holding their hands or tying what is tied over the thigh; another minister extends the patient's hand so as to place their own underneath theirs, and at that point they should strain using a belt around the root of the hip joint. And let another minister hold the end of this belt.
And if there is an extension of it or from the part within that pains at the part of the fork, or from the back to the part of the spine.
And for the extension of all these, at once have the patient raised by their body from the ground and let them remain hanging.
And this type of extension is special for all four [limbs].
And so if the dislocation returns to what we have said [previously], it will be good; but if not, then it is necessary for this specific type of cure that I shall now explain.
In the specific reduction when it is dislocated, and the dislocation occurs at the inner parts, have the patient turned onto their side; then place the straps over the top of the hip bone in that area between the head of the femur and where it pains; now extend the strap above the painful area to the highest part of the fork (i.e., the shoulder).
Then have another strong assistant take the patient's arms, and pull hard on the thick part of the dislocated hip and extend [the leg] outwards with violent extension, for this will return it to its place.
And this type of treatment is less invasive than other methods as it reduces the need for surgery on this body part.
If you find yourself unable to comply and do not follow the instructions for this treatment method, then ensure that both of the patient's feet are securely tied together with a strong yet light binding, above the heel and below the toes.
And let the length of each be equal to about four fingers, and let the patient's leg on that side be extended further than the other by about two finger widths.
Then the patient should be suspended over the top of a pole or post, and let them hang there securely; let their body's length from the ground measure about two yards.
And instruct a strong young man to push down on the head of the hip joint, and let another young man be suspended with the patient, pulling up on the other hip with force, so that the joint returns swiftly into place.
However, during the reduction process itself, when there is dislocation outwards from the joint, it must be that the patient remains on their fist as previously advised for swelling; and let the binding over the affected leg and foot be tightened accordingly.
And then two sticks are placed, one under the patient's feet and the other on their head; then adjusted sticks are placed in the middle of a poultice wrapped with wet cloths to prevent the patient from being harmed by the sticks between their legs so that the extension of these parts below is not pulled.
Then each assistant extends to their respective position while the doctor places his hand according to the reduction technique.
And when the dislocation is in front of you, make sure the leg is slightly extended; according to this description above on the poultice, have the doctor place his right palm on the patient's affected joint, then take that and extend it gently down towards the lower parts.
If the dislocation is in back of you and it's not necessary to extend their lower parts, then have them elevated from the ground; however, they should be placed on a hard surface, just like we mentioned before for the examination when their hips are dislocated outwards according to what we said about placing them over two planks. And while they're on their stomach, have their limbs extended as described earlier.
And now it is necessary to apply compression with a board on the area where the joint is located.
So, once the reduction is complete as it should be - and you won't miss the sign of the reduction in him, which is when you extend the patient's legs, and when you see his legs become equal and he draws back his knee without protest, then you'll know that the limb has been returned to its proper place - now adjust two cushions and apply a plaster cast and remove with bandages so that no part of the body is squeezed; keep the patient at rest for three or four days.
Then remove the bindings and plaster cast, and compare one leg to the other.
If you see that the legs are now equal in appearance, then you'll know that the dislocation has been corrected, and so let the patient go.
And if you see any signs of softening, then return and plaster that limb again, removing it according to your original structure, and keep it for three days.
Then remove the plaster, and have him delay walking on it for a few days until he is comfortable.
Sure, here is my attempt at translating the provided text into English:
De curacio de dislocacio del denolh."
The shoulder is dislocated in three ways: it is dislocated outwardly, inwardly, and behind the joint; it cannot be dislocated forward.
The sign of a dislocation is when you ask the patient to put their leg on their hip, and if they can't do it, you know that the shoulder is indeed dislocated.
To restore the shoulder in all three ways, make the patient stand straight and have them extend their arm if they can; place your hands on their face and put their foot between your feet; then hold their shoulder with your palms and grasp it firmly between your thumbs over their shoulder; meanwhile, another assistant should extend the patient's leg until the shoulder returns to its socket.
The sign of successful restoration is when their arm sticks to their hip without effort.
Then plaster that area and attach the arm to the hip, binding them together with a bandage for three or four days; then untie the bindings.
Do not let the patient walk for a few days until they are healed and comfortable.

Chapter 33.
From the cure of the dislocation of the ankle.
Sometimes the ankle is sprained due to a small displacement, and sometimes it is dislocated completely, with the dislocation occurring either within or outside the joint.
The sign of an ankle dislocation is that sometimes the affected area becomes swollen, proceeding from the joint to the side where it is dislocated.
Mostly the cure for its sprain is a slight reduction [of the ankle], and it should be extended with ease using your hands and wrapped so that it can heal.
In the cure for a complete dislocation of the ankle, it is necessary to have the patient lie down straight, and they should have a strong and valiant assistant behind them in their mid-section.
Then you will have your right hand on the uppermost part of their foot and your left hand on the lower part of the foot in the area of the ankle.
And then you will pull the foot towards yourself with your right hand and [then] twice with your left hand, and extend it to the left; finally use the toes of the foot with your right hand under the leg without strain.
And do this twice as we have counted.
Then wrap the foot around the leg for the third time, you are at the ankle.
Therefore, if upon returning once or twice in this manner you see the foot wrap correctly, it is good; otherwise, repeat the operation as the ankle will return.
But if it is prohibited for you to perform the reduction as we have recounted earlier, then make the patient lie on their back on the ground. Place a long stick in the ground firmly and position it between their legs. Ensure they are wrapped in cloth so that the patient does not catch cold.
Then have the assistant hold their legs and another minister extend the foot with both hands or something similar to pull on it; stretch each of them in opposition to the extension of their limb, and let the stick be between the patient's legs holding that position so that the body is not pulled away from where they are underneath.
Then the physician should pull on the dislocated joint with both hands while another assistant holds the healthy side of the body to prevent any further displacement as it is returned easily.
And thus, when the dislocation returns and you restore their health by reducing it, then apply plaster and secure it tightly with linen strips, and bind the foot to the leg with a bandage.
Be mindful to avoid or protect the nerves which are located behind the ankle bone, as you do not want the bandage over that area to be too tight and cause harm.
Then leave it like that for two or three days; if the bandage has softened, remove it.
And on the third or fourth day, untie it and forbid the patient from walking for forty days. However, if they are forced to walk before that period of time has passed, it is certain that the dislocation will not be completely resolved and healed, and thus it may not respond to treatment.
If an acute abscess occurs, you should administer the treatment as previously described in this account, but in a different location for healing and anointing until it is improved.
It seems that this indicates the end of the text or a new chapter/section. In modern formatting, you might see "Chapter 34" or something similar to indicate a new part of the treatise.

But if the dislocation is in one of the joints of the foot, then you must have the patient sit on the floor or a table, and keep him that way as though he were walking.
Then stand by the patient's side, place your foot on what projects from the joints, then press that with your foot vigorously until it returns to its socket, and you see it level again without protuberance.
Then place under the patient's abdomen a table that fits around the foot entirely, which has two ends, and then bind that with binding that is tight yet firm for three days; then unbind it and make him rest from walking for many days until his recovery is ensured.
It seems this medical treatise consists of numerous chapters, with the last message being Chapter 35. Is there another portion you wish me to translate?
Of the kinds of dislocations that occur from blows or fractures or any other cause.
When any of these causes occurs, and you are engaged in the cure and restoration of it, many times death succeeds.
Certainly! Here is my attempt at translating the provided text: And so, exert yourself quickly to perform the reduction at the beginning of the procedure, before it develops into a dangerous abscess.
And if the limb returns to its desired position, then administer treatment that prevents the dangerous abscess and heals the wound with what you deem appropriate from among the drying medicines.
If there is dislocation with fracture and the bone ends become separated, then you pierce the membrane of their joints, and do as we have said before for simple illnesses in those areas.
And be mindful to avoid using instruments on the paths of fear according to what my teachings have instructed you; for this is better for your true self and Creator, and brings greater glory to yourself, and more wholesome benefits to your body in due time. Thus ends the words of Albucasis, for which may God bless us. Amen.
