Sometimes rupture comes in the groin, as we have said, and the place opens;
and none of the intestines descend into the testicles, and if some do descend, it is little, and returns all the time;
and yet if it remains too long in this state, the wound or fistula grows, until the intestine descends;
and this happens because of the extension of the fistula that is in the groin, as we have said, for it is extended, then the place softens and swells and opens;
and the treatment is by cautery, as we have said before;
and sometimes it is treated with iron in this manner:
and the patient lies supine between your hands, then cut the swollen place of the rupture widely, about the width of three fingers;
and then extract the fistula that is under the skin that follows it, then take the thread and put it on the visible place of the fistula;
and press it deep into the belly, then sew the two visible places of the fistula over the end of the thread, and sew both;
then pull the end of the thread, and do not cut the fistula or spread egg or anything else, as I have taught you in the treatment of intestinal hernia;
then treat it by the treatment of wounds.
And when you cut the threads, clean it and treat the wound until it is healed.
The fistula is constricted, and has no opening in the rupture, and the cautery is more moderate in this place, and closer to healing.
