of the limb crooked after healing
When the limb is crooked after restoration, and the bone broken openly, and the shape of the limb is ugly, yet it does not lose its natural function: do not believe the fools who say that the limb must be re-broken, and many foolish doctors have done this in our land; and this work is condemned, and great harm comes from it, and perhaps death; however, if the knots and the crookedness are fresh, they should be watered with hot water, in which softening herbs have been cooked, such as marshmallow leaves and roots, and melilot, and similar things; and make a softening plaster, such as well-made diachylon, and take the mucilage of marshmallow, and mix it with chicken fat or sesame oil, and make a plaster on it; or take ripe figs, and crush them with dove droppings, and similar medicines that soften the callus.
And sometimes the knot is removed by rubbing continuously and for a long time with moist hands.
And movement should be administered to the limb every hour.
And if the crookedness is old and hardened, like stone, and it needs to be removed with an iron tool, it must be cut down to the bone, lightly with a fine scalpel; and put care and study into the treatment.
