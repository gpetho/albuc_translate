On the treatment of panarici and damaged nails, and the incision of extra fingers and their removal.
A panarici is an abscess that forms under the nail of the thumb or toe and quickly appears on other fingers. When it persists and its treatment is neglected, or when it is caused by a hot abscess or becomes corrupted, it discharges pus that corrodes the root of the nail, quickly destroying the entire nail, often reaching the bone and causing a foul odor. This makes the end of the finger swollen, and the color turns dark.
So, when you have treated it with the method we described earlier and it does not respond to the treatment, you must then cut away all the remaining nail with an iron instrument and then cauterize the wound thoroughly because cauterization is very beneficial in such cases.
But if the bone is healthy and the nail is intact, and the edges of the nail press into the surrounding flesh causing pain and injury, you must place a thin wedge under the edge of the nail that presses on the flesh, push it up, and easily cut that flesh. Apply corrosive burning medicines to the remaining flesh until it is all removed, then treat it with ointments until it is healed.
But if the corruption has already reached the bone, you must cut and remove the affected bone, for it will never heal as long as the bone remains corrupted.
And if you see the corruption and decay spreading in the finger, you must cut it at one of the joints as previously indicated and then treat it until it is healed.
But if the nail is injured by a blow or friction and causes severe pain, you must initially bleed the patient, then cut the nail with a sharp blade in a transverse section from top to bottom. Be careful not to cut into the flesh beneath the nail, as this will cause the patient intense pain and will lead to the growth of excess flesh in the area. Then treat the area with something that relieves pain.
An extra finger, which some people are born with on their hands, is often entirely fleshy, sometimes contains bones, or is sometimes found on the nail.
Some of these are born at the root of the joint, or they may originate from some joints of the fingers.
But those that are born on the finger joints are usually not harmful, while those on the joints are more troublesome.
For those that are purely fleshy, the removal is easy: you simply cut it at its root with a broad blade.
But for those that originate from the root of the joint, the treatment is difficult; therefore, be cautious in removing them.
For those born on the finger near the joints, you must first cut the flesh with a circular incision down to the bone, then saw through the bone with a suitable saw, and then treat it until it heals.
But the fusion that occurs between the fingers sometimes by birth, by healing of a wound, by burning, or similar causes, you must cut through that fusion until the fingers return to their natural form.
Then place linen cloth soaked in rose oil between them so they do not easily re-fuse, and keep them separated, or place a thin lead sheet between them until they heal properly.
Similarly, if fusion occurs between some fingers and the palm, cut through the fusion according to the shape and configuration of the member.
