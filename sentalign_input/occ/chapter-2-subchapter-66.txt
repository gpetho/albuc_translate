Chapter 66.
On windy hernia.
In this hernia, no one has been seen to be daring enough to treat it with iron.
And the first ones said that it is done as we have described in the hernia with life; which is that you tie the vessels near the incision over it easily; then dry the area around the swelling with something that opens it, until the vessels fall off.
And treat the wound as we have said until it is healed.
