of the rupture of the belly/abdomen The rupture of the belly/abdomen is large, medium, and small; from the large wound sometimes the intestine, or the sinews of the intestines, protrude, which makes their insertion difficult; and the stitching is more difficult, and sometimes the small wound is worse than the large one, because it is harder to put the intestines back in, if they are not put back in immediately; because the intestines swell as soon as they feel the cold, so they are harder to put back in, and therefore the medium wound is better, because the intestine is more easily returned to its place than in the other two. And know that the rupture of the belly/abdomen is of four kinds: the two common stitches occur in the stitching of the belly/abdomen, and the stitching of the other wounds of the body and two other specific stitches are common to other wounds; and yet they are more specific to the stitching of the belly/abdomen, and I will describe each one and explain.	On wounds of the abdomen, and protrusion of the intestine; and on suturing them. The tear that occurs in the abdomen may be great or small or it may be middle-sized. From a large tear one or more segments of gut may protrude. The reduction of this and the suture of the wound is an exceedingly hard and difficult matter.	0.7006409
I say that when the wound is small, and some part of the intestine comes out, and it is difficult to put it back, this is for one of two reasons: either because of the smallness of the wound, as we have said, or because the intestine is swollen from the cold.	I begin then by saying that when the wound is small, and a piece of intestine protrudes from it, rendering the reduction of it difficult, the difficulty will be due to one of two causes: either on account of the smallness of the fissure, as we said; or because the gut has become inflated on account of the coldness of the air.	0.8725742
And when it is cold, warm it in this way: wet a sponge or a soft cloth in lukewarm water only, or in which you have cooked squinanth, cypress, and spikenard, and sprinkle the intestine until the swelling is gone; and sometimes this makes the veins contract, and is better than plain water for reducing swelling.	If the latter case obtains, the gut must be warmed by fomenting with a sponge or piece of cloth bathed with warm water or water in which have been boiled rushes and cyperus and hyacinth, bathing the gut until the inflation is gone down. Wine that is somewhat astringent may do; in bringing down the swelling it is better than plain water.	0.7802585
And when you see the swelling subside, moisten the intestine with water in which marshmallow and mallow have been cooked, for this makes the entry easier by a little; and if it cannot enter, then cut the wound a little with the instrument with which hemorrhoids are cut; and the first treatment is better than cutting, which one should not do unless there is great necessity; and this is the instrument for cutting it: it cuts inside the curve and not outside, and here is its form:	When you see that the swelling has come down, bathe the gut with water in which have been infused althea and mallows; for with this the reduction of the bowel becomes easy, using the lightest effort. But if after this treatment the reduction is still difficult, open up the wound a little with the instrument for opening up haemorrhoids. The first method, if possible, is better than incision, but one may be compelled to incise when other means have failed. This is the form of the instrument.	0.7827802
And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestine protrudes, put it back in its natural form in its proper place, if you can, for this is better.	When the wound is opened up a little with the instrument and the bowel is reduced, it is important to return it to its natural shape and proper position, if you can, for that is better.	0.7689094
When the wound is large, and it is in the lower part of the belly, you must make the patient lie on his back, and put his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the part below the belly, then put the head and chest higher than the lower parts, and also if the rupture of the belly is in one of the two parts put your attention to this so that the injured part is higher than the other; and thus it is necessary to manage what I say in large and medium wounds.	When the wound is large and in the lower abdomen the patient should lie on his back and have his legs higher than his head; but if it be in the upper abdomen his head and chest should be placed higher than his lower parts. And in the same way if the opening be on one side of the abdomen you should always make it your object to put the wounded side higher than the other. So must you proceed in large or middling wounds.	0.9174784
I put his intestines back after they had been out for twenty-four hours, and the wound was stitched up to fifteen days, and I treated him, and he was healed.	The opening was in the middle of his belly; and I reduced it after the bowel had been outside the wound for twenty-four hours. The wound healed in about a fortnight, and I treated him until he was better; and he lived for many years after this, carrying on as usual.	0.74026394
And the physicians had judged that he would die, and it was a miracle; and I did not treat him with ointment, for I was in a place where none was found, nor any medicines; and I simply put old cotton on the wound twice a day, and washed it with honey water until he was healed.	The verdict of the doctors was that he could not be healed. The remarkable thing is that I did not treat him with any ointment, for I was in a place where there was no sort of medicine; so twice a day I applied teased-out cotton wool to the wound, and carefully washed it with honey-water until he was healed.	0.85649645
Now I will tell you the two proper ways of stitching: take the needle, and push it from the outside to the inside; when it has pierced the flesh straight through, then leave the edge of the siphac or skin where you pushed the needle, and make it pierce on the other side from the inside to the outside; and the meaning of this stitching is that you sew as the leather-workers do skins, and that you leave the syfac once on one side, and take it again on the other, until the stitching is completely finished. The second way of stitching, which Galen specifically describes, is as some do, who bring the two parts together naturally, and join one end of the siphac to the other end, in this way: insert a needle at the edge of the wound nearby, and make it pierce only that place, and leave the two edges of the siphac; then turn the needle, and make it pierce from the outside to the inside, at the two edges of the siphac; then make it pierce both from the outside to the inside, in two other edges of the wound that are on the other side; and this is the better way of stitching and the most common.	Then begin again on that same side and sew it together with the peritoneal edge on the opposite side and bring the needle out through the skin nearby. Then reintroduce into the same skin area and sew the opposite peritoneal edge with that abdominal skin edge and bring the needle out through the adjacent skin. Do this once again and repeat until you have sewn up the whole wound after this fashion. In short, this way of suturing is to sew with the stitch used by furriers in sewing skins; thus you stitch the peritoneum once one way with the skin edge and leave it once the other way, until you have done.	0.7457639
Galen said these words, and some testify to it, that one should sew the belly with two needles, with thread in each; and one should push one needle from one side, and the other from the other, in the manner of those who sew straps; and know that when the rupture is in the middle of the belly, the stitching is more difficult than in other places of the belly.	These are Galen's very words. Some have said that the suture of the abdomen may be performed with two needles, thus: you thread one thread into both and begin by introducing the needle into that part near you and carrying it through to the other side. Then you insert the other needle on the far side and bring it through to the near side, after the manner of the shoemaker's stitch. You must understand that when the fissure is in the middle of the abdomen the sewing of it is more difficult than in other parts of the abdomen.	0.8596909
The intestine which is called "jejunum" cannot heal when it is wounded, and this is because of the layout of the veins that are there, and because of the thinness of the whole body, and the proximity of its nature to the nerves.	But the part of the bowel called the jejunum is not likely to recover from an injury to it at all; and that is due to the number and size of arteries in it and to the thinness of its structure and to its nearly approaching a nerve in its character.	0.7142237
And if the omentum protrudes from the wound, put it back in just like the intestine, while it is fresh; and if it is old and has become green or black, then you must tie off the place that is black, so that a flow of blood does not come there, because there are veins and arteries; then cut what is between the ties, and let the two ends hang from the part below the wound until later to ease the extraction when the omentum falls off, and the wound festers. of the rupture of the bowel	If what protrudes from the wound be omentum, and you find it freshly protruding, then reduce it as you do intestine. But if some time has lapsed and it has turned green or black, you should ligate it above the site where it has gone black lest there be a haemorrhage; for the omentum contains veins and arteries. Then cut off what is below the ligature and leave the ends of the thread hanging out from the lower part of the wound, so that it will be easy for you to draw upon it and extract it as the omentum falls away and the wound suppurates.	0.8921293
When the intestine is round, and the wound is small, it can be restored in some men, because I saw that a man was wounded in the belly by a lance; and the wound was to the right of the stomach, and it swelled and became a fistula, and the excrement and gases came out of it; I treated it as best I could, and I did not cease to refine the treatment until he was healed, and the place was closed.	When a break occurs in the intestine and it is a small one, it is possible, in some men, that it may mend. For I myself saw a man who had been wounded by a spear-thrust in the abdomen. The wound was to the right of the stomach, and, being chronic, became a fistula whence issued faeces and flatus. I set about treating him, though I had no hope of his recovery, and I continued to attend him, and eventually he recovered and the place healed over.	0.8873637
