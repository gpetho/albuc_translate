Chapter Twenty-Eight.
On the treatment of dislocation of the wrist.
The wrist joint is frequently dislocated.  Its reduction is easier than other joints, except that it should be reduced quickly, at the hour in which it is dislocated, before the place swells or a hot swelling appears in it.
Its reduction is done by placing the patient's wrist on a board and an assistant extends his hand. The physician puts his palm on the protuberance of the joint and pushes it until it returns. However, it should be observed whether the dislocation has moved towards the inside of the hand.
So let the patient place the back of his hand on the board when extending and reducing. And if the dislocation protrudes towards the back of the hand, let him place the palm of his hand on the board so that the physician's hand falls on the protuberance of the joint itself.  If it returns immediately, good. Otherwise, bandage it with a dressing that reduces swelling.
And leave it; do not try again, for it will not bear it, and you will not be able to reduce it after a few days have passed, except that the joint will remain crooked.  And it will not harm the patient at all, unless the hand is weakened and unable to grasp anything.
Then you will know that the nerve has been severed or bruised, and there is no remedy for it except to cauterize it. Perhaps this will be beneficial, and perhaps it will be of no use.  When the wrist reduction is complete, apply the dressing that we described, then bandage it and leave it for five days.
Then untie it and exercise the hand. If its movement is difficult and some stiffness occurs in it, soften it with warm water and massage it repeatedly until it softens.
