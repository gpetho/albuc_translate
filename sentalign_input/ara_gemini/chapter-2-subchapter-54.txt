Chapter fifty-four on the treatment of acne.
We have already explained in the section on classification the types of ascites, how water accumulates, the signs of each type, and its treatment with medications.
And the one that is treated with iron is only the ascitic type,
and the drum-like type and the fleshy type should not be approached with iron at all, because that is deadly.
If you have treated this type of ascitic swelling with medications and your treatment has not been successful,
then consider: if the patient is extremely weak, or has another disease besides the swelling, such as a cough or diarrhea, and so on, then beware of treating him with iron, because it is dangerous.
If you see that the patient is strong, has no disease other than the swelling alone, and is neither a child nor an old man,
then the way to proceed is to have the patient stand before you and have a servant behind him squeeze his abdomen with his hands and push the water down towards the pubic area,
then take a pointed scalpel like this:
Long, limited on both sides, with a defined tip like a scalpel, except that it has a slight bluntness so that it does not pass through to the intestine during the procedure and harm it.
Then look, if the hernia originates from the intestines, it is appropriate to distance the incision from the navel by three fingers downwards, along it, above the pubis.
If the hernia originates from liver disease, let your incision be three fingers to the left of the navel.
If it originates from spleen disease, let the incision be on the right side, about three fingers.
It is also not appropriate for the incision to be on the side on which the patient wants to lie down, so that excess fluids do not flow to that weak spot.
Then pierce the entire skin with the instrument.
Then insert the instrument into that incision and lift your hand with the scalpel between the skin and the peritoneum as if you are skinning it, and the amount you skin should be the size of a fingernail or so.
Then pierce the peritoneum until the scalpel reaches an empty space, which is the location of the fluid.
Then remove it and insert into the hole the instrument, of which this is an image:
It is similar to a tube of thin reed, made of silver or copper or polished smooth steel, having in its bottom a small hole, and on its sides three holes, two from one side and one from another, as you see.
Its end may be sharpened like the point of a pen, in this form:
At its upper end is a ring.
For when the instrument reaches the water, it will descend from its reservoir onto the instrument, and it will discharge a moderate amount of water at that time.
Because if you discharge from it more than is necessary at the time, the patient may die from the dissolution of his animal spirit, or he may experience fainting close to death.
But discharge from it according to his strength and what the patient's condition indicates to you, from the strength of his pulse and the goodness of his color.
Then remove the instrument and stop the water.
This is because it stops from its reservoir due to the leather that covers the hole on the peritoneum, which I told you to pad in that manner.
Then return the instrument another day if you see the patient can tolerate it, and also extract a small amount of water.
Do this for several days, while being cautious and guarding against error, until only a small amount of water remains.
If you fear for the patient and have left a large amount of water, treat him by burying him in hot sand, and with profuse sweating in the bath and sun, and make him endure thirst, and treat him with drying medications until he recovers.
And cauterize him on the stomach, liver, and spleen after extracting the water as I described previously.
