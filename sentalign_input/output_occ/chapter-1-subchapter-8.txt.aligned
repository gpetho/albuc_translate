At the beginning, the patient should be given large jars and pills that cleanse the brain.	First, great electuaries should be given to the patient to drink; and pills to clear the head.	0.7921729
Then shave the patient's entire head and place a cedar plaster on the nape of the neck, as described in the treatise on plasters.	Then let his whole head be shaved and apply a mustard plaster to the hinder part as described in the treatise on plasters.	0.7930757
Apply it several times, as it acts in a similar manner to cauterization. Do this according to the same order already described.	That should be applied several times as it is a kind of cauterization; do it in the very way described there.	0.81349933
If the patient is healed by these methods, that is good; if not, then make three cauteries on the back of the head, descending from the uppermost part of the head to the lowest part of the neck. Place the cauteries about a finger's width apart, and treat them with the previously mentioned remedies.	If he is cured, well and good; but if not, burn him with three cauterizations on the back of the head, arranging them in a row downward from the upper part of the head to the base of the neck; and make an interval between each pair of one finger's breadth. Then treat as aforesaid.	0.8764243
But if you want to add more and the patient can tolerate it, then make a cautery in the middle of the head; and if you want to add even more, then cauterize over the two horns.	If you wish to add to these cauterizations and the patient be fit to bear it, give him a burn in the middle; and if still more, then burn him on the two frontal prominences.	0.8071742
Then treat the area until it is healed; and let the cautery be olive-shaped as previously described.	Then dress till healed. Let the cautery be an olivary as described before.	0.7910827
