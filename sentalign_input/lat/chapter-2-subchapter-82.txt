On the treatment of inward and outward Almirmar, and of dry Athelil, and of Formica.
Chapter 82.
Know that Almirmar is nothing but a round knot of the same color as the body, similar to the head of a nail; it appears on the entire body, especially on the lower parts of the feet and toes, and causes pain when walking.
Therefore, it is necessary to cut around the nail, hold it with forceps or a hook, and remove it from its root.
Then treat it; and if you wish, cauterize it as was previously discussed in its chapter.
As for dry Athelil, it is a small, rough, filtered, round prominence on the surface of the body.
And it often occurs on the hands of children.
The treatment for it is to stretch the Athelil and cut it, or to tie it with a silk thread or hair until it falls off.
And if you wish, cauterize it as mentioned before, either with fire or with sharp medicine; and now both inward and outward Athelil are eradicated with the instrument I will describe.
Formica is also a small, thick, filtered prominence on the surface of the body, going very deep; and when cold reaches it, it feels like an ant's bite, appearing all over the body, especially on the hands.
The treatment for it is to take a tube from a goose feather or a strong vulture feather, and place that tube over the Formica until the tube's circle encloses it.
Then twist your hand with the tube until you cut around the Formica; insert it deep into the flesh and remove the Formica from its root.
And if you wish, do this with a tube of brass or iron, in this manner.
Let the top of the tube have a raised and rounded cover so that handling and twisting it over the finger is eased.
And if you wish, cauterize the Formica as previously discussed in the cauterization of Athelil in the chapter on cautery.
