On the adhesion of the eyelid to the conjunctiva or cornea.
Chapter XV.
Sometimes this adhesion occurs in many people, causing the upper eyelid to adhere to the white of the eye, thus preventing it from functioning naturally.
Therefore, you should insert the end of a thin rod beneath the eyelid and lift it upward, or stretch it with a hook. Then, cut the adhesion with a fine spatula that should not have a sharp edge but should be slightly blunt so that it does not cause discomfort to the patient during the procedure, and so that the spatula does not damage the eye with its sharpness. Make the incision as if you are gently peeling away the adhesion until the eyelid returns to its natural shape and the adhesion is fully healed.
Then pour salty water into the eye, rinse it with this water, or instill a solution of sief made from dissolved ziniar.
Next, place a linen strip between the eyelid and the eye, and place over the eye wool soaked in egg white. After the third day, apply sief and consolidating agents until it heals.
