Circumcision is not like the healing of other wounds; however, when we perform this procedure willingly, especially on children, it is necessary to make it the best and safest operation.	Circumcision is nothing but a solution of continuity like other wounds: but as it is a result of our deliberate action, and as it is done particularly to boys, we should plan in this case the very best operation, and the easiest way that leads to safety.	0.7883343
I say that the ancients did not mention circumcision of their children because they did not use it in their law, and we only have what we have learned through experience.	Now the Ancients made no mention of circumcision in any of their books, since it was not practised in their religion; but it is something we have acquired by experience.	0.68361676
For I have seen most of the masters and surgeons performing circumcision with a scalpel, and scissors, and with a razor; the procedure was faulty because there are two layers, and perhaps they cut the top one and leave the one underneath.	I have myself seen the common run of practitioners and barbers carry it out with razor and with scissors; they use a spindle-whorl, a ligature of thread, and incision by means of the finger-nail. I have personally tried all these ways and have not found a better than circumcision with scissors and a thread ligature.	0.6800183
Now it must be cut again, and the pain is doubled, and with the scalpel, the tip of the member is not secure; and with the razor, the blade might slip and cause complications, and often they heal without needing treatment, as I have seen.	I have personally tried all these ways and have not found a better than circumcision with scissors and a thread ligature. For circumcision carried out with the razor is often eluded by the skin; for the skin of the prepuce is of two layers; and often the outer skin is incised and the inner is left intact, so that a second incision is needed, and renewed pain; while when the circumcision is done with a spindle-whorl you are in danger of cutting the tip of the penis, since the tip often goes into the aperture of the whorl.	0.61985177
Regarding the circumcision done with scissors and a thread tie, I have found it to be effective because the scissors cut both above and below equally well.	Experience has taught me the superiority of circumcision with the scissors and the thread ligature.	0.5190538
For when you press your hand, it cuts evenly in one go; but the thread must be tightly tied around the skin; and the way of the first procedure is to make the child think, if he understands, that you are only tying the thread around the penis, and then make him enjoy in all the ways you can; then make him stand between your hands straight, and hide the scissors in your hands or under your feet so that the child does not see them or any of the instruments; then place your hand on the penis and blow on the tip, and pull it up so that the tip of the penis is inside; then clean it well from the dirt that has gathered there, then tie the marked spot with a double thread, then tie it again slightly lower with another tie; and hold it with two fingers at the second tie at the thumb and index finger, and cut between the two ties, then quickly lift the upper skin and pull the tip of the penis;	For scissors cut evenly, since the upper edge of the scissors is exactly the same as the lower edge; and so, as you compress your hand, thanks to the correspondence of the two blades you cut equally and simultaneously; and you make the girdle of the thread like a wall all round the skin of the tip of the penis: thus no error can occur. The manner of operating is first to make the boy, especially if he is one who understands a little, imagine that all you are going to do is tie a ligature on the tip of the penis and leave it for another day. Then amuse him and cheer him as much as you can, according to his intelligence; then stand him upright before you, not sitting; and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot and do not let the boy's eye chance upon that or any other instrument. Then with your hand take hold of the tip of the penis, blow into the foreskin, and draw it back till the glans penis is exposed; then cleanse from it all unclean matter that has collected.	0.90900034
then make him stand between your hands straight, and hide the scissors in your hands or under your feet so that the child does not see them or any of the instruments; then place your hand on the penis and blow on the tip, and pull it up so that the tip of the penis is inside; then clean it well from the dirt that has gathered there, then tie the marked spot with a double thread, then tie it again slightly lower with another tie; and hold it with two fingers at the second tie at the thumb and index finger, and cut between the two ties, then quickly lift the upper skin and pull the tip of the penis; then let the blood flow little by little because it is cleaner that way; and put powder on it and on the powder a cloth soaked in the white of a cooked egg mixed with rose water, mixed with good and fresh rose oil, and leave it on until the next day, and treat it with other treatments until it is healed.	Then amuse him and cheer him as much as you can, according to his intelligence; then stand him upright before you, not sitting; and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot and do not let the boy's eye chance upon that or any other instrument. Then with your hand take hold of the tip of the penis, blow into the foreskin, and draw it back till the glans penis is exposed; then cleanse from it all unclean matter that has collected. Then ligate the indicated place with a double ligature, and a second right round beneath; then take hold at the site of the lower ligature with thumb and forefinger, very firmly, and cut between the ligatures; then quickly push back the skin and draw out the glans penis; then let a little blood flow, for that is all the better and prevents the swelling of the tip of the penis; then wipe it with a piece of soft cloth, then sprinkle on it ashes of dried gourds (this is the best of all that I have tried) or else fine white flour, which is also good; then apply on top of the powders a piece of linen with egg-yolk cooked in rosewater, beaten up with fresh oil of roses of good quality. Leave this on the wound until the following day; then dress it in the usual way till healed.	0.91767615
The shape of the scissors for the circumcision is this: the two tips should be thin and sharp, and the tips should be as big as the handle equally:	This is the type of scissors most suitable for circumcizing. They should be fiat-nosed, sharp, with no bend in them, and with the pivot tempered ; and the length of the handles should be equal to that of the blades.	0.5843731
the mistake of the circumcision is when the inner skin escapes the incision; then it is necessary to stretch it with your nail before the place forms an abscess; and cut it evenly, and if you cannot hold it with your nail, hold it with forceps, and then cut it.	Now the mistake often occurring in circumcision is for the inner layer of skin, either the whole or the part, to be inverted at the cutting. So you should at the start draw it out with your finger-nail before the place swell; then make an even incision. And if you are unable to get a hold with your finger-nail then pick it up with a hook and make your incision.	0.7975337
And if three days pass, and the area below the penis is swollen, then leave it until the hot abscess is soothed, and peel it lightly; then cut it as you can, and be careful of the part of the penis, as it will not harm it at all.	If after three days there still remains some inflation and swelling of the part below the tip of the penis, let it be until the effusion subsides, and then gently peel it away and cut it as best you may. Be careful of the tip of the penis; though if any of the tip is cut away that will do no harm.	0.84481764
Then treat the area with healing powder that we have mentioned in the powder section, and if you cut the skin too much, and it goes above, it will not harm; treat it as we have said until it is healed.	And dress the wound with stimulating medicaments from among the powders that we described in the treatise on powders. Should more of the skin be cut away than necessary and the skin is wrinkled up, that will do no great harm either. Continue such treatment as we have mentioned, until healed.	0.7961043
