Chapter seventy-seven: images of the instruments needed to extract the fetus.
Image of a spiral used to open the mouth of the uterus:
This binder, which is used to straighten books, similarly has two screws at the ends of the two pieces of wood, except that this screw should be finer than the binder, and should be made of either ebony or boxwood.
And the width of each piece of wood should be the thickness of two fingers, and their edge about a finger, and their length a span and a half.
And in the middle of the two pieces of wood are two projections of the same type of wood that have been fastened in them, their length being half a span or a little more, and their width about two fingers or a little more.
And these two projections are the ones that enter the cervix to open it when you turn the two screws; a picture of another instrument for the same purpose, finer and lighter:
It is made of ebony or boxwood in the shape of hooks, except that it has two projections at its end, as you see.
The length of each projection is about a span, and their width is two fingers.
If you want to open the cervix with it, sit the woman on a bed with her legs dangling and spread apart.
Then insert these two projections folded together into the opening of the cervix while you hold the end of the instrument below between her thighs.
Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with hooks, equally according to how much you want to open the cervix, until the midwife does what she wants.
Image of another spiral mentioned by the ancients:
Picture of the instrument with which the fetus is pushed:
Picture of the perforator with which the head of the fetus is perforated:
It resembles scissors, it has teeth at the end as you see.
And it may be made rectangular like hooks in this form as you see, it has teeth like the teeth of a saw, you cut and file with it.
Picture of a cannon also:
Picture of a fishing hook:
This hook should have some thickness so that it does not break when the fetus is pulled with it.
Picture of a hook with two barbs:
Picture of two wide scalpels for cutting the fetus:
All these instruments, the more numerous their types and the more prepared they are by the craftsman, the faster his work and the higher his status among people.
So do not disdain to have any instrument prepared.
For there will inevitably be a need for it.
