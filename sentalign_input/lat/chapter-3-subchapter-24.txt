On the treatment of dislocation of the lower jaw.
Chapter 25.
The two sides of the jaw rarely dislocate.
When both are dislocated, it occurs in one of two ways.
Either they are displaced slightly, becoming somewhat loosened,
Or they are entirely dislocated, so that they fall toward the chest, causing saliva to flow uncontrollably, preventing the patient from closing the mouth, and causing the tongue to interfere with speech.
When the dislocation is minor, it often returns to its normal position on its own with minimal intervention.
But if the dislocation is complete, it is necessary to reposition it quickly, without any delay. To do this, an assistant should hold the patient’s head still, while the physician inserts the thumb of one hand along the root of the jaw’s dislocation, on one side if only one side is dislocated.
Or, if both sides are dislocated, the physician should insert both thumbs simultaneously.
The other fingers should be placed outside to steady the movement.
Instruct the patient to relax the jaw, as if preparing to chew from side to side.
Then the physician should gently push the jaw, guiding it back into its position.
If repositioning is difficult, especially when both sides are dislocated, then apply warm steam with water and oil until the jaw can be repositioned more easily. Do not delay the procedure.
Once the jaw is realigned and the patient can close the mouth without looseness, place small cloth pads over the area, with a plaster made of wax and rose oil.
Then gently secure it with soft bindings.
The patient should sleep on their back with the head held steady between two pillows to prevent any movement to the sides and should avoid any chewing motions. Food should be given in soft sips until pain subsides and the jaw stabilizes; then, the patient may eat freely but cautiously.
The patient should avoid straining the jaw during eating, drinking, and yawning until the jaw is stable and healed.
If both sides of the jaw are severely dislocated and cannot be repositioned, fevers, continuous sweating, diarrhea, and possibly vomiting of bile may occur.
When these symptoms appear, know that it is likely fatal, and often the patient dies within ten days.
