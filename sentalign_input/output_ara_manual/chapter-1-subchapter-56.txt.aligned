On Cauterizing Bleeding that Occurs When an Artery is Severed.	On cauterization in haemorrhage arising from a cut artery.	0.8328383
Often bleeding occurs from an artery that has been severed during an external wound or during the incision of a tumor or the cauterization of a limb and so on, making it difficult to stop.	Very often there occurs bleeding from an artery which has been cut either by an external wound or in opening an abscess or in cauterizing a part of the body and so on, and it is difficult to stem.	0.85709363
If this happens to someone, quickly place your index finger on the opening of the artery and press firmly until you stop the blood flow beneath your finger so that nothing comes out.  Then place several small and large olive-shaped cauteries in the fire and blow on them until they become very hot.	When this happens to anyone, quickly apply your hand to the mouth of the artery, putting your forefinger to it and closing it properly till the bleeding ceases under your fingers and nothing comes out. Then put in the fire several olivary cauteries, small and large, and blow on them to make them very hot.	0.92640233
Then take one of them, either small or large, depending on the wound and the place where the artery ruptured, and place the cautery on the vessel itself after quickly removing your finger. Hold the cautery there until the bleeding stops.	Then take one, small or large according to the size of the wound and the site of the opening of the artery, and bring the cautery down right on the artery itself, after promptly removing your finger, and hold the cautery upon it till the blood ceases.	0.9228058
If the blood gushes out when you lift your finger from the mouth of the artery and the cautery is extinguished, quickly take another cautery from those prepared in the fire and continue doing this, one after another, until the bleeding stops.	But if it bursts out after you have removed your finger from the mouth of the artery, and the cautery has cooled, promptly take another of the cauteries which you have ready in the fire. Continue doing this, with one after another, till the haemorrhage is stanched.	0.85802186
Be careful not to burn a nerve that may be there, which would cause the patient further harm. Know that if an artery bleeds, it cannot be stopped, especially if it is a large artery, except by one of four methods: either by cauterization, as we have said, or by severing it, if it has not already been severed. For if it is severed, its ends contract, and the bleeding stops. Or it can be tied tightly with threads, or medications that stop bleeding can be applied to it, and it can be bandaged tightly.	Mind you do not burn any nerve which may be there, so that another calamity afflicts the patient. You should know that when there is arterial haemorrhage it is impossible to stop it, especially when the vessel is big, except in one of four ways, to wit: by the cautery as we have said; or by division of the vessel when it is not completely divided, for when it is cut through the ends of it contract and the bleeding is stopped; or by a strong thread ligature; or by the application of styptics with tight bandaging.	0.91638136
As for those who try to stop it with a bandage or by tightening with rags or applying burning substances and the like, it will not stop at all, except rarely. If this happens to someone, and a doctor or medicine is not available, let him immediately place his index finger on the mouth of the wound itself, as we have described.	But those who try to stop bleeding with ligatures or cloths, or by the application of caustics and the like, never stanch it by these means, or at least very rarely.	0.62650144
And he should press it very hard until the blood is contained and emerges from above the wound and the artery, and the finger should not be removed from it.  Continuously apply very cold water until the blood congeals, thickens, and stops flowing. During this time, consider what is needed in terms of cauterization or medication.	And if this happen to anyone and there are available neither doctor nor remedies, let him at once apply his forefinger to the mouth of the vessel as we have bidden and close it firmly till the blood is stanched; and pour over the wound and over the artery, without removing the finger, water as cold as possible till the blood thickens and congeals and ceases to flow. And meanwhile one should be considering what kind of cautery or medicine is indicated.	0.73307705
