of the abscess of the throat
When an abscess arises at the base of the throat or in the uvula, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, it subsequently festers and rots and ages and becomes a fistula; and you treat it as we have described in the sections, and it is not at all effective: then you must take a cautery according to the size of the fistula; then insert it into the opening of the fistula, and hold your hand there until the hot iron reaches the bottom of it, and the furthest point; and do this once or twice, then treat it with what we have described in the treatments, until it is healed; and if it is healed thus, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary to uncover the area and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in its chapter.
