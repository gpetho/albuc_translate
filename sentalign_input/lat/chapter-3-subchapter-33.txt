On the Treatment of the Dislocation of the Heel.
Chapter 34.
The heel sometimes shifts slightly, and sometimes dislocates fully.
Its dislocation occurs either inward or outward.
The sign of its dislocation is that you see the heel swollen, protruding toward the direction in which it is dislocated.
The treatment of its slight displacement is an easy reduction: it involves gentle extension with the hands, aligning it until it returns.
For treating a full dislocation, have the patient sit upright, and a very strong assistant should hold him from behind at the middle of his back.
Then grasp his foot with your right hand from the top, and with your left hand from the lower part of the foot at the ankle.
Then pull the foot toward you with your right hand.
Then do the same with the left hand twice.
Then extend with the left hand, and push the instep of the foot with the right hand toward the leg without strain.
Do this twice, as we described.
Then, on the third time, push the instep of the foot toward the leg, while you pull the ankle.
If it returns within one or two attempts in this way, and you see the foot aligned, that is good; if not, then repeat the procedure, for it will return.
But if the reduction resists with the method we described, then have the patient lie on his back on the ground, and firmly fix a stake in the ground so that it falls between his hips, having already wrapped it in cloth so as not to harm the patient.
Then one assistant should hold his hip, and another assistant should extend the foot, either with his hands or with a band tied around the ankle.
Then let each assistant pull against the extension of his counterpart; and let the stake stand between the patientâ€™s hips, holding him so that his body is not drawn downward during the extension.
Then the physician adjusts the dislocation with his hands, and another assistant holds the healthy leg downward.
For the dislocation returns quickly.
When the dislocation returns and its proper alignment is evident to you, then apply a plaster and cotton, bind it firmly with bandages, and tie the foot with a band to the leg.
It is necessary to be cautious regarding the nerves above the heel from the back, to ensure the bandage is not overly tight, which could injure them.
Then leave it undisturbed for two or three days.
If the bandage loosens, tighten it again; then loosen it on the third or fourth day. Restrict the patient from walking for forty days.
If he tries to walk before this time has passed, there is no assurance that the dislocation will not recur and worsen, making it beyond healing.
If a hot abscess forms, apply the treatment previously described in another section for cooling the inflammation, and apply embrocation until it is reduced.
