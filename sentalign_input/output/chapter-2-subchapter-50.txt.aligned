Chapter 50 on the abscess that occurs due to the twisting of nerves.	CHAPTER FIFTY. On the tumour arising from the twisting of a tendon.	0.64850336
Just as an abscess occurs in an artery and a vein, similarly an abscess occurs in the nerves when they are struck or due to excessive work, and for similar reasons.	As a tumour arises on an artery or a vein, so may it also come in a tendon when it has been bruised; or it may arise from excessive fatigue, or such causes.	0.79634416
And it occurs mostly in the places of the joints or the heel, or in any place where the joints are affected.	This occurs mostly at the wrists, at the heel, and at all sites of articular movement.	0.7349499
And it is a severe abscess, and it resembles the color of the rest of the body, and it is mostly in the large joints, and when it is pressed with force, the patient feels a kind of numbness in it.	It is a hard tumour of the same colour as the rest of the body, and is generally painless, and when strong pressure is put upon it the patient has a numb feeling in it.	0.719465
And it is not an abscess aggregated in the body's depth, and therefore it is under the skin, and it is affected all over and does not move forward or backward.	It is a tumour that does not form in the deeper tissues but is subcutaneous. It is freely movable laterally, but will not go forward or backward.	0.6606513
So those that are in the joints should not be invaded with iron, because it will very easily lead to contraction.	Those that are situated on joints should certainly not be tackled with the knife, for that often causes palsy.	0.65049577
But the one that is on the head or the forehead, separate the skin with a spatula. But if it is a small abscess, then hold it with scissors and cut it off from the roots.	Incise the skin of those occurring on the head or forehead, and if the tumour be small take hold of it with the forceps and cut it away by the root.	0.6481619
And if it is large, then you lift it with a hook, scrape it, and then remove it; and join the wound with stitches, and treat it until it is healed.	But if it be large, catch it up with a hook and dissect it away and remove it; and sew up the incision and dress until healed.	0.85592115
