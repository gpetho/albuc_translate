Chapter twenty-six on suturing the nose, lip, and ear
if their connection is severed by a wound or something similar
Know that whenever a separation of connection occurs in one of these cartilages, the treatment rarely succeeds except in some people.
So it is necessary, when something like this happens to someone, to see if the wound is fresh with its blood, to bring the edges of the wound together by stitching, then treat it until it heals.
And if the separation of the connection has separated its lips and each side has become sound, it is necessary to excoriate each side with the thickness of its visible skin until it bleeds, then bring the two lips together by stitching and tighten them, and sprinkle on it ground costus and frankincense, and put over the powder a plaster of date palm ointment or other vulnerary ointments, and leave it tight for two or three days, then loosen it and change the medication, and leave it until the stitches fall out on their own, then treat it with the ointment until it heals.
The method of stitching is to bring together the separation of the connection either with needles as we described in stitching the abdomen, or with thread as I explained to you there.
