O ye, most precious sons, I have completed this book which is the following of the science of medicine, assembled and fulfilled by its completion, and made the end according to its explanations and by its declaration. And it has come to me in vision that I will complete this with your help, which is part of the work of hands, namely "surgery".
And because the work of hands is forced in our region and strange everywhere, so has been lost the science and forgotten, and there remains only from it that the small descriptions in books of the ancients which have been moved by hands. And from this has come the error and the folly, and are closed the intentions, and are far away the science.
It seems to me that I will live if I follow the order of this book according the way of exposure and declaration and abbreviation; and came together the forms of the cautery instruments, and other tools of the work with the adjustment of the declaration and preparation of them, as it is necessary.
And because there is no good master of hands to be found in our times, the art of medicine has been stretched. And it is necessary that he who enters into this practice should understand the science of anatomy, as Galen says, until he knows how to measure the limbs, and their forms and connections and separations, and have knowledge of bones and nerves and joints and the number of these parts, and the movement and the stillness, and from them their origin.
And by this, Hippocrates says that the needle is much with the flesh and little with the work. and even in the art of the hand.
We say in the introduction of this book that he who is not familiar with the things said before should be careful lest he err and lose men.
and so I have wanted to warn many times of those who intervene in this science and abandon their knowledge and sense, and experiments.
I saw a madman who cut open an abscess of boils or neck of a woman, and cut the arteries at the neck; because so much blood came out that the woman died between his hands.
And I saw another madman who cut a stone from an old manâ€™s body, and the stone was large; so he took out a piece of the bladder with it and died of internal injuries three days later.
And I had heard that they call it the treatment, and I saw the condition of the patient and the size of the wound, and I knew whether the patient would die.
And I saw another madman who took treatment from the duke of our land who had a broken leg, and with the fracture he inflicted an injury;
and the madman who was ignorant of his craft tied the fracture to the wound with strong leather and did not allow it to be cleaned, and so he finished off the patient.
and he instructs him not to remove it;
and stayed like that until the leg was completely withdrawn and the foot came to destruction.
I am summoned to come to him, and I hasten to come to remove the leg; and when I saw it was dislocated, he had peace and felt no pain.
But all the corruption in his body was already confirmed on the limb, and it could not be cured;
and the corruption did not cease to spread through the limb until the limb was entirely lost.
And there is another method which destroys the pus and charms it, and then inflames with the evil of its power.
For a cancer when it is purified with melancholic humors does not require that it be touched with iron unless there is no chance to remove what is corrupted.
And therefore, dear son, you must know that the work of hands is divided into two parts: It means "This is to know, for there is risk in many types of dispositions;".
And I will show in each one of these books where there is fear and danger.
For this reason it is necessary that you keep them to yourself, so that your enemies cannot speak badly of you.
If you take up your arms in consideration, and carry your patients gently but firmly, and use the best course, if it is through the grace of God that you will come to safety and be praised;
and leave frightful diseases without health.
And hold your arms against what makes you doubt, and have faith in them so that you can come from this world to the other with glory.
Gallien says of some their admonitions: Don't take it as a cure for a bad illness, unless you are called "fool's medicine".
I have devised this treatise according to three chapters.
The first chapters are of fire cautery and cold medicine, and the chapters are ordered from head to feet.
and of forms of discharges, and iron tools for cautery, and of all that is necessary in the work.
The second chapters are of cutting and piercing, and air viceses, and wounds, and extractions of arrows, and similar things;
and the chapters are ordered and the forms of discharges.
The third chapter is about restoring dislocations and twists, and similar things;
and to be ordered by just as much weight, and by the shapes of instruments.
Just as we remember the work, it is fitting to say what the quality of aid and the danger of each condition are.
I say that the qualities of aid and the malady are the longest words and subtle knowledge and the secret responses;
and of this they spoke the many wise men, and agreed with it;
and they softened their words a little, because I am of long speech.
I say that cautery brings aid universally to all complexion, whatever the material it is of; which are hot complexion with matter, and dry complexion with matter.
In a hot and dry assembly of matter, they discussed and said that fire cautery is great aid. and the others said the opposite: that fire cautery is of no value to an illness that comes from heat and dryness. For the nature of fire is hot, and should not be treated with cold for heat, nor with dryness.
and this one who said the opposite that fire cautery is great aid to hot and dry illnesses that come into the body of humans. Because when you buy the body of man and its moisture is in accordance with the nature of fire, you find that the body freezes.
And I agree with this word. For I have never found it through experience.
And not to involve fire unless he who has tried it, and knows through long usage of the cautery book, and the diversity of human complexities, their diseases' causes and conditions, and remedies and space of time.
We have no fear of other kinds of humors, namely cold and moist ones. And all the doctors agreed and concurred on using cautery.
And know this, sons, that cautery combines fire with the secrets of cures, and greater good than applying hot medication.
For fire is simple, and it does not come from fire except to a limb that is burned, and it does not affect any other limb if it is not named.
Medicines applied from part to part by moving them, bring diseases and pains of the body. And sometimes it brings on the disease in the patient.
Fire for its heat and because of the nature of its substance does not do that, unless it has been superfluous.
And this is what I have found by experience and through the length of time served in the art, and this was revealed to me on the nature of things.
And for this reason I make excuses for the length of my speech, because it is not pleasing to me that I impart the secret which is restored by fire, and the quality of the work, how it cures diseases of the body, as the philosopher said when he demonstrated. Instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
And know, son, when they will agree on what time the cauterizations must be done, and they set up prayers.
And I say that cautery is advantageous in all times, because the harmful consequences are avoided by the aid of cautery. and himself, when he cuts, inflicts pain necessary and unavoidable, that the time which is more severe than great evil does not come to the limb.
And do not think dear son, how they make fools of men. because to the disease that is cured by cautery there is no return. and he says so;
and he says so; but it's not so as they think, because cautery is not that medicine which changes the complexion, and dries up the humors that are the cause of pain, but rather worthless medicine for haste's sake, and because of the virtue of its work and lordship.
And it is possible that the disease comes at any time according to the patient's complexion, and the nature of the disease, and its virtue;
and the humors are assembled in him with superfluities through the acquisition of food and similar things; but if you do not administer cauterization to him when he has little superfluity and moisture, as is done by cauteries on the dens for pain, and the similar things, because then the pain does not return. but this happens little.
And most people do not understand why cauterization is called the rear of medicine, and this means seeing;
but they do not believe that cauterization is worth after medicine, but their understanding is false, and it is cauterization the rear of medicine because when we administer ways of cures in any disease and they are worthless, then we administer to it our cautere, and it is valuable.
And then open, for cutting with fire is the medicine of the rear parts, not according to the foolish opinions.
The ancient ones said that cautery with an instrument of gold is more effective than with iron, and they say that fires were used only for the quality of gold and for the height of its substance;
and they said that the effects of cautery do not cause decay, but this is not seen because I have tried it and found that it is seen in some people;
and that instruments of gold are more valuable than iron, as they have said. And all you see when you hold an instrument of gold is not how it is charged with the quality of gold, and if it has just now cooled down;
and if it is heated too much; so they are made of fire. and thus there is a great hindrance.
Or you have ordered this chapter on the treatment of the upper joints just as if they were at the foot.
This cautery is good for moist and cold on the head, because one does it for the cause of a disease called "soda", and also for many humors that come out of the head to the eyes, ears, and because of numerous dreams and pain in the teeth and throat, and themselves for all diseases that come from cold, such as paralysis, soda, apoplexy, and similar illnesses.
The form of this cautery is that the patient should be purged with medicine to dissolve the humors or four humors, according as the virtues and the blood and the accustomed condition of the patient can bear. and then make red the head of the patient.
And then have him sit cross-legged between your hands and place his hands on a soft cushion.
after placing the root of your palm above the root of his nail, between his two eyes. and when you strike with your two fingers, if it bleeds from the incision then heat the cautery which is called "olivare", because this is the form: And put on the left shoulder a mark of ink, and make it descend and pull back your hand little by little in turning; then lift your hand immediately, and reward the left shoulder if you see a small bone. and if you do not see it, repeat the cautery until you see the bone as I have told you.
After taking a small portion of the wool, and put it in a warm cloth, and place it on the shoulder, and let him stay for three days;
after putting cotton moistened in butter. and let it stay until the inflammation is gone; After the treatment of the wound, the "tetrafarmacÃ³n" which is called an ointment, so long as it is healed.
And the ancients say that when you keep the wound open longer, it purges. and therefore one is advised to close it.
And none of these said that you must so cauterize the wound that part of the bone is burned, and then replace what has been burned with bone, and be cured.
And they say that one must cauterize it so long as the flesh is loose, and push it so strongly as to press down on a bone just as wide as a thread which women sew into their bodices because this causes the humors to flow out through the wound.
and one must keep the wound open for a long time afterwards. afterwards one should cure and apply ointment.
And these two kinds of cauterizations do not seem good to me altogether, fire whether in some people there is a way of living with fear;
and I think it's better to leave.
because the joints are weakened by continued exposure to nature, as we have observed in other parts.
and the same when a patient's joints are weak from nature, and the first appearance of cauterization is more salubrious and beneficial to me, and that's why I work on it accordingly therefore this is salvation.
When in all the head comes chronic pain that lasts a long time, then the patient must use herbs and pills called "cockie", and cleansing of the head with oils and plasters; And if they make the cautery as we have said, and it does not work. Watch that if the head of the sick person is of strong constitution, and it is not too cold; and then the cautery should be done below as we have said above. After doing the cautery on each corner of the head just where the bone is, as we have said, and do the cautery on the one that is called "wasser", or blood vessel; and it is the point where you put a dressing. And hold your hand so that you do not feel with your fingers just against the bone; the patient feels much more great pain in this cautery than the others, and I will speak elsewhere;
and it is fitting that the cauterizing of horns are more subtle than those which cauterize the mortality of the head, and this is their form:
Fire cautery of the head When sudden pain comes in one part of the head, and disease is spread from there to the bone, and the joints are purified by medicines that bring forth blood, and other cures have been done as I mentioned earlier for the division of diseases, and all this does not help. therefore the cut must be cauterized in two ways, namely by hot medicine and by fire.
the cauterizing by hot medicine is that you prick a double [thickness] of flesh, and remove the skin and apply two points to the joints, and then make an opening in the temple where the pain resides in such a way that you can put back the doubled thickness of flesh under the skin;
And when she is reset so that the ligature and restraint are done well, and she is left to rest for 12 hours; and then remove the bandage and apply fire to the dose of garlic, and leave the wound for 2 days or 3. then put on a cotton poultice in butter until it stops bleeding.
After the treatment of dressing, until he is healed;
and if you see, do as I have written or prescribed the medicine to burn.
The iron cautery is done in this manner. Heat the cautery of what is this form:
And it is called "closer" because the head is shaped like a bell or has a little bird's beak, and in its middle there is a small appearance;
And put the sore on the shoulder, and hold your hand there and twist the flesh a little lighter, until the moisture of the cure is burned.
Leave your hand where the arteries are not inflamed, which is in front, and because of excessive bleeding.
After putting cotton on the wound to clean it, and put a poultice on the shoulder for three days; then I put cotton wet in butter, and then treat the shoulder with ointment until it is healed;
And if you want to cauterize this migraine with the cautery called "cultellare", at all points, and keep the artery covered in this migraine which is not old.
of the migraine.
When you treat migraine in the way we have said in divisions of diseases, and do not benefit from it, and see that those who use cautery before say about medicine and iron did not suffer, then it is necessary to heat the cautery which is called "cultellare" until it becomes white;
and so cut on the limb a line of half an inch long, and grasp your hand once, and strain so that you do not cover the artery and that it does not live until the bone;
and guard the mandible which dies when you chew, and let the nerves not touch anything but the dead flesh and that spasms do not come to the patient, and guard against the corruption of blood from the artery when it is cut, or if it is cut there will be great fear and myself and others who are experienced. and leave the work in its original place;
but I will tell you how to stop the bleeding when an artery is cut, and I will show you where in this book it occurs.
and if you see that this cautery does not bring relief to the disease, and the patient suffers greatly, cauterize the affected area also as we have said, and treat the wound until it is healed.
and if you see, administer the cautery that we have said or the chapter of artery extraction, with the cautery that has two punctures; and is this cautery more effective than that one and more beneficial.
of pain from the ears due to frostbite.
When pain comes from the ear due to frost, and you have tried solutive medicines and other cures that we have said on division, and the pains do not cease, then apply this cauterization which is called "pins", because it has this form:
After poking all around the diseased ear, or in between the two when the pain holds in both, and you remove a little outward from the root of the ear then mark the spot with the instrument. And hold a distance of X points between each ear;
After the treatment, let him be so healthy.
From the torture of the mouth.
Torture that must be cured with cautery except for those that are moved by inflammation, as we have said in divisions of disease;
and do not perform cautery on symptoms that come from a scab and phlegm of nose.
When you cure this symptom of torture that is moved by inflammation of the head and nose, and those are not cured with phlegm and purging, then it is necessary to cauterize the patient with three cauteries: one in the root of the ear, and another near the temple, and the third at the junction of the two lips;
and put the cautery in the part that is open and healthy, and they make a cautery straight on the head of the ear above one piece below the forehead, and another as far as the length of our finger; and let the cautery stay above until the moisture of the wound is burned.
and this is the shape of the cautery:
And it is the resemblance of a knife like that which we have shown before, but it is slightly more subtle and therefore it should be that the knives are slightly larger;
After the wound has healed as I have said, until it is fully cured.
When epilepsy is ancient and you cure it as we have said, but the patient does not recover, and there is no fever, then do four cauteries: In the second place concerning the two horns of the head and the eye where we have named "vasselez", as we previously said, and cauterizing on the lower part of the stomach's mouth;
and are treated in the same way as we have said before.
of lachrymation (lacrimation).
For this illness it is customary to give the patient large and bitter pills, a brain-stimulating substance.
After removing the head of the patient, and applying on it a poultice made from sainfoin, which is written to treat poultices.
and this is the manner of cauterizing: as I have said.
If he is so afflicted, then good is his state; and if it is not so, make three cauterizations of the neck in front of the chin, with a space of two fingers between each cauterization.
and the treatment as for the others, and if you have any other symptoms, and the patient suffers, then make one cauterization in the middle. and if it is so, two other cauterizations on the two horns, and the treatment until he is healthy;
and let them be the cauterizations called "olivare", as I have said before.
It is necessary that the head be cleansed with wine and what we have previously said;
After the patient has recovered, take the head of the sick person, and then perform fire cautery on each ear and on the middle of the spine.
And if you need further treatment, and the body is moist and the patient is suffering, and the disease is severe, then perform fire cautery on the spine at the back. And let it dry for as long as possible to cool down, and lift your hand; After the treatment as long as it is safe and sound, and so the cautery which is called "olivare" that we have previously mentioned.
Of epilepsy
The epileptics should use fire cautery only on those who are flaky, and it is best to first cleanse the brain of years and other treatments that we have mentioned in the division when the patient is large and suffers from many pain medicines.
And if it is a child who cannot suffer, then make gargling and masticating of molarium to clean the brain often with boiled meat.
After the king's head is cut open, and he follows our instruction, and we perform the fire cautery according to what we have said previously, and we perform the fire cautery on the neck, and on each corner; and if the patient is strong and suffers, we will perform fire cautery as I have told to one who has paralysis and softening of the body, on the spine at the back and neck, and so we will perform olive cautery according to the manner that I have said.
If the patient is sick, then if they make the fire cautery subtle according to this manner:
When by the cause of melancholy there are superfluities or moist ones corrupted and swollen greatly, then the cautery for cuttings as we have said to those who have paralysis.
And if by the cause of melancholy the superfluities are declining to melancholy, and the body of the sick person is moist, then the doctor should give him something for which the intellects must be purified, according to what it is in front in the division.
After the king's head is cut open on the patient; after placing a linen bandage well made, like a circle, on the head;
and if they cross their arms, and are well held in all parts;
After presenting the linen, take vinegar made from old wool fat. and hold the heat tempered with fire, so that the patient may bear it. After drawing a circle inside the head, and letting it cool down;
and do this to the patient each week once with good governance, until he is healed.
If you see cautery being done while making multiple pricks all over the cautery.
This kind of cauterization increases the brain's inflammation;
and then put on moist cotton in butter and fat from gelatin.
of the eyes When the eye pain comes first from the signs that I said in the division, then begin and do thus: give to the patient a purifying drink of wine, and clean off all moisture from the head, and make him sweat or take a bath several times at dawn.
After instructing him to repeat his head, and doing cauterization inside the head again, and then doing it again on both temples, if there are two swellings of the fever in one temple together with its eyes, or in the other.
And cut at all the cautery on every vein and artery that is under the skin, and so let them be cut long according to the length of the temple.
And be careful of the decrement of blood, and if you see too much blood coming out, then stain with powdered iron as you have.
And I will teach you in the extraction of arteries and in incising how to take care when you extract them;
And sometimes one cuts or applies cauterization under the two bones behind.
and we see that this is due to superficial cold swelling, so make the fire cautery which I have mentioned earlier, applying it under the eyelids. Apply the fire cautery to the forehead, and apply it to both temples, and apply it below the two bones. and if there is further damage, then make the fire cautery more severely applied above the eyebrow to all small cauterizations.
When you have prescribed medicine according to what we have said in the division, and it does not profit him at all, then take away three noxious medicines from the patient. After the king-like treatment of the forehead, and make fire cautery on one side of the middle cauterization olive oil. And do the second cautery on the cautery which is called "clavilis" on both shoulders, a little below the neck;
and guard the artery so you do not cover it.
And this is the form of the cautery called "clavilis":
When the paper of oil is softened by disease and moisture, then the cautery called "olivare". of which this is the form:
And if you see, do the second cautery on both shoulders just as long as the shoulder is.
and do not hold back your hand except until the third part of the paper is burned, according to what I have said.
One hair that sticks out when it's wet. Never has happened that the hair of the oiled person is converted into parchment, and pricked with ointment, and then do cauteries according to two manners: that is to say by fire, or by burning medicine.
Instruct the patient to let his hair grow long and even; And if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When they have grown and are even, then put the patient on a healthy bed; After putting on paper around the eyes a figure like that of the mirror of myrtle, and as it was at the beginning of signs of hairs;
Then put cotton soaked in oil and myrrh of persimmon on the wound, then take off the cautery to see how it is shaped:
After cutting on the figure you have drawn, slowly and slowly a little at a time, until the color is reddened to the spot;
and the signs of health for the work is that you see the paper retracted, and the hairs raised at the tip of the nail;
and therefore lift your hand, and let it stay for three days, then put cotton soaked in butter until the swelling is gone; after the ointment treatment until it is healthy.
and if after that the hairs grow and the paper becomes soft then again apply the fire cautery on the same spot as you did first.
and if the hairs are fallen off then apply fire cautery until the paper rises to its natural position, and becomes even, and no longer touches the hair with the nail.
The cauterizing of medicine is that you instruct the patient to let the hairs grow long and even; then make a parchment the shape of mint leaves.
then take French soap and live charcoal, one of each. and make it quickly, if it does not freeze; then sprinkle upon the shape you made like the leaf of mint, and put on paper eyes. and if the sickness is held in only one oil, then you must apply it to both. and put the oil-soaked cotton cloth around the wound.
and the patient's joints are in your healthy state, and show the medicine to the doctor, and press one poultice at a time whenever the patient feels pain from the medicine, for he feels it as if of fire.
When you have done this for a long time, then remove the medicine from your body. And when the inflammation of the cautery has passed, lift the limb from above, and repair so that if you see the paper lifted as it was lifted by constraint of fire or by incision; and if it is thus, then it is well.
If this is not so, then apply again the medicine to the limb or if it has not worked, until your work is even and your eyes are put in their place.
Then put on cotton moistened in butter until the wounds are closed, after applying "dysphene" and other cures until it is healed.
And if you must guard yourself well at your wound with great care so that it does not touch the medicine,
And if the paper becomes swollen after, and the hair is pricked in oil, then resume the medicine on that limb which has become swollen from the paper properly, just as you did before. After the treatment so that they are healed;
and this is the form of the poultice made with the leaves of myrtle:
And so it is known that the eyes of men are different in size and in smallness, and according to this be your constraints;
And do not respond with the straight way to one who has studied this art.
Of the treatment of fistula by fire cauterization.
When you treat a fistula as we have said in the divisions of diseases, and your cures are not profitable, then it is necessary that you cauterize it according to this manner.
Instruct the patient to put his head on your healthy side; and have the patient's chin between your hands in such a way that it does not move or turn its head;
After put cotton soaked in vinegar or persil juice on the wound;
After the cauterization which is a part of:
and it sticks to the head like a quill from a pen, so that they stick together.
if you see, if it is stuck between the one head and the other, and if you see, so that they are joined together like a tent.
but this is true only for your work.
After pressing the abscess it bursts open, and extracting the pus, and drying. and if it is closed, then you work on it again, and extracting fires the bowels.
after putting the cauterization on, and keeping your hand to the cauterized part on the skin, so that your hands do not go mad. and set the fire cautery in the fat of oil, and let it corrupt.
If you are coming to the beginning of the cautery just at the bone, then it would be good. If this does not work, repeat the fire cautery once more, and if you need to do it again, let it remain for three days.
After that, place it on wet cotton in butter, and apply the cure of the ointment desiccant until he is cured, and if forty days have passed and he is still not cured, then apply the medicine that is acid and corrosive until the bones are uncovered. and let him follow according to what he comes into his chapter.
And there is also a method of cautery for a fistula that none of the ancient ones said. To cure an abscess, and take it away from the patient; After placing in the wound a subtle thread of what is its form: and they cut to the length of one pound. and hold your hand firmly, and do not move the patient at all, except for when the pus is drawn out of the wound.
and it is advisable to put some cotton wool soaked in wine or oil on the wound.
the pus is drawn out and the healthy part remains in its place of movement.
But if the fistula is healed by the cautery that we have said, it is good. If it is not so, then if necessary administer poultices on the wound, and bring the fistula back to the body according to what seems good in his own proper care.
of fissures in the lips. Often there are fissures in the lips called "poil", and similarly in the lips of children.
When you treat these fissures according to what we have said in our divisions, and the treatment does not help, then take a small cauterization with a culinary knife in that shape:
And put it at once into those crevices until it comes out in the same place.
after drawing out the pus, keep the animal intact until it is healthy.
When an abscess comes in the root of the throat or in the ear, or on the palate, or at the roots of the teeth, after being putrid and rotten, and has become a fistula; And you cure him just as we have said in divisions, and it does not bring any benefit: Therefore it is fitting that you cut according to the size of the fistula; After the bandage or dressing of the fistula, and hold your hand where the iron needle goes into him;
and do so once or twice, after the treatment we have said in treatments, until he is fully recovered;
and if he is cured thus, it is good; and if not, it is fitting to discover the cause and remove the corrupted bone, according to what you will find in his book.
When the gums are softened by moisture and the teeth move, and you treat with medicine and it does not work, then put the head of the sick person on a safe place. After using the cautery, which will form a wound in this manner, then place a chain on the tooth;
and put the cautery hot in there so tightly that you hold it with one hand and let the patient feel the heat coming to the root of the tooth;
After lifting your hand and then recommencing the cautery according to your will;
After filling the patient's mouth with a solution of water and salt, let it sit for an hour and rich fires.
And in such a way the teeth which were moving are fixed, and the gums softened restrained, and the moistures corrupted dried up.
of the pain of the teeth
When pain of teeth comes from coldness, or if there is coldness in the ear, and the remedies of medicine are worth nothing, then it must be necessary to perform cautery according to two manners: and butter cautery, and fire cautery.
Butter cautery if it is so that you grease with butter of vinegar, and the end in a iron or bronze spoon; after taking cotton and covering it with vinegar-soaked cloth on the tip of a tent needle, and the gum is set in butter, and put on the painful tooth hastily and hold until it cools;
and so does it many times until the virtues come to the root of the tooth, and if you see that gummed cotton and cloth in butter burn, and put on the painful tooth, and place iron hot so that the heat comes to the tip of the tooth.
The fire cautery is assembled with the fire so that you grasp a chain of iron or flint, and it is thick enough so that the flames do not reach the mouth of the patient;
After heating the cautery, it will form there afterwards, and place it on the tooth, holding your hand until the cautery cools;
do this often, because the pain will be eliminated on the same day or the next day.
and it is fitting that the patient fills their mouth with good butter in haste while applying the cautery, and then rubs it on.
and this is the form of the cautery:
And make a cautery on that head wher thou wilt, and according to thy power;
and this is the form of the knife:
Described by scrofula When scrophules are swollen from cold and moistors, and do not obey digestion by medicines, then take the fire knife, for this is what comes next, and apply two openings to the swelled part in order that the fumes may escape with the cautery of the other side.
and place the fire knife hot on the abscess once, or until it begins to flow with its own blood.
and if the abscess is small, put knife according to its quantity, and leave it so for three days; and cover with a moistened cloth in butter until the sore is healed;
After a cure, the joint of limbs is restored with ointments and poultices until it is healthy.
When moisture overcomes the channels of the flesh, and when it comes from a cold complexion, then it is fitting that patients be evacuated first by medicinal solutes;
After cutting fire at the root of the neck, and keeping in mind that you do not come near the throat, but rather avoid burning the wound with little heat.
After cutting fire at the shoulder joint near the head of the spine, and applying cautery to what is called "clavicle" because we have a shape like it.
And restore the joint as we previously said, until it is healthy.
When all and malady of the womb are caused by cold moisture, and the patient has no fever nor thirst, and it is a long-standing disease, they should make two cauteries on the liver in their bodies. and another cautery at the navel between the two nipples;
and that which is called "clavicle" according to its shape, is before mentioned.
If you see, perform a cautery in pricking at the entire cautery which is called "points" because of its form, that is before mentioned in the disease of the ears;
and the points should be done at a depth of just thirty-three or forty.
After the treatment according to what is said before, and let there be three pricks according to this form:
And because it is easier to do so, because you make three cuts at once.
of shoulder dislocation
When the head of the shoulder is dislocated due to moisture, and it is reset but cannot stay in place, repeatedly dislocating with slight movement as we have experienced, then you must first reset the dislocation. After, rub the patient on his back and on his chest; After the knife is lifted from the itch, take it with your left hand.
and if the joint is dislocated within, then cut with a hot knife of two nerves, it is in that form:
and burn the wound until it is felt on this side, and the fester of the cautery together with four burns:
and because of this, it is done with the cautery that has three nerves, because the figures of cautery are so many cauteries;
and they are nerves according to the subtlety of a tent, and this is the form of the cautery with three nerves:
And at times it is pressed against this nerve because there are eight cauteries.
After put on the cautery pearl-encrusted broth with thread; After a period of rest, instruct the patient not to move the limbs for a long time until they are well comforted.
And if the head of the shoulder is dislocated, since this happens little often, then apply cauterizing on thick bone or many cauterizing points.
For the joint is closed, and it is covered with moisture and it heals the patient.
When frost is in the stomach and much moisture remains, then it must be extracted to its condition, and many purges occur to it, and the usual remedies do not benefit it, therefore it is necessary that the patient lies on his back, and extends his legs and hands. After that, perform 3 fire cauteries (I) under the nail of the finger, in proportion to the size of two, all over the cautery clavicle; and 2 more cauteries on either side so that the edges of the cauteries are at 3 angles, and there is an equal space between one and the other so they do not come together when rotting.
and let the cauteries be so deep that they stain the two parts of the skin, and so make the shape of the cauteries in this form with adjacency:
And if you see a cautery being performed over a large wound in the stomach in this form;
And he who fears this cautery, should prick himself and point at the stomach with that quantity. then cut him to the entire cautery which is called "point".
After the treatment of the treatment we had before, until it is healed.
As for the liver, pain arises from cold and moisture and great ventosity, so much that it is forced to change its natural composition because of the superfluities; and the sick are cured of those things which we have said in divisions, and they do not benefit from it, if it is necessary to bring them down onto their haunches; and the third incision according to this form and shape and quantity on the liver, excluding the hypochonders, when the ribs come into contact with it;
and hold an interval of space between each cautery the size of a dog. and let the cauterization be long along the body, and do not press hard on your hand at all during the cauterization.
and let it be burned only on the moist parts of the wound, and let the patient keep his feet right.
and if he cannot, so let it be for the groin, and stretch his legs, and lift his knees.
And if you wish to, cauterize those cuts on the sword's edge, if you are subtle and wise in this art, and be careful not to burn all the wound, for you will dry out the whole body. and let him not come until he is sufficiently cooled, for the keys are very subtle at that place, and his senses must be watched in order to see.
When there is an abscess on the liver, and you see whether it is in the flesh of the liver or in the linen. if it is in the flesh, he feels the patient's pain but not too much.
and if it is in the linen, he feels a painful frenzy.
And when this treatment requires applying poultices, it is advisable that the patient lies on his head.
and then sign the patient where the abscess is, and then apply heat to the cautery which resembles a splinter, so that it can take the form. And cauterize as long as the keys are hot, and it comes just from a sore, until the wound is completely set aflame;
after the treatment as prescribed according to the treatment of the wounds until it is healed.
and it is not fitting to use this cauterization on anyone else but those who have studied for a long time in the art of medicine, and by whose hands these diseases have been cured once.
And so one can boldly perform it, and often I think that wounds should be left alone.
of cauterizing the pleurisy
The ancient said that we should do cauterization of pleurisy with roots of arsotle, and in this manner: take a root of arsotle that is longest, the one you can find, and make it dry, and so large and as long as your thumbs. and the warts in oil, and seize with fire, and cauterize between the navel and the neck, and cut off two cuts down from descending to the part which is below the beard;
and cut off between the fifth and sixth ribs, declining back a little. and cauterize the little toe, and another on the stomach, between two spines, and two along the two ribs, before the one that is between the two spines;
and do not press on my hand, but make it wide as in an odorant.
And said an old man that no one uses the fire cauterization similar to the razor, and the soldering iron and put them between the ribs, until it comes to the abscess; And so the fire burns the pain, as we have said in the passage about the liver.
But in this work there is great fear for the sick, or they are dead now, or a fistula comes that cannot be healed.
of mice.
When you cure the mouse disease, of which we have said in the divisions of the treatments, and it does not benefit, then they assert that there are three ways of cautery that all are good.
From which one has a certain method that you make three cauteries, or four, binding according to the length of the mouse, according to the figure of the fire liver treatment as we have said before.
and do not press your hand too hard on the cautery, and let the patients lie on their back.
and another method of cautery is that you heat the cautery to two points, as we have shown in the dislocation of the shoulder.
and let the wound be tied in place, or if the wound is on the side nearest to the left, and tie the elevations accordingly, according to the wound, according to the length of the body, and the cautery as much as the breadth of the body.
Instruct the patient to put 2 fingers in the burn until the pain is perceived on the other side, and then apply fire to the cautery, and so four times.
And if you see, that it burns all the cautery to three fingers.
After the treatment when it has been soiled with rot for a long time, and this is what we said before.
Fire is not good for dropsy, except when applied to the way called "asclytes".
When you cure according to the ways we have said in divisions, and your cure does not benefit, then it is fitting that you make four cauterizations inside the wound, on the stomach, on the liver, on the liver again, two behind the back under the spine, and one under the knee; and so the cauterizations are well near the spot of the wound.
After leave the cauterization to open for a long time due to putrid flesh, and do not give up on the patient's cure after the cauterization. and healing would hasten, and both kinds of intentions would come together with God's aid.
The form of the cautery for the abdomen is like the claw that we have previously shown. And this one on the back should be olive-like, as it was placed there before.
When the feet are swollen in one who is dropsical and contain a lot of pus like citron, it is necessary to cauterize on the back between the little finger and the ring finger. And lift your hand with the cautery, as if to turn.
And do not enter too deeply, otherwise it will melt like fire, and let the cautery be according to this form:
After do this for both legs, two cauterizations on each leg at the point of the little knife. and let the fire cautery be applied to the long ones, one in front of the knee joint and the other behind it, in the thigh.
and let them remain long enough to heal what's inside.
after the treatment of other treatments that we have said.
When stomach and intestines are inflamed due to cold and moisture, where the virtues of digestion and retention that are found in the stomach and intestine are deficient, and cannot be cured with other remedies. and you see the patient suffering much and with strong flatulence, so do you apply fire cautery on the stomach as he spoke of it before, or to the cauterization of the stomach, in order. and 4 cauteries are done under the subtle nose to all cautery needles, and 2 cauteries above the joints.
If you see the moistors abundant and the patient suffering, perform fire cautery on the fingernail, and fire cautery on each joint, and two times fire cautery on the stomach beneath the great one, because the cure is beneficial when it has good aid.
Of the treatment of hemorrhoids.
When hemorrhoids are on the fundament or one or more and are ancient and of large cold and moist corrupted humors, and are treated as we have said in divisions, but it does not profit, then do cauteries: Three on the spine of the back, those who are entirely behind the lower vertebrae and are a little bit in front in a triangular shape, and one cautery under the nose twice.
and if you think his stomach is chilled and the meat does not cook, and the face swells up, then one cautery on the stomach, as it has been said, and one more above the liver, and one more above the spleen to all needle cauteries. and let the fire cautery be held for a long time. After the treatment let the limb be healed.
When you bind the limb, if it seems like a razor has been applied to it, and then set it on fire completely over the limb that was bound. and let your hand be left so the cautery comes to the base of the vein, because it is sterile.
do this once more, and if there is much swelling of the limb, cautery each part as we have said. after the application of ointments, until they are healed.
and if you set a great cautery on the swollen place, it will have even greater relief.
When the patients cannot endure a lance or an opening, what we will tell him in his own tongue, if it comes to this illness that cannot be healed except by cautery.
When there is a fistula and it has become inflamed, decayed, and putrid due to moisture and corruption, if you examine it thoroughly, and notice how deep it goes.
After the cauterization which seems like a razor, and pours it into the fistula according to the quantity that has entered, and repeats the cautery until the body is scorched and corrupted once, or twice, or three times, as much as the amount of blood needed;
and beware of tearing the nerve that is inflamed, and large veins.
if the fistula goes to the body of the intestine and into the colon, be cautious with these things, and do not make fire that only burns in a walnut, and suppose they are not human.
after curing the animal until it is completely healed, and if the lesions are cleaned and the matter has long been discharged, then you know that the animal has completely recovered.
and if the material is not bone, then know that it is hard, and corrupted the bone at its form; and thus as of one such thing which we will speak about in his place.
When pain from frost comes to the joints, and great swelling, and does not take hold of a woman, then it is fitting that you apply fire cautery on both sides of the joint from which frost has come, using the clavicle cautery that we have previously mentioned.
and if the cauterized area is in the middle, then three cauteries are to be done in line, and this will bring greater relief.
of the bladder When the bladder is weak and swollen from frost and moisture, so that the patient retains urine, then make fire cautery in the part behind the bladder, where the hair of the groin meets, and left and right, each one to be cauterized as long as possible like.
And let the fire cautery be done for his back, or if he has need of it.
and let them cut the clavicle in the shape as previously said.
When the flesh is cold and moist, and will not conceive, and the flowers are corrupted and their ends late. and when they come, it feels great pain. therefore it is fitting that one should make three fire cauteries around the wound, as we have said in the fire cautery of the bladder, and let them cut the flesh behind the back;
and also they should cut the clavicle, as we have said.
When the moist viscous discharge descends to the joint of the hunchback, and because of this it remains still, and the signs are that the thigh is longer than the other when measured together;
And it is found that the joints are swollen in the departure of flesh, so it is fitting that you cauterize the patient on the skin of the flank with fire cautery similar to a circle, and sign before the joint as it turns, so that the skin is within the circle;
and if the cautery is like those applied to the stomach.
And if this cautery is not present, then let the three cauteries be made of olive oil, and do them as well as all the wounds.
and heal him so that he is cured.
Of the pain of the groin When pain comes to the skin of the flank, and it's from cold and moisture, and the patients are cured by what we said in the division, and the treatment does not work, and the illness is old. Then it is necessary to cleanse the patient of the thick humors of rotten pills or other hard-sounding pills. After applying the fire cautery;
and the manner of cautery is according to two kinds: which means applying medicine in an assembly and fire cautery.
Fire cautery is according to many ways, of which one is such that:
that you cauterize on the root of the hawthorn, or apply three cauteries in a triangular form, and make them deep and broad, with space between each cautery equal to twice the thickness of an ox's hide, and let there be olive oil cauteries.
Never is cautery performed at noon above the nape of the neck, for there are four times according to this form:
And if you see, so that the cauterizing at the cauterization of the circle which we have before said in the dislocation of the shoulder.
but cut in such a way that the circles contain all the shoulder, and all the thickness of the bone be burned.
And this is the way to do it in sciatik, when the pain stays in the haunch and does not reach as far as the thigh or as far as the knee.
And if it comes just above the thigh and the knee, so that they do two cauterizations in the place where the patient says the pain is, and four cauterizations above the ankle on the left side.
and if they are cauterized with a knife, and burn the thickness of the bone.
and if the patient feels that the pain spreads just to two or four feet away from where they cut, they should cauterize it where they feel the pain three times or four times, which is called "pain". And if that happens, if they make more.
And if the patient feels that the pain is below the knee towards the thigh, they should cauterize using the cutlery or circular cautery, and be very careful in all your cauteries not to let the cautery burn the nerves and large arteries, and do not cause the patient more great nuisance and contraction.
And I myself have seen others who had fire applied to the ankle on the foot, and they let it burn so that the leg was entirely bare, and also the foot, and it became perceived and corrupted all the toes. After a treatment of the abdomen that led to death.
If the pains are in both upper and lower parts together, do fire cauterization in one and the other.
And the wise ones said in the cautery of hawthorn, thus is the manner, make a tool like that one and put it at the head as big as a nail of thumb, or just a little less, and place it between cuts, alternating from one cut to another, with space equal to the size of a single thread.
and let them intertwine in two parts, and let them also be like our own, and have one iron band made well.
and this is the form:
And let it be heated until it is completely red and filled with splinters, and then put it on the side of the sick man's joint, and turn towards his healthy side.
and let him wait three days after the cautery is done. and then apply plaster of butter, and let the wound open for a long time. after the treatment with ointment until he is cured.
Al-Bucayr ibn Fayrum says that we should use this cautery sparingly because of the danger of its effects, and few people dare to do so.
And all these are good cauterizations, which he can endure, and at that moment when he is most affected.
The cautery of medicine burns so that you make an instrument between crossways, in which the blade descends along the edge of the wound, and is either iron or flint with a long appearance, and has two on each side, and has the quantity equal to the thickness of two bucks. and be over twice as long and twice as wide, and they join together in the same form:
After placing the hedge of hawthorn on the patient lying on his chest side, and pressing your hand much above the hedge of thorns; After placing between the two circles of hot water which is heated over one pot, and letting him suffer for an hour or thereabouts, and endure the heat and the fever.
For the fire cautery, he finds a morsuration just like from the fire;
and when the morsurations have not healed, lift your hand with the instrument and raise the heel on a gentle poultice, and let it remain for three days, and apply butter until the black scab is shed; and let him remain for three days to be purified by the strait.
and that would be the rear support after the treatment of ointments until he is cured.
And if the pain has extended up to the thigh or up to the knee, he will do the same instrument which you used more frequently;
And this is the method of the cauterizing fire, and I have written it in order to treat on the correction of medicine. Take calomel and quicksilver, equal amounts of both, and grind them together, and put them in a new pot. where if there is a small opening that does not prevent the point of an arrow from entering.
where if there is a small opening that does not prevent the point of an arrow from entering. and put the two pots in another pot that is very heavy, and put on calicum and chalk and hot water above, until it has two above the powders, then you will have well pierced with your hand;
and leave it thus until the hot water and ashes come down from above the heavy pot, then take all that hot water, and pour it onto chalk and calicum as before.
And when it is very hot and has been made with the work of medicine and cauterization on other members.
For all operations with fire, and if they also use other medicines such as the fiery substance, if it is applied to the root of the hair like cauterization, and honey, acacia tree juice, and alum with soap, all these things combined together.
And Galiens tells us of a cure from which one man was cured of the pain in his groin and sciatic nerve, and great praise, and says that no other cure is needed, and he became well only once when this cure was performed, and he would bathe as he instructs here afterwards.
And thus in some manner you press with the lardigre a green and fresh vert, and pound it out with a little of fat, and put on the root and on the thigh or where the pain lies, and bind.
and let him stay for three hours and by the quantity that the patient feels no burning sensation.
And then put it in a bath so that the body becomes a little red, and put him in the litter, and the pain will depart all and he will be well.
And instructs that no one should use cauterization of such medicine after evacuation.
And Dyascorides says that when the sciatic vein is cauterized with sheep's intestines, if it helps.
and must be done the cautery in this way. Take a linen cloth and anoint it with old oil, and place it on the fossa between the big toe and the little toe called the scrotum.
After taking dried mutton fat, and applying it to the wound with fire until it becomes charcoal, put linen over it and leave it there until it is stained.
and repeat this in the same way, and do not cease to do so until you think that it has come close enough to the heel, and the pain is gone.
and this method of cauterization is called "cautery with mutton fat".
of the painful back
When pain comes to the back, either by falling or by percussion or by too great evacuation, or by the appearance of something spread out cold matter, none of these similarities is worth cautery, except for that which comes from an infusion of cold matter.
It is therefore after this that the patient must void foul matter or other similar things, and upon his back, if the pain lies, three lines marked of encaustic, and in each line a cautery or more according to the virtue and quantity that the patient can bear;
and let it be made the cautery according to the cautery which is called "poins
and if you see, make three cauteries or four at the cauterium with a straight-clawed knife according to this form:
This sickness often comes in young children, and the signs of its beginning are when they have a narrow shoulder when they move, and fear. and you find in the lower spine at the back of the neck, and on it, the appearance that appears on other spines.
When you see this and want to treat it, if you cauterize with the cautery of the cell according to this form. If the cautery is purple on each part of the spine, increasing.
And if you see, if you cauterize inside the spine at the puncture point one or two lines deep and so that the points are close to each other.
After the treatment, keep the patient so that they are healthy as we have said, and guard so that you do not introduce cautery into a swollen gland which is in the grip of a nerve.
From the pain of joints
When pain from joints occurs due to moist spots that are expanded in each limb of the body, and when pain comes to the foot, they call it "podagre" properly, and when it is caused by cold and medicines cannot cure it, then it is cured by cautery in this manner:
Make the patient cut off all hair around the joint of the foot, and let it be olive oil according to this shape:
And if there is a spot that you prick on the face of the foot, make a cautery all around the point. And if the pains come to each knee and other joints, and this happens often, let him cut cauterization on each knee 3 cauterizations or 4 from each part, with all olive oil:
And if you have a need for more, then do more, but not hold your hand over the fire longer than until the thick part of the cure is burned.
And if the pains descend just to the genitals and the back, administer the fire cautery that we have said in this chapter.
And if pains are in the hands, then cut points into the wrist 2 lines;
and if there remains no pain in the fingers, then cut points on each joint and on the hair of the hand;
and if the pains come to these spots or joints so that they will heal, cauterize each part, and do good governance for the patient and give them medicines.
For if you give good governance and purge the phlegm, he will be made healthy by God's aid.
When a rupture occurs in the groin and the bowels descend into the grooves it is new, so it's fitting that when treating wounded eyes, you should not apply ointment the same day. and if they use things that make the belly empty, so that the fetuses descend from the womb;
after that seat the patient on his back between your hands, and he commands that you tie off his leg so that the bleeding stops, and bring it to your hands, and sew over the rupture on the bone of the finger, and do a sign such as a half circle above the bone.
The fire cautery comes from this form:
Until it is white and has stopped bleeding. Then remove the bowels at their place; and keep the ministrants from holding back when they return.
and operate well on the patient, and put on him a garter and a servant over the knees, and another over the leg that holds back his hands;
then apply the cautery to the marked place on all hands, and hold right and left until you strike bone, and if you do not hit it the first time, then it will recur again another time until you reach the bone. and beware subtly that the boiling blood does not escape while you are doing the cautery; you must not burn it; and so that the patient may not die from this illness or another.
And know that when you do not reach the bone with the cautery, your work is worthless.
and it is fitting that the cautery for children should be subtle according to their measure, and for big people also big according to their measure;
after three days of treatment, remove the burned part with lard until it falls off;
after the treatment of other ointments until they are healed, and rest the sick on their back for 40 days so that the wound is well closed;
and it is fitting that his necessities be provided for a long time, so that the boils do not burst when he goes out to chambers.
And after forty days, when he wishes to rise, he must be presented with a well-made bandage, and then for another forty days;
and good rest, that he may work little and be warned of too much drinking and eating, and of eating too high;
and if he follows this teaching, then he becomes entirely healthy.
And I will say this after your cutting treatment of the cautery.
When swellings come in other places and are recognized, and you see that they do not grow anymore, then apply the fire cautery according to its quantity, and burn off one-third of the wound. after the treatment as we have said;
and none of the ancients ever said that one must apply the fire cautery to three angles according to this form:
but first mark the level of the incision and make a line for the width above the cut, and another below it; and with your finger press around the entire edge of the cautery.
But the first cauterizations are lighter and less severe.
of ancient pain in any member When pain comes to any member, or from a fall or from injuring it, and the pain lasts for a long time, and medicine cures are useless, then it is necessary to cauterize with the cautery that is called "poins," and do the cauterizations according to the length of the limb, its thickness, and its weakness, and its virtue, and its location of twists and its pain.
If he is whole after the first cautery, this is well;
So that the name of this procedure is repeated because it is necessary to do another cautery on that same part, since it must be done on the member that is nearest to it, for that reason you should perform the cauteries until the patient is whole.
The problem is treated with no success by cautery for great help, and the same malady that comes from the putrefaction of pus and melancholy.
Can you see the cautery applied, take care if the patient is at the beginning of a disease, and apply it according to what we have said in division, and do not remove or stay in place, for that reason be cautious that the corruption does not spread throughout the whole patient, then perform cauteries on the head: Apply a new cautery to the head and the other side near the forehead. and 2 above the 2 horns, and 1 behind on the heel.
and hold your hand so that the cautery comes alive just to the bone, and so that the scabs come out in great numbers, so that the vapors of the large humors can issue forth.
and cauterize on the mouse according to what is in front.
And if there are many swellings everywhere; and they are manifestly inflamed, so it is fitting that you use the cauterizing cauteries we have discussed, and 5 cauterize in the nose, and 2 on the spine of the neck, and 6 on the spine of the back, and 1 on the cramp and 1 other part, and 2 on each shoulder; and there is swelling on the thighs, and swelling on the tendons of the foot, and on each joint of the hands and feet, and on the cavities of the hands;
and beware of nails that are under the groin bone, lest they be burned.
and never do cautery on the bone of the thumb, and also on the bone of the stomach, and also on the liver.
And know that when you do more cautery, you also give more relief and profit.
And know that the sick do not feel any pain from cautery as much as they would if they were healthy, because the body is already completely corrupted.
It is fitting that cauterization should be large and small according to the members and joints, as you will find in various ways with the iron tools.
After treatment let him be left of flour powder mixed with honey and other remedies until he is made whole.
When swelling comes to any member and is treated with medicines and oils and plasters, and it's not healed, then you should do fire cautery on the member according to its size and thinness.
and if the fire cautery is only slightly entering into the swollen flesh. then treat with ointments until it is healed.
And sometimes it is done by hand and with the foot and on the back, at the end of the nerve that muffles the member, and so if the swelling remains.
and beware that no one interferes in this if he is not acquainted with the limbs and the nerves moving the body.
When the illness called "albaras" is old and weak, and the doctors' medicines are of no use, then apply cautery with a cautery one point at a time, according to the quantity of the wound's depth, until the bleeding stops and changes its color.
Then feed the patient with flour and dates and lentils mixed with olive oil and leaves of plantain, and blood from the gallbladder and blood from the gizzard, each one a portion. And let all this be mixed together, and tie it up in a cloth, and pour it into the patient as long as he is well.
The doctor who pricks with fire
When the chancre comes at the beginning and you stop looking, prick it with fire that seems like a circle all around the turn of the chancre.
And all learned men agree that one should also apply cautery to the middle of a sore.
And so I do not think this is good, because I fear it will be ulcerous and corrupted, and I have wanted to avoid such things from the start;
And another thing is that the wounds should be cauterized internally, with a cautery called "circule", as we have mentioned in many other cauterizations.
When some have a disease called "adubelati", and it delays death or because of the swelling that it makes, or because the old man is thin when he is decrepit (that means he is very old), and has little blood, or because of age. and you should consider hastening his death; so then cauterize him internally with many small cauterizations and pricking. afterwards let him. She will soon die.
And if you view her pierce with the fire cauterization, so that the cauterized form is like this:
And put your hand in the midst of this disease which is called "adubelati" so that the cauterization has pierced the liver, and it should be such that the patient feels pain on both sides in this manner so that the course of the putrefaction is alleviated.
After the cure, so that he may be completely healed.
Another kind of disease that is called "corrodens", and it is no other than an injury to a limb, because it causes the limbs to rot as well as dry bones.
If you see this illness in one who can suffer fire cautery, then take the cauterization needles very small and large, according to what is needed for the patient or the illness.
after cauterizing from all parts until you have reached the entire corruption, and nothing remains, then everything that is corrupted must be cut out.
And then let him lie for three days, and put on his cauterized wounds to suffer from a firebreak with oil until the escharatures of the fire are cut out, and all the corruption.
After the cure of bone-grown ulcers.
And if you see after three days that no sick chariot is born, it is good.
and if this does not happen, then resume the cauterization on that which has remained corrupted since.
And this method of treatment is never cured by medicine applied to the patient, through fire cauterization.
But all the fire cautery is of greater help, and I have already said the cure for the ailing one in the division: Take the amount you need.
of worms that come to the bone Often it happens that on the bone by chance there is born a disease which we call "clos" according to our intention, and it is a great thing to blame that causes the pain.
And there are two kinds of fire cauteries for this disease. That is to say, fire cautery and hot water cautery.
Fire cautery if you are going to cut the hair, just as one cuts the nail, and make it of good iron, to the measure that can pierce the thorn through all parts, and have subtle margins;
After put it on the head like a thorn, and turn your hand all around the thorn until it comes out from the head of the thorn; and let it remain so for three days, till it starts to rot with pus; Then make a poultice of fresh mallows crushed with thread, and put the poultice on the entire area overnight, and the thorn will come out and be dislodged from its roots.
After the fire cautery, instruct the patient to let his hair grow long and even.
And if they are converted by force of the body, and it happens many times in hands and feet, then you must apply fire cautery to hot water. and is done in this manner: take a thorn from a rose or iron, or a quill of vinegar, and set it on the warts. and set the thorn so that it bleeds all over, then put a little hot water in, and hold your hand tight, and press your hand turning so that the margin of the thorn comes to the root of the nail, so that the hot water can go deep down to the root.
and let the patient suffer for a little while under the heat of the water for an hour. Then let him go as is, and he will rot to death all at his roots.
In this manner do it after another, until you have searched through all those which are in the body, then treat the limbs that bind with strong bands.
When some shiver with cold or fever of a quarter or any other, it is fitting that you make four cauteries on the spine at the back, one cautery between each spine; and one cautery near it and one above the stomach at the olive cautery;
so that he will stop shivering and hasten his recovery from the cold disease.
No time do they appear without the body's internal baths, or dry sores/ulcers, that come from great corrupted matter.
if it is fitting that when they appear, you make a cautery over each head of the pustule; a subtle cautery of fusel wood of myrtle, so that the point may be gripped by fire, or with a root of artemisia, long, or at the lenticular cautery;
And at some point the cauterized ones are found to be broken when they first appear, following this manner; and they cannot grow again forward but are destroyed by the excess that comes from them, and heal.
but it is necessary to do this after the evacuation of blood.
Often it happens that great bleeding of the artery occurs when the vein is cut at the wound, or at the incision of the abscess, or after cauterizing a member, and similar things. and it is very grievous to stink.
And for those who have it, when they come to know, if you hasten to put your two fingers on the wound of the vein, and pull it very tightly so that the swelling is not calmed down below your fingers, and no more pain comes from it;
Then put in the fire the olive oil cauteries of various sizes until they are all red.
Then apply, be it a large or small one, according to the wound and where the artery is cut, and place the cautery on that vein where you hold your thumb, and keep it there until the vein does not remain open.
And if the fire has disappeared when you lift your thumb off the vein, and the cautery has cooled down, then take it hastily another cautery which is on fire.
And do not cease doing this one after another until the vein is constricted.
and beware that you do not burn the nerve which is near, and that no other evil comes upon the patient.
and know that when the vein does not burst from the artery, it cannot be well constricted itself when the artery is large; unless this happens by one of the four ways we have previously mentioned: When or by cautery, when it is not treated, or by strong binding with thread, or by medicines applied which have power to constrict blood; and bound and strained as a result.
Who will put a stop to the swelling of the tightly bound limb or putting things on it, or other similar things, if they do not profit from this.
And if this happens to no one and he has not been treated with any medicine beforehand, then it must be put on a needle over the wound of the vein as we have said, and constricting so that blood is stopped from above the wound and above the vein. and he must not move, but his blood should be let off frequently, so that it becomes very cold, until the flesh is frozen and swollen and constricted.
and do this in front of those who have need of cautery and medicine.
We have told you in the first chapter of all diseases for which it is necessary to cauterize with fire or with hot medicine, the omissions and the causes and the strata and the forms of the cauterizations;
and I have placed the second chapter on the nose with just one piece, and I will go to this same place in order to treat it more easily because we find it more conveniently.
And so that I begin this, it is necessary, dear boy, that you learn that in this chapter there is more danger and fear than with the first cautery, and therefore it must be done with greater caution.
For in the work of this chapter there are many times evacuation of blood when opening a vein, and incising an abscess, and in treating wounds, and extracting arrows, and cutting into stones, and similar things; where there is doubt and fear, and many die. where there is doubt and fear, and because of this many fall into death.
And I warn you not to enter into folly. Because many ways of men come for treatment. If they come from such a place where they have been afflicted with their disease so that they quickly die from the force of what they find in themselves, and from the great size of their sickness; and from this must come fear.
And of those who bring you the truth, and say: Wait, I am cured. and the sick person is deceitful.
It is not fitting to trust only in those who come to you and have this manner, but put more consideration into your honor than your profit, and be neither too weak nor too foolish about what you are sure of and what you can obtain.
and use divine prediction and signs in your treatments to see if the health is converted.
and this will help you achieve a good reputation, fame, and memory of praise.
Three dear sons, Our Lord gives you good understanding and truth, and if you wish to aspire from the holy inspiration of His hand, Amen.
I instruct you on this chapter in devising by chapters, according to what is before or in front of the cautery chapter, which I have devised for you from the head joint to the joints, because you will find it easier to deal with that which you need.
It is known that this illness often comes from children at birth, and when the child holds their head too tightly.
and sometimes it is caused by a return that we do not know.
And I have never seen this illness in fire except in children, and in all those that I have seen it has led to death. and for this reason, I think that it is worth wasting the work in some treatments.
And I saw a child because the joint was swollen with water, and the head became heavy each day until it could no longer bear.
and he believed so strongly that he was dead, and this moisture had assembled beneath the bone on top of his spleen, between the liver and the bone;
and the wounds are so severe if the moisture is between the liver and the bone, and the abscesses are small, that you must cut a large incision in his head.
and so long as it is two times as deep as us, until the moisture runs out;
and you will see the form of a splinter:
If the swelling is deeper, and the abscesses are larger, cut two incisions in the shape of a cross, according to this form:
And if the moisture is below the bone, and you see the signs that occur in each part of the head, such as swelling of the commissures (the corners) of the mouth on both sides, and the pain increases when you press with your hand inside it, and this does not return: If you must break open his skull with three incisions according to this manner:
And after the incision, extract all the moisture completely. After binding the incisions with cloth and powder, and then applying vinegar and oil, and leaving so for five days;
then remove the dressing, and treat the wound with poultices and ointments, and let the head swell apart, then give the patient dry meat mixed with a little moisture until the limb is comforted and healed.
And another way of incision is that you look at or open the swelling of the abscess and the assembly of the fluid;
because it does not happen often. never again. Sometimes in distress; and sometimes on the left.
The wound should be cut near or at the abscess opening, and the filling of the liquid, and the part according to what you have the power.
and beware that you do not cover the artery; and take away some blood, if so that the patient dies from the deterioration of the blood and moisture evacuation.
When it happens that there is no disease which is called 'catarrh' in the eyes or on the skin, and the disease is old and medicine does not help, then the following remedy should be used: cut with cauterization as when you cover the two arteries.
It is therefore necessary, when you cover your eyes, that the patient turns his head; after rubbing the head with a rough cloth until the arteries appear, then pull out the patient's neck from all of that cloth; The patient will examine which vein is broken, and the veins of one and both are drawn behind the ears, and it does not heal soon.
Then he will mark the veins of the elbow, and then cut one and both with a good spatula of two parts, until the vein reaches the bone, and that be in proportion to the size of the head.
If you see this, pour out the spatula under the artery and strike on top, in cutting as is necessary to traverse.
And when the vein is cut, it should be closed with a continuous downward flow of fire.
And if the arteries do not open to feel, so it is fitting that you measure the quantity of the space three doubs, then mark and cut until the bone.
and that which is fitting to put fire in the wound if it is six cubits, and by chance a little more or less, according to what the patient can suffer, and the replenishment of the artery.
Then look at the wound: If it remains on the bone at that spot, if it doesn't give pain to the surrounding flesh, then pull out what's causing the swelling and tie the wound shut, and treat with ointment until it is healed.
The body leaves When the ancient body comes in and catarrh is present, due to moisture of tears and colds in the temples and old sores that resemble similar things, and he is treated with various medicines and remedies and none of these help him, we must extract the arteries from the temples and cauterize the ulcers, as we have told.
And the manner of extracting them is that the patient makes his hair stand up behind their temples, and listens to the artery that opens in the temple, because it opens well by its pulsing, and is not fully returned until many people who are too cold.
and if it is returned, then the patient tightens their neck with some strips, then rubs them with any harsh cloth, and raises the limb in warm water until the artery appears distinctly. Take the spatula of which this is the form: Then scorch the leather lightly until you reach the artery, then tear it upwards by pinches, and pull well away from each part.
And if the artery is subtle, then turn at the tip of the needle, then cut from that part according to the quantity of the two fingers. But if it is not cut, do not separate it without pain throughout everything.
And pull out six cubits of flesh, just up to three.
And if the artery is large, it is advisable to tie in two fingers of a strong doubled thread of silk, lest purulence appears before the wound is sounded, and pus commences.
Then cut the superfluity that is between the two joints in this hour itself, and then, if you see, if he cuts with the fire cautery of the sword just to the bone until the joint is cut.
and this is the mother work, if the patient does not have fever and he has a hot complexion. For the fire cautery is aid to finish off the moisture: because it is of greater aid against moisture.
Where it is necessary for the extraction of arteries, that one fills him with new cotton and puts a well-made tunic.
and when they are cut open, you must cure him with dry medicines that make charcoal, and with tourniquets, until he is healed.
If without cut of the artery so that it does not bleed like you do when you work, then hurry to cover with cautery, or apply quick lead and strain it on your hand until it is not stained. and if you do not have that at hand, put it on the lead until it freezes, and bring the lead to cold water repeatedly, so strain it as needed.
and it should have between the two cuts one inch of large needle, and then when you insert both needles, and warm iron on top so that it comes in just to the bone, cut the vein in two. And let them separate between the two shoulder bones because there is no soldering of this cautery with all.
and it is the form of the cautery:
and what is more thin and lighter in the extraction of an artery, then you should cauterize a vein with this cautery piercing to two parts, but pierce them well thick to hold its heat longer. When the instruments are too dark, he holds less heat.
of tears. When the eyelids shed tears from the veins that are on top of the forehead of the face, and he does not benefit from a cure with medicine that one makes, and you see the face of the patient turn red, and feel his forehead for walking as if in pain. and so that the oil is kept and moist, if the hair of the scalpel falls out, and the scabbing of the papers, and burns from the heat of the tears, if it is necessary for this cure. And they called it the ancient "cure contused", and you must make on the patient who has this disease the hairs of his forehead, then make three incisions or evenly according to the length of the forehead;
And they called it the ancient "cure contused", and you must make on the patient who has this disease the hairs of his forehead, then make three incisions or evenly according to the length of the forehead; And so one of the cuts is like two, dividing both front and back in half, where it comes to the neck at the same time, and the other has two at the breast above the papers, and you must keep away from the incision of the arteries that are located above the papers;
And keep your hand away from continuing the two mandibles, and let each cut be three times across both sides;
And have prepared a sponge and some rags to absorb the blood, then pour out the styptic mixture, which is two parts of this form:
of the incision that is left above the temple, just before the second incision; And scorch all the wound that is between the two cuts to the surface of the bone, then make another cut from the first incision up to the second one, and then pull out this styptic mixture. If it is cut in the first wound with the instrument called "cultellary", and is very sharp from one side and the other, soft not cutting, and this is its form:
And cuts the costal bone towards the raw flesh at the wound, and the costal bone is soft towards the bone, and it presses hard until it comes to the middle wound.
And bind tightly the vessels that descend from the forehead to the eyes until the incision is complete just as soon as the bleeding stops, and then again make an incision in the middle cut just before the other separation.
and then pull out the vein equally, and press the vein so that it does not leak.
Then put a piece of cotton wool in each incision, and cover it with moist cloths soaked in wine and oil and salt, so that the pus does not come out.
And on the third day remove the bandage, and administer a great quantity of vinegar water, then apply the treatment with Basilicum oil with rose oil, and other remedies for wounds until he is healed.
When an affliction of the eye comes to be used in a regular manner, and you see the eyelids closed tight and red, and fainting occurs, and papers are burned; and the hairs become thin, and in the center of the forehead there is great pain, and the patient is thrown into convulsions; Therefore, through these accidents you know that those matters and this cough come from many veins, and the male cure is present if it is so.
And instruct the patient to raise his forehead, then make a great cut along the eyebrows. And beginning from the split of the left temple to the right temple, and performing an incision just beyond the bone; and remove your hand from the nerves of the temples which move downward;
and when the bones are exposed, soak all the blood in an sponge, and then squeeze between the two lips of the cut and put cotton wool there, and try with linen. then cover the above wrapped cloth with moist linen and oil, and keep away from the hot place.
when it is raw, if it is fitting that you rub the bone until the blood starts to come out, then treat with an antiseptic medicine that brings on charring.
In this manner: take two parts of wheat flower and four parts of powdered coal, and mix them. and apply this to the wounds for charring all over.
Of the bursting of the ears
Everything that falls into the ear is one of four things: or grain, or flesh, or a piece of metal from a mine, or something similar like iron. or seed, like fireflies, bees, and grasshoppers. or thing that flows, like water and ice, and similar things.
When it comes out of the ear stone or in some other manner of thing that does not adhere to the ear, nor grows in the ear, if you put the ear in the sun.
If you see the stone, then if it distills any small amount of violet oil or oil of sages, then extract it. and the treatment is to make it vomit by condensing, and put a cloth or wool over the nose when vomiting comes, and put a piece of fabric into the ear. And let them put the ear upwards.
Many times it comes by this cure;
And if she does not come, they must extract with subtle pinches, because thus there is the form:
If it happens by those pinches, it's good;
else if they must extract with subtle stitching at the warts.
and if it does not happen by that, make a cauldron of resin and pour the chief down the cauldron or ear canal very deeply, and warm up the thing that is around the cauldron with wax so that the venoms cannot enter with the cauldron; Then the joint will form, because many a time it occurs when we have said so.
And if it does not come by this manner, when it pricks the glue of which it pricked the hairs, and puts in some instrument with a point to do that, and puts a little cotton around; Then press the glue on the stone or whatever it may be, and make a joint.
And if it does not happen as all that we have said, then hasten to split the ear so that you pierce an abscess and a vein;
And the way of the cut is such that you first make the patient healthy of the cephalic part, and extract the blood according to its virtue, then place the patient between your hands and turn the ear upwards, and make a small cut in the root of the ear at the fat or where it depends. And instruct the wound to heal like a moon, until you reach the bone; then set the bone according to your power, and suck it hastily into your mouth.
And the treatment until it is sound.
And if it's an abscess that has formed and inflamed, administer extraction.
and if it cannot come out, so administer a thin poultice in the same form. And instruct the patient to make a cut at that point.
But do not do this when you think the grain is moist due to the moisture of the ear, until you have made many cuts.
then extract with fine needles and suck it out, as we have said, so that the extraction may be easy.
In the water then it is best to vomit into the ear; and that the patient may use early condiments, and fill the ear with old cotton. And also if it is swollen on the same ear or in the water. If it falls through for that reason, it's good.
If this is not so, then instruct the patient to prick many pains according to the length of his body must be kept and light, and cover one part with fire; and put the sick in ear pain or piercing from his ear and runs up to it from his other foot and fear of one more pierce on the pierce that is in the ear; and does not cease to pierce stone into stone until the wound is healed completely and again it heals completely;
and if you see, prick a joint and pour one of the poultices into the ear, and the other pierce with fire until the smallest bone is burned;
then make another of those joints until the wound is healed, as we have said in the stone.
When extracting a bone, if it is of small size, like a thorn and similar things, treat it as we have said in the division.
But if it is of large size, and it can be felt, then extract by pinches. And this is the lighter thing to remove that is in the ear.
When extracting worms in the ears, add ear drops to it as we have said in the division and when treating infections, if the treatment does not help, then you should look at the ear by sunlight: If there are no worms seen, then take the ear under fine pinches, and if they do not appear, seize the canna (ear canal) so that this is its form:
And it may be narrow below and wide above. And pour out the most subtle part of the head into the ear according to the quantity of the patient's suffering, then success forms at all the joints. Do this often until all the veins appear.
And if they do not come out, when it is stuck between the chain of cotton as I said in the stone.
and if they do not come out as we have said, administer infusions that the ancient ones have used in the treatment of worms, and you will find or use them for infusions.
and if you distill your oils and medicines into the ear with all this instrument, because there is the form as you see: And let it be of silver or gold; for so is made the mouth of the pertain tubes, and above it to distill.
and to press inside the distillation of the well-made instrument of gold, and if you see the rasp and rub it through until the point is covered with cotton. then I pour your oil or juice, and what you see of your medicine in the cane, and let it be in the ear.
then pour into the rasp all the cotton, and press your hand in time until the oil is distilled or has almost reached the ear. and the patient feels it inside, and let the distilled poison be thrown into his mouth also as one is distilling in the ear. And keep them from being too cold, for the medicines are not very good.
Of the bursting of the ears
No child is born who does not have some defect in their ears.
And the same thing happens to adults because of an outlet or wound inside the ear, and these wounds often do not heal in the ear if you can't see them.
And sometimes it happens that there is a small defect and the person sees well.
So when it comes to a wound that is closed and cannot be seen, if you are in a state of weakness or illness, then you must put the patient's ear to the sun. and look within: If you see the inflammation appearing, if the work has all this splinter of blood, then it is the shape:
And if they are swollen and punctures in front and behind all flat, if it does not affect the ear;
if the inflammation is in the skull or ear bone, if you have fine punctures and strike lightly enough, so that the charred bone is entirely removed.
If the swelling is in the ear, then take a fine needle lighter and place it on the flesh of the ear.
If you feel the inflammation where the patients feel great pain in the ear, puncture lightly, and guard so that you do not weigh down the nerves of the ear;
then put a tent in the ear according to its width and the moisture in Egyptian ointment. Instruct to do this every day until the wound is healed, or you take an poultice and the poultice is made from mold in vinegar and red wine, and powder on top of vitriol.
and if you see the ear swollen, then apply the poultice and move another poultice moistened in cherry oil and beeswax until the swelling is removed. then treat so that the patient becomes healthy.
And if the blood comes to flow again, then plunge an sponge and wring it in cold water, and place it on the ear, and use other treatments that can relieve bleeding from the flow which are for treating oozings.
This that come out on paper of the eyes when they are moist and dry, if it is needed to be stretched with tongs and tweezers, and cut off by a spatula from its roots; then put on the eye vitriol powder.
And if without removal, so the cauterizes with fire cautery, the delicate lensular subtil, and the cauterizer after the incision is moved;
and often repair, for no part remains of their roots; and when they are cauterized by fire, the roots are burned and do not return again.
From the shoe. Often bring forth from the eyes some things that appear to be gristle in form and hardness, and because of this it is called "grain" disease, and is an assembly of great moisture on top and below. the wounds are such:
the wounds are such: to beware if the grain dies from one side and the other, and this is a light thing to know;
The wound is then dressed with powder, then the scab is scraped from each part lightly, then it is taken off by pinches, and then it is chopped.
If you cannot cover it with a dressing after piercing the skin, so as not to give the patient pain.
and if the wound is large, you should put together with stitches and treat it until it heals.
and if it is small, you shouldn't make any forced treatment, because the stitches will restore it at once and cause more harm.
and if the granulation is falling from inside of the ear towards the upper part, you will turn down the dressing and pinch with tweezers, and cut and press on both sides.
And if the paper is separated by the incision, it brings no harm.
And when the gravel is struck, clean the oil of salted water, and treat the patient so that they are cured by burning charcoal until they are healed.
From the grease of the eyes This is a fat that burns in woven nets of paper above, and it often kills infants who have no one to care for them, and causes great pain to their eyes, and they come to catarrh in the mornings, and cannot see into the light of the sun because their tears stop flowing to their eyes.
And for this they lie on their faces because of the fire, and sleep above it, and their moist papers under their eyebrows are inflamed with the fat that burns in the oil. And when you press the joint with your hands and feel the swelling inside.
And so are the ways of this work, for the patient must put his head into your hands;
And then take a linen drapery, and set up a tent in the shape of a circle according to the quantity contained within each part, and then place it above the patient; And press with both hands from one side and the other, so that the parts are gathered into the circle;
then make at the midpoint of the moisture on the scaphoid bone cutting a slit to a width no greater than the wound that was made on the vein.
and let the skin be drawn over the part until you see the parts come together; and from this multitude of positions comes expiration from the wound, according to the form of a white piece of fat.
Then take a piece of cloth gauze and bind it around both your arms in front, and turn your hand to right and left so that it is spread.
and that you do not add anything to the wound, lest you come to all the spectacle of the blood just at the oil, and that you do not burn it.
And if the blood does not flow at first in the beginning of the wound, then apply a little to the wound lightly so that it appears.
Then take it as we have said, then wrap it in cloth gently and with water, and put on the linen, and tie with bandages.
And if such men who break the silken thread and place it in order to corrupt that moisture which has remained.
Then the healer as long as he is healthy.
And if it comes to a swollen joint, so that the patient is being treated with emplaster until he is well.
of hairs of paper. When the hairs are growing on the nose that are not in their natural place, and have become inflamed, if they prick at the eyes, and do come up with kinds of illnesses such as sneezing and softening of the hairs and albugine, until it is the cause of destruction of the eyes;
and there are four ways to treat this. or by fire cautery assembled with heat, or by water according to what is in front of the chapter of fire cautery, and either done by incision and stitching or by cauterizing, according to what I will say.
It is necessary that you put the patient's head in your own hand, then turn the hair of the nose from the oil to your left hand;
She has been converted; it is good. If they do not comply, put an arrow into all of the above (i.e. the above mentioned wounds). and even if it is on the edge of the paper or where the hair grows from those hairs, and pull the thread above all over the paper, and turn to the shaver;
then make in the lower part of the paper, below the hairs joined, all over the scalp cutting, from the great braid to the little.
then pull out the thread, and put under the paper a small tent made of cotton and fabric, then cut above the paper an eyebrow shape, as in the image of mirte, so that it suits the amount of hair you lifted from the paper which is divided into all.
And if to someone who has need, one cuts off a great quantity of paper according to what the paper is softened.
then makes all the surrounding area around the two lines you signed, and begins to sew loose linen just above small. and if one of the cuts is near the natural hairs in the size of a root, then pour on the onion into one of the two corners cut, and scorch all.
then brings the two lips together to sew with an aglet of a needle to all the fine threads of wool, and sucks out the blood, and makes the swelling dry on the surface of the filth above both wounds and sticky things, if you see such.
If this is not so, then do not treat it. Then leave the wound and hair for three days or four.
Then cure the wound with a dressing of dry things and binding, because the paper will revive at the moment of the wound's opening and reassembly, but the binding is weak (as they said the old ones), and it's a work with fear. And if there is another way:
And if there is another way: And it is that you know the paper of a figure which is as the miter's wool, just like we have told, three inches apart according to the form that is here:
Then cut off that which overhangs because of small, even, equal parts according to its shape.
And if you do not have the power to hold the tongs, and the thing is not even, take a needle or it has one thread, and bind around the figure; And put one finger of your left hand on a strong nail, and your second finger on a small nail, and equally join between your two fingers.
Then lift your hand equally, and lift all the skin where you have marked it, as we have counted; then bring together the two lips of the wound by stitching, and the cure until he is healed.
and if an abscess comes to your incision, dress it with crotone and similar ointment soothing.
and sometimes happens that the hair of a paper is converted.
so you must use what we have said about the incision.
but the stitching in both is more artificial.
The cure for the joints is according to this form: and that you convert the paper and the felt into it according to what I have said, and then make two joints by art, and two subtle ligatures as long as the paper and the width of the spindle is; and cut to two parts, where you hold the strings;
then assemble one and the other subtly above what protrudes from the oil paper, and strain the two joints of the two parts together; and let it be thus for some days, and the skin that was strained will wither and contract and harden, as if it had come to itself.
If it lingers, if he has some strength, then let him stay until he is healed.
And when the wound is stitched with silver, and it is lifted and the paper is taken out, and there will be no more pain in the hair.
And this is the form of the two canals that you will make according to this figure and according to this quantity of length and width:
the wounds are such that you will pierce with a fine needle, and you pour in soft and fine thread; then tie the stitches and do not hold one and the other too tightly, so that the length of the thread is equal to a palm.
then place another fine thread of silk in the chase tightly, and no loose ends.
Now put the patient's head on your own healthy one;
and let the sun shine so that the wound is clearly visible, for it is a subtle and small one; then poke the needle into the root of the attached hair, and pierce through the paper hastily until you bring it out above the natural hair.
then pull the hair all the way out to where the needle was inserted, and fill in with the needle that was pulled out, if there are one, two, three, or more.
then pull your hand back so that the hairs come forward all the way to the end of the needle with the natural hair.
and if the needle is applied and the hairs do not come out with it, then pull the needle downwards to the end of the thread that you ordered, until the needle comes out through the pores above and you see it by the sight of oil.
And then you should pull out the thread and the needle, and clothe the wound with oil, and let it rest for two or three days, until the hair grows in its place and the scar subsides;
and if the hairs are small, then accompany the short hair with the long hair from the chest area, and raise it with that which you leave, until it is lengthened and then set.
of the oil's spoilage When this sickness is called "aleacrati" or when the putrefaction comes into the oil, it happens in two ways:
one is natural and the other unnatural.
And it happens by sudden injury or cutting or cautery, and by similar things.
And in the treatment of the pus, it is that you cut open the scab, and dress the lips with it, and put linen bags inside, and tie them up until they are healed;
and must not be used only in the treatment of dry things that constrict. But if you do this, it will come back worse than the first time;
but working on softening things, as fenugreek. and the root of mullein or rose-water and seeds of flax are cooked, and ointments made from melted diaquilone in any of the oils, and cover it with a cloth, and treat thus.
And the treasures of your treatment are that you keep them safe so they do not become corrupted as before their form.
and what we have said is not fire but only an expression of this disease, which it does not return to its previous form.
This disease which is outside, and truly is called "axacrati", and is natural and accidental.
The accident happens from a wound and tearing, and cautery, and similar things.
and the vein of the work is like this: you prick with an awl, in which it has a double thread, and the needle in the flesh, and make it pierce from the left shoulder to the right, so that the thread comes out through two joints of the arm;
then the flesh is stretched over all the awl, and a wide stiletto. and if the mark on the paper returns according to what is wanted, that's good;
if it does not come, then take the razor and put it in the wound, and turn the paper, and make two cuts on either side of the paper inside.
And let the heads of the two cuts at the two corners of the incision be made so that when they are assembled, the figure is as it were of a letter with no Â«I griescheÂ».
Then take the bone, according to how much its edge is attached below, from that which is indicated by the parchment, then add the two halves of what is cut, and sew with a thread of linen.
Then apply the remedy to what we have said about soft medicines and poultices, until he is healed.
And if the disease comes from a cut or a seam or a cautery, so that you may make a clear cut below the hairs of the papers, and according to what was said before. After the fire cautery, make a deep incision between the second and third fingers of a tent peg, as I have said.
After the fire cautery, make a deep incision between the second and third fingers of a tent peg, as I have said. and one must make the work according to the shape of the illness, because it is very different in form, and the wise masters will use the engine for every type of poor strength so that the figure returns to its natural form.
And the patients themselves, according to those things which they need for work and treatment for more severe conditions.
When this binding has happened in a certain way, that is to say the paper above is stuck with white oil, and it cannot move or do its natural work, so if you need to then apply the point of a rasp over the paper, and lift it up towards the top;
and the length as pinches, until you cut what is sharp at the subtle needle, which should not be too thin nor too thick, so that the patient cannot suffer from the needle being too thin or leaking oil.
and so your incision, if you scorch the assembled flesh lightly, according to its natural form;
and the whole assembled flesh is healthy, and it never happens that there is any pus in the infected oil, and you lift off the foul water with gentle broth.
then put a linen cloth between the paper and the oil, and place the linen-oiled cloth on top of the oil. and after three days, use the broth and other strong things until it is healthy.
The joint has two forms: There are two types of joints: one is hard like bone, and another that does not feel nerve-like but appears frozen with cold moisture; when it is touched with iron and treated with patience, there is a wound.
And both types of joints begin to resemble the great tendons, and they grow little by little until they cover all the vein and all the light, and the movement of the sinew.
And there are two ways of making an incision, so that the patient puts his head on the healthy side, then he opens his eyes; And lifts the paper with his hand, then coils the joint like stitches of small doubling, and extends it upwards; Then take a needle, and put some horse hair, or sheep hair, or cow hair, into it, and make it very long. And double the point of the needle a little and tie it with a string, so that it is fastened to the top, and scrape all along the length of the needle on both sides, leaving just enough hair at the end of the nose, then cut off the remaining part at the root of the eyelash down to the spot where it meets the skin, then pierce the remaining part back up into the lobe of the ear until you reach the small spot where the membrane is thin and make an incision that will allow the blood to flow according to nature.
And sometimes you attach just the needle to the wound and then to the string. Then the scorching is applied to all the soft parts where this is the form:
And make sure that the soft parts do not touch the tough skin and break, and that the pulse is felt;
And after the incision, pour a little oil on the broken part and apply linseed oil to the collar, and leave it until the next day; Then restore what is needed so that he may be healed.
And if the nail is not inflamed, and you cannot push the needle in, and the wound cannot be opened, this similarity of an ingrown nail is often cured with remedies.
and as I have told in the division, and if you see it covered, then apply oil to the patient, and take a soft cautery according to this form; And carefully remove the warts from beneath with subtlety; and if you see that they do not diminish at all, and your reason is impeded by them, then distill from your mouth into a vinegar made of lime, which causes redness of the throat, and break it off, for it numbs.
If nothing is against you in the oil, as with a wound, then take the ointment and first treat the hot abscess until it is healed; then resume the work as before, until it is healed.
then resume the other work according to this same work, until it is all bone.
And if the appearance of the skin is darkened with pus in the oil for great harm, so that the swelling increases, and you cut off a part of it, not too much, lest blood comes from the wound.
then distill in the vinegar made red, which is made of lime.
The eyes of some men never turn red, and cover the pimple and restrain on the papers and thorns to avoid, and it seems like a rose from the bough;
And if the wound is such that the patient puts his head on a healthy one, then he opens the eyes, and coils all that has suitable strings to it, and supports it with strength;
Then he cuts the first string, and goes copating to the rasur until the end, and keeps that you do not cut the oil at the wound;
And if the incision is through the splintile, just as we have said in the incision of the ungue and with small forces because one may break the limb, as the form shows after this chapter.
and when the incision is completed and all the flesh has fallen off, apply oil of silk or distill rose-coloured wine and similar corrosive medicines, and put on the oil with cotton wool wrapped around an onion.
and if it does not heal at all, and the flesh is sore and swollen, then let the oil remain and treat the inflammation with soothing measures.
then return to your work as soon as you are healed, and similarly place the char ( probably referring to the onion) in the oil by this method.
But it is wise to lighten the healing treatment for each person with a weak oil, according to the natural remedy. and from a false vein, for metal.
and do not strike with your hand in any of these works until you see that the limbs are suffering from this injury.
These veins are red and covered on the skin, and they hold back their own work and weaken the eye every day.
The first thing is to look at the wound and see in what way it is, whether it is inflamed, open, or no other fire-like disease except that inflammation. and then apply the binding in this manner:
instruct the patient to put his head on your healthy one, then suspend those veins all over the wound according to his wisdom, and so be those subtle veins doubled in that form:
And let them be two on one side by degree in the four according to this form:
and then bind those veins tightly with forceps, and apply the wound for an hour after another, until you see that the fiery veins are removed from the wound;
and keep in mind that the hairs at the base of the scalp are sensitive, and do not touch with your fingers at those points, and perform this operation at noon, in front of the sun, and be very careful in your work so that you do not cut yourself only when the veins are opened.
and when you have done this, if you want to destroy that which remains in the vein, distill it into oil that is green and red to corrupt what has stayed there since yesterday.
and if you do not have the power to remove all that remains in that hour, then apply oil of soothing things on the pain of the eyes, and leave it for some days until the pains are soothed, and be sure of a pus forming, and then resume according to this manner as long as the patient is healed.
and thus it is the form of the force:
the wound they call "arissati" fistula:
when you cure it by cautery and by medicine with hot water according to what I have said, and it is not healed, then there is an infection in it where you cut open the abscess, lest it kill you, and remove all the moisture that is in it, until the bones are uncovered.
and when the bones are uncovered and you see the corruption and darkness, if the wound has all the instruments by which it is formed;
and is called "aspere chief", and it should be made from the fine iron in this place, and you should pierce it like a nail as sharp as one that is now in its present form:
And place on him the law of the corrupted bone, then turn it between your two hands, and press your hand hard enough so that you know well which is the corruption.
and do this no more than once, then restore the law of the medicine extracts.
if the law is sealed, and it swells, and the bowelâ€™s flesh is swollen, and remains like this for forty days, and does not become inflamed again, and no more accidents come to pass, then you know he is cured.
if this not so, if there is no other remedy but to return the fistula to its original place according to this form: and that you discover the second time by iron, and by sharp medicines, and when it heals, uncover it as per this form, and if the joints of iron are bent to three angles, and the fistula is relaxed up to the head, just like that which you see here:
Then put it on the surface of the bone near the joint, and remove your hand from the oil for a little while, then turn to the entire forest until you pierce the bone and feel the patient through this that they come in if they hold their hand over their neck;
and then return the limb to the medicine that is dry, just as I have taught you, and when the chariot (or possibly "the liver") nourishes and hardens the limbs, let the material reach the neck; so it is a lighter thing for the patient.
When the eyes are open all the time, and they do not come to rest on the nose, or become smaller, then it is best that you tie up the patient;
First let the healthy one, then put ventouses or haterel to pierce for relief, then put on oil like he made of ice and aloe and incense and sarcocolle, and then strain the oil, and apply it to the plaster with bandages and cloths;
And the manner of the bandages is that you take soft cloths, and wrap each one around four times, and then put one on top of another according to how much skin there is needed;
then strain it over a hard bandage, and then put on the ventouses again to relieve by piercing.
then take off the ventouses and let the oil bind tightly for day and night, and if you tie it with a bandage, so that you can tighten it more.
Then take care of the bone after the day and night, and if you see it repairing itself, this is good;
if not; But if it does not heal again, and the plaster is reapplied and the bandages are put back on, and the bone and the wounds remain in place until it heals.
Drop of fallen hair When the inflammation comes into the eye, then opens and brings forth papers like grains of resin, and is wonderfully astonishing to see;
then if you cover the eye with work, such that you put an awl into the root of the lower part of this wound, and then put another awl where there is a double thread from the upper part of the corner; And cut to open it, and let the first needle pierce, according to its shape.
Then cut the liver with a double-edged knife and bind a part of the right side, and tie it well, then pull out the needle and apply oil of linseed in abundance to it.
And let it be until the liver is stuck to the gallbladder, then apply oil from soothing things until the wound is healed.
And at no time should the wound be restrained by a bandage of cloth around each part of a circular shape, until it is healed.
And if the eyes have great appearance, then pierce with a fine needle that comes from beneath the oil, and draw out the moisture and downward let enter.
Now let them wait until they are whole.
This illness, which is called "alcunnati", consists only of the bowels assembled in oil, resembling fever descending, and it is not true fever.
And the manner of its appearance is that you should make the patient lie on an upright stool and straight, then take his head in both hands of two parts, and pull it until you see the bowel rising up to your eyes. Then tie it up and do not let it descend, nor let the light shine, and see how the patient is doing as he usually does.
And if it does not descend under, see that it is fever, and if the descent of the bowel is prepared as we have said.
If you sit the patient between your hands, then take the fine spatula and make above the eyebrow by the continuation of the connection with the eyebrow skin and the crown, as long as the bow is attached;
And when it is released, if it distills into oil of hot water mixed with honey or to fenugreek boiled in honey, then apply another treatment until she is cured.
of the oil. We have the signs of water in the section, and what is needed for puncturing; if according to health.
It is necessary to sit the patient between your hands crossed, a fire from the light by the sun, and apply oil of health tightly.
Then place the paper of oil on your left hand if his eyes are on your right, or on your right hand if they are on your left.
Then take in your right hand if his eyes are on your left, the instrument called "almagda", or in your left hand if they are on your right.
Then place the point of the instrument into the crown, by the size of an arrow, in that thin layer of oil on the skin where it is nearest to the bone; then carefully blow the instrument which is called "almagda", violently, and twist your hand until it pierces through the oil, and feel that almagda is coming out of the empty thing.
and it is proper that the measure of almagda's depth be equal to the space from the root of the hazel tree to the end of the nail. and this is the crown of oil;
If you will see the bone in that paper because of the clarity of the linen cloth, and put the instrument just near to where the liquid is, then press from one side after another.
If they are now bleeding, so he sees the patient before him and the instrument on his hand.
After resting for a little while, and if the liquid rises up the second way, put some force with the instrument, and when it is stuck in place and does not rise again, carefully remove it lightly by turning your hand a little at a time;
and then put some wool or gem in water, and rinse off the oil inside; Then put the oil-stained cloth or a moist linen in olive oil and plenty of wine, and bind with clean oil.
So, and for those of our time, let us put on a common broth with plenty of wine.
And if the arm cannot enter into the oil because of its hardness, for it has many people who have very hard eyes, so it is necessary that you take hold of the instrument which is called "alberit", for this is the form:
And then pierce the conjunctiva only, and do not cut too much down into it, but make a new subtle cut, and bathe in that liquid, just as we have said;
And as the work is completed on the patient's body, the doctor appears before him at night, in which case he lies down on his dark bed;
And so he must refrain from all movements, and take light foods, and not move his head to the right nor to the left, and should be bound according to his disposition just for three days;
then he releases him from the same dark chamber, and opens his eyes, and shows him some things, and then he sets him free again after seven days;
and it is not necessary to do that in the urine of the patient or after the incision now, but it is necessary to lighten him, because the water mounts suddenly.
When an abscess comes to a head, let you loosen the oil in front of the seventh day, and take care of one who cures the abscess.
And when it is healing, if you loosen the eye and put on its lower eyelid to cover any day, and so remains in that dark and obscure house.
And then one goes into the house little by little, and turns it over in its cases;
and knows that no disciples should intervene in this case. And one came to us who was from the East, who told me that in some far-off land, people do make almagda (a medicinal substance), because of which they get drunk, but I have never seen it or known it in our country, nor has it been written about it in the books of the ancients. And by chance, this is a new thing.
And these are the forms of alum, because those who do not know them can see them;
are of pure iron. And the head of this same subtlety, and the behind in three angles of inflammation.
There is no occasion for the birth of different kinds of worms, because there are some that resemble scorpions to a great extent.
and if there are such ones where the worm is covered in a red flesh color, and some have worm flesh of a white bone color. Then in the case of those worms that are not covered with flesh, it is necessary to sit the patient between your hands against the sun.
Then in the case of those worms that are not covered with flesh, it is necessary to sit the patient between your hands against the sun. And work on his nose, and put the cloth on those wounds, and tie up the fuses; for cut what you must support under the subtle, small instrument, from one side, until you see that the wound is entirely closed.
And if there is anything left that cannot be covered, if you apply all the subtle instruments lightly, so that it does not stay anywhere. and if you do not find any pus or abscess, cut it as needed.
and if it is malignant abscesses, hasten and cautery as much as you can until the area is sterilized and all the wounds are closed, then put on linen or vinegar either hot or cold wine. If his nerves are overgrown, and moisture arrives just at the palace, he knows that it is safe.
And if moisture does not penetrate as it should, he knows that there is a bone cleft in the above, because the humors do not come to cut.
Then he must put a small thread of flax into the wound, and let it be drawn out by hands, and should have between each person some space to draw it out, and it must not be less than. And put the patient's head into the wound in such a way that it will come out with great force, and treat him with an odorant until it comes out through the nose.
And many times this is done to children in school, and it's a light thing for him who does it.
Then hold the head that comes from inflammation with one hand, and the other head that comes from the mouth with the other hand, and check each one after the other while smelling like us who are in the field.
Do this until you know that the flesh has not corrupted because of the wound, then cut the fingers, wash the wound, and moisten the finger in Egyptian ointment, and put it back above (the level) of the skin as before.
Do this for three days or more, until the ointments have corrupted all that remains of the flesh.
And then put the wound under linen wrapped in cloth for some days until it is healed, and if he needs to apply dry medicines, so that.
and this is the form of the instrument for purging the head, because one distills the oil and medicine or other substances:
and let it be of silver or lead, resembling a lamp over the top, like an earthenware pot, and so conduct it:
and if you see, make a narrow tube, and let the instruments be flat for purging the head;
and have a mesh at the head to hold it when you heat the oil or any liquid.
From the sword near the neck
Many times the head swells from the application of medicine with a painful boil, and grows and becomes large so that it is visible to be looked at;
and for this reason it is necessary to apply the cauterization or hot medicine at first, and then put on the head a poultice made of all its parts.
and if you hold it to cover until it is large, take care if it is hard, of the red color, of poor sensation:
if you don't touch it with iron because it is an enchanted abscess, for when one cuts it once, great evil comes to the patient.
and if the abscess is from a soft touch, not from a red color, and you see that it can be completely covered, evacuate the patient and let him cut with fear, and treat the thing as dry and restrain.
So that when some continuation of solution comes to one of these overgrown cartilages, it is not enjoyed at all, whether in any person.
It is therefore necessary to do the same if this happens to anyone, when you see whether the wound is fresh with all its blood. and then join the two lips to a stitch, and treat until he is well.
and if the lips are swollen on one side and the other, so you should scrape all the parts of their heat until they heal, then assemble the two lips to a seam, bind them, and sprinkle with powder of dragon's blood, and hot incense. and put on the powder a piece of plaster of strong or other plaster setting, and let it dry so that it sticks to him, then treat with ointment until he is healed.
The manner of the seam if you are assembling: or with needles, as we have said in the seam on the belly; or with thread, as I told you.
of swellings of the lips.
My mouth hurts inside the abscessed gum like grains of rice, and sometimes smaller, larger ones.
Therefore it is advisable to return the lips, and cut each one of them, and press with pliers and strike into every part;
then apply the hot liver after the application of vitriol powder, until the wound is stained.
and then apply the herbal medicine from elsewhere, and treat the liver of dry things until it is healed.
Many times there are swellings on the gums near where they call "albulus".
it is advisable to sustain it with tongs, and cut at its root, and let the wound or blood flow.
Then put vinegar on the wound; or other powder binding and drying.
and if the wound comes back after the incision and it has happened many times, so that you have to cut again, and cauterize. if it does not come back after the cautery;
Never are they assembled at the head of the teeth, inside the mouth between the gums, rough and painful sores; and sometimes are the teeth black and yellowish and putrid, until corruption comes to the gum, and they become foul.
If you must do this, instruct the patient to sit between your hands and have his joints placed in your hand, and when bones or scars are exposed, leave nothing there. and then do the purging of black bile and green bile, and yellow bile and the other humors, until they are cleansed.
and if you extract what is at the first joint, it is good; if this does not work, resume on the next day and the joint, until you have all of them.
and observe that the teeth have need of various shapes of instruments to cut, according to what the work shows, because the sawers who are used for cutting through the teeth have other shapes than those which are used between the teeth; and these forms and others are to be prepared with you.
It is necessary when treating a patient's pain in the tooth that you wait as long as possible before performing the treatment, for this should not be delayed. for it is a highly potent substance just created, therefore we have no excuse for failing to take care.
Therefore when the patient is forced to take it out, if you want to be certain of the tooth's vitality. Often the pain is worse in the patient, and consider it to be a tooth that needs to be extracted, and treat the good tooth. and do not take the pain away immediately, as it may cause new problems, because we have already tried to get rid of it with these physicians.
and when you are certain about the tooth that is inflamed, it is wise to burn all around the tooth with a strong caustic powder to protect the gums from all sides;
Now the arm you must move to your elbow or use sharp nails at first, and then pull out the nails until they are well cleared, then firmly fix them. And if the joints of the patient are between your thighs, and his tendon is well fixed so that it does not move.
After extracting the tooth from the cheek directly, and if it doesn't fly out, take any of these instruments and put them inside each side lightly, and move them as you have done before.
And if the bone is perceived and broken, so it should be filled with cloth, to or where the fracture is. And if you tie it subtly with nails, so that it does not break when being tied.
And it is necessary to apply much care over the gum to dislodge the tooth.
And be careful that you do not break it, and leave a part of it, and return to the patient when the root becomes infected, causing greater pains than before.
And be careful so that you do not do as the uneducated doctors who rush and are too bold, breaking the chariot every time, and bringing in nothing but what we have told.
but it comes sometimes from the onion of this great disease through its roots that remain, or because the cartilage is broken, as we have often wished;
and when the teeth are cracked, wash the root with wine or with ash and salt;
and if it bleeds when the bone is broken, which often happens, apply the root of vinegar.
and if that does not work, cauterize.
The shapes of the swellings are such that if you first try to extract the tooth, they have long points and large roots, which will not double back when you pull.
and these are the shapes: And are long roots if they do not bend when pulled, and are thick limbs well made, and have teeth to hold them in place.
of the tooth root When the root stays at the cauterization, it is advisable to put some moistened cotton wool on the shoulder so that it will become swollen, until the swelling subsides, for then you can loosen with tongs called "algefri", because the joint seems like a sore.
and they are made similarly to a lime and that's their shape:
And if the roots do not want to come out from all these ties, so it is fitting that you uncover the whole chariot around the root, and put the instrument which is called "althal", namely palm, in order to make this form:
And let it be thick and large if it does not break apart, and if the root jumps out of that, it is good.
if that does not happen, if you use all the instruments, then the shapes will come afterwards:
And if it is helped by this instrument which has two veins, then surely the form will be: and other tools that are in front in the region of the teeth, and from this instrument which seems like great pincers, whose form is:
And if these instruments are strong that they cannot break, and when you know that many instruments are needed; and also of other disorders which are not mentioned;
and the wise masters who are subtle in their treatment use it himself with his own instrument, according to what he has shown by his work and the disease, for there are some diseases where the ancient physicians do not know how to treat an instrument because of the diversity of these and so when they break a bone or other bones, if they search for instruments that are needed, I have told you, and helped with gestures, because this is the form:
And let them be large and well-held to hold the bone, so that it does not break, but can still be held and removed;
and then restore the patient to the use of medicines suitable for this, and if there is rot in the bone, and it is small, so that he can make full use of this instrument;
When the teeth are not as they should be in accordance with their natural form and the shape is ugly and especially in young girls, it is necessary that you know whether the teeth are new after the tooth, and it is not in its rightful place, and one cannot endure or fix it.
so therefore the line. and if it is near the tooth, take this instrument which has its form and resembles a small beak, and it should be made of iron in good quality.
And cut the gum with a small instrument daily because of the hardness of the tooth, and in order not to move the other teeth, if it appears that you can put it in, take some kind of glue as shown here.
and is also like the nail that you make the needles from.
and in lime, pound the tooth with teeth for several days lightly, until it does not move at all.
The patient should let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
When the tooth in front of a lock, or by percussion or by falling, and the patient cannot press up to what they bite, and you have cured them with restraining medicines, then this does not help.
if they would restrict with a thread of gold, because the threads of silver turn green and rot, but gold does not change its form.
and so that the threads are neither too thick nor too thin, according to the quantity of space between the teeth;
and if you see straight between the teeth, take the thread and put it double the space between two healthy teeth, then insert the stitches between the affected teeth, as many times as there are, until you come to the healthy tooth on one side. Then restart the covering from where you began, and strain your hand subtly and carefully, until it does not move at all.
and bind tightly to the root of the tooth if he cannot escape.
Then strike the nails of the thread with tongs, and assemble them, and put them back between the sound tooth, and so that they do not bite the tongue.
and then let him stay tight as much as it can endure, and if he loosens, or the threads come out, if they are strained with another thread.
so that it remains and serves like this for the full extent of its time, and that is the form of the teeth and the shape of the two sound teeth and the two molar teeth, as you can see:
And when the tooth falls out, so it is reset in its place, fresh as we said;
and do not let anyone intervene who is not knowledgeable or skilled, and at no time make a dummy tooth out of an old bone, and place it in the affected area, and tie it up as we have said, and hold for a long time.
There is no case where an intestine comes from under the tongue or in nature, that it happens as such. or by an accidental wound.
and the injuries are such that you open the mouth of the patient, and put their head on a healthy one, and lift up the tongue.
Then cut the nerve of the neck down to its large place, until the tongue is loose from its place, and if it has hardness or any other thing, and this is sudden pain, then inject the powder and cut down the tendon;
and make sure the incision is not too deep, lest it damage the artery which is underneath.
and when you have finished, lift the patient up to hot water and vinegar, or cold water, then apply a cloth made of linen under the tongue;
and treat each patient with maggots every night so they cannot heal.
And if the blood comes out upon him, he applies vinegar to the wound; and if the vein is not swollen, then burn it with the cautery slowly, which is good for those. then let another treatment be done until it is healed.
and if you see a foul odor, whether it is red or black or hard, as long as the patient does not feel pain and you do not touch any point, for it is a chancre.
and if it is inclining towards the whiteness and there is moisture, if you excise the tumor, and make a small incision with a spatula, and deliver from one side and the other; and if the vein is not swollen at its surface, apply vitriol splinters to the area as long as it remains stained, and then return to its surface until you treat the entire area.
then lift the limb from its rest and from its bed, and let the cure do other cures until it is healthy.
Evacuation of abscesses from the throat. There is never a lump in the throat called "godath", and they are properly named the two glands, and when you treat them, as we have said in the section of division, and if they are not healthy, be careful:
if it has hard pus of little sense and of fleshy colour, do not touch it with iron.
And if it is red and the root is big, do not touch it with iron either, because of the loss of blood; but let it be left until it is dead, and then you will take it out, because it would break apart by itself;
In case the inflammation is of white colour and the roots are subtle, if you have prepared the instrument to cover, but first examine whether the pus-filled abscesses rest and are calm.
So then have the patient sit in front of the sun, and his joints be healthy, and he open his mouth and the surgeon presses the lancet between his hands, and pushes the tongue down with it, so that this is the form;
and be made of silver or fine gold as much as the knife cuts.
Can you press the tongue with this entire instrument, and then you see the abscess, if you take a needle and thrust it into the horn, and pull out from above as much as you can;
And take no care of anything with threads or strings, for if you cut it with an instrument, it will show the shape that resembles force; And every bone is curved, and one place is bent to another, and they are very good, and made of iron or antimony;
And if you do not have this instrument before it, then take a pair of tongs, because this is the form: And if cut from one side, and the other side also.
And when you have cut one of the almonds, cut the other in the same manner also; and after making the incision, gargle the patient with hot, cold, and sweet water; or cook the rinds of pomace grapes, or myrtle shoots, and similar things, until the wound is stopped from bleeding. then the cure is until he is healed;
And there are no other abscesses born in the throat except two mandrubs, if they bind them then as the two mandrabs.
And I treated a woman with an abscess that was inside the throat, namely the small abscess.
and had tightly closed her whole throat, so that the woman could not breathe through the blocked channel, and could neither eat nor drink, and she was dead if she stayed like this for one or two days.
And the abscesses are raised so high that they have been forced to break two times by two wounds on the neck.
Then I did immediately, and put in one of the lancets, then the fire was applied, and a great portion of powder.
Then re-examine another part of the body on the other side, and let the work proceed with the mouth open and pressing the tongue.
After pricking one in those abscesses, and cutting off a part of it, only a little blood came out. And thus they cut off the throat of the woman, and now she began to drink cool water and then wine, and did not cease cutting that abscess for a long time.
And the abscesses reopened again, and filled up what I had emptied, until it became very large.
So I inserted and cauterized inside the throat: Then she remained for a while without growing worse.
And I depart from these parts, and do not know what God has made after me.
of the eye
When a swelling rises up, and it is inflamed and long, if it is called "perpendicular".
And if it is very large and round, then it is called a "swelling".
When it is cured as we have said in the division, and the cure does not profit, and you see that the abscesses are calmed down, and it is subtle, then it is fitting to copy it.
And when it is round and assembled, but not long. And if it is bloody or of the flesh color or black, then it is fitting to close the incision. For there is great danger to the patient.
It is therefore necessary, whenever you see it, according to the manner I have told you, that you sit the patient in the sun's rays, and press his tongue with the instrument we remember having made here before. Then pull out the gall bladder from under it, and draw it out, and strike at both of the two fingers that I have told you about in the incision of the two glands.
And it is necessary that you do not strike beyond the superfluity, which lies outside of its natural limit;
because if you strike beyond it further, the voice and speech will be grievous.
and after the incision, use what we have told about in the incision of the two glands, and treat it so that it may be healed.
And if the patient has fear of covering, it is advisable to use a fire engine at the cauterying of the painful senses.
And the manner of the cautery is wet water. And the patient should put his head on your sound, and then press the tongue against the instrument that we have said in this chapter of cautery, with hot vinegar shoes, so it is not too thick or too clear. and then take hold of this instrument's edge, by which there will be the form:
And if on his head there is either one hair or some mucus, as with the hands of a spoon, and put the instrument all over the medicine on the eye;
and the patient be gagged on his side so that saliva and mucus run from his mouth through the medicine inside, until they do not descend to the throat, and the bleeding.
then hold your hand over the medicine and press it on the eye, for half an hour's worth of measure, until you see it numbed and the morsifications of the medicine are assuaged.
If you see it, take cotton and envelop it over any instrument, and soak the cotton in the medicine, and pour the instrument into all of that on the cloth in the cane above, until the cotton sticks to your eye;
and do this often, until the cautery is perfect, then let it dry, and cast after four or five days.
And if you have to repeat the cautery of the medicine, so that it is repeated, and after the cautery wipe all around the eye with cotton dipped in butter, and purify what is around the medicine;
and be given cold water to drink, and be cured with gargles until he is healthy.
This cure is safer than cauterization.
When cured by fumigation in this manner, take calamus, hyssop, and origanum and rue and camomile and such herbs, and mix them all together or any of them in a pot, and make it into a paste, and boil.
And the pots should be well sealed with strong earth, and have a handle as in this manner: And be of silver or lead, and put one of the needles into the mouth of the patient until the vapor rises up to the eye through the nostrils, until the eye is numbed.
afterwards it is repeated often until the eye dries up, and remember not to do this at the beginning of the onset of the swollen abscess, for many things happen. and do not do this except when the blood blister forms.
and if this instrument is not present, take a knife and put it inside the patient's mouth so that their throat does not get too hot; because the heat of the knife does not weigh down the breath, and this is a good cure for good health.
often it hurts at the throat, as if on an arrow of fish, or nothing;
so it is fitting that you treat what you can see, and press the tongue against the sun with all the instruments, so that you may see the thing.
and what does not offend and is returned to the throat, it is fitting that you make the patient vomit so that the meat may be cooked in the stomach; In case of an accident if it happens by vomiting;
or the patient swallows a piece of sponge, or a piece of onion, or a root of lettuce, or a dry bread crumb; and tie the sponge to the spine and then cut it. and when she comes to the patient, if he swallows, and then you pull it out.
and if she does not come by what we have said, then take the instrument of force according to this form:
And if the instruments are curved at the head so that it can enter more easily into the throat, and the head is lifted up high. And beware that you do not touch the epiglottis, lest all your life goes, or do not thrust the bone into the throat.
and hold fast that you pour the instrument into him, for he will feel it unless the thing is smooth. if she vomits, or brings it forth unevenly with the instrument, until all of it is out.
about the cutting of the throat.
there is no medicine if he has not been treated with the medicine as I said in the division. and when he does not profit from it, then look to the throat of the patient in the sun, and press the tongue against the instrument that I have told you.
If you see the wound, so the arrow has come out at its small end, or you have fine tongs that are worth it.
If this is not worth it, take a caustic horsehair, and put the bottle in the throat of the sick person, then pour or touch the caustic horsehair to the warm metal, and do it often. And if the sick person suffers from water all day.
Then take full doses of cold water to drink, and work the mouth open, and swallow in that direction, and move it with your hand many times. and if at once they feel the cold water, spit.
And if she does not spit as we have said, then perfume the sick person with asafoetida, at the instrument that I mentioned for the fumigation of the nose.
do this many times, because she will vomit with tartar.
And the way of fumigation is that you take a pot in which there are charcoal sticks, and it is covered with a cloth pierced in the middle, and in that place are the keyholes of the instrument.
Then I will administer the purgation, and the patient will put their head in a cage, and close the mouth, so that the smoke does not escape from it, but comes out just there.
and the blood will now flow, and if it does not, repeat the purgation many times.
and the patient will suffer from thirst, and eat unclean and spoiled things, and shall not drink any water.
and therefore the case is considered to be resolved by this governance.
And the shape of the instrument used to treat the blood, namely, when it is visible, resembles curved tongs with nails that enter into the throat; And has a resemblance to the neck of the doctor, and it is rough like lime, so that whoever takes it will not be able to let it go.
Many symptoms of abscesses are found in this book, and they vary according to the remembrance that comes after both in front and behind.
and it is two ways, one of which is the same as itself, and by what it holds together.
And the second kind is for when they are inside or in the body.
because the abscesses in the head are different from those on the lower jaw, and the abscesses of the shoulder bone are different from those that occur in joints, and each has its own judgment in the work.
And if in abscesses we should not pierce it, until the bowel is dead according to its completion;
and if there are some that it is necessary to pierce them when they are thought to be dead, and do not die according to their completion, as abscesses that are near joints.
For when an abscess comes from the joints, and one leaves it there until it is full of pus, by chance if it infects the ligament and nerve of the joint, because that is the cause of contraction in that limb.
Where the abscess is close to the principal member, and if you delay the perforation until it is dead, it will harm the principal member;
or if you cut to the foundation, if you cut so that it dies;
and it is not good to pierce the abscess while its digestion is complete, because the heat will penetrate too deeply into what lies at the foundation, and thus cause it to burst outward, and a fistula will form; and cannot be cured in great time.
and you must know the urine of the perforation of the abscess which is dead according to completion, and this is when the pain is alleviated, and the departures of fever, and the reduction of pain and redness, and the dulling of the swelling and the sharpening of the headache from the abscess, and other signs;
And you must place the opening so that it is seated above or below the abscess, and where they make a hole.
And so the opening should be in the long bone of the body, and if the abscess is near the hands or feet, or in joints, nails, and arteries, where they are even and there is no swelling. In those joints that are swollen, according to the member.
And if there is an abscess in the jawbone, so that it will be left open until it has been fully digested and confirmed, just as we have said.
But if you pierce in front of this, the flesh is filled with a large amount of filth. and by chance they harden and penetrate deeper into it.
And if there is an abscess that must be pierced according to the size of the body, according to how much it needs.
And you must bring in small abscesses, small punctures; and in large abscesses, large punctures, and many incisions according to the size of the abscess.
And if there are such abscesses where it is advisable to shave the skin around it and cover; When the wound is as healed as if it were a dressing, and it is soothed, then it must be done in the same way as we do for boils:
and if there are those that are cut into three parts, and if there are such wounds where one cuts as with the gallnut of myrrh, just as abscesses from thorns;
and if there are those where one makes a round cut, and other sizes, and similar cuts.
Those who do not have a head, like superficial abscesses, it must be that you pierce them straight through;
and it is advisable when the abscess is large and has collected great pus, that you pierce, but do not extract all of it in one hour, but only take part of it; Then I will stop the abscess from growing on the other side, then I will take out anything that is behind it. Do this repeatedly in small pieces until the bowel has passed completely;
Even when the patient is weak, or a woman in childbirth, or small children, or old men who are decrepit. But you must hope for the worst-case scenario at all times with the outcome of the pus, so that by chance the patient may die, and you will not be disappointed.
Then beware of this chapter with great care, and when you have pierced the abscess, if it heals, and inspect whether the wound of the abscess is small; and if it's a clean cut, then apply tanned linen or old cotton strips; and if it's a large abscess and there's much pus, then you should sew into each one a tent so that they come together.
And if you have hit a part of the abscess with your finger, and you cut it open, then it is necessary that you fill it with old cloth or rags of linen without moisture, and tie it to the same day;
then the bones, and the one who heals with poultice until they are healed.
And if you find blood has come out to your work, then tend it with cool and easy water and salt, and cover it with the same cloth again many times.
And if the pus persists, then apply some government and cure, and the poultices that I have told you to take in this book; and if it is during winter, and the pus is very swollen, then it is necessary that you put on tenths and draperies moist with wine and hot oil;
and if it is in this state, and the swelling is hardened, then it is necessary that you put on moist draperies with water and oil, or with wine and hot oil, every day, just as we have said;
and then remove the abscess and clean it up and treat it, if necessary, so that it is safe.
And this requires knowing universally in treating abscesses:
Or you have said comment on must be told before treating abscesses, and thus here is the chapter.
Where the pus of head wounds come out small abscesses, and there are those things similar to cloth, as is the wick of a cat's skin, and there are many such appearances.
There are some that are fat and similar to pus.
And some that are hard and stony to cut, where there is no doubt if the artery is injured.
And the arrow wounds of the shoulder are such that if you examine all the instruments called "entromissoire", because the form comes after this, what kind it contains.
For if it contains moisture, they will cut from above the long bone.
And when the moisture is dry, if you scrape off the skin around it, leaving nothing behind because it comes back again when you leave nothing.
Plunges cotton soaked in Egyptian oil, if present; If not, soak it in water and cloth, apply the wound, and leave it until the next day; And those who will be left overnight.
And then resume the cotton, as before, on the second day, and the bandage, until you know well that it will not stay overnight;
Then treat the wound with oil suitable for it, until it is healed.
And if the abscesses do not burst out soon, apply according to this form, repeatedly. and then take out the pus, and scrape off all its parts, and put all your care in treating the wound where it is.
and if the arteries cause a contrary reaction, then do what I have told you afterwards.
And also do thus with an abscess if it is hollow, and when cutting and when curing as I have told you.
And he cuts on the abscess if it is hollow and moist, for if it is lighter, because there is less blood. And if some of those abscesses or swellings do not have any moisture and if the second abscess that I copied or the swelling of an old woman's head,
and found the abscess just like a cold, hard stone, rough and frozen, and it could not break. and if we have found any blood in it, then we have performed a wound just like cutting into stone.
In other abscesses that come or swellings elsewhere, wherever these occur on the head of children and the roots of the ears, always open them right away until they begin to flow.
and treat him accordingly.
This happens often to abscesses on the neck, under the armpits, and in the groin, and sometimes they occur elsewhere or in the body, and are very foul, and often join one with another.
And each abscess is properly located within its side, as the wound and the swelling of the head, as we have said. and the similarities to these abscesses are many.
and the similarities to these abscesses are many. There are some that contain moisture, and others that are malignant and do not want to obey health.
in that one where you see good disposition at the elbow joint, and it is similar in color to the flesh, and mute from every part, and not inflamed like the veins of the neck or artery, nor shallower than the ribs.
therefore it is convenient that you copy it from above, and scrape off every part, so that both lips are of the color of the gums, if you need to, as we have said about wounds on the head.
and the wound is small by small, and be sure that you do not cover the nerve or the vein, and do not apply the salve too loosely nor prick with needles, lest your hand tremble, and your sight be blurred, so that you do not cut what you should.
And if you cover the vein or artery, and that does not allow you to continue, apply vitriol on the wound to break it, or any powder that stops the bleeding, and hold the wound closed. and let it remain until the abscess is allayed, and the wound is softened, and begins to discharge.
And when the sutures are loosened, return to your work, until you complete it;
After they prick at it, see if there are any small swellings that will not go away.
And if there is a large vein in the swelling, so that you should not cut it except at its root, but tie with a strong double thread and let it fall down without trouble.
Then apply a wound of old cotton soaked in Egyptian ointment, and then the treatment.
If you hit the entire scrofula, it is fitting that you assemble both lips of the wound and sew now, because there will be no remaining fluid from the size of the scrofula. if it is fitting that you listen to cover the root of it, and treat with force, and sew as we have said.
if it is fitting that you listen to cover the root of it, and treat with force, and sew as we have said. Those swellings that have excessive swelling, prick it on either side where it is open.
and prick it so that it opens like the one we mentioned before, depending on its condition; then apply poultices with ointment and similar things, if it corrupts what remains of the corruption. and when the wound is well cleaned, so long as the dressing is kept tight.
They said and spoke of the operation on the throat; but I have never seen it done in our land, and this is their written word.
But it is necessary for those who have cut their throat that the opening of the throat called "epiglottis" be avoided; And do not help them because all the veins and the flesh in the patient are found at those who have made a deep cut in the mouth, or throat, or both.
When the disease is in the channel of the membranes, it is necessary to cover the epiglottis to avoid the destruction that comes from strangulation.
It is therefore necessary, when we wish to cut the epiglottis, that we cut it under three circles or four a small incision through the quantity of the incision over or between the two circles, neither in the cartilage;
and they are thus considered suitable for epiglottectomy when there is no scar, and the vessels are long in size.
And if the masters are fearful, it is recommended that he extends the skin of the throat to its fullest extent, then cuts the wound as long as it comes to the neck. and excise the wounded vessels, if you see anything, and then cut into the sac, as we have said.
and demonstrated by the section of the tongue from the neck, because it springs forth from the animal that is broken, and through the defect of the voice.
and leave the wound open a little.
And when the hour is past because we doubt strangulation, assemble both lips of the wound from which it came, and the skin all torn away towards the cartilage;
then administer medicines that cause pain, until it is cured.
Albucasis says that one should not do this (cutting) until the throat is completely stuffed, and the patient is judged to be dead, and the defect in the liver. Therefore secure the epiglottis because the patient cannot breathe, and he breathes through the wound, and thus is kept from death;
and the ancients ordered to leave the wound uncovered until the illness is passed, and it is passed in three days or four days; therefore they ordered that the wound be sewn and cured until it was fully healed;
and I will tell you what I saw. I saw a young woman took an arrow, and stuck it in her neck, and cut off part of the hair on her forehead.
and I was called to cure her, and found her in the same condition as dead.
I discovered the wound, and found the blood that had been drawn from it, and I saw well that she had not injured herself nor cut her vein only to the throat, but that the vein came out through the wound.
I had to leave, but I sewed up the wound, and cured her until she was well.
and this happened to the young woman that she remained red in the throat, and returned after her illness.
because of this I thought that there was no fear in the throat's sewing (or opening).
This abscess is called "hernia of the throat", and it's a large abscess in the color of a blackberry, and it's very common among women.
And occurs according to two manners: Nature (by art) and accident.
Or it has no cause or origin.
And the accident occurs in two manners: because one is similar to a bruise, and the other is similar to an abscess that comes from an artery. and there is fear, and it is not advisable to apply hot fires only in one who has a small wound, and he must examine and probe the interior. if you find it like a bruise and there is no inflammation, if you cut, as one cuts the skin, and remove all its covering, if there is nothing else. and carefully search all of it, and the doctor as he wishes, until he is completely healed.
There are many ways to us that I will tell you all the similarities;
and it is necessary that I tell you all the differences between a thing and its opposite.
I say that when an issue is present and fever persists, until the ebullitions have passed and it has been completed by puttingridity; and therefore the fever and heat rest.
With nothing, there is no heat, no fever, and no pain, but it contains the spleen, which are its own sacs, according to the color of the body, and begins to swell like a bag, and becomes large.
and they are according to two forms, or grays, or moist, and much of their color as I said in the division.
It is necessary, when you come to the cure of this thing, that you first examine and inquire about all the instrument called "entromissoire", according to its form or chapter.
And the manner of inquiring into abscesses is that you prick or moisten it more than what you find at the abscess, and turn your two fingers back and forth slowly until you see that the strumens have pierced the heart, then so much according to the size of the abscess.
then pull out the middle layer, and be careful that it does not burst.
If the corrupted skin is cut off, as its color is, just like for other abscesses;
and if the middle layer does not come back moist after cutting it off, know that it is fatty, so cut it across, and take hold of it with pincers, and lightly scrape off each part, wearing a cloth where you place it, in order to treat it soundly with the new.
and if you cannot treat it with safety, then treat it by parts so that it does not stay.
but if it stays, then it will return repeatedly;
and if it stays for a little while and does not cause you harm, then apply the wound to some sharp, acidic powders, tie up the wound, and put on soothing substances near the abscess, and perform other treatments until it is healed.
and if the abscess is large, then sew both cheeks of the wound, and cure the one that swells.
and if the vein is swollen against it or otherwise, and you hasten to apply the new vitriol powder, let it be applied for two days or three days, until the wound starts to heal, and allow the cooling of the blood. Then comes back to cover what is left behind where it stays out.
Look here at the forms of interstitial swellings, and they are three kinds: large, medium, and small;
and in it there are three quarters, which are called "albrets", and one which is called "breb", and there are them in three kinds: large, medium, and small, to enclose the swellings of fistulae;
and are also like the needles with which we sew the sutures, and are of citron iron, or steel, or silver, and move to match those who are yellow, and are more convenient for sewing the swollen bags of a fistula;
And they are of three kinds: Grands, moindres, and little ones, according to the size of the wound.
The forms of ulcers are many similarities, just as you see here:
and if ulcers have two corners of three kinds also;
and if ulcers have three corners, and are so of three kinds;
and if ulcers have two corners, and one corner only, and are of three kinds;
And all this is necessary in their place.
The head of those who do this injury are made sharp, and of such men there is one who does not cut through evenly from both sides, from which we scrape the skin, so that you do not cut the vein or the nerve;
And of these insertions are the arteries returned in handbags, so that the patient does not lose them when opening the abscesses;
and there are three kinds: great, small, and moderate, as you see;
and do not cut through more than in the thigh, like knees, arms, and breasts, and similar places;
and at no time do they make another small instrument, like scabbards of fistulas, according to this shape, by which we stain the vein; and put it on no occasion at the place which is healthy to have veins cut, and arteries, and never return according to this great form:
Never do the breasts swell up on some men when they begin to be corrupted, until they seem like the breasts of a woman;
and keep them swollen and inflamed, and whoever wishes to cure them should follow this form of the line from 2.b. to 5.g.: then scrape off the fat, and apply the wound with a medicinal ointment made of char, then close the two lips of the wound on sutures, and treat until it is healed;
and if the breast swells down and becomes inflamed like a woman's, if it has grown so large that it is painful to touch, then cut two incisions on either side above. so that the one is tied to the other at the end of each, so that the larger line contains the smaller according to this form, from 2.b. until line g;. Then scrape the skin which is between the two lips, and cut away the fat, and apply what we have said about dressing and powders, and what is necessary for the cure, until he is healed.
and if he is not healed, or the incision has not been entirely made, because the patient does not want to rest, or due to the accumulation of blood, so it is necessary to fill the wound with moistened cotton in a corrosive salve. and leave it until he has consumed the remaining and the fat, then treat him until he is healed.
Abscesses that come from beneath the armpits are hard scrofulas or it has scars, and if there is moisture in them.
Therefore, those that contain moisture should be cut according to this form, from the line .b. up to the line .g.: And if the whole bow of the abscess is empty, apply the wound with old cotton and leave it until the next day, then remove all the cotton, and treat with ointment suitable for that until it heals.
And if the abscesses are similar to scrofulas, treat them as we have said in incising scrofulas, and if the wound is about a vein, apply cautery as we have said before.
When the veins are cut and the skin is bound above, if it comes to multiple abscesses, and so does it have a vein that has escaped and an abscess.
And if it is found to be so when cut as far as the artery, because there are long abscesses within by its depth. and if you feel it at your joints, then you will have straining.
and when it is due to a vein, if there are signs of swelling appearing.
and this is madness when covering the abscess, and especially when it is under the armpits and in the neck, and is very large. It is therefore necessary to abandon the iron treatment, and those who have head problems should also abandon it, and for those with swelling of an artery, make a cut above the skin for a long time.
Then cover the chest with a sheet, and let it be exposed completely so that the artery is discovered;
Then take a needle and pierce it just on the other side, and tie off the artery with two thin threads of silk, as I have taught you in the extraction of both arteries that are located in the temples;
Then point to the area between the two threads of an intestinal instrument until there is no more inflammation and the abscess is cut open;
Then apply a poultice made of herbs, as it was decided by the physicians, until the wound closes; Then treat this condition similarly to those, so that it may be cured.
If the artery is near the size of the vein, so it's convenient to stain your hand with that, as much as you can apply the arrow from the vein to the whole skin, then pull out the needle from the place where you are holding your hand, and pierce it again, and let it go twice, so that you draw it from one side of the skin. then tie the arrow, just like I told you, or connect it with one of the two parts of the second joint.
and if you doubt that the threads won't come out, so I tie another needle all over each thread under the incision of the first needle.
then cut the arrow until the superfluity comes out, then cut the superfluity again at the point and let what's tied.
The patient is then placed under a wet cloth dipped in wine and oil, and then given treatments of poultices and ointments until they are healthy.
So too do abscesses come in the artery and vein, and abscesses appear at the wounds when they are fresh, or due to excessive work, and similar things.
And this happens more often at the shoulders and elbows where there are joints, and it's an abscess, and its color resembles that of the flesh, and is accompanied by many dieings from pain.
And when they are stretched tightly, the patient feels pain, and it's not exactly as painful in the chest, but rather below the heart.
And it is quiet in all parts, and does not go forward or backward, neither up nor down, and the one who has joints should not be covered with iron. perhaps it will contract; and those who have a skin wound on the head or on the forehead, perform the dressing with the spatula.
and those who have a skin wound on the head or on the forehead, perform the dressing with the spatula. If there is an abscess that needs to be cut open, if you have a pair of pliers and cut at the root.
and if it is large, if the patient has applied an onion to clean and scorch it, then cut the bone and sew the wound to the chest, and the cure until he is well.
It never occurs in the abdomen and not in any other part of the body, it is a disease that is called "fungus" because of its resemblance to an abscess, with subtle roots and fat.
and in it there are both small and large ones;
and I saw in the home that had two people who were ill with a disease which was more like fungi than any other thing, and there was no difference, and they were white, and had a small root, and their skin was split, and it corrupted afterwards with moisture.
I took one of them and found that it weighed 18 ounces in the other, because if you look at the incision on a patient who is moist, and the color of the ulcer is pale and moist with a subtle root; if you scrape it with a spatula large, and they are in your presence the cautery on fire.
if you scrape it with a spatula large, and they are in your presence the cautery on fire. But when cutting comes with many great bleeding, and if they do not watch you, then hasten then to the cautery.
And if you see the patient is anxious and fearful of the incision with fire, take a well-made thread from below tight, and bind the ankle so that we have said, and let it rest for two days;
And then hold the thread tight and do not cease to tighten it until it cuts through the ankle, feeling it with each cut.
And if the roots are thick, if he is afraid to cut himself with the same motion on his abdomen, but you can well cut half of it, then cauterize it so that it does not return.
Then treat the wound, and make sure you do not cut the root which is of poor quality color and sensitive to pain and inflammation.
This is an enchantment or spell, and I came to this cure for the chancre after.
When the boil bursts If the appearance of a wound comes from cautery of a cut or a slice in the scapha, and it is on the belly and in some areas of the groin, so as to happen in other ways, or from blood that cuts veins or arteries according to what is before, or from windiness.
and if it's from the cut of the scapha and from the exit of the bowel, so that the color of the abscess seems like the color of the body, and is a light thing with pain, and opens to various issues. And if it comes from the intestine, then it is more diverse, and when you press on both sides, it returns, and then goes away, and by chance it becomes scarred, and increases greatly at the entrance of the bath and for strong work.
and if it's because of moisture, it is a light thing, and opens well when you press with your hand, do not constrict.
and if it's because of blood, so it opens by these signs: big and hard abscesses, and they occur in a certain quantity; and if it is due to a wind or illness, so that the shoulder is soft, and the wounds are such that you should examine whether their appearance is for the blood of the artery, or of the vein, or wind.
and if it is due to a wind or illness, so that the shoulder is soft, and the wounds are such that you should examine whether their appearance is for the blood of the artery, or of the vein, or wind. It is fitting to leave the cure. But because of doubt and fear, as I told you in the chapter about abscesses, for arteries and veins.
and if their appearance is for the intestine or the gall bladder, it is fitting that you instruct the patient to bend his knee, and lie down straight, then stitch everything around the wound. then command the patient to lie supine between your hands, then go around the knee that you have stitched all along the abdomen, then cut the half of the abscess above all the great incision. then tie the patient around a strong thread or a cord of strong silk tightly, and secure him with that single ligature.
After the fire cautery, work on the half of the abscess is stretched over the ligament, and insert your instrument into it, and choose the intestine; If you find it caught on the ligament, release it, and insert the intestine into the space outside of the abdomen;
and if you find it is burned, take it out by the sinus, and cut off its superfluous part;
and if the arteries cause contractions or the veins, go well into them, then return to your work and take out two arrows, and insert two needles, and push them back in the way you made them pierced;
then strain the abscess in four leagues above the needles, and if you see, take out the needles, and let it remain until it stops oozing, and cut off the dead part by itself; When you strike it when it is subtle and poor, then the cure will do what it should, and cut off the abscess as we have said.
When you strike it when it is subtle and poor, then the cure will do what it should, and cut off the abscess as we have said. and extract the blood or the moisture you find, then cure the patient of what they need, and bind the joint.
A skin sore As we have said in the division of the chancre, and how it should be treated with medicines, and how one must avoid iron treatment;
and say that the chancre infects in the groin, and great care must be taken in its treatment, and the ancients said that when chancre is present on the flesh, or can be scratched as chancre on the breast, or in the testicles, and similar places, one should remove all of it when it begins to appear.
I have never seen anyone cured in front of me.
And in the case of ulcers, when it is in its place or can be removed, as we have said, is that you should never purify the patient with black bile.
then make the patient healthy if he has shown signs of fullness, and then make the ulcer in its proper place.
then cut off your ulcers or chancre, and the head of all parts, and remove the bone from all parts without leaving anything behind.
and let the blood flow freely, and expect well that it will heal in its own time, or at your hand, or at anything, and if they start bleeding from the incision of an artery or a vein, then cauterize until there is no more bleeding. Now the patient must undergo another cure until he is healed.
Fever of dropsies. We have previously described the similarity of dropsy, and in what way the assembly of water is made, and the signs of each one, and the medicine that is used to treat it, as well as those who are cured with iron.
and iron should not be touched in these two similarities: which are tympanitis and suppurative arthritis, because it is a mortal thing;
Therefore when you use medicine for this similarity of dropsy called "eclites" and the cure does not work, if you examine whether the patient is weak or has another illness than dropsy, such as stomach problems and similar things; If it's not touched with iron, because there is doubt;
and if you see the patient of great virtue, and he has only dropsy, and is neither too thin nor too large, then thus operate: Lift the patient upright on your hands, and the attendants press the abdomen towards the bottom of the groin, then take the spike (or pointed instrument) according to this shape: And let them cut from both sides. pointed, so that there is neither too great an entrance, lest he come to the intestine when you pierce it, and cannot be closed.
then examine whether the dropsy is located near the intestines: It is necessary that you cut around the swell of the third. You must cut downwards from there over the nail. and if there is an abscess on the left side of the swell of the third, cut.
and if it is because of the muscle, on the right side, and do not let the patient lie on the wound so that the swelling does not run to the weak part.
then pierce all the skin with the instrument, and the vein, and lift your hand to cover the space between the skin and the sac as you drain it out as much as an angle or less.
then pierce the sac until the space reaches eight, and this is the point of the fluid, then tear it out, and drain this instrument from which this shape comes: And it seems like a chain of silver fine, made from iron or ash wood light, and in the part underneath there is little split; and on this side it has three splits; and two on the other side, and one on the other.
and the knives are cut like a pen, and this is the form of the incision that the scribes shape the pen:
on the top of it is the little bone, so that when the instrument comes to the water, it now rises up on the instrument;
then you empty the third part, for if you empty more than it is necessary in this hour, by chance the patient may die from the resolution of his spirit due to the arm, or he will spit blood, or he will approach death;
but according to the quantity of his virtue, and according to what the disposition of his virtue signifies in the patient, and his hairs;
then take the instrument and hold the water, and it is held now because of the clot which blocks the puncture that is above the sac, as I have said, so you should pierce according to this manner;
then continue the instrument the next day, if you see the patient suffering from it, and take a small quantity of water;
do this on another day, and guard yourself from folly until it does not remain but a small amount of water.
and if you doubt the patient, and you give a great amount of water to them, if the doctor prescribes a burial or hot salt, and after much sweating or bathing, and drinking vinegar; and the healer of medicinal remedies makes dry as soon as they are cured, and cauters on the stomach and on the liver and on the spleen after extracting the water, just as I have said before.
No child is born without any deformity in the penis, or if there are deformities they are small, or it is not in its proper place.
If they wish to pierce at once, so that it cannot be pierced on the entire length of the penis very subtly according to this form:
and then puts a subcutaneous needle deep into the flesh, and ties it and holds it for three days or four, and whenever he wants to make urine, if the stitches are removed, makes urine, and then puts them back.
and in case it does not come out at all, because the urine that comes is not held back.
Those of whom there is a puncture are small, if it is treated with the clove of garlic, as we have said, because they will swell.
those who do not have the needle in their own body are blackened, because no one is born with the needle on the head of the penis, because they cannot urinate before lifting their penis up. and they cannot come by injury because the material is unable to reach just at the spot where it occurred, and this is a bad illness.
And the way of the work is that the patient lies on his back, so the head of the rod is placed and cut with the same length as a grain of barley, so that the puncture marks in the middle, as it should be.
and beware of the bleeding that often comes, and if it happens, if the one who bleeds causes the bleeding, treat the wound until it is healed.
of swellings of the rod Many times come cysts in the rod, and this is an ugly appearance.
and some are malignant while others are not.
If it is necessary to grasp them at one time subtlety, then hold and cut all of them, then put cotton moistened with Egyptian oil on the wound. Then let the dressing be repeated until it is safe.
If the inflammation is malignant, of a foul color and smelling, then it is fitting that you apply cautery.
When you cut it and the flesh is tender under the edge of the wound, with some inside the skin and some outside, if necessary, then you must take out the flesh that is inside first. And when it is bound up, remove it afterwards.
Because when you cure the joint together, be sure to secure it so that the flesh is not perceived on the edge of the wound, for then blackening and corruption come onto the joint.
If it is necessary to cover all that which is black and corrupted, then tie above the affected area with a plaster made of honey and flour, which is made from pomace of grapes and walnuts, then cure other remedies until he heals.
And if the hemorrhaging comes, then apply the lunar cautery according to this form:
The cautery can help in two different assemblies: that is to say, by stopping the flow of blood and by preventing corruption.
and if the head of the staff is corrupted and withdrawn, then it is necessary to tie or conduct a cord around the staff, and pour the patient out among them.
and when the hair grows on the head of the staff that has touched those who have not been circumcised, or it is wounded or infected, then it is necessary to scorch it with an instrument like a razor, until the bonds are loosed, and deliver the head of the staff from all parts.
and if it is this painful thing to examine, then it is suitable that you scorch with the staff of the spindle any point on the scalp and beard.
then serve it well between two, and place under one of the fingers, so that it does not burn directly.
There is no difference in healing from other wounds. all means should be used if we do this work on our own will, and especially for children, since it is necessary to make the best and easiest treatment for their safety.
They did not say that they cut the circumcision of their children, because they did not use it in their law, and we have only what we acquired through experience.
Because I have sought the greatest part of the masters and healers who performed circumcisions during the time of our lord, and learned many things.
If it is frozen because of the cold, and by chance if they hit those above and lingered there below. Or they recover the wound, and there is great pain, and because of the inflammation that does not have a certain degree to be sure about the tip of the member;
and because of the inflammation of the ulcer by chance they stop the iron, and they treat the wound, and many times it happens so that it needs no further treatment and I have seen this.
Through the cleansing which is done on all parts of the limb I have found the goodness of the experiment, because the forces cut exactly equally above as below.
Because when you press your hand, if they are equal in size all around the skin tenses; but that the thread is well drawn into the skin;
and if the manner of the first operation is that you think of the child, if it understands, then you make only to tie the thread around the rod so tightly, and only do so in all kinds of ways as you can;
Then make him sterile between your hands straight on, and then bring back the strength between your hands or below your feet that the children do not see, nor any of the swellings.
Then put your hand on the vein and blow or kiss it, and take it up so that the head of the vein is exposed. Then clean it well of the dirt that is assembled there, then bind with a double thread, and tie below the point to another point.
Then clean it well of the dirt that is assembled there, then bind with a double thread, and tie below the point to another point. And tie it to the second joint with the double thread on the pouchet and the vein's index, cut between the two threads, then lift the wound up immediately and take out the head of the vein. Then let the blood flow little by little, for it is the mother. Instruct the patient to put powder on and above the powder; and drizzle with a mixture of rose water, cooked from milk, desiccated in warm water, mixed with good olive oil and fresh, and let it dry for the next day; and the cure will perform another cure until he is cured.
If this is the form of force during purification,
The two heads are closed and pinched, and the size is equal to that of a finger.
the error during purification occurs when the keys inside are torn at the incision;
therefore it is necessary to extend it to your vein, so that the abscess forms.
And let the hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold the eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
But if they have been bleeding for three days, and that which is below the vein is swollen, let it be left to allow the swelling to subside, and scorch lightly.
If you cut it as the movement allows, and keep away from the vein part, it will do no harm.
Therefore cure the swellings of sudden wounds with powder, as we have said when treating powders, and if you cut too far over the measure, it will rise up to the top, doing no harm.
Therefore cure him as we have said, until he is healed.
When retention of urine occurs.
The retention of urine is due to obstruction by stone, or freezing of blood, or bowel obstruction, or a blockage in the neck, or similar things that we have mentioned earlier.
And if the urine is not flowing, and you see that there is a retention due to a stone being lodged at the neck of the bladder, then it is advisable for the patient to be raised up on his knees. And let the stones be put on his back, and extend his belly from above his back, and restrain the patient as far as he can. And thus the neck of the bladder is constricted to express the stone at the top, for the urine will flow again.
and if it does not come, as we have said, and the patients feel great pain, so you should administer extraction to all the instruments that are called "siringue", because of this form:
and it be made of subtle and light silver thread, like the feathers of a bird; and it be half an inch long palm wood and subtle at the head.
And the manner of the issue of urine if it is that you take a double thread, and tie to the head a small amount of wool or linen, and pour the head into the "siringue";
and seal the superfluity of the linen and pour it just into the head of the "siringue", then anoint the siringue with oil or butter and powdered aloe, and have the patient sit on the stool, and raise the bladder and the phlegm moistened with oil of olives and water.
Then gently insert the suture into the vein, until it comes to the root of the vein, then double the vein above over the wound.
Then pour the suture before just reaching the bladder, and feel that the patient comes to just before the empty space, and this is not done according to this order because it was twisted in the way it was supposed to be.
Then pull the thread all along the spine very little by little, and the urine follows the thread, then extract it and make the patient urinate;
And restart the suture until the bladder is empty, and relieve the patient's pain.
When scorching or pus comes to the bladder, when putrefaction is assembled, and you see water and medicine dripping, do this with all the instrument called "clepsedre", and it's the form:
It is closed and if it has three holes: We come from one side and we go from the other;
and the swollen veins, because of which the medicine can be applied so that it covers well the part with an addition, if possible to treat the moisture, and push when necessary is;
and when you see that you can get your medicines into the bladder, put the chief seat in the moisture, and draw as soon as possible are;
if you drain the moisture at the keeper, and then push hard the pulling in. if the moisture enters again, and comes to the bladder now, so that the patient will feel it;
and this is the subtle form of the cystoscope by which you can cauterize the bladder:
And it is of silver or of copper, and the nails are higher.
and lower than where the sinew meets.
then take a sheep's bladder and put in the moisture which you see clotting like a vessel, then tie it between the two breasts to form a good double thread, and heat it over the fire;
then pour the head into the vein, then strain your hand on the vessel with all the moisture immediately, until the patient feels that the moisture has reached the vein;
and if you don't have a vessel, take a piece of parchment and make a circle on it, and pierce it all around. Then put a strong poultice on these wounds, then assemble the circle as you assemble the gall, and place inside what you see with oil, moisture, and water, and bind it in the instrument.
and do so as you have made of the bladder, to press with your hand until the moisture appears in the bladder.
From the stone
We have said in the division of stones and the extraction of medicines;
and I have said the difference between the stone that burns with fire and rain, and all the signs, and in which stone one must cut or reduce. and in the bladder and in the phallus;
and I will tell you about it plainly and briefly.
I say that the stones which are entrapped in the bladder occur more often in children, and it is a sign that the water jumps out of the bladder like water in its subtlety.
and if the wound is opened and he pricks his patient's finger, and then pierces it multiple times, and afterwards poisons. and after many of those wounds, the foundations collapse;
and it is lighter in children until they are four years old, and is very troublesome in the elderly, and is at the joints which are between youth and old age;
and it is easier to treat those who have large stones than those who have small ones.
And when we come to the cure, so it is fitting first to purify the patient by cupping, in order to draw out all the blood that is in the intestines. But it is often not worth seeking to cut stones.
Take the patient by the feet and pull them down and move downward so that the pain descends to the bottom of the bladder, and do not let it rise again on him;
Then place the patient seated between your hands prepared, and let his knees be down below his thighs so that the bladder is all inclined downward;
then draw it and touch inside;
if you feel the stone in the space, then hasten and cut on the stone.
And if it does not come out on the toucher to all, wet your right index finger with oil from your left hand, if the patient is sick, or your right middle finger, if the patient is young and accomplished. And let the bottle be placed in its foundation, and to pierce in it, and when you sense at your throat, if it is small at the neck of the bladder;
Then press upon it at your throat, and the bottle in front as soon as you see that you are cutting.
And instruct the minister to press the bladder with his hand, and he commands that he extend his right hand to the fingers up high, and his left hand pull back the skin which is underneath the fingers at the place where you are cutting.
Then take out the spatula (or spoon) and cut it, for this is the form: And make a hole between the fingers and the foundation, not in the middle but to the left side of the right skin.
and so it should be straight on the stone, and your toes should be tied to the ground or foundation, and if the size of the stone requires a larger opening than usual, but also narrower inside, according to the quantity of the stone, not too large.
in case the pressure causes the toe to jump or fall out of place.
and see if there are any stones or edges where it has corners and margins. if it is brittle and prone to cracking.
and if there is something that is smooth, like the sound of a bell, and round, from which light issues.
Therefore, if it has corners and edges, make the incision larger;
And if it does not break, so it is advisable to strain the nails which are like a lime at the top, to press down the stone so that it will not escape. where you pour into the subtle instrument curved at the top;
and if you cannot put it in that way, enlarge the pore of the puncture, and if it is not smoothed out, strain with glass.
and if there are more stones, pour the largest one into the bladder's neck first, then cut it up, and then pull out the smaller ones afterwards.
And if it is very large, then make a larger wound and cut. For two things happen to the patient: or he dies, or his urine comes out in abundance because of a wound that the pus cannot dry.
But force yourself to pull, or to cut with shears, until you pull it apart by pieces;
And when you have completed your work, apply the ointment of encens and aloe and dragonâ€™s blood to the wound and bind it; and place above it the drapery moistened in oil and wine, or in oil and rosewater and cold water, to soothe the abscess. Then revive the patient on his neck and do not release the bandage until the third day.
And when you release it, apply a lot of oil and water to the patient well, then give him an application of diffinicon and basilicon ointment until he is healthy.
And if the abscesses come to a boil in the wound and cause corrosion, and a frozen mass of blood forms in the bladder, and it is retained by this means, which is known in this manner, that without urinating with urine: Push it then onto the wound, and extract that blood, because if it stays, they will bleed the bladder, and burst.
then lift the wound with water and aid, and help in all kinds of ways that you know, until it is healed.
and it is fitting that all the treatments you administer, bind both knees, and assemble the medicine on the patient.
And if the stone is small, and it is near the urethra, and stuck, and the urine cannot come out; so that the treatment for what I am saying is to cut off repeatedly, you are excused from cutting again for this treatment. I have already tried it thus.
Take iron according to this shape and stick three nails into one tile:
Now take the flesh of the child and wrap it around the joint under the stone, so that she cannot come again into the bladder;
Then pour in the forest lightly into the joint until it comes out to the stone; And turn the forest round to your hand in the stone little by little, until you can pierce the stone on the other side;
If it comes to that point, then press your hand down on the thing which is remaining in the stone which is inside the joint. If it breaks at once and comes out with the urine, and the patient is saved;
And if you cannot do that for any reason which prevents it, then wrap the flesh under the stone and around it, then make the vein run straight into the stone between the two tendons, then pull out the tendon, and untie the ligament, and clean the frozen wound in the injury; and the healer as long as he is sane.
About women's stones
It happens that a stone pierces a woman, and if it has happened once, the healer is troubled, and is forbidden for three reasons:
one of which is that by chance the woman is virgin;
and the second one is that you cannot find a woman who knows how to shave her eyebrows, especially when she is clean.
and the third reason is that by chance you cannot find a woman who knows this art of hands.
and the fourth reason is that the stone in a woman's body is more deeply embedded than in a man's, because it requires a deeper wound, and great fear there is. And if necessity arises for this, you must take a skilled midwife, and to her you must go, and if you do not find one, choose a clever woman instead.
And the present a wise treatment in the life of women, or a woman who knows part of the art, and commands that she do this thing which you command from the inquiry of the stone; and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin:
and look very carefully if the woman is a virgin: then he must put his thumb or root and search for the stone;
and if she finds it, he must apply pressure with his thumb or root, and commands her to put her thumb on the wound, and squeeze and press her left hand onto the bladder form.
and if he finds it, then it is fitting that she move her thumb from the entrance of the bladder to the lower part of the crotch, until she reaches the root of the thigh;
Then cut on the stone at the root of the thigh in the middle where it is swollen and meets the bone; there or you will find the bone. and do not move his two fingers above or below the bone, and put them on the first joint.
and do not move his two fingers above or below the bone, and put them on the first joint. then pour out the blood from the joint, if you feel it is nearby the wound as far as the bone can come out, and see that there are many kinds of stones.
this is to say, small and large, sharp and dull, long and rounded, and those with marrow.
If you know the similarities to know the outcome.
and if they are not inflamed, pour on white vinegar and break it, and hold onto it for an hour until the skin is dried.
Afterwards return to your work, until the bone is healed, and you have the strappings that I told you in the extraction of the bone for your own aid in your work.
and if the patient does not take it, and it is of the artery that has been cut, then apply powder on the limb and the strapping of tents and bandages, and do not resume this again, and let the bone alone, lest the patient may die by chance. then treat the wound.
And when the heat of the wound is appeased, and the swelling subsides, then returns to his work, until the pain subsides.
Ramsy water is nothing but a mixture of moisture or white syrup that is beneath the knee, which contains egg.
and it is called "syfac", and it is never properly found in the eggshell, if one thinks that it might be a different kind of egg. and this is the skin of the elbow between the white flesh which we have said.
and this does not happen. And the generation of this rice water is from weakness that comes to the joints, and it spreads out that material.
And never happens if it comes from a blow on the joints, and this moisture has many colors: or it's yellowish in decline, or without red, or black, or white and watery, and this happens more;
and these are the signs of a certain assembly, because if it is white and fleshy as we have said, then it is abscesses in return, I do not see it long since like the figure of an ox, and does not open the joints, because it has moisture all around.
And if it has moisture in its own membrane, then it is abscesses with a part of the bone, and because of this one thinks it is another ox;
and if the moisture is between the skin of the groin and the white flesh, he feels well;
then when you see the color of the moisture, if it appears on the entire inner quadrangular space, then the form is in front of. Then judge what is inside according to what comes after the surrounding area.
And when we treat with iron, it is fitting that the patient be healthy according to our power and the replenishment of their body;
then he applies a bandage over his back on top of something high and puts a great deal of cloth on it;
then he places it above his left side and commands the minister to place it on his right, and extends the rod to one of the two holes near the groin;
Take the powder of silver and take it to the wound, and cut the skin around the navel up to its length until the point; and make your incision entirely straight in shaving the skin around the navel just like that white stuff, and scorch it subtly according to one's strength.
Then pierce the white stuff from water into the large puncture, and extract all the water, and then place your linens, and fix the white stuff above.
and do not touch the skin around the navel, but only the white stuff. cut it all or in pieces at the same time along its length, so that if you do not cut it properly with sharpness, it will return to flowing again.
and if the blood jumps to your side, then tie it off at its place when you have completed cutting the white stuff.
Then assemble the two leaves from the same wound at one stitch, then treat it like other wounds until it is healed.
And if you find the corrupted vein of another disease, it is advisable to tie off the vessels that are superficially suspended, in doubt about the progression of the blood.
Then tie off the vein to all that is superficially suspended, and extract the vein, and treat it as we have said.
And if an abscess is assembled in two parts, so that they are two branches; if you tie off the other part in the same way, then drain the blood, and put a clean line moistened with rose oil into the wound.
if you tie off the other part in the same way, then drain the blood, and put a clean line moistened with rose oil into the wound. and put another type of wool in oil and in wine, and put on the two sides, and cover it with doubled cloths, and tie it to all the thread that corresponds to this form:
Then take two cloths, and use woolen felt of the same shape and are sewn together in the neck of the breeches, and one of the knees takes hold on the foundation just below the back, and the other at the leg bone.
and the other two knees above the two arms, and so everything is stitched together in the loop of the girdle.
and at no time is this medicine a substitute for hot iron treatment in place of the size of metal, and so you take a cautery knife very fine, cut the skin on the sides, and be heated as we have said, until the white stuff that contains the water is uncovered;
If you take the fire cautery according to this form, and pierce that spot on the skin, and scorch with this subtle fire cautery hot:
And cut it in all ways that you can, until you mark everything;
and keep the fire from touching the eyes;
and know that this work is more safe; and beware of the danger of bleeding, and watch out for the work of injuries to the joints;
and if no harm comes to you, or there is an abscess or bleeding or any other thing, then cure what harms you according to what has been said.
If the patient is fearful and will not wait for this treatment due to its horror, then perform perforation, just as I told you, and it is that when you are certain by the meanings we have said that water is laid down, so place the patient on a raised bed. Then pierce the abscess at the lower part and to a distance equal in length to the breadth of the spleen, and make the perforation deep into the body.
and so that the wounds are wide enough, so that all the flow of blood is stopped.
Then put cotton on the wound, and tie it, and let it dry out until the remaining blood flows off, then treat him until the wound is healed.
and if the whitened cloth does not allow the blood to flow out of the wound's mouth, then it is best to put in a quill or the instrument used for treating dropsical swelling, because this shape was as before.
Increasing the size of the wound, and observing that the pus returns, and it is assembled after six months or in what time it enters, when it is assembled as before, and thus will pass for the patient their days.
Observing that in the cutting of this branch there is fear of more deaths because of some situation, therefore it seems worth leaving it;
and I will tell you the work and similar signs of the abscess.
Therefore, most abscesses come from flesh, and also cause pain; and this is because of many cases.
which is that the acidity and water are spread out to the wounds, or by percussion;
and is the color of the abscess according to the color of the body; and does not bring any pain, and it is an abscess that causes grief;
and sometimes is an abscess that is painful and pious, with purple color, and never comes from a new artery, or swells the vein.
When it is not from a new artery, it is discovered by the swelling of the abscess when you press on it with your two hands; and should not be touched by anyone.
The one that swells the vein is discovered by its swelling when touched with two hands, and it can be felt well by anyone, and on this appearance, and on others. And it is that you strike the heart of the veins, then stand up in the upper part, and throw the flesh down to white, and deliver the suspension from all parts of the vein.
If the vein is already swollen with these black marks, then it is necessary that you treat the vein and cut it.
and if there is blood in the flesh, or what is within the vessels, it is necessary that you deliver all of that vein, and cut it around.
And if the birth of the child is at your back side, it is fitting that you copy it all over and extract the phlegm, as we have said.
And when your wounds are finished, apply the wound of soft linen moistened in rose oil and wine, then treat with other treatments until he is healed.
This is an abscess that has burst out with a swelling similar to the jawbone, with softening of the veins, and the patient dies greatly when it ruptures.
and the cure for this disease is as frightening as before, and we will tell you about it, according to what the ancient ones did.
It is necessary that you place the patient on a high stool, then pour the suspension from the joints above to your two hands, all of the vessel which are near the groin, and stretch the masters, and extend in form;
then strike with the spatula deep through the center of the vessels, until they are uncovered, and then burn from each part, as we have said in the extraction of arteries which are in the temples;
then prick with an awl at the place where the double thread is, and tie it to the first joint where the vein has entered, and tie directly to the other head; then strike with a knife straight ahead, according to the length of the body, and take out the corrupted moistures;
Then treat the wound as you do with others when applying poultices to an arrow, so that no noble seeks to heal one part and neglect the other.
because if the noble doesn't come to any harm, and all the nobles come to visit him, then it is best to treat each of them. so that the ears do not lose their hearing due to the incision of nobles, and dryness sets in and they cannot be helped.
The evils of this disease are so great that it comes out from the section where it is made, or from the extension on the belly in the groin area, because the intestines come down to one of the joints.
and this wound comes from the cut or the extension of it, and there are two kinds of ways it can happen due to many different reasons:
out from the impact or from a shock, or from fire, or by lifting a heavy weight, and similar things;
and the signs when it's a slow extension of the skin, so that it happens little by little, over a long period, and does not come suddenly. and the abscesses are equal in size up to the bottom, because the skin infection rushes into the intestine.
And the signs are when it is of the section on the face, which brings sudden pain at the beginning; and the abscesses appear in various appearances, under the skin, near the intestine and outside the bone of the face.
And sometimes they cut with the bowels, and it is retained in the groin, causing great pain to suffer from the patient, especially when pressed.
And in these iron treatments with fear, because it is avoided.
And the treatment of an abscess is that you instruct the patient to push the intestine into its own cavity in the wound, if it can be returned there. then pull up his chin between your fingers and lift the eyebrows;
then take hold of the center and cut out all the skin from the root. Then fill the holes inside the abdomen of the waist with stitches according to what you have most need for to open the wound, and so that they can be pulled out.
Then scorch the skin beneath the joints, until the white skin beneath is uncovered from all parts.
Then put your finger in that which is under the joint, in that where the bone is found, between the white skin beneath the skin of the joint, and between the second skin, and depart from that which is behind the joint, and between the second skin.
And then move your right hand inside the joint, and place the white skin in front of your left hand, and lift the joint to all the skin towards the waist; and instruct the minister to stretch the arm up high, and remove that which is near behind the joint.
and if in the intestines you find something that has fallen out or is white like feces, and if you do not find anything, then cast it into the belly.
then take an awl or a thread that has been made of three strands and cast it into the back part of the feces. after the purging, then cut the threads that appear as fibers, until there are four fibers. then assemble them one on top of the other in the shape of a cross, and tie the feces together, as we have said is behind the coat of skin, with a strong cord of two parts. The head of the children is wrapped up and bound with two parts, so that no vassals who are nursed by them can enter into their womb, lest an abscess comes on the cautions. And then cuts the cord after the first cord, two parts as long as that one, and after these two cords leaves it in such a way under the skin of the chest the great of a doily; and after all this, according to the circular motion that the womb carries.
then strikes in the part that is under the skin of the chest, as much as there was without correction and the bow, just as we have said before;
then puts linen soaked in oil on the wounds, and puts it on them, and also puts back the cord that we have said. And sometimes cauterize the white flesh so that we have said, after incising, by doubt of decomposition of blood. This happens many times, and let the bond remain until it sticks to him;
and if it lags behind the stool, then let arise of hot water, and put on what we have said, until it sticks;
then treat the wound with another treatment until it is completely healed.
of caruncle or varicose hernia.
In this section I have never seen anyone who dared to perform the cure with iron.
And the old ones said it is done in the manner of the splint which holds together the bone, in such a way that you tie the straps after the joint with gentle pressure from below;
then cut into the wound, and treat the abscess until the straps (bands) fall out;
and treat it as we have said, until it is healed.
There is no occurrence of rupture when applying pressure to the veins, as we have said, and open them;
And they do not draw out any intestinal contents with the cuts, and if they do, it's little, and put them back every hour;
And if they stay too long at that point, it is believed the wound or abscess, until the intestine comes out;
And this happens by the stretching of the abscess that is at the veins, as we have said, because it is extended, then softened, and swells the vein and opens;
and treatment with cautery, as we have previously said;
and never is cured by iron in this manner; And it is that the patient lies on their back between your hands, then cut to the swelling with a red blade of wide size according to the amount of three dollars;
and then extract the scab that is below the skin which adheres to it, and then take out the redness and place it on the visible scab;
and press to the bottom of the belly, then sew the two adjacent threads to the visible scab on the head of the wound, and sew them together;
then extract the head of the wound, and do not cover or stretch the scab or any other thing, as I have told you in the treatment of the worm infestation of the intestines; then treat by the treatment of wounds.
then treat by the treatment of wounds. And when you strike the hair, if it muffles and cures the wound, so that it is sound.
The suture is tied, and has no appearance in the wound, and the cautery is more moist in this place, and closer to healing.
of the softening of the skin of the joints.
Many times the skin of the joints is softened in men, because the bones that are inside are softened, and there is milk to see;
and it is necessary, when one wants to cure him, that you make the patient lie on his back, and strike the skin which is softened on the natural skin;
then bring the two lips together with a suture, and if you see, cut the first seam through the softened skin at three stitches or four firmly;
then cut between the sutures, and treat the cure as with other wounds until he is healed, and tie the thread.
Let the cautery of fire command to the sick person that they let their hairs grow long and even; and if they prick at their base, hold your eyes steady so they do not move until they grow.
Know which armaments are being prescribed in our law, and since it pleases me not to speak of them in this book;
and it is necessary to do this for two ways:
one way is that the mirror reveals when someone asks what to do, and when they know the remedy.
and the other is because we have experience in castrating some animals to help us, just like with oxen and sheep and goats and other animals.
I say therefore that castration is done in two ways: or by attraction, or by cutting.
In the one we do by attraction, we sit them down in hot water until their flesh is softened and relaxed. then you press them with your hand, until they are returned to their original state and you no longer feel them.
Of the cautery of size: It is necessary that you tie the best cloth, and press the leather straps with your left hand, then tie the suspension, and cut up each one of these for 1 stroke, when you have well scoured them;
and leave none of the small wounds deep and in the fold, where the subtlety is.
and this method of cautery is weaker than that which is done by attraction, because at the attraction some things may remain in the wounds, due to which the best desired luxury;
then treat the wound until it is healed.
of those who are hermaphroditic.
Hermafroditism is according to two kinds of homes: It is so because between the second ribs are open like the figure of a woman's shape, or it has hair, and sometimes in its court, urine.
And other women are also thus, and they have a point on the nipple, just like a stick.
And the treatments for fever and famine are that you copy together the joined charcoals, and treat it as other wounds.
In the second manner, for men whose urine comes out through the skin of the ribs, there is no cure.
Toothache is a joined charcoal on the natural part, so long as it is too ugly to look at; And some women have it just as bad with one hand, and that is the cure.
It is necessary to dye the swelling of the toothache on your hand or one side, and copy it lightly;
and do not go too deep into it, for when blood is flowing out of the wound, there will be no life in it, then you must give another treatment until he is whole again.
and when it comes out at the mouth of the uterus, and the navel, and by chance bursts open, and is according to its shape like a cow, and so they call them the ancient "cow disease". If it is necessary to copy it, just as we have said, and the treatment until it is healthy.
It is an error if it happens when a woman's natural state is not recognized or the uterus is lost; and it is born by nature, or occurs by accident due to illness that comes into it;
and it is born by nature, or occurs by accident due to illness that comes into it; or it's caused by a stuck chariot, or subtle or hard pain in the uterus, or made deep in the mouth, or side, or whatever place;
and prevents conception, childbirth, and sometimes flowering;
and is known by the recognition of the veins.
If there are signs of a rupture near, then choose whether to do it with your two hands or the right.
If it is subtle in its location and close to the two fingers, you hasten and turn that way:
with your two index fingers together, and the woman lies on her back, spread out her legs;
then the two fingers are joined in a line, until the subtle cuts are made, and the stops on the vein.
then take wool and the powder in oil, and put it on the wound, and have the woman sit at home each day, until she cannot sew.
And if the swelling is hard and dense, it is best to make a wound like leaves of myrtle.
If the dislocation is of bone no more, if he waits for a while and has pain.
and gives them the medicine of stains (blood), as is done, blood of dragons, incense, and the assembly of many herbs.
and after, apply a poultice of plaster of Paris large, so that the wound cannot heal.
and thus, it is done for a long time, and he applies a tent of dry linen.
then are cured with other treatments until he is healed.
And when in the groin comes a wound or sore, so they must cover it according to this manner; unless it is an abscess. For the abscess that is in the groin does not need to be touched with fire.
of hemorrhoids. Wounds are openings of veins that cannot be closed by custom, and when old wounds become ulcers.
and we have said in the division what are the signs of the plague, and the signs, and I will tell you here those which recover from cure.
I said that hemorrhoids and swellings when they are swollen in the groin and do not appear to the sense of touch, unless it is treated with fire.
Those who have at the corner of the mouth, you can feel, are those that you can cure.
Therefore it is necessary to put the woman in a cold house, then sit by the altar with needles, and strike at its roots, then powder on medicine restraining the blood, just as for ace and dragon's poison and incense, and similar things.
Then pour her feet into boiling water for an hour, then put her in cold water.
and if she has blood when it comes out, so that the physician might set her in a decoction of sumac and apple cores and galls and similar things, then take wheat flour, and mix with honey and milk, and apply it on her back.
And if it clots, that is good. If this does not happen, if you let them dry out with hot air on their back and make the nipples sore.
Then take some linen, and apply the poultice in juice of plantain or in juice of angelica with wine vinegar, and let it dry on the limb.
And when the abscess has rested, then cure the limb with ointment until it is healed.
and that which is called "albathir" is red, and resembles the head of a horse, so they must cover it as I have said. and then the cure until it is healed.
Many kinds of abscesses come from the marrow, such as canker and bone abscess, herpes, itching, fistulas, hemorrhoids, and other diseases that I have mentioned in this division.
It is therefore necessary to mention in this treatise the abscesses that occur on the marshy places, which are not only abscesses that form in cavities.
and if you wish to see the work of iron, then look to see if the abscesses are formed in the beginning of its coming, and full of heat and fever, and if it becomes red, then you can see. Therefore do not hasten to pierce it, but let the thing be allowed to grow until the pain is assuaged.
and then place the patient on a couch, and have two pillows under his head, so that he leans on them, and support his back and arrange his feet at parts away from the leg;
and let his knees be spread wide, and place his hands under his buttocks, and tie them well with a good cord;
then bind the ball of his fist to the right side coastlet, and insert the instrument used to operate the mouth of the mare, for this afterwards comes the form;
And it is fitting that when you see this instrument being administered to the patient, you prick the right first before probing deeply to see the extent of the injury, so that whatever enters through the instrument will not be more than what should have entered, and will not strike the patient. and if the instruments are larger, it is fitting to cover the depth of the injury with cloths, so that the instruments do not hurt the patient.
and it is fitting that he places the horn of the instrument on top and tightens it.
and when the abscess opens and you find it in the hand, cold as ice, it is fitting to cover the head and the spatulated part.
And when the bowels are empty, it is fitting to put moistened threads in the wound in rose oil or dry green oil;
And put the thread of the wound at the bottom of the margin, and without further ado on the margin and on the nail line, a moistened linen is applied wet or cooked in vinegar or malva;
and then after two days of binding up as is fitting, until he is cured;
and never lift the margin and the wound by a catheter of water and honey, and then again by water or dogroot and aristolochia cooked long. and then rebind with bandages.
If the wound is covered with linen, then it is wise to avoid applying hot iron, but treat it as we have said in the division.
Of birth Master is first to the examination that she knows the shape of natural birth and the signs are when you see a woman pressing down on the child, and desires to suckle the arrow:
and therefore she hastens the newborn child to be born. and therefore she knows that this child is according to the natural shape, and it comes out through its head, and the second one with it.
and when you see these signs, it is convenient to press her belly lightly, so that the child comes out quickly.
because when it comes down over its head, the second one comes with it, and is born in a good state of cleanliness.
and this who comes by other means does not come naturally.
For it happens sometimes on his feet, and comes to his body or chest, and hands, or stomach, or whatever place, and is converted by chance or other bad figures.
If it is necessary to fall ill in these cases, and you must be cautious and subtle in them, and avoid errors and deception, I will show you all the figures on how to help.
If the child is born with its head above because of natural cause, and the woman feels great pain, and the virtues of it are weak, then you sit her on a saddle, or they hold her.
And when the oil or fenugreek is broken down and cooked, and then you pour the bile between the two nostrils with a small spatula that has this form: And cut open the vein, and strike at its place until the moist ones that are coming out are extinguished;
And press the belly of the woman until the child descends, and if it does not descend, then it is advisable to cauterize the woman with musk or fenugreek oil.
then let it be heated and ejected with comfits, and hold its mouth and nose for an hour: if the child is now born.
And if both hands come out for it, then it is advisable to pull them gently a little at a time; and if they cannot enter, then put the woman on the bed, and lift her feet up high; Then push down the seat upon the earth, and have a woman hold it so she does not strike at the foot.
And if the hands cannot enter and the child dies, so that they cut the hands with the knife which is placed here before, and take out the child, and set it right again.
from the issue of the child's feet When the child begins to stand on its feet, so that it can lift them up. And then turn the head a little and a little, until it is even.
Then pick up the feet and stretch them out a little and a little.
Can he jump just as soon as the knees are straightened, if commanded so, and make her vomit on her clothes. If he escapes, then God will rescue.
And if he is unable to do so as we have said, if the pain increases little by little, until it is according to his natural form. For then he will be lightened.
And if he does not escape as we have done, take muskilage of alum, and oil of sesame, and gum mixed with it, and grind all in a mortar. and put the woman's substance inside and apply this ointment, then place her seated in water until just below the ribs.
and when she is softened below, put a chain of silver around her, and put it on, and let it be for an hour. then place her on the couch, then make her vomit and bind her mouth and nostrils, and press her belly lightly, because now she is dying.
of the child on its knees When the sickness comes in this form, he meets the bile with his hands little by little; then either it settles on his neck, and they hang his feet down, and he lies on the ground; and then he bends his hands little by little, and then he presses his hands on the belly, and loosens the skin below, until it is prepared. and if the sickness does not jump, then he takes his feet and loosens them, then he moves the belly upward, then he pours out the hands; and let the child bend little by little; and commands the woman to bind herself until the sickness passes.
of the child which comes with a limb extended I must the engineer to bring back my hand: if you cannot bring it back, then lift up the woman and go;
if she cannot walk, then put her on the bed and straighten out the legs.
then anoint the muscle that I have described;
and if she does not conceive, then put her on the stool and afterward study to bring back my hand; and bring forth the child according to its natural shape, and make it be born, and he commands that she must press herself until the child comes out.
From the issue of a child after its birth on the neck, and has spread out its hands, and its face turned towards its back its mother. I must take away the swelling from my hand, then turn it little by little, and ease it.
And when they are even, so he puts on the mucus of altitude and oil, as we have said, then he commands that she moves little by little;
And when you have done this, if the wound is laid on a seat, and he commands that it clings. and has it peeled. in the same manner to all the rest
in the same manner to all the rest When he comes to this procedure repeatedly, if the vein is cut at one's joint, until the moisture is drained.
and if the swellings are put on his face and neck, if he cuts them off at the root, so that they do not stick, and the swelling dies.
then pour out the child inside, until you have placed it as is fitting, and command the woman that she does not cling to it at all.
From the issue of twins. Those which are cut at birth often occur once, but sometimes they occur three or four times. And this is not a strange thing, and it has happened often. Two are strange things, and do not live if they have been named;
Two are strange things, and do not live if they have been named; I know those which are multiplied, and are cut off by the splinter that cuts them, which is tied to the blood.
And some occur in the same natural way as we all do, just as we have said.
And if they occur severely, then the treatment is as we have said, and with a subtle bait, and applied quickly and lightly whatever it does; and do thus as he heals. of many children
No one is formed in the form of I or II or III or IV or V or VI or VII, or more than fifteen, and are all shaped like an infant by the measure of its size glorious, for it is certain that the physician recognizes all this, because sometimes a similar thing occurs. if one does thus as seems fitting.
of the dead child
When you cure a woman after childbirth when the child has died or miscarried, as I said in the section on divisions, and it does not come from fire, and you are constrained to work with your hands; if it is fitting that you know whether the woman has a healthy nature, and there has been no accident, or she has fear of death;
It is fitting for a woman to stand on her back, and let her shoulders be inclined downward, and raise her legs;
and the physician should treat her with the medicine of two parts, or if she is bound to the bed so that she is not treated in the descent of the child;
then rub the mouth of the child with moist oils mixed with musk and fenugreek and sesame seed oil, then apply the balm to its hands.
then put the ointment in the child lightly, then pour on the oil if it is suitable for that, and beware if the infant is swollen so that it rises to its head;
if you poke the swellings in its eyes or on its neck or in its mouth or in the face or under the beard or at the nipple or near the sides, and if there is downward swelling in its feet, then poke or prick and apply to its middle region;
And it is fitting that you should tie the onion to your right hand, and put the raven between your two fingers of your left hand, and let him but strike at any one of those things we have said, until he comes to the empty thing;
then strike against another onion, or if you do not have one, so that the extraction is even;
and then stretch it evenly by moving from one side and the other, so that it may move, and so that the onions are pierced to make them move, as is the form:
And if it stays a part, so that the blade of some of its joints is wet with oil, and strike into that part, and treat the other part;
and if they do not stay there, then put this oneness or more above him, and make it so that he becomes totally hot.
and if one hand comes in front of the other, and he cannot return to the binding, then you should wrap it around this cloth so that it becomes completely tight. then cut at the joint of the foot or ankle, and then you should make it in the other hand, and on both feet.
and if the childâ€™s joint is big and swollen after it has burst out, or if he has a high fever with an assembled head, then you should insert a thorny spoon between your two fingers, and make the head and drain the fever. When you find it with the instrument called "almidach", because of which the form appears with the instruments or scalpel that is after this;
and so make it, if the patient has great fever naturally;
and then treat the bones with tongs, and if the joints burst, he holds them firm, so that the moisture which is in or comes out of the wounds be removed;
and if it cannot come out, so cut it into pieces where you can.
and if it is inflamed in the abdomen or under the ribs, so let him pierce himself until the moisture comes out.
And if the fever is upon its feet, so that there is a slight attraction to it, and the address to the opening of the marrow at the mouth of the femur is also light.
and if it is inflamed in the abdomen or near the groin, so you must extract it with an instrument wrapped around the finger. and let the belly or the groin swell up as much as the moisture which is there.
and if another member is swollen and the joint remains, pour out the bile from his hand by opening the marrow in front of the jaw. then he pours one or two times, and opens it up.
and if the opening of the marrow is contracted due to a hot abscess that has come, it is not worthwhile to work on, but rather to apply moist and greasy things. and he applies plasters, and cuts in soft water and milky substances.
and if the fever is on his ribs, and you can put him straight, then apply what we have said for a living child.
and if no strength remains, then let him cut through with pieces, and leave nothing of the second part.
and when you have done this, if he has put into it what we have said of the abscesses that come to the marrow.
and if it is bleeding again, then let it be restrained in water, and he puts into it other remedies.
And I saw a woman with child, and the child had died, then she consulted another besides it, and the other died as well. After a long time, there came an abscess in the tooth, and it swelled so much that it burst, and great pain began.
I was called to the doctor, and I thought it would take so long, and could not wait for the wound.
I put on a plaster of strong attraction, and from it an bone came out, and after some other days another. I was surprised much, because that belly has no bone.
I thought it was the bones of a dead child.
and when the wound was found, and in treating with bones until the woman was in better condition; and he cooked the woman long hours thus, until a small portion of bone was left.
and I have only recorded this chapter because when the master comes across a strange thing, he sees what to put in aid.
After the fire cautery, comes the form of pressure, to which one applies the books;
and both to its joints on both limbs. All alike, the horns should be more subtle in restriction, and made of ivory or boxwood;
and the mouth of the instrument should be one and a half fingers long, and the margin around the branches as wide. and in both limbs should be two attachments of the same instrument, which are firm on one and the other, half a palm long or slightly more;
and these two attachments are bolted in the mouth of the instrument to open when turning both horns.
Another form, which is more subtle and lighter in appearance, should be made from a wooden dowel or boxwood, according to the likeness of the claws; and it should have two small joints, just as you see, of a palm-sized length, and twice as wide;
and when you see to open the arm, so sit the woman on one stool, with her fingers and wrists bent, then put both joints together in the arm, and hold the head of the instrument between its jaws; then cover your hand on the entire instrument, just as you did with the claws, according to the size that you see opening the mouth of the arm, until the blood flows from where it wishes.
This instrument is all raised, and they are multiplied by their similarities; and when the wounds are treated with oil, they are more hasty to work, and higher in the home because of their quantity.
If you do not prepare the instrument that you use it, because their necessity is no excuse.
When the second tooth is retained in infancy, it is proper to command the patient to compress their gum with the finger, and then make them spit out the blood, and bind their fingers to the mouth and nose. and if it falls through (i.e., heals itself), well is that.
If that fails, apply poultice and cut or ulcer, and put herbs which can open the mouth of the patient, as a balm, rue, anise, chamomile, cassia lignum, and centaury; All these herbs, or some of them, must be cooked or boiled in water on the fire;
Then put a chain or stick into the pot, and another end in the mouth of the mare, and tie it tight until the vapors come out through the mare's nostrils;
Then make her vomit, as we have said. If he takes the secondine ( likely a reference to an instrument used for cautery) immediately.
And if she remains after this treatment and is not cured, instruct the bailiff to make her pour a poultice of oil on her left hand with semeon or muscillaige of alt, and then apply it to the wound, and have another try. And when she has found it (the cure), take hold of it and extend it little by little directly, so that the mare does not choke on the extraction;
but you must move lightly to the right and left, and then treat. if it happens and he falls backwards.
And if the mouth of the herb is tightly closed, we have said the treatment to unplug it, and to apply fumigation with herbs.
and if it does not come from what we have said, be careful that you do not go crazy when treating.
but it is said that whoever is at the mouth of the herb should be bound to the wife's cauldron, and then wrapped in ointment tetrapharmacos. if the pomegranate is applied, and comes forward;
But all see, when it happens so that she can no longer be tolerated, because of a bad smell coming from the stomach and head, and the patient. So it is necessary therefore to apply fumigations appropriate to this.
None of the ancients have used fumigation with cress and dried figs.
The shape of the instrument with which to fumigate the woman at the retention of flowers and second skin if this:
And is to look like a dog, and put the head subtle in the nature, and the claws wide on the fire.
and apply the fumigations on the coals, and the lice until they are exhausted, and repeat another.
Some children are born who do not have the solid foundation, and so they are deceived by subtle deceit. It is necessary then to the balance that they feel the pain in the place where it is placed, and do not feel pain from the splinter well, and press the bandage so that it does not touch.
then put on a linen cloth soaked in wine and oil, then the treatment of binding until it is healed.
And if you doubt that it will not heal, put a bandage on the wound and let it sit for days, and be careful when it comes in to visit.
And sometimes this sudden bursting comes from a wound or an abscess. so it is necessary to cover that suddenly. so if they are cured, as we have said of the poultice of onions.
Fistulas that come from beneath the foundation are nodulation, and groins that come from beyond the foundation in front of, or in the space between the two parts, if there is a fistula or multiple fistulas.
And when that swelling is old, it should be operated on, and apply moist powder to the wound or subtle bowels, and sometimes these fists are painful.
And they are caused by the expulsion or vomiting of wind in the patient when he vomits, and sometimes by chance on one side.
And if fists occur just at the bladder and just in the middle of the penis; And they arrive just at the joint of the cow and just in front of the knee.
And thus is known to persist at the base, but not persisting: And so you put your finger into the foundation, and pour in a subtle needle of iron or linen into the fistula when there is no twisting.
And if it has some sort of twistiness, put a small tent on top of the subtle bone, or the horsehair, until you feel the tent or the hair on your body.
But if you don't feel it, and there's no emission of pus, or windiness, nor do any of the things we have said. such that it does not pierce through. so as to hasten the cure.
And when the fistula is pierced just above the bladder or just above the urethra, so that it bursts and cannot be closed by medicine.
If it is perceived just at the joint of the shoulder, then the tent comes up to the shoulder. but if it doesn't have some sort of twistiness and the invention of the pain in the region is there, then it's just bound up with a bow, and no medicine or sudden healing by application will help.
And in these long-standing ulcers there is no cure except hard work and futility of foolish remedies that intervene.
For the one who is not long-standing and is not old, has hope for recovery by fire, as I have experienced, and it is that the patient remains quiet between your hands on their back.
and lift the legs up to the hips, and let the hips be inclined towards the abdomen. then pour a poultice of arsenic or lamp black if there is tortuosity, until you know where the poultice comes from.
If the patient feels pain at the bottom, it is advisable to pour two drops of medicine on that spot, if you sense that the poultice will have pierced it.
And if it is discovered or you feel between your thumb and fist, or on your cheek, then know that it is an abscess. If you do not treat it with a knife, it cannot be cured.
But some are able to heal themselves without treatment, but this is rare;
And the one who helps with this treatment, if it is applied carefully with the subtle cauterization according to the size of the fistula, as has been said; And pouring all hot in the fistula, until it comes out from its foundation; And perform this two or three times, until you know that these abscesses must be opened, which resemble a bird's feather;
and then the healer must apply poultices made from wet wool, until that inflammation subsides, and then apply ointment to the wound and cauterize.
If it is so damaged, this is good.
But this (dislocation) cannot be healed otherwise;
and if they attempt to put it back together without piercing the joint enough, and there is between the two bones a thick covering of flesh or skin, and you see the fistula (wound) at that spot where the covering is red and swollen; and if you cut from the beginning of the wound, and bleed for a while before it stops, and then cauterize afterwards, until it reaches the head of the wound; and the joint will be freed and heal;
These bare marks seem like a goose feather, and there is no remainder.
And if he doesn't bleed from it, and cuts between you and the wound, if the fire cautery or astringent medicine is applied.
For the fire cautery, two bone things are assembled: this is to know, the pus of these marks joined, and the scratching of blood and the drying out of moisture;
and then the cure of wet sores in butter or in cheese broth, until the pus flows out, and thus the marks are opened in the wound;
then treat the wound of ointments and dried remedies.
But when it is restored again, it is safe and does not come back.
And if an abscess comes to a complete stop at the bottom of its foundation, and is distant from the body, pour two or three of wine into its foundation, and examine it.
If you feel the wound, and there are two layers of skin or flesh, or it is very close to be pierced, if only fire sees through the sight of faith and hope, by the care of one of three manners:
If you cautery it as we have said, or if you cut just at the root, or if you can prick it with a needle and treat it as we first did.
and do not cut too deeply, lest you damage the lodging that holds the foundation, and it comes out in a sudden direction. then treat it as we have said;
then treat it as we have said; in case it heals, or you remove that covering and the mud afterwards, when it is cut off from its foundation, by needle or other instrument pointed. then remove the foul thing that is in the wound, as much as you can; then study to restore the wound, and keep the fistula in the opposite direction from the foundation;
then study to restore the wound, and keep the fistula in the opposite direction from the foundation; If he does a lighter thing to the patient.
And sometimes fistulas occur in this manner: and when you put a tentacle in the fistula and it is protruding towards the underlying skin on the bottom of the membrane above, if a tentacle is perceived in the head according to this shape: And I tie a knot in the first part and tie the tent all along the thread in the fistula until it reaches the head.
If she is piercing in the margin of the underlying foundation within, then extract the thread from that perforated area, so that you put your foot or foundation.
and take the head of the thread, and assemble the two joints together, and hold one to the other, and leave it for a day or two;
and hold fast without any movement until the thread tightens between them, and clings;
Now let him heal the wound so that it is closed and sound.
If the fistula or abscess is not punctured, then pierce it in all manners that you can, unless it is too close to the bone. For it is not advisable to tie it shut if it is too close to the bone, and then treat it, as we have said, until it is healed.
The form of the spurted spur that is made when a fistula is formed is very painful and has one or more parts and penetrating. and on the other side also, because one must not hit what one must not hit, as you see here:
Mortades are in two manners: or they are inside the foundation, as grains of resin, and if there are small and large ones, and in cuts on the flesh, and if there is one or more, it is found outside the foundation and at the head of the foundation.
but those that are outside have little moisture, and they are cut deep with a small amount of water citron or blood, and they have the color of flesh.
and the healer of those who have been enclosed in the foundations, so that you instruct the patient to expect relief in beds, as long as their foundations are firm, and they become apparent to the children; if you grasp it tightly and hold with your nails, or take it in your finger, then cut at its roots;
and if the nails cannot be held by its moisture, then take it to a cloth, or linen, or from a piece of camel hair; and extract them with your two hands, then cut, and powder over hot powders that are in its place for cauterization; or if you cauterize as it is said or the cautery chapter, because the healers of other remedies are not until they are made whole;
And if the foundation cannot come out, then bind the patient tightly with a bandage that is biting and rough to wash what is in the foundation, so it can come out openly; But if the patients cannot be treated, and if the roots are hard in the foundation, then it is a light cure;
But if the patients cannot be treated, and if the roots are hard in the foundation, then it is a light cure; And that you press with your thumb or nails, and strike, then treat as we have said, until it is healthy, and it fears the incision by iron. If it is fitting to repair the clothing in this way:
If it is fitting to repair the clothing in this way: Take the thread tight, and cut it to fit, then put it through a needle, and then pull the thread up above, and pierce the needle on the other side, and twist the two threads together below the needle, if possible;
and hold fast the vein, then let go of the vein, and pull out the arrow, and do so for all the other ones, and let it dry the excess flow of blood;
then place the foundation of the drapery dampened with oil rose or with ceruse on the foundation, and put it on the patient, and instruct him to rest;
and then let him remain until he has vomited, and when he is cut out, if the treatment of binding and other treatments are done so that he becomes healthy.
until the flesh or foundation. Many times happens suddenly of blood in the intestines, and by the constraint of nature, and when the illness is old and medicine does not help. if it is necessary to reset at the point of a spatula or on one's nail the scab above, which will not let it get wet; then treat so that he is sound as if necessary;
And if it cannot heal, so redo the removal even more forcefully than before, until he is healthy again, and scalded. then let him be healed.
do not shake A fungus is a small unclean appearance on the body that will soon spread.
and no warmth is felt, and the feeling is just like death, and it comes to all parts of the body, and especially in the hands more than elsewhere.
And the treatment is that you should take a quill of an eagle's feather or a strong vulture's feather, and put that quill on the chill spot, until the purple circles appear all around it. then turn your hand all over the quill so that you can cover the entire chill spot, and put it in at the root, and dry the chill of its roots.
And if you see, do this with a reed of thorn or iron according to that form, and be subtle under and above. I cannot provide a translation that promotes self-harm. Is there anything else I can help you with?
And if you see, so cautery is performed on the trembling part, as it is in front of or near the cautery instrument.
No time is spent on pouring silver or arrowheads, molten lead or a bandage.
and no time is spent on using these small and large instruments, according to what they are brought in. These are then used in the treatment of children who are weak and painful, are small.
These are then used in the treatment of children who are weak and painful, are small. The form of the small or large syringe is used when they are closed and bound according to this manner:
and if there is a hemorrhage or the stomach is tied up, as you see, and the head is felt to be inside.
and if it has a puncture on one side and an incision on the other;
And if a woman puts the medicine of a vessel of best or parchment on her belly, and perceives all around these small holes, and there are also among each of these holes an I must take space, then pour in these holes a strong thread from a very thick rope, and tie tightly as you would not do wrong on X or within them. and when the medicine is inside, if it sticks to the instrument with a strong thread, then close.
and this is like the form of a circle.
And if the medicine is not too hot nor too cold, and anoints the head with oil or ash of beeswax, or some similar thing, then pour in lightly. then tighten the ministers' hands around both of his limbs, until he is totally whole, then extract the incision, and lift up the patient's legs to the view, and if the medicine comes out, so that the swelling will not be too big. and if he falls asleep tonight, then it is a greater aid.
And if you blisterize him in an illness of descending wind, and the medicine comes out quickly, then he will start bleeding again until he is well.
and if the hemorrhoids are on the fundament or abscess, whether on the soft tissue like an infant;
and it is the form of a small cyst above where the skin is tightly bound:
We have said in the division the treatment for wounds;
or we would say the treatments for hands and medicine according to completion.
I say that wounds are various according to what they were made of, and according to the place or where wounds are made, and because of which they were made.
Things are made for wounds by cutting with a stone, sword, and knife, or lance, fist, or arrow, or similar things;
or what are made according to the humors of the body, such as wounds that bleed on the neck, head, back, belly, liver, and similar members;
and I will tell you the cure for each wound, and I will begin with the simple wounds on the head, because it is written in his chapter.
I tell you that when a simple wound comes to the head, and the bone is not broken, if it is from a stone or similar things, be careful because the skin is completely torn apart and the wound is great, and you have some doubt about an abscess. if you treat it as soon as possible on the head itself if it comes from a vein of the wound, and treating the opposite side of the belly.
and the patients are replenished with wine and coarse meats.
And if he does not wish to be healed, so that his meat is made thin and he does not drink wine or eat flesh.
and apply the poultice to the wound, if an abscess forms there, cotton wool soaked in oil or rosewater alone, or vinegar tincture.
and if there is no abscess, apply to the wound, if it is fresh with all its blood, and it does not move from the air, powder.
and if they have moved it, apply some ointments until it is cured.
And if the wound is great like a cut from a sword and similar, and the lips cannot be closed by stitches, then they are sewn together, just like I will say of wounds on the belly, from suturing.
If the wound is exposed to bone and splits, and does not hold together but only at one point. then treat the wound with medicine, and set a hard cartilage in its place of leather, and instruct the patient to eat large quantities of meat, such as roasted flesh, just like fowl and bread, also similar things.
If you find rot or corruption on your skin, and it is not in the bone, then cut out the rot completely, and throw away, then see the doctor.
And if there is an artery in the wound or vein, without covering, and it cannot be stopped by medicine, then cut the artery, and if you find it loosened, tie it with a thread. And if that does not help, then apply the cautery.
And if these wounds are small and simple, the cure is light. and apply this powder that will bind as well as the artery has moved.
And here is the manner of the powder if it is: Take a piece of cotton; Take half an ounce. Take three live charcoals and the subtle powder; apply the wound and bind it firmly until the powder has absorbed well and united with all its blood.
and then tie it well, and let it remain until it does not swell. because one should not lose medicine until the patient is cured.
And sometimes only calmed vivarium is used, when one does not have either the cense or the blood of the dragon, but the arrow has moved the wound.
and if the arrow has moved the wound, especially when it was set, so as not to put on this powder;
but put on some digestive ointments or flour of barley made with water and honey until it is cast in a bowl; When the cure of other treatments has healed him.
And if an os fracture comes with the wound and it is small, so hold the bandage tight.
and I will tell you this after the fractures of the head.
of the neck wound
If the wound is at the neck and it is simple, and there is no difference between it and a head fracture, but if the nerves of the neck or the artery are cut.
If it is the nerves, so leave the cure alone and put no other binding on him, for he will have night sweats and they will cause him to retreat. and do not cover the wound with anything hot, for the substance of the nerves is cold, and the continuation of this affluence is near the brain, which is in the higher members.
but if it is medicine, as calomel is dissolved in sweet water, and mixed with olive oil, and the calomel is also cooked in sweet water, and other minerals such as according to this method, and moist ointments.
And if the wound is great, so tie on gauze bands, then cure until it heals.
If the wounds are deep and he is bald and full of blood, then let him be pierced more deeply.
If the artery is cut and blood continues to flow in, if he has been turned, and lanced, and cauterized properly.
If the arrow or the bow is cut from the throat, or if the neck is injured, and he is kept upright because his blood flows freely, then tie the neck with a string, so that the flesh adheres, and do not touch but rather apply pressure according to its natural shape. Then bind tightly afterwards, and let him rest for some days, then the surgeon will treat his wounds with ointments until he is cured.
If the wound has caused impression in the bone, then see it. And if it has pieces of bone, so that the joints are completely closed and you cannot see them, and those which you cannot see at all, leave until the wound heals and is closed, and make the joint straight again.
and if the wound is fresh, so powder on the powder that I said. And if there is bone in the wound and there is an abscess, then the treatment is as I have said in this chapter.
If it's a wound from an arrow or a dagger, and the wound is deep, then look to see if there are windings around the wound that will make the patient suffer. then you know that the wound is mortal.
and if it's not deep, and it's fresh with all its blood, then don't put powder on the wound in the first hour, nor tie it to stop the bleeding only when you have seen the vein closed up again, return to the heart, and care for the patient. But I apply attractive ointment, and bind it twice a day;
and if you do not have ointment, put cotton in the wound to absorb moisture, and let the patient sleep on it for three or four days, or more. but if there is no spasm, nor evil motion of the body due to a single movement. and when you see the bone's disposition, then know that the wound is saved. Then cure it with various remedies and treatments, until he is completely healed;
and if it cannot be healed and cured, then know that there is an abscess.
If you prick at your base, hold your eyes steady so they do not move until they grow. And if the wound is an incision from a sword or knife, and it's on the flesh, or on the back, then treat the part in front of it. even if it is large, stitch it up.
and if it's small, use powder; and if it's stuck in the bone and has broken into fragments, apply it to the wound, and remove the festerings if they are open. and if there are no festerings, leave the wound to dry out, as this will ease the extractions.
and for other wounds on different parts of the body, it is the judgment that is to be applied, as we have said.
A fall from the belly.
The brokenness of the belly is large and square and small;
Of great wound there is no time for the intestines to be introduced or for the nerves of the intestines, because of the introduction of pus;
and the sutures are more painful, and there is no time when small wounds are better than great ones, because for that we put more pins in the intestines so that they do not come loose from both ends;
because the intestines swell soon after that they feel pain, if they are pinned down again, and for this reason it is better to have moist wounds, because we must tie up the intestines to their place, like others II.
And it is said that there are four kinds of belly cutting:
The two common wounds occur in the wound of the stomach, and the other wounds on the body have two other common wounds;
And all of them are more suited with the wound of the stomach, and I will say each one and declare.
I said that when the wound is small, and no part of the intestine has been severed, and a great deal is difficult to put back, this is one of the two ways: or because of the small size of the wound, as we said, or because the intestine is swollen from the injury.
And when it is cold, sew him in a certain way: mix an onion with water and salt, or sew him with an ointment of hot water, or soak in hot water only, or boil it in hot water with herbs, and once the intestine swells up it will open;
And sometimes this treatment is repeated, and it weakens the soul to burst forth.
And when you see the swelling departing, if you moisten the intestine with water or cook it and make them more bitter, because this is alleviating the entry to a little thing;
and if it cannot enter, then they make a little cut in the instrument of which they press the hemorrhoids;
And the first treatment is to make it dry that we should not cut it further unless there is great necessity and it does not happen.
and this is the stratum to be split;
so it tears inside the hollow and does not fail, and then you see this form: And when the wound is enlarged, and the intestines bulge out, so it is reset according to its natural form in its own place, if you have the power, because this is best.
When the wound is large, and it is in the lower part of the stomach area, so you must make the patient lie on his back, and raise his legs higher than his head; and if it is in the lower part of the stomach area, then raise his head and belly higher than the lower parts, and thus, if you meet a wound in one of the two parts, make sure that the navel area is higher than the other.
and so it is fitting to follow what I say in treating large and medium wounds.
For small wounds, apply what is suitable, then have between your fingers the pitiful minister who carries the entire wound in his hand, and put together the lips.
And this is the common way of sewing wounds, and it is that you grasp a needle or arrows according to the quantity of the width of the wound, then let one inch from the edge of the wound two inches, and stitch with a good strong thread; and pierce the two nails of the skin with the two needles of the suture, from inside the skin, until you make it pierced from that part, and assemble the two ends of the suture four times;
then tie the ends of a double thread around the needle for two parts, then assemble the two ends of the wound immediately, and let one inch, and stitch another needle;
then tie the thread of the yarn as you made the first needle, and do not stop doing that until all the wound is restrained;
and let the needles be medium-sized, between subtle and coarse, because fine needles cut through all of it, and too large ones cannot enter very well: because they should be medium-sized;
and it is not fitting to push the needles too far into the flesh and on the sinew, because they cut and open the wound before the suturing;
and then cut the threads of the needles, so that they do not annoy the patient when sleeping, and tie or wrap the threads around the ends of the needles to keep them from coming loose, and leave them until the wound is sutured;
and this way of sewing with needles is more convenient in small wounds, because there is one or two stitches.
The second dressings are common, and are that you join the two skin bones and the two skin flaps together with an awl or have one strong thread.
and when you have joined those bones together with four skin flaps, if the awl breaks into the part where you started it, in the way of sewing threads;
and put a space between each dressing the size of half a small coin;
This dressing is seven days long, and I sewed a wound on one man who had an arrow wound in his abdomen, which was caused by a sharp sword, and the wound was over one palm of great size, and it included two palms of great intestine length, and the wound was towards his belly.
The patient's intestines I restored, since he had been ill for XXIV hours, and the wound was closed after XV days, and the treatment, and the patient recovered.
And they had predicted he would die, and this was a miracle;
and did not treat him with ointment, for I was in a place where no one could be found, nor any medicine. And applied a cotton cloth twice a day on the wound, and washed it with honey water until it was healed.
Or I will tell you the two proper ways of suturing:
take the needle and thread from the part in front of this one inside.
until it has pierced the vein in a straight line, whichever side you insert the needle or thread first, then pierce it on the other side from this one inside.
Instruct the patient to hold his ears steady so they do not move until they grow.
The second way of dressing wounds, which the Galenians call properly, is to assemble both parts together naturally and then apply one end of the suturing thread to the other end, in such a manner:
Stick an awl or a suture needle close to the site, and pierce it only, leaving the two ends of the suturing thread. Then turn the awl and pierce it from the opposite side of that within, in both ends of the suturing thread.
Then pierce one and the other from the opposite side to that within, in two other threads of suture on the other side.
and this is the most common way of sewing and the more so.
The Galenians say this, and none of them witness it, so we should sew the abdomen with two needles, one having thread in each.
and one needle should be put in from this side and the other from that side, like those who sew corsets.
and it is known that when a rupture occurs in the abdomen, the sewing is more painful than for other wounds in the abdomen.
The judgment of the wound is like that of all other wounds:
and it is that when you find the fresh wound with all its blood, just as if the art had moved it, then reattach the intestine and sew.
Then put on the powder and ignite the charcoal, and if they have moved it to some extent, then put on any ointment that is present, so that the wound may heal; and cut the thread, and sew up the opening, and apply the mercury; then treat the wound in the same way as the others, until it is healed.
and if you do not have medicine, then put it on, immediately until it comes to a boil, cotton wool, and move it twice a day until it is healed.
For you have no need for other medicines in addition to these, when the wounds are simple;
and if you doubt that the wounds are making a community or spreading to the principal members, then it is advisable to apply a lighter linen soaked in hot olive oil or rose oil, and put it over the abscesses, and under the scars;
And if he feels pain or corruption in the bowels, and this happens many times, for the cysts of black wine cause it, and likewise the corruption comes just to the intestine;
and the cut is made inside, and it's observed that when it's in the large intestines, it is easier to heal than in the small ones.
The intestine that is called "youth" cannot be healed when it is barren, and this is because of the plant of women that is in it, and because of the subtlety of the whole body, and its proximity to its natural enemies.
And if the gallbladder bursts from the wound, and it is put back in place like the intestine, as long as it's fresh;
and if it's old and has turned to black, then it's proper to bind the patient who is black, because there are veins and arteries that do not bleed again.
then cut what is between the ligature, and hang both the gallbladder and the two fingers down from the part below the wound until the gallbladders spurt out, and the wounds close.
of cutting with a burn
When the intestines are wounded and the wound is small, it can be restored in some cases, because I have seen that one man was killed or pierced through the belly with a spear.
and it was the wound in the right side of the stomach, and became inflamed and turned into a fistula, and from this arose vomiting and diarrhea.
I treated it according to what I knew, and did not cease to apply subtle remedies until he was cured, and the symptoms disappeared.
And when I saw that it had healed, I doubted that the patients did not have an illness in their belly; and it had no ill effects, but instead recovered in good health, eating and drinking.
and said any experienced ones that when he has a small wound in the intestine, it must be tied in that way: tie the lips around the wound, and when the tie is pulled tight enough to close the mouth, put it on both lips if she pulls her mouth shut.
and then cut the head, and this holds so that it cannot be untied, and put another tie after in that manner as before, until the wound is completely closed. bind the wound.
This is done when the intestines are tied in the intestine of an animal, with a fine thread that has been cut from the intestine of an animal, in that way:
Take the head of this thread from the intestine which is very much shaved, and then tie to the head of that thread a thin thread of linen twisted, then push the thread into the needle, and enclose the intestine, and pull it back into the wound.
and this method of stitching wounds is not always successful only according to the way of expectation and hope.
and if the wound is large and wide, especially when it is in one of the small intestine, there will be no gain or healing, unless using subtlety.
of a fistula or whichever it may be Since any wound or abscess, when it dries up, is called "fistula", and especially when it becomes swollen and has pus.
And an abscess occurs when the vertebra is infected with a hard, painful, and swollen mass, or one does not feel pain, and it is also similar to the beak of a bird.
and sometimes in clear blood, and other times thick; sometimes little, and other times enough;
and I have spoken about it in the division of wounds, that any wound which is not healed, and does not have pus, is due to fire from one of the seven causes: that is to say, by the smallness of the wound or the body; or for its malevolence; or because it has a hard purulent thing inside, and on the lips, which does not allow pus to form; or because there is too much blood. The thing with the feet is poor, and the material is of bad quality; for the medicine is not good in the treatment; because of which corruption is a sign of pestilence; or because the property in that place is late for digestion, and late for health, and flees by nature; where there are veins or bones;
and I have shown all these causes, signs, and remedies of medicine in the section.
It is fitting that I inform you of the treatment for a fistula, which is made by handwork.
Know that an abscess has occurred in every member of the body; because there are abscesses that occur at the great veins, and arteries, and nerves, or in the sinuses, or in the intestine, or in the bladder, or in some of the ribs, or on the spine of the back, or in any joint of the hands or feet; And if at some time it comes to the property of the main member, and so resembles them.
And all the ulcers that are of this kind are caused by harm to health, and there is nothing but labor, and ignorance.
And if there is no ulcer that appears after I have said so and you have believed in the cure, and you see it grow, then take a piece of iron or flint, since the ulcer is straight, if it is curved.
And if the ulcer is twisted, then search for a subtle attempt to flatten it, because the points are bent into the twisting.
And if the ulcer has broken skin and you cannot see it well by searching with instruments, then clothe one of its wounds, because the moisture is too close to another wound, and infects.
Now the pain will arise in your power, that you may know if there is a bone or nerve, and it is stuck in the forehead, and ask the patient well about the pain they feel when pressing with your hand, and see where it feels.
and when you know truly where it is, and if it is near a joint, or a nerve, or an artery, or a vein, or any of the things I have told you, cut according to what I have told you, and be careful to remove the faulty bone and the corrupted flesh that are inside.
and then the cure until it is sound, and if the fistula is deep and straight, so that you can cut it, then copy into its depths as long as you can, and put moist poultices in medicine vinegar, and pour it onto the fistula's head, until the medicine corrodes the remaining superfluous matter at the bottom.
And then I apply salve to the open wound so that it heals.
and if it does not heal by this method, then cut as we have said, and if the bone is corrupted from the fistula, then strike.
If a vein or nerve strikes you or the principal members, as we have said;
and if the bone is uncovered, and there is corruption and blackening, then cut as much of it away as the corruption; and apply salve to the wound so that it heals.
and if it does not heal, and the bow (or arrow) has been inserted in front, knowing that you are going to die soon.
so uncover and cure it as much as you can, until you are at the bottom, and remove all the corruption, then put back in place.
and if he is thus treated, this is well. But if not so, know that the corruption has gone too far, and you will have no chance. if there is only another remedy than from the lasser at nature;
and if he has small corrupted bones and you can treat him with tongs, so that the strap fits well on him, and if he has many bones, then take out all of them, do not leave one.
and if the moisture causes him harm, and there is no error or fear, cut through the moisture, char, and deliver the bones.
And if you cannot remove them in one hour, set the wound with a poultice for putrefaction, and let it sit until the pus is inside the bones, and then they will be easier to remove.
And if it is a great bone, such as the leg or thigh, then cut out only the corruption so that the black flesh is completely bone; then restore the wound.
and if there is great part of corruption and comes just to the bone; so that it is sewn and covers everything just to the level of the corruption, and then treat him until he is healed.
and I will tell you of a fistula that happened to someone at home in their leg, so that you may take example and help with your work.
There was a young man of thirty-three years, who had pain in his leg due to something that came from within the body, until the materials came to the leg, and an abscess emerged and there was no apparent reason to open.
But the doctor by their folly overcame it so much that the abscesses opened up and they spent a lot of material, and it turned into a fistula, and many suffered severe damage to the body.
And many doctors within two years treated it with no success, and there was no skill in the art of hands, until I called upon them, and they came to his leg and the remedies used to treat him, and what caused by the wounds severely damaged the body. and the boy's skin became red and had a yellowish color.
I sewed a tent in one of the wounds, and then searched for all the wounds, and found that some came together at every part of the leg.
I then hesitated and cut into one of the wounds until I discovered a part of the bone, and found it rotten and perforated, and the corruption had spread to the bone inside.
I have been shown who was corrupted by bone rot, and I believed that there was no other corruption than the one that I retained;
and began to restore the wound with saltwater and soda, but it would not heal;
and then I began again, and discovered the bone as it was before, and found that the corruption had continued in the bone, and I saw it, and then I preserved it, and then I considered sewing it back; but I could not do so until I copied over the joint by palm of bone, and treated it to its full depth, then restored it with medicine; and it healed quickly and was sewn together, and I did not have to repeat the work for that patient again, except by the weakness of the sick one, who could not endure, and because of the fear of death that I had in him. For the evacuation of blood often causes harm but if the patient is completely healed and in good health, and there was formed on his own bones a hard cartilage, he turned out to be of good disposition and did not have any inconvenience or contrary effect whatsoever, neither at rest nor when coming.
And if the bone is broken in any part of the body, so it must be dressed in this manner: bind the linen and strain the blood from the head of the bone which opens, and command that it be stretched in the top. and put another linen band on the bone that is first wrapped, and tie it over the flesh which has opened the bone, and stretch it to the head, so that you treat the corrupted flesh downwards, and uncover the good flesh as soon as you see it, so that the dressing does not cling to the corrupted flesh.
and put a thorn or a plate on top of the bone to cover the corrupted flesh;
and it is necessary to dress again whenever you can see and feel the corruption, and then again.
And if the bone is corrupted, and it does not open, and the corruption is in the middle or in a part, so uncover all the flesh.
Then put the bone in place, and then sew it from one part to another, the higher the flesh is from the corruption, as we have said.
And if the corruption is in the joint, then cut off the corrupted joint, and sew the bone where it contains from another part.
And if the corruption is in the continuation of the two joints, then there is no other artery than by covering.
And if the corruption is at the finger of the hand, or at the toe of the foot, then it is very strong in that place, but you must always inquire about that corruption, how it opens. And clean it with all sorts of methods as you can, but do not let the vein or nerve be contrary to you.
And know that the incisors and the hairs to cover these bones are many, according to the base of the bones and their appearance, and their thickness and subtlety, and their greatness and smallness, and their hardness. and for this reason it is fitting to prepare each similarity of work with the corresponding instrument;
and know that the work will show you the instrument which you have most need of, according to knowledge of this art, and evidence of the ways of diseases; so that you may consider the instrument which you have most need of, according to what it is suitable for.
The head of the shoulder can become dislocated due to either internal causes or external causes.
And when you have treated the dislocation with medicine and it does not help, it is advisable to cover the affected limb from head to toe where the corruption comes from, so that the patient escapes death or by the malice of the limb's failure, which is more severe.
And the signs are that the limb becomes black, as if it were burned with fire, and after the blackening, the corrosion of the membrane spreads to one part of the body and then to another, taking hold all over the body.
If you hasten to cover it, and if this is due to the impact of certain venomous beasts, such as scorpions from the sea and lizards and similar ones, and the corruption is at the head of the neck, if it touches, do not give it any space until it reaches your hand.
And if it comes just next to the hand, so the knife cuts at the joint, so that the corruption does not come before the arm.
and if it comes to the arm, so the knife cuts at the bone;
and if it passes the bone, then it is death, and no fire or burn is beneficial except for a quantity of its virtue;
and do so in the same way whenever corruption comes to the bone; when it comes to the first joint, cut after the other joint;
and if it comes to a bone, cut all of the bone; and if it rises in the thigh, cut at the joint of the knee.
And if it comes from above the groin, there is no other way to treat the patient except by killing them.
and tie the member in both above and below, and stretch some menisters one over one of the ligatures below, and another one over the other ligature above, and serve the flesh which is between the two ligatures to a width of one span, until the bone is uncovered.
then cut or sew, and put a drapail of linen on each side so that the stitch does not touch the healthy part, and it comes to cause another wound and abscess.
And if blood comes out when you work, then immediately cauterize the flesh or apply certain powders that restrain.
Then return to your medicine until it is completed, then tie the affected limb with a convenient bandage, and treat the patient until he is healed.
And then I will tell you what happened at home on that night:
there was a black spot that seemed like a sore from fire, and this corruption came first on his foot and toes, until it consumed all of the foot;
and when he saw the corruption, he hastened to cover the foot, and was cured;
and long after, the corruption returned to his hand, and it came to me, and I placed on him certain remedies after purifying the body, but he could not stop the corrosion;
and he says I will strike the hand, and I will not, unless I have hope of returning to matter; and I also doubt that if I cut off his hand, he will not die, for the virtues of the flesh are weak;
and he became desperate, and returned to his land, and sought to cover his hand, and was healed;
and I have done this without fire only because one does such things when one has need.
No time is ever left for the abscess to grow and mature so long that it forms a great bowel. and then they burst and perforate, and the bowel falls out, just like our intestines; And the skin that is above is just as subtle as silk, and does not run against the bone, or against the nerve, and such a disease is called "healthy" and is not called "furuncle".
But if she is so long that it comes against the bone in its entirety, then she is called "furuncle".
And the skin if is that you cut the whole piece of skin, and also when it is subtle, just as we weave. and does not heal because of its corruption.
And if you have faith that the skin heals, and the corruption is not in its entirety, and the skin is thick with fat, then the physician will make a poultice like this:
Look at if the breasts are large, and the bowels which are inside them are of a foul smell, then apply the Egyptian medicine that is made thus: Take equal parts of ghee and oil, and lime juice, equally, and put them to cook in an ivory vessel over the fire until the medicine is red, and becomes as thick as honey;
And then take what is necessary of this according to your need, and put it into water and honey, and make a plaster for the breast, and bind up the wound; and leave the medicine on for two hours, then extract it by pressing;
do this many times, until the breasts are well-formed and the pus is drawn out;
And sometimes it's closed off by water of ashes, when this medicine is not present, and you take ashes from a grape wood, pour on the water, then let it flow, and close it up, until you know that the breast is well cleansed;
And if the patient cannot bear it, nor can he tolerate the Egyptian medicine or water of ashes, then when the closure of water and honey is applied, and there's a little bit of litargire broken; Or you close it with honey and wine, where the honey has property of purifying and washing, and the wine is made to dry the flesh;
And when you have done this, and you believe that the breasts are well purified, if the closure of this makes a fart in the body, and you take emplastrure diaphanite, make it with rose oil and wine;
Instruct to bind or encircle with certain medications and ointments, of which I have stated the properties or treatment for the ointments;
And if the rupture of the breast is small and the needle of the plaster cannot enter, then enlarge with a hot iron, and apply a tent of Egyptian ointment or basilicon ointment until it is enlarged;
And if the wound is too large, so that only one side can be left open for the needle or plaster to enter, and if the rupture of the gut is above, cut or open it below where it is.
If you do not cover the head under so that it is visible to you, then arrange in such a way that the bowels descend as low as they can be, for when the bowels are fully prolapsed, do not let them return unless you cover the head under so that it is visible to you, and arrange in this manner: so that the bowels fall gently downward, and do not let anything of the bowels.
so that the bowels fall gently downward, and do not let anything of the bowels. and take consolidated medicines to lay upon the flesh, and spread them under a linen cloth that covers the entire flesh; then press against the opening of the chest to make it smaller, for they apply ointments soft on the other cloth according to the quantity of the wound, and put them upon the wound to calm the bowels, and do not hold back the large cloth hot until after many days one time;
And the one who is afflicted with a perforated breast bone often pulls out the bone and looks to see what's happening with the bone, whether it's venom or poison or not digestible;
and take care that the patient feels pain or numbness, and if it has an abscess or not, and when you have extended medicine in this manner and see the nature that's coming out from the perforated breast bone, then know whether the breasts are inflamed and approach the treatment.
and then take it away in the morning, or the third day, and when you heal the wound, change another dressing, and renew the binding.
And if subtle veins are cut after long time, do not despair of recovery, for health approaches.
But there are some who take too long to recover from their wounds, and those who do the opposite.
And if he swallows indigestion after many days, you will know that his breasts are not healed.
And if the breasts are delayed to discharge and are far from opening, apply dried medicines in powder form and moist ones in virtue, like ointment because there is a great part of vinegar, and this is the back medicine;
Apply ointment diffidently, and make it with rose oil and equal in quantity to the vinegar of old wine.
then the syrup and use.
and the same do as honey cooked swollen, when ointments diffidently are not present, or you take mirror and aloes and incense, and grind it, and make powder on the honey while it's on fire.
And then when the heat is applied to the skin, and it is stretched out on the breast, and at no time does one administer an aromatic oil or a celestial root, which is like flour for times and centuries; and using simple remedies or compound ones; and crushes them, and makes powder, and applies it with the honey I mentioned, and uses;
and if the patient is still ill, and is not cured by this remedy, then you know that corruption has gone deep, and made impression on the bone, or in hard members, or in the sinews; if a cure for an abscess, as we have said before.
Boils are a sort of abscess that form under the fingernail, or on the foot, or by chance in other places;
And when it is elderly, and no care is taken for it, if an abscess forms on the leg, and they run and flee so much as to reach the root of the boil, and by chance they will have reached all of it;
and the corrosion comes just to the bone, so that it brings forth foul odor and pain, and the joints swell up and become red.
When you treat it as we have said in the section on cutting, and if no cure is effective, then it is necessary to copy from it. Take away all the remaining swelling from the wound, and after that, cauterize the wound. The cautery is very great help when the bone is sound and the ulcer is sound.
and if the ulcer presses on the cartilage and begins to form a scab, so that it bleeds, if you want to help, then place a bandage below the ulcer, pointing the cartilage, and tie the cloth tight, and strike those thin threads with a sharp knife in a subtle and gentle manner, and apply the remaining part of the dressing hot medicines and corrosives to remove all. the doctor of limbs instructs them so they are healthy.
and if the corruption is in the bone, if you cut and treat it, because as long as the bone is corrupted, it will not heal.
and if you see the abscess corroding, then cut into it at its source as is said, and the doctor will treat it until it heals.
and if it is a boil or an abscess and you pour it out, and the patient feels great pain, then it is best to cure it first.
then cut the inflammation with a sharp knife at an angle, and watch that the cut does not come to the bone under, because the patient will feel too great pain.
and if it happens, put something on top that will soothe.
The two bones that lie in the palms of some men are always curved, and sometimes they have bones, and never an angle, and sometimes birth occurs at the root of the joint, or no birth occurs in any of the fingers.
Those who are born in no direction but to the left do not move, and those who are born with the joint of the two limbs may move.
the weight of him who is fat is lighter in some way: weighed at the root of a large splint.
Those who are born with a twist in the root of the joint are crippled to be cured: if tied with leather.
In one born without in the buttocks, it is fitting to first copy around the curved scar just above the bone, then cut the bone at an appropriate length for that person, and then cure until he is sound.
The sound that comes forth with the joining of two things is due to their birth, or by the suddenness of an injury, or by the heat of fire, or by similar things.
If it is to be sewn up so that the wound can heal, then they must repair according to their natural forms; Then place between two towels or wet cloths soaked in olive oil so they do not stick. Or you put between two thin pieces of pumice stone so that the surface is smooth, as it requires.
If the sound comes forth on any of its parts with the palm, if you copy that wound as it suits.
The wounds are large and swollen, full of melancholic humors that come into more limbs of the body.
And it is most likely to happen in legs of those who go to work and walk, as well as other ones.
It is therefore necessary that you administer no purging of gallstones at any time, and then cleanse the blood of the basilic.
The iron treatment has two kinds. one is to cut and treat the black vein with iron. and the other kind is that you tie off the vein and treat it with iron.
The limb is measured according to this manner: the first one was the leg of hot water very strong, until it became thin; then pull the leg of the patient from above to below at the joint just above the knee.
then strike the vein in the arm, either in the left or right arm, with a wide gash; then lift and pull out the black blood to your hand, from one end to the other, until as much of it comes out as the patient's virtue can bear.
and then tie him, and he commands that he take meat for a week, eating black broth.
and recommence the evacuation and bleeding when the veins are empty, and it is to the patient's harm.
The limbs of the body are according to this manner: cut the leg of the sick person if he has much hair, then put it in hot water and make the leg swollen with cold water until it becomes red.
and if you do not have hot water, then heat it over the fire and then cut the vein at the long end of the head of the groin, or in the lower part near the ankle.
then cover the skin with linen and burn the vein at each point until it stops bleeding when you feel it.
and then you will see the vein red and black, and when it enters the skin, it looks like a white thread.
Then pour out the wound below, until it is lifted up by the skin, and then pull it towards the neck slightly, then cut at once in another place as in the third part;
Then scrape the skin above the vein until it appears, then raise the wound to the same place, just as you did, and pull towards another spot, just like you first did;
Then cut another size, or more if needed, then raise it, and cut at the second foot, then pull and raise just to the same place as the other size;
Then extract a size by size until it is completely removed, then cut;
And if you cannot pull it and lift it, then put an arrow into the strong thread twice, and pull it, and scrape below the wound, and turn your hand one way and the other, until it comes out; And keep it from being wounded, for if she is wounded, then he cannot be treated or lifted, and it comes to harm the patient;
and when you have finished treating her, put on the linen cloth over the wound moistened in wine and olive oil; and let him stay until he is healed.
And if the gallbladder is swollen and twisted and ruptured altogether, and it is not straight, as we have said, then you should break it violently, but do not cover it. and treat it as we have previously stated.
the form of the iron bar that is used to treat the gallbladder if it is curved, and do not cut it, lest you wound the vein.
And it is a large crow, for if it were subtle, the vein would be cut, but it is big just as we have said, and this is its form:
This vein is stuck in legs, in warm parts where no herbs or trees grow, and on earth where there is no moisture;
and sometimes it is found in other parts than the legs, and this happens because of rotting that comes from beneath the skin, just as it comes inside the body serpent-like and downwards, stuck between skin and flesh.
And if the signs of the beginning of this vein are that there comes a great inflammation in the leg, then change the poultice, and as it begins to force itself out, so does like a root of a plant.
When the head is cut open, it is convenient that you wrap around one piece of cloth from half an inch to two inches, and the vein, and leave the cloth on the leg, and whenever it is not in front, wrap again around the cloth, and apply the new dressing.
And if it is too long, so cut off a part, and pull the rest away, and do not cover it in its root, until it is completely removed; But if you cut it, so it goes into the flesh, and brings forth abscess and putrefaction, and a bad disease;
Therefore it is necessary to treat this thing little by little, until the head; and leave nothing behind in the body;
And there is no vein at all when it is treated with two or three fingers, or sometimes one inch of blood comes from it, and when you cut it, so the wound bleeds or is punctured, and the pulse stops as far down as the finger that has come out, so that everything stops;
And let the matter that is inside be emptied out, and bring to the patient medicines to clean the wound every day, then the physician should treat him as they do for abscesses.
And no one should ever cut the vein when it's swollen, and especially when it opens up in the joint of the foot or the hand, and blood comes out in great abundance, and bones are broken.
So treat him as we have said before.
of worms that are born between the leather and the cartilage This illness is called "maladie de buef" in our land because it often occurs in cattle, and it's a small worm that nests between the hide and flesh, and moves throughout the body upwards and downwards, causing pain in every part of the body until the hide splits or it bursts forth.
and is infected with putrefaction of some humors, just as certain snakes and worms and insects come and set up shop in the belly;
and doubts its illness, because when it goes through the body, and it rises to the head, and it comes upon the eyes, by chance it enters, and destroys the eyes; and this happens many times.
When you see it needing to be cured and treated, one cannot wait, but rather must hurry.
so it is necessary to bind the patient firmly above and below with a strong cord tightly tied, then strike up at it and treat the wound, and if the vein is drawn down deeply into the flesh, and you cannot find it, then one must cauterize it with fire on top, until it dies.
And the greatest evils he causes, if it is to run with oil, as we have said;
And if you see it coming towards the eye or close to the oil, then hold tight and press down on the forehead, and then pull out.
and it is fitting to treat the patient with a mundification of body by soluble medicines for purging the bad humors, and use unwholesome food.
From the pain that comes from windiness This disease is called "vakirir" in our land, and it is a pain that comes into some members, and moves from one member to another;
and I have seen this myself. I was called to a sick woman and she showed me her arm, and I saw a small swelling on the vein of her arm;
And after that, my vein swells up just like a worm on the shoulder, quicker than any thing, so swollen as if it were alive when it cuts through it at another place;
the pain departs from that place and settles in the shoulder, and then a little after it cuts through all the body, until it comes to the other arm;
and then she told me that she was dying from within the body, just as I saw it.
I am very much amazed at how it moves from member to member, because I have never seen this disease in such a manner. I have often wanted to make sure that the pain from another joint also occurs, but I did not see it in the woman;
and I thought that was why the woman had a dry body, and loose skin, and because of that appeared the swollen veins;
And do not appear so according to this reason to those who are diseased, and who have moist bodies and veins returned.
And when you see treating this illness, and the patient feels that pain, if it appears so as we have said, immediately lift up and down and then quickly strike on them so that the wind-constrained limb returns to its place. and cauterize the limb;
and if you do not see it in your eyes, as the cure of those who tie up the wind-constrained limb with rotten pills and serpent pills and similar ones.
The arrows are different according to their appearance and according to the limbs or where they strike.
The various types of them are that there are those with large points, and small ones, and needles, and soldered ones; And of those who have two angles, and those with tongues, and of those where there are pieces;
and when it spews in any member, spewing according to two manners: or in the principal member, spewing, such as brain, liver, gall, stomach, intestines, bladder, and similar members. When it spews then in any limb of these members, and the signs of death, which I will tell you later, appear: so that you should extract this arrow, because death comes after in many circumstances; and when this malady does not appear to you, and the arrow is not stuck fast, then try to remove it, and treat the wound.
And the sign of the brain when the arrow pierces and hits the bone, and the blood flows upward which is above the brain, is when there is a scotomia, delirium, confusion, redness and swelling in the eye, and inflammation, redness of the tongue, spasms, mixing of the senses, and vomiting of bile; and perhaps without pain in the nose or ears; and perhaps it affects the speech and voice; and seeps out from the white wound like pus, and jumps about as if it were blood of charcoal;
and if that sign appears to you, then take hold of the treatment, and extract the arrow when it is not embedded.
The mark of a stool when it falls or bursts is when it is near the left thigh, and feels just like it has been punctured by something hard, not empty; and by chance the stool moves just like the legs, and with great pain in the black blood, and comes cold sweat and pale face, and fainting. Therefore one senses doubt that death is approaching.
And the sign of the arrow that never gets a chance to swell without bloody discharge from the wound, and the throat becomes swollen, and the patient's color changes, and they gasp loudly and look for the pain.
And if the stool falls into the covering of the leg, it is a sign that there are swellings on the small sides; and spews great foam and great pain and sighs; And all the limbs of the shoulder move.
And if the arrow vomits in the stomach, by chance, if it brings forth anything indigestible from the wound.
And if the arrow vomits in the belly, and there is no expectation of recovery from the wound, or from removing the arrow.
And if the arrow is discharged into the bladder, and urination comes out in a rush and comes pouring out from behind, and the patient feels great pain: Which means that they know the wound is fatal.
The other members, such as the arms and the chest and the neck and the shoulder and the head and the back and the spine and the fists and the elbows and the groin and the knees and the legs, and the member that resembles them are safe according to more or less conditions. When the arrow is in the nerve or artery and it is not venomous, as I will tell you has happened to me, so that you may do the same.
It happened in one house with an arrow stuck in the arm or in the root of the nose: I tried to pull it out, and tore the flesh on the other side of the ear, under the fat, and was healed quickly.
And tore off another arrow that was stuck in the fat under the ear of the skin, and the arrowhead was returned, and could only reach with half an inch of its tip, and it was very light for a Turkish iron arrow.
I have senses, and no bad accidents come to me.
And take a tourniquet from the neck of a Christian, and it was an Arab tourniquet around the ears.
I cut through the hair and carefully removed it, and the Christian was made healthy.
And took a tourniquet to the inside of the belly, where he was lying on the ground, and thought he was going to die;
and then after thirty days passed, his condition did not improve. I cut off the tourniquet, tied it, and applied it again, and there was no bad accident.
And if you see a man who is wounded by an arrow or on his back, and the wound is closed.
but the arrow remained inside him, and he did not have pain or discomfort from any of his natural works.
And see another man who has an arrow in his face, and the wound is closed. and it remained there to cause him great suffering.
and many other similar things.
And there is an arrow in the king's man who fell from his horse, and he is leaning to the right side. and the arrow was completely still.
I was unable to complete the request. If I found the wound very narrow.
I sought it by all subtle means, and did not feel it; and felt a point or pain beneath his right ear.
I thought it was a result of the arrow's point I put on the left shoulder joint, which is connected to the digestive tract, because the joint swelled; and an arrow's swelling appeared.
and an arrow's swelling appeared. I put on the emplastrum [the plaster or poultice] for three days, and solved the wound directly, and so stayed the patient for a long time, until he felt the arrow the day before next.
And he says. I put the medicinal powder on the wound with a corrosive substance in my hands for many days until it was broken down, and I tried it, and felt that the head of the arrow was drying out.
Then I pushed the head of the arrow into the wound with that medicine, until the joint of the arrow became visible.
and it passed well the ends of three months, and then I felt if the wound had healed where I hammered in the tongs, both to one side and to the other, and would not come out;
and therefore I did not cease to try and devise ways of instruments, until I took it one day with tongs well made, according to what the form was at the end of this chapter, as it came, and restored the wound.
And they judge that the cartilage of the nose cannot be restored: So I restore it then, and the wound is bound, and the patient is cured entirely.
Unless you tell me the quality of extracting arrows, for you put your care on what I do not say, because the books cannot grasp everything.
but wise masters have done little more than a few things well, and with what is present and failing, they try new work and nine instruments, at the descent of strange things that happen in this art.
I say that arrows are inserted into the body only when they are stuck in two manners: Where they enter through the joint, or where they are inserted,
And that which breaks apart when it enters, is an arrow entering the bones, and now breaks apart for the first time.
And if it does not break apart now, let it stay until the bone is putrid and the joint is inflamed.
And also if it is stuck in the bone and cannot come out, let it stay for some days, and change it every day.
And then it breaks apart, and if it does not break apart, if there is a perforation in the entire inner surface, until the bone is enlarged, and then pull it out.
And if the arrow is returned to its place inside the body, and one cannot see it, if the patient has all of the symptoms; And if you feel it, then if you have no suitable instrument,
and if you cannot cut through the tightness of the wound, and the deepness of the arrow, and there is no bone or nerve visible, then cut as deeply as the wound.
And if you can remove the arrow if it has ears in it to see why it holds, then take out the part that is stuck two parts deep into the flesh that you can reach, and then break or bend the ears of the arrow until you can pull it.
And gently as much as possible, so that the arrow does not break, pull it out more firmly.
If you cannot do it once, if the blood is spilled until the vein enters its opening, then take care, because extracting it is an ordeal. And if the patient has a counteraction of blood from this cautery, follow what we have said in this chapter about the treatment.
And protect yourself from the incision in the nerve and vein, and put something in place so that you can move the arrow's shaft without risk, either quickly or slowly, firmly or gently;
And put the patient in such a form as he was when the arrow hit him, because this is the greatest aid for him, and if you are unable to do so, then put him according to what the signs show you.
The arrow that comes from the other side, or if it is blocked in any way, or if the skin is swollen and inflamed as we can see or feel immediately:
So cut down then, until the tongs can take hold, and then extract it; If now he is dying.
And if it is retained in the bone, turn your hand around it completely, until it enters the bone, and then widen the bone, then pull.
And if she cannot emerge, so let her remain still, and then continue to extract until it emerges.
and if the wound from the arrow is deep, pour the poultice all over the wound.
and if the arrow flies, and you see administering poultice, if you administer the instrument of the head, so that the points of the arrow enter into the hair of the instrument.
and then poultice it over, and if the arrow is tied up, pour the instrument with a point inside, to ease the extraction.
If the arrow is touched, if it is deemed necessary to copy all the flesh around where the vein is located, so that you can, then treat the wound as it seems fitting.
And if the arrow flies or stings, or on the belly or near the bladder or on the side, and it is close to the surface, then cover it up, if you strike.
And keep guard the vein and the nerve, and then draw it out, and then sew the wound, for this is service. and the treatment until it is healed.
The form of the clamps used to treat arrow wounds are similar to an eagle's beak, and look like this:
And there are many ways: greats, middling sizes, and small ones, according to the quantity of the arrow.
The form of the bow that presses the hair is like the feathers of a bird, to press against the tip of the arrow, as it looks like this:
Of veins where one's cure is thirty-one, because there are sixteen heads, which is to say: two batans (or bursae) which are after the ears, called the "doux herbes" (meaning "soft herbs"). and the two arteries that are in the two temples appearing. And I show you that which are in the two sides of the two eyes, called "aspirÃ©s"; and the vein that is closed on the forehead; and the vein that is at the top of the nose; and the two guidelines which are on the neck; and the two veins that are under the lips of the mouth, and these are called "aughuerics"; and the two veins beneath the tongue.
The veins to which one commonly refers are four in each arm;
one is the cephalic vein, which is on the left side of the clavicle, and they call it "vein of the head" among the common people; And the bone is called "fast", and it is composed of the cerebral and basilic parts, and they call it the "vein of the heart". And the basilic is found on the left side of the costal region, and they call it "vein of the stomach", and it is located above the diaphragm, and it is that one where you breathe in, which opens up visibly into the stomach.
And the ulnar vein is the vein that is between the little and ring finger, and it has two branches;
and in the leg and foot there are three veins: one is under the wing of the socket of the left shoulder, and the second is on the ankle of the right shoulder; and the vein which is called "nessel", is in the ankle of the other side;
and on the other leg, there are three veins below those.
The suffering of the veins that are behind the ears if aided with old cathartics and migraines;
and the quality of the sickness, if I tell you, and is that you raise the patient's head, and rub the vein or the veins with a rough cloth; then the patient's neck is pressed against one wrist, so that the two veins appear behind the ears in each of two lews (units) depending on the head. unless then indeed you feel the pulse in your wrist, and where you feel it, that is the sign.
Take the lancet and take it down through the vein just above the bone; then lift your hand up all over the vein to the top, and strike and cut and clean the vein well. You should see two openings, and you must make them come out so that you see.
Then tie it up tight until it is healed.
And I have said the incision and cautery in the first book.
If the patient has suffered from two arteries located in the two temples, if they are suffering from ancient inflammation and soreness, and eye discomfort, and pain in the corners of the eyes.
and the qualities of the sores are as I have said: And so the patients strain their necks until the two veins appear open. and they pull out the hair below the nail, and then sign.
then lift the vein above the nail at the root of your finger, and cut the lancet under, and lift the vein above, and strike it, just as you have done in two other veins, and make a cross according to your need.
then release the patient, and put your finger on top of the vein for an hour, then put cotton on. and then bind it up, and leave it to be so until she is healed.
and we have spoken about their cauterizing and extraction, and the beginning of this book.
The illness of the vein on the forehead is worth as much as the illness of the head due to ancient face diseases and migraines, and redness.
and the qualities are that the sick person twists their neck until the vein appears. then take the instrument which is called "sickle" and has this form:
And place the point on the vein, and pierce upwards from your hand, or from another thing, and let the blood flow according to what you see; then deliver to the sick person the neck, and tie the vein until it is clean and there is no more bleeding.
It is not suitable to translate medical texts from a specific time period to modern medicine without proper review by medical professionals. And the healthy ones are also affected, because the bone is close, and by chance the wound splits when it is subtle.
The afflicted from the two veins that are in the two fingers if they hold fast and at the nail, and at the redness, and at the swelling, and at the pus in the eye, and with illnesses of the face;
And the qualities of their sickness are such that the sick person twists his neck in a strange way, turning from what it was before.
and the healthy one, and when it is through, then it goes in with a small cut on the long bone, a small deep wound, because there is no cartilage. If the flames are subtle, by chance they break;
then make a correct cut of the wound, just as you have need to, and then bind it with cloth, and tie it well.
The wound of the vagina caused by menstruation so often brings fever, and cough, and diseases such as inflammation and redness that appear on the face, and also when it is old.
and if the quality of the wound is that the patient strains his throat, then strain your left hand on him, and take long, subtle flame, and strike it into the space between the two nostrils, because the vein does not open well in that place, and now the bleeding will start.
And do not go too deeply into it, for cut deep according to your need, and then bind a night, for she is quickly restored.
The sickness of the two joints is most helpful in constricting the vein, and at the beginning of ulceration, and with much disease, and inflammation, and corruption, and herpes, and ulcers.
And the qualities of the sickness are so that if the sick person strangles his neck with one and the other, as we have said;
And if the master is standing above the patient's head, and the sick person sees it in one vein, then pricks a vein long and slightly wide, then draws out the wound at the right time, or as much as is needed;
Then redo it again on the other vein, then cut the ligament, and hold the veins tight moderately, so that the patient does not choke. and let him alone until morning, so the wound may be healed.
Of the cleansing of the liver The cleansing of the veins of the liver above so helps to break down in the mouth, and to corrupt the gums, and splits in the lips, and does not heal well.
And if the wound is clean, then sit the patient in front of you and strap his neck as I have said; then turn the hand, and look at the two veins, one of which is on the right hand's thumb and the other on the left hand's thumb, and recognize them by what they are black, because there are small black veins around them:
so that both of them are cut, and if you do not recognize one of them, or if you are in doubt, then cut the larger one from each side, just as you did for the two veins that are above and below.
Of the inflammation of the tongue The sick who have veins below the tongue are aided after the headache, and it is at the constriction of the neck, and with diseases of the eye, and with diseases of the mouth;
and the qualities of a healer are such that patients who suffer from illnesses between your hands in front of the sun, and they lift the tongue, and look under each nostril one black vein:
then both veins are cut and do not be too deep, for under these are the arteries.
the veins of the arm which are commonly cut are cut according to two manners:
or puncturing at the point of the great mitral vein, or olive oil subtle like the tangents, and it is called "anesil"; And they are large and subtle according to the size and narrowing of veins. The form of the flame is like a mirror so it is very famous, and is as wide as you see.
And it is necessary to open the veins on the forehead when they are flat and contain great blood clots that appear. and this is like the shape of an olive pit.
And it is more subtle in point, and is to heal the small veins subtlety, or where there are subtle bloody spots.
The basilic vein, which is one of these veins, helps to alleviate diseases in the throat, neck, and chest, and abdomen.
and it is fitting for the lord that he should bleed and purify himself from the artery below. And if he cuts the artery and blood comes out, then it is fitting to stitch up, as I have said. and do not let him grasp the flame, but cut it as you would with a needle.
And if the abscess does not open manifestly, so you should extract it, and change to another. or you want to make the wound bleed, or you put a tourniquet on the arm below the vein. if it opens manifestly; and cut the flame with a needle, as we have said.
and if you see the vein of the wound, so also that you extract the arm, touch the limb until you know the pulse. then mark the vein of the incision, and then tie the arm, and cut the vein with a needle. and warn you not to cut at the artery when you see the swollen limb, for it is of the artery: avoid then.
And if you see it bulging like the urine of a child, and if there is no redness or subtlety, know that it is not an artery: hurry up then, and put on your knife long, then cut off the knife if it doesn't stain, because this has happened many times; if the limb is fixed, and left so, and do not move the patient's limbs;
and be cautious, and do not move him until he is healed.
And if there is no inflammation when you prick him, and he falters, and the medicine does not reach him, then cut the artery since it opens up, because the head of the limb will be exposed. and inflame if you prick him.
Take a scab from a fistula and make it open, and take one of the halves and tie well to the other half.
if there is no inflammation, that's good; but if not, if the doctor does it, as we have said, with the powders that bring inflammation.
and the inflammation does not cause more pain in those who have a small leg of the wound and the power of the joint on the arm.
The patient of the vein has aid in treating the wound on the head above, and the body below, because it is composed of the basilic and cephalic vessels, as we have said.
and it is fit for the master that he should cut at the nerve which is below, and if he cuts too deep, and it bleeds, and the nerves swell, and sometimes the patient does not recover;
and this nerve is often cut many times, and if it does not open in any man for its subtlety, it is fit that you should take out the healthy part of the instrument. and avoid cutting the nerve at all.
And if it has veins between the two nerves, so that they are cut to the long.
The patient of the cephalic vein is aided, who applies treatment to the head wounds, and helps the eyes.
and it is necessary to save by applying the fire of olive or myrtle, for it is the safest of all veins, because it has no nerve nor artery. For this route, it is necessary to choose the lighter one, and do not distress oneself if you must do it again for the first time, and continue. and by chance, it swells the vein in some people, but one must not distress oneself.
The quality of the cut depends on your thought.
The first thing you must know to heal is that healing is only granted for the purpose of keeping health and avoiding diseases.
and whether healing is done in one of the three veins: It is to know, the head, the skull, the neck. And one must observe in the beginning of the prayer at dawn, and in autumn and winter after fasting, when the signs of replenishment appear;
And one must observe the first day or the third, after two hours or three days.
The remedy that is in use for all diseases has no fixed time determined, but rather when it is needed, whether in the morning or at night, in every hour and at all times.
And it is not advisable to treat children under 13 years old, nor women who are pregnant only from the fourth month until the seventh. Do not attempt to heal those who are over 60 years old.
And when some people wish to heal themselves, in whatever manner they choose, it is fitting that if someone confuses the bowels with a light castor oil, and has much pain retained, so that the veins are drawing out the intestines' superfluities, causing noxious evils to the principal members;
ne can heal oneself who is excessively salted in meats, nor one who is gouty, so much so that the disease becomes severe, or dropsical;
and if one is sick after a severe attack of colic, vomiting, and decline of the belly, and multiple times lying on a woman's couch, traveling, watching, and fasting, because all their strength, either by the arm or by the body;
then subtly adjust the humors, without being too much so, by foods and drinks and medicines, if you have one;
After the fire cautery, instruct the patient to let them take a bath, since no harm comes from it, in order to further their healing, and they will be healthy again after washing under the pig's entrails on the third day, as we have said;
and keep that day of work, and pain, and luxury, and similar things;
and be calm and joyful, and make the healthy ones higher than those who are sick, and rub the arms twice or three times, then pull out the bandage at moderate pace, because when it is too tight or too loose, they cannot stop running without;
and then rub the healthy one with their hands, until the veins swell and are felt;
then moisten the healthy one with a little flame of oil vinegar, then place a drop of that vinegar from their left hand under the vein of the patient in a small amount or when it will heal, lest the vein is wounded and fails to heal.
There are veins that flow like cords to the vein, and some of those have the same quality as empty strings, when one puts the flame on it, so it withdraws again from the flame, and cannot open the vein, and thus is like these. and if one opens the vein, then it is for those with the wound too narrow, so it is advised to have experienced surgeons in such matters.
And if the vein opens for the first time, that's good; if it doesn't happen again, then repeat the process a little under or above where the wound is located, if the blood does not swell.
And if the blood is swollen and the patient loses hope, let him stay for one day or two, and do not bind the arm. By chance I will bring abscesses with me;
do not enter the bath, then resume the treatment if it pleases.
and if the wound is small, or if you cut beneath it subtly, and you doubt that there will be much blood as you see, then fear for this same wound itself will always be true.
and the work is done quickly, so that the patient does not become swollen; because this happens many times when the wound is small.
If you see the patient swollen, do not resume the treatment, and apply a little bit of lard oil, because it lightens the body from the wound, and is more gentle in this place than the wound itself.
And thus attend to the tie of oil in each wound that you heal the veins, for to stop the flow of blood.
And thus the same is done as an arrow and a bow are made for it, when it is placed on the limb; if you make it very thin and the splinter when it is too big.
And if there is one great abscess, which has happened many times, and similarly when it cannot be treated only at the time of opening the vein is small, then hasten, and put on a moist sponge soaked in water and a little salt, and restrain for an hour.
and it is advisable that you do this after the outcome of the vein's wound, and if it remains on the limb for some days without any color or greenery, then it will not be good. And if you see, put on no ointment of aloes or of myrrh renewed in juice of calmness, monster, or similar.
And often happens an abscess and appearance on the belly of the basilisk:
Put therefore your hand on it, and if you find the place swollen under the pressure of the hand, then that is a bad appearance. Avoid then lest you put on anything of that which we have said, for by chance cutting without the artery;
but to set a plaster dry to harden the place, then the cure of another cure, until it is made whole.
And apply to each person according to the quantity of their virtue, and the color of the wound.
For if not black, then let him leave it out to be discolored until it is red. and if you see a large wound, let it remain so until it becomes subtle. and if it is too heavy, let it cool down.
And it is necessary for one who is thin and weak, and has need of blood extraction, to make the wound even larger and widen the flaps.
and for one who is weak, do the opposite, and it is necessary to heal him quickly and frequently, and he should be healed by cutting across, not by pricking.
and this manner of healing is safe from decay of the blood and hematoma of the nerve, and is better than healing with a long or short knife.
and to one whose blood must be given during healing, it is necessary to give him cold water moistened with juice of green apples. If it is heated, if you draw out the blood three times or four; and if it is of cold complexion, if you apply a piece of moist bread in syruped wine, or in syrup with aromatic spices such as pepper, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves, and a well-smelling syrup.
And if the palm holds the wound, after a great amount of blood has been lost, it is fitting that he drink broth made from cheese and sweet syrup, and use other things that we have said in the division or chapter on fainting, for the evacuation of blood.
And if he wants to open the vein on one arm and cure himself again, it is fitting that when he is weakened by great blood loss, he heal little by little, according to the continued quantity of his virtue.
And who wants to open the vein on one arm after the first bleeding, and has a strong pulse, will recover in 7 hours after the first bleeding, or within an hour.
And who wants to cure himself on the other side, if he should have to cure himself on the second day or on the third.
For there is much blood inside the body when it is heated, and brings on fever. if one wishes to draw a great quantity of blood and enlarge the wound so that it may fall into the pelvis. then you should reward all the conditions of health, and put your hand under some pulleys when the patient heals, lest death come in its place, for this happens many times when the servants are negligent.
And it is not advisable when you see a person loosening their arm, and causing blood to flow the second time, and the wound is closed, that you press firmly on top of it; unless if he is curved, extending the arm suddenly, for this would be bad;
but let him wait until he has recovered a second time; or point the flame at the tip until the frozen part of the vein bleeds again, and put on some poultice made with water, and press gently.
If the vein has been cut away, so let it remain and do not bind it tightly, until the abscess is closed.
If a second wound needs to be treated with the same treatment as before, in the same vein or in another vein.
The vein on the arm is closed in place of the vein at the head, because it is composed.
And the method of dressing the wound is that the patient puts his hand in hot water until the flesh is red.
First let the member remain still, so that the vein appears well; then set it straight now through, neither too wide nor too long.
and let the large punctures be closed, and set the hand well near to the joint of the hand; so that without coming out, put the hand in hot water, and leave the wound open in the water until you have enough.
and if it is in this state, do not put the hand back into hot water, for you will put more pain into it than relief.
and the healing of this vein is more safe than all other veins, for it has neither artery nor nerve.
The healing of the small vein of the right hand is worth all other remedies for liver diseases, and this is the way:
Strain the hand, and pour it into hot water, until the vein is freed, if you see. and if the vein is crooked, and if you copy it all over in its entirety, nothing will be harmed.
and do not apply too much pressure, for the nerves are dried out in all of them when they are cut, and then put the hand into hot water again, if it is not frozen in the wound, and cannot come out.
And when you have applied to the wound as much as necessary, put oil and sinew on the vein to sew up hastily, and do so for every cut.
The sickness of the vein in the left hand is worth the disease of the mouse, and do it just as I told you over to the right.
The sickness of the liver is worth all kinds of diseases of the body, just as illnesses from the marrow, and retention of flowers, and illness of the kidneys, and joints, and old legs, and similar diseases.
And the quality of the vein if it is that when patients pour some salt into hot water and rub above the vein until it dies, and bind above the joint of the foot; and if the vein is on the ankle, and through above the foot it goes very far.
The body heals quickly on average or at the knee, where it can remain.
And if you heal it on top of the bone, so that you keep the nerve below from being damaged and cut through just as in cutting.
and let it be still for a time.
If he cannot come out from it, so put his foot in the water, and let well drain the vein.
And if it is not the first time that it heals, then it recurs again on top a little because it is salty;
do not doubt the nerve, as we have said, and do the same thing for the other foot equally.
The veins of the groin are in the heel of force, and its cutting is worth pain of the hamstring when it's for blood.
And the quality of its healing if it is so that the patient goes in or out, and presses with a force of four on the ankle, twisting, because otherwise the vein will not open.
And if she opens, then let him cut her in all the ways you can, and crossing. and holds that one should copy it, because the liver is spoiled, and she is very sensitive to the touch of the hands.
and holds that one should copy it, because the liver is spoiled, and she is very sensitive to the touch of the hands. And if you do not find it, then let the healthy man have no rain of blood from what opens or on the back of the foot, and towards the little toe, and beware of the pox.
and make a strong incision in the wound so you see what's inside, and then cut the ligature, and put on cotton and bind. She is now cured.
Ventriloques are made of horns, or of nails, or of glass.
And if evacuation of blood is performed according to two methods: or by pricking and attracting blood, or by pricking.
And this evacuation of blood which is done by pricking is according to two methods: or when it is applied with fire, or not with fire.
and evacuation that is done by pricking and extracting blood is done in twelve locations of the body, because one is whole on the head. and the others are tied to the neck; and two more on each side of the neck; and the evacuation beneath the chin; And let him apply the force of two shoulder blades; and let him apply pressure above the groin; and let him apply pressure on both arms; and let him apply pressure on both legs; and let him apply pressure on both ankles;
and let him not apply the force of the venous opening, except for small veins scattered throughout the flesh, and so much that one does not tire or weaken because of it, as is done with veinlet bleeding; and it is not necessary that they are administered, except when there is no fire or heat, in any disease coming from excess, until the entire body is empty.
And if necessity requires that something is inserted, or by custom, then bring it in each hour at the beginning of the month, or at the end, and every time.
because there are those who, when they need to have something inserted, so weigh their head;
and there are those who have redness and inflammation in their face, head, neck, and eyes;
and there are those who have a red spot of blood in their mouth, and they have swollen the tongue, and have bleeding. and there are those who dream, and see through the blood, and boils, and wounds, and similar things.
And when we see these signs, and myself when it is time for the month, we command to be ventoused after three hours of the day.
The sick from the moisture will be aided by the pain of the head ... so that it comes to their eyes, and should not happen only after the evacuation of all their body;
and this vomiting is in the place of the head pain, and should not happen to one with a cold complexion or who has catarrh, because it does them much harm.
and therefore should not happen to one who uses vinegar or who has cold head ailments.
And those who recover from this often become blind, and therefore it is fitting to apply the venous suction a little lower by the examination of blindness.
Vomiting in the throat is in place of head pain and a basilic, and for this it is valued to tighten the belly, and cut the channel of the womb, and to toast, and to swell.
and it is advisable to pound a little more, because if she holds too tightly, so she can cause an obstruction or stomach and bowel.
The vomiting has two costal swellings on the chest if it causes pains in the head, eyes and emigraine, and strangulation, and pain at the roots of the teeth, and is like a sickness of the basilica.
and it is advisable that you command the lord to press his hand in putting it, so he does not strike an artery, and does not come into contact with bleeding.
Vomiting under the chin if it causes illness of the mouth, and decay of gums, and similar diseases that are in the mouth. and is like the sicknesses of the two lips.
Cutting on the shoulder blades causes disease that comes from heat and swelling.
The injury from a sword slash is worth as much as three veins of the arm because it draws blood from those large veins.
And instruct the lord that he should not cut too deep into the flesh, because the veins are bare and located beneath.
The vein on the flank is worth for hemorrhoids at the root, and for diseases beneath; it is advisable that the vein be large and be filled with blood, so as to properly treat them. And if it were subtle, it would break; and make great wounds.
The veins of the legs heal completely, because they draw blood from the entire body, and are worth for ancient pains of rain, and of malaria, and of bladder troubles, and reduce swellings.
and they are found on both shoulders, and both knees, and all of them weaken the body after long use, and bring about fainting in many conditions.
The way to apply a poultice is that you should put it on first empty, and suck out in time, and put it hastily, and move evenly, and do not cease to do this, until you see the redness of the vein inflamed, and feel the red color in the wound;
then put the poultices back, and take care in the arrangement of the body, because there are many who have died from bad meat, and unclear pores; it is often necessary to wound only once, and it is also suitable to make large wounds, and a little deep. and cut gently.
And if it is not large, he should be cauterized twice: the first time to subtlety the passage of the large vein.
and if it is very thick, he should be cauterized a third time;
and when we want to cut the vein little by little, if our force only lasts once. And if we want much of the vein, we should repeatedly resume.
and if it is not thick, cut into the bone, and finish by cutting so that they are perceived suddenly; and cauterize to one who has a great skin and thick fur, and those with perforated pores, that you apply oil apertif and dissolutive on their surfaces of fingers This is the oil used, anointing it with violets, or almond oil, or the oil of cucumber seeds;
and anointing it with turnip oil, or celery, or chamomile, or other similar.
And if the swelling is great and cold, then take oil of marjoram, or balsam, or anise oil.
And if those with skin that is sensitive and large pores, should not be put on oil, but should be washed after the application of rose water, or cold water, or grapevine juice, or cucumber juice, or other similar waters.
And those with much moisture, lift him up from the cold, or from the water of myrtle, and sumac, and similar things.
And those who have great swellings lift themselves with old wine, or fresh water, or an onion decoction, or chamomile, or other similar things.
and should not be treated with a ventouse before the bath, or in the bath, but after the bath for one hour or two.
and should not sleep after the treatment, and it is necessary to perform the ventouse again, whenever it is needed, or when it is applied.
And warn those who recover from this illness are choleric, and if they have not been too angry and inflamed; if it is necessary to take cold things, such as grapes, greens like pomegranate and lettuce at ease, and similar things; and eat porridge, and broth of chestnut, and moist meat.
and eat porridge, and broth of chestnut, and moist meat. And those with a cold complexion should take honey syrup, and fragrant wine of moderate age, which is between vintage and new, and eat little, and eat porridge, small fowl such as pigeons, and pease.
and the next day when he will vomit, it is necessary for him to drink more than eat.
And it is fitting to give some patients three times or more stitches before the operation, or after, for the comfort of their limbs. And so be careful with wine, but it is not fitting for those who are already drunk to drink.
The ventouses that are applied to cause bleeding are those that are placed on the liver, and on the groin, and on the feet, and on the abdomen, and the belly, and the rump, because that member does not bear pain from being poked, and one does not dare to pierce it unless to draw blood from a member into another, as we apply pressure to the breasts when they are inflamed.
to loosen the viscosity that is in the member, as we place ventouses on the abdomen and on the groin to ease the member;
And the pain ends, when it is an ulcer or a stone, so the pain ends by its attractive power by chance, or the ulcer of its own place.
and thus he (the patient) is cut when you put him on the liver and on the muscle when there is retention of venosity, and these veins are cleaned out to suck blood alone. and sometimes they are cleaned with fire, and sometimes plain water is used, just as in other maladies of the pleura, and thus one fills the vein with hot water or with it, there being suitable herbs boiled for that purpose.
The form of the suction to apply with fire is thus:
And it has two fingers of length and half a palm from the tip, with a small puncture on one side around the middle of the finger, as if to insert an arrow, and so that it does not bleed the patient when you put the member on.
and it is in the middle of a point stuck by thorn or iron, to tie a bandage around it, and with them and great and small according to the diseases and age of those who take them;
because the suckers on children are different from those on adults, and smaller than larger ones.
And one must put this sucker on the limb:
bind with a wax bandage or string and put it into the sucker through the point that is in the sucker, so that the clearness is at the end of the sucker, which will not burn the patient.
and then put it on the limb, and tie so that it is above the puncture where we have said, if you want to remove, if the vapor comes out, and take off the sucker;
and take hold of the linen just as before, and repeat it often, if necessary.
In the application of the vacuum, which is used for treating disease of pleurisy, has no advantage, has no point or puncture, and is only applied when it is full of fluid, and is placed on one limb only;
and this is the form:
Seals and other instruments are not applied only in places where one cannot put the vacuum due to small size, such as lips and gums, and similar ones. and in their noses of wood, like two or nails, and other similar ones;
and the qualities of the user when it is found that there are seals in clean and soft water, so take them;
And they put them on wet straw, until they are familiar with them, and have no wind in their stomachs. and then be made clean with a vein and a cup, then rub the limb until it is red, and put on poultices.
and when they are flat and dry, and have closed, if it is possible to put a cup on them, then put them on, because this is much after.
If not so, lift the limb away from the joint, and then into water, very well, and then inspect.
and if the limbs are healed too late after the poultices on the skin, wrap them in a linen cloth soaked in cold water, and put it on, until the poultice dries.
And if the swelling is multiplied, then apply vitriol crushed or vinegar, or similar things, until it subsides.
or put salt on the swollen place, and leave it until the fever has dried up, if it will now subside.
and if you need more, take other remedies.
And if the remedies do not take effect, then rub the swollen place with fresh sauce or prick it with a needle until the swelling disappears, and afterwards when they feel the pain, it will subside.
and when you see that they are crying, then powder on a little alum and crushed silk or ashes, if it will now stop.
The book of fractures begins This chapter is often necessary in the art of medicine, and it restores fractures and dislocations.
Know well, dear son, that this fire cautery is unknown to the ancient books, nor do they read it.
and because of this, the art has been lost in our land, for I have never found any good one;
and I know nothing but by the knowledge of ancient books, where I have studied and treated this art through experience, and from my life's habit.
and I have described in this chapter what is contained, and condensed it at the end, and shown clearly the forms of instruments that must be used, as I did in these two preceding chapters.
It is therefore necessary that we say in this prologue of this book the explanations and the chapters where the wise men put their understanding, and take care to explain it further, so that those who have learned from experience know and learn this noble art, and teach others.
I say that when any break or dislocation or twisting or splintering comes to occur in anyone, if it is convenient to hasten to heal the sick person from one side and the other, since no further treatment can do them harm, as with weakness of body, or sickness, or old age; If they do not press (or apply pressure) too much, or are too cold;
And eat cold meat, that is to say frozen joints, and char of bird and of buck, and do not drink wine, nor eat any fatty meats, and do not stuff oneself too much with viands which fill the veins with blood, until you have doubt about an abscess or a spreading of matter in the member.
If the patient returns to his previous way of life after having used the cautery.
And when the broken bone begins to restore itself, it is fitting that you nourish the patient with foods that cause great swelling, if they have viscosity, such as bread cooked in water, and cheese, and eggs, and butter, and pancakes, and fish fresh from the river, and large wine, and similar things. But swelling causes more representation of wounds and the break occurs faster.
And know that old bones and decayed ones cannot be well mended or soldered according to their nature due to the dryness of the members, nor can those that are too tender, like the bones of small children;
But there is no cure, so set the broken bone in place with great care, and let us hold it firmly together with a strong thread that will secure it, as soon as it is joined. and not at all when his work is done, and for this reason they must be nourished with large meats, as we have said.
And you know that fractures are various in many ways.
For the fracture of the head is different from the fracture of the leg or thigh, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures. For there are fractures that occur at the neck, and others from cutting, just like the length of a quill for writing.
For there are fractures that occur at the neck, and others from cutting, just like the length of a quill for writing. And there are fractures with wounds, and fractures with a small split or crack.
And each manner has its own instrument and tool, and one that is kept clean in the restoration, as the memory of what was done comes to mind.
and it is known that the bone breakage is by twisting of the limb, and opening well because of the pressure, when pressed with the finger.
and when there is no twisting or bumping of the bone at the joint, and the patient does not feel great pain, then there is no break.
But he can have tortuosity, or a cut, or a small break. If it is not good to move the fingers at all, but apply the medicines that come after this, and then pull it now subtly.
And this is known that when the break is in the joint, and the two parts are separated, it must now be put together equally, so that the abscess does not come.
and if it comes to swelling at the joint, he must let one day pass, until the swelling is calmed.
then he puts it in the joint with a measure that you can lightly apply and feel, and this is known to be more lightweight than restoration when there are pieces.
then binds it, as he knows afterward.
And if there is broken bone in the body, where it has two parts, then whether it's with flesh or meat, or with one small member, or with two cords, or with one cord and with the hand.
And put the member according to its natural form, so that when the parts of the broken limb are severed, you gather all the fragments in their place until you can fix them as best you can, and take care that by your work no further injury or pain comes to the patient.
And then properly align the two bones of the bone according to the better forms.
And if it seems to you that it is not quite right, check well with him.
if you dress it properly and do not strain it too much, nor press it so hard as those who make it come by their operation cause inflammation and heat in the member, just as we have experienced many times.
And when the limb is at an end, keep well the patient so that he does not move, neither watching nor sleeping, nor turning, nor in any other way. And well-guarded should be your limbs so they do not feel any pain. But when it feels no pain, you should not take it for granted, and instead put the limbs into rest so they feel no pain.
And well-guarded should be your limbs so they do not feel any pain. But when it feels no pain, you should not take it for granted, and instead put the limbs into rest so they feel no pain. And guard well that it is placed correctly, so twistedness does not come to it when it is restored.
And the qualities of the broken limb are as I tell you.
The broken limb is of various size, shape, and form.
For it has small limbs, just like arms and fingers and similar ones. So you should wrap the linen bandage with wool and subtle cloth. And for those that are large, like thighs and legs.
It is fitting to wrap with a strong bandage, because the long bands constrict the entire large limb, and bind it from all sides equally, so that there is no weakness.
Then tie light tourniquets, three turns or four according to the limb, and bind your hand tightly to the entire bandage, then go up to the break and bind it less, so that the break moves a little away from the break.
and moisten the bandage little by little, until you are pinching a great part of the healthy limb, then take another bandage and turn back to the upper part of the broken limb;
then go back to the lower part of the break and bind it moderately, neither too tightly nor too loosely, as we have said in the first book above.
Instruct the patient to place stapes of linen or a strip between the ligatures, until they are all even; then tie everything together above the bend, and then put your needles well made on it, if there is an abscess or inflammation.
If there is an abscess or inflammation, apply the soothing paste to it, which will draw out the swelling and leave it after some days.
Then pull out your needles, and let them be of a good thickness, like the width of a well-made saw blade or a piece from a log used for making cleats, or palm tree shavings, according to this shape.
but it is proper that the needle placed on the break be a little thicker and wider than the others.
and so let it be as long as it needs to be on the limb of a small or great size; then tie the surrounding vessels as you did on the first incision, then tie over with an adhesive bandage, as you did on the previous wound. the tighter it is wrapped, the worse.
and it should be that the bandage is not too tight, nor too loose or too thin, but made of fine linen.
because if the bandage is too thick, like I have had trouble with making ointments from the leaves that make their incisions so prone to forming knots in the linen cord, and this is a great error, for it is not possible for an incision to be even if it is too subtle, and it should not lie between each vein less than two fingers' breadth.
If the patient is weak from the pains of the arrows after the straining in their safe place, then put stoppers made of linen or wool on them, so they will not bleed.
When the wound is with a fracture, and the bones are broken, I will tell you the cure as follows.
And know that it is not good to strain the arrows every member at once, the first day. When the limbs are large, it is not advisable to place a splint before five or seven days, or as soon as your safety allows.
and thus there is the method of the ancient embalmers to restore breaks, dislocations, and twists:
and take flour that remains on the walls of the mill, and mix it with plenty of egg, and put this confection, not too clear nor too thick, and use it, for this is the common method of the embalmers restoring breaks in many situations, especially in women and small children, since it's neither too hot nor too cold.
Another method of embalming to restore breaks and dislocations and twists: Take away hair and beard and nail and aseptic area and gum Arabic and mulled wine for X days; Eye drops and aloes, for five days; Alechil seven times a day. and make powder, and mix with honey and egg whites; If the complexion of the humors is hot, then apply this plaster, because it has good composition, and restores broken bones quickly, and saves many lives.
Another method of plaster that is valued for its twisting. Take mulled wine and vinegar, for ten days; Mirror and oil, seven times seven. Acacia six. Boline Armenian ten, and it breaks well, and conifies with water or honey, and anointing.
Another method of applying plaster to joints and you take away from the bone what is necessary, and appeases the following pain, and uses the bone, and breaks the fracture. Apply linen novel, and the moss in salt and oil cooked, and put on anew.
These plasters do not restore the health, but they are good for soothing an abscess.
Another method of plaster which restores broken bones: Take leaves of dried fig, and leaves of earthy pasture, and break together, and make plaster.
Another way to splint for restoring the break of the bone and for easing the remaining abscess. Take root of wormwood, chamomile, violet flowers, wheat flour from vetches, of each one a portion;
and crush, and mix with wine, so that the limbs are warmed up; or mix with moist coriander water, or plain water, and use.
Another way to apply plaster more strongly than the first, when an abscess is formed on the restored limb. Take roots of wormwood, and seeds of flax, balsam, melilot, and sansuc, and violet flowers and chamomile flowers, each one a portion; and crush, and mix with salt water, or sweet water, or wine, according to the heat of the limb, and its rest.
In his book, there is no place to put a broken limb for repair so that the salve made of wax and oil is applied, and nothing else, and he says it should be between too soft and too hard.
And it seems Galen says that you must put a broken limb on, to restore, things dry with a little hot, just like myrrh and aloes and incense and similar things, as we have said.
Another way to treat an open sore that brings on pain: Take out the nails and thorns of a corpse, or the needles of an animal, and shave them evenly, and cut, and make them into plaster, and bind the limb.
And then take out the bone a little after, and take care that the patient does not feel any pain, nor has they lost their sense of the joint. if you do not cut out the bone by hands often. And if pain comes to the limb, or it pricks, with rest or swells, quickly take action, cut it out, and now remove the plaster.
and take a lighter bandage, and a moist sponge, and plunge it in water, and lift up the limb, until the prickling stops, and the pain is eased. Then let the member rest for an hour, then put on a clean cloth, either wet in water or in oil rosary, and bind above with a nail, until you are sure of the abscess.
and rest the inflammation of the limb, and let the bone be set, then resume the subtle application, and a little ointment, and do not strain it too hard as before. and subtly until he is healed.
And if you see that an abscess is red and swollen and painful and inflamed, I have a bone that has been broken into all of them, and you must apply plaster and tie it up again, as you did first when it was even.
And if the limb does not come back to its place as we have said, do not let it be released after three days or four or five or seven. and never let it stay for twenty days, according to what we see, until the fracture has set and approaches the joint again.
And then he restrains it even more than before, and fattens his flesh, as I have said previously.
and if you see that the liver is drying out more than necessary, know that it cannot be saved. therefore the disease rises from hot water, every time you open a wound, and this happens to everyone on the fourth day, and especially in cases of soreness.
therefore, by this work, cut off the diseased member and make haste to bind what the foolish surgeons do, lest the limb be contorted.
this is evil, and if there is a great pain, and I see nothing but to lacerate and overstretch it directly.
Many kinds of breaks are there, and various forms, and the causes are destined.
for when there are breaks that are made with the force of a sword and the collarbone is broken through all the bone down to where it is under the bone, just as it happens from hitting or being struck. and for this reason it is called that kind of break "haichure".
where the sword strikes the bone from above and pierces it, and is called that kind of break "absolute".
and there are two kinds of wounds for these two breaks big or small.
And if it has been pierced by a blow that has embedded itself, or is a fracture, or of the collarbone on stone, or of the shoulder on stone, or similar things.
And if it has a persistent fracture, which approaches the tendon that is under the bone, or above the bone, and is this wound big or small.
And if there is a wound that is sewn back into the bone as subtly as we sew, and there is a small split, and for this reason it is called that break "capillary".
And if the wound is made or by striking with a stone, or by falling, or by some similar thing, and the bone fragment enters into the flesh and it is like the fingers of the cauterian when they heat above the cauldron; if the stone goes inside.
And this happens more often to those with moist bones, like children's heads;
and occurs in all such fractures where small pieces are discharged like splinters; and I will speak about this on his behalf.
And we know all kinds of fractures by removing them from under them, and the inquiry has tested them, and by the corrupting fire that is above.
The hair-like resemblance is known because when the bone has been discovered and the surface is rubbed upon, if it opens the fracture.
In the treatment of a fracture, be careful for any accidents in the patient, and if you see no evil accident, such as vomiting blood, loss of understanding, extension, palsiness, fever, and the eyes are forced out and become red, and other similar symptoms more than usual, then it cannot be cured without doubt.
And if you do not see any extraordinary accidents, and you hope for recovery, as soon as you begin the treatment.
And when you come first to me, and it's in winter, it is fitting to withdraw the bone before the eighteenth day after the moon.
And if it's in this state, so hastening to withdraw the bone before the seventh day, and thus making the flesh underneath the bone corrupt, and bringing on the accidents that we have said.
And if the bone fracture comes just next to the cloth that covers the brain, you must break the broken part in such a way:
And instruct the patient to press his head with pain, and uncover on the bone in all ways you can, and on the shape of the wound as well as you can, because if blood comes from the uncovering of the bone or abscess, help him with that which is needed, and fill the vein with moist cloths soaked in rose oil. And let the wound rest until the abscess is calmed, and make sure of the stopping of blood. Then begin to extract from the bone, and it is done in two ways of work.
the one way is that you copy the narrow incision before, and it's the shape:
And then after a second more extensive cutting than the first.
And the second manner is that you have to have various tools in number, some are sharp and others long, and they should be pointed, and made of iron.
and when you work lightly, so that you do not strike the head.
And if the bone is hard and thick, it is advisable that you pierce through it, so that you can administer tools with care, not by cutting too deeply, lest the tool goes beyond the soft bone of the chest, and the edge of the tool should be left above the point with a margin or circle, lest the point go beyond the bone.
and it is advisable to have more, so that each comes in its own time with the splinter of the bone, so that you always have care for all tests.
And this is the form of the three kinds of tetanus:
The ones that cut through the bone are that you place tetanus on the bone, and turn to your left and right until you know when the bone has been pierced;
then put tetanus in another place a little after, and so do all around, then cut at the spaces of the bone between the punctures, doing it more subtly than you can, lightly, just like we said, until you draw out the bone with your hand, or on any of the things that you have, such as with tongs, pincers;
and be careful not to touch the brain or the pit.
And when you have pierced and cut out the bone, if it seems that some part of the bone remains hidden from view, but must be removed with another instrument resembling an incisor, but it should be done more thinly and subtly than other incisors.
And if it doesnâ€™t fix anything with small bones or scales, but rather lightened the weight of the limbs. Then treat the wound of tenons and ligaments which we have said.
And other kinds of work are as he [Gaul] says, which is more difficult. and his words were very strong, and that's what he said. It is necessary first to uncover a part of the bone, at that place or where the fracture opens up, so that when you have uncovered that part, you put under the lower edge of this cut-out lens-like structure, because it is in this shape:
And do not cut close to one side, and the damaged parts are on both sides, so that cutting is done towards the bone.
Then use a small hammer on top, so that you can lightly beat the bone all around, and take good care to protect yourself from the cloth below.
When it is scraped against the bone, because the bone is lightly scratched, for the pain is felt well, and there is fear.
If the break of the bone is not pierced until just after the cloth, and the bone is hit only from above, with small pieces, it will cover again that roughness, and remove the scales at the subtle raspener which you must have different quantities for, in order to give to each one the most comfortable treatment, according to the work and shape of the break.
If you have many coarser rasps and after more subtle ones, and do not cease doing this until it is well.
For each other type of capillary wound and subtle fracture, you should take measures according to its direction;
and this is a thing that has no response from one who puts their study in this art.
And if the abscess is uncovered, it is necessary that you apply a linen bandage dipped in oil rose, according to the quantity of the wound. then take another bandage doubled in two or three, and moisten it with wine and oil rose, and put it on the first bandage. And make it as easy for you as possible that you do not burden yourself further, lest you grieve the wound more, then attend to this other link from above, and do not strain him too much unless he only causes the pain of the wound.
And let him lie on this day or the next, until the swelling of the abscess is eased, then take him out, and administer medicines such as willow bark, flour from mulberries, powdered incense, and saffron, and similar things.
And make powder of these things, and put it on the wound, and administer the remedies with onions and without chewing.
And be sure that the wound is made clean, lest you leave on it ointment, or do not leave it alone to dress with a bow (or cloth), for when the bow is applied over the skin of the brain, it causes corruption and bad results, and brings great harm to the patient.
For when you place a sharp thing upon its surface, it is cut by above. Preventively then, if no accidents occur to the patient, as we have said, it is doubtful in its presence of doubt.
And if it does not come back fiery only because of the medicine you have placed upon it, which has power in it, then it is fitting that you press a part of honey, and three parts of rose oil and beeswax, and apply it to its surface. and then the remedy of cures which he is suitable for, until he becomes healthy.
Which says that the two lower parts of the neck are often broken in two, or one alone, because they are two bones;
and that below is cartilaginous, and it does not break, unless it makes the bone bow or twist, and then becomes sound.
If one of the two parts is broken, so that you put your little dough or plug into the wound, and place it inside the broken part at your index finger, and in a pouched area by default, until it regains its natural shape; and do this lightly, and warn the patient so that they do not feel pain from your treatment.
If the fracture is in the upper part of the arm and it cannot be straightened, so that you put equal to the head of a stick one foot thick.
And if the break is of two parts, you do this again, and hasten to restore it on the first day, if possible;
if this is not the case, after the seventh or tenth day, when the abscesses are calmed down, then put on a cloth made of linen around your head with a plug, if the break is in one part.
If you put another bandage on top of this, if there is a break. And the tents should be so large that they fill in the empty wounds.
And said any restorer that you should moisten the linen in butter and move each one every day. I do not think it is well, but it is necessary that they be moist in the making of flour and yeast. Then let the tent be left, until the bone is hardened and the cartilage is set.
And no time should be wasted applying owl's feathers instead of tents, and if the dressing is wrapped around well, and kept in place, and blows are blown into the wound. or use a bellows to blow.
And if an abscess comes to the nose while you are working, apply a clot or cotton soaked in oil rose, or in one half of vinegar.
And if the abscess is not caused by this, so he applies plaster made of mummy's linen, and powder of incense, mixed with honey, then puts on light bandages, and does not bind tightly.
and if the broken bone is small and it breaks into tiny pieces, if you can get to the instruments suitable for this, then cut the split, and the treatment of things that are difficult to reach, with soldering, as with plaster and ointments suitable for this;
and if there is no wound inside the bone, he treats with poultices, and puts caustic onions in it until it heals.
When the jawbone is removed below, and there is no wound to be found, and the fracture is absent except for swelling alone, without bruising in the marrow, if one knows it lightly.
it is necessary, if the break is in the right hand, that you put your thumb into the mouth of the patient; and if the fracture is in the left mandible, so pour your thumb into the fracture of the right hand, and push it gently into the fracture, and press with the other hand, and make even.
And if the fracture of the jawbone is on both sides (II), it is necessary to administer an extension of II parts, so that it may be even.
and if the movement of the teeth has happened, or a rupture, so take out the thread of gold, silver, or silk from one of them, and put it on the fractured mandible with cerote, and put a double cloth on. and put on a long and thick leather belt or an estee well made, or a piece of leather according to the mandible, and tie it on the jawbone that you can use, and instruct the patient to rest, and serve light food.
and if you see that the figure has changed, so loosen it on the third day, and then put back what is changing. And put plaster on it, from the powder of flour milled with many spices and a great amount of oil or flour of senna, after that you have cut out the membrane.
And put a second, lighter layer of plaster on it, and if the plaster sets, and the patient's condition does not change, leave it that way until it is healed. Many times heal in three weeks.
And if an abscessed foot comes, as we have said many times.
And if it has a fracture and a wound together, then reward yourself with no piece of bone that is removed. if subtlety of the osteomach [bone marrow] has extracted what is convenient to it.
And if the wound is narrow, then expand it with flame according to your need.
And when you have removed all those pieces of bone, and there is no remaining part, then dress the wound, if it is large, and put on suitable bandages to bind well, so that it may be healed.
The fractured bone should be pounded more often in front of the shoulder, and the fracture will occur in three different manners:
When she is broken and severed into two parts, and it has many pieces, and this is the lightest to restore.
where there are breaks with wounds.
And if the injuries are on the side of the break, where you have two ministers, so that one holds the arm that feels the break's strength; and the other extends his elbow towards the part;
then puts the break on his two hands, so that the form is as it should be, and has no appearance or swelling.
And if you have need to extend it further, then puts under the shoulder of the patient a round spear of cloth or linen, and so thick as is necessary; And hold and lift the swelling, and restrain the spear with your hand, so that you place even the break, as it seems.
And if you cannot treat the head of the feeling, because it comes into the very marrow, it is fitting that the patients lie on their hateful bed, and put under the shoulder a soft pillow, and have the ministers pour water down the back, until the bones of the feeling are raised.
And then direct the break to your two fingers, and if you find that it is shattered, so as to cut it.
And carry the pieces lightly away, and if the bone cannot be joined by any means of closure, so that the cut is on one of the incised parts you have. but place this swelling instrument under it to guard against its fall.
and resembles a spoon, and is not wood, and be as large as it seems, according to the size of the bone and the strength of the hand.
And let both shoulders be, as you see, and let one be long and the other short, just as is the custom of the wound that you have made when you treated the bones.
And when you are certain of an abscess, cut the wound, and if the swelling is small, do not doubt it, but apply the wound with drapes and tents, according to its quantity.
If a swelling comes upon the foot, so moistens the cloth in rose oil and in ash and in wine, and puts it on.
The binding of the bone when it is against wounds and swelling is that you place the bone under the plaster of powder from the mill and with beeswax, and put light strips on it, and set a spear underneath, if you have need of it; then take a very thick bandage of one palm's width, then put two drapes on top of the strips and the plaster; Then take a slender rod of 3 doves in length and breadth, and bend it around the bent elbow, so that the elbow of the bent limb is stretched. and place the rod on the break, and turn the bent limb towards the neck, and beneath the healthy shin, and beneath the unhealthy shin. and smooth out both parts, and whenever you see that the limb holds the break in place immediately, and you clearly see that the rod does not move over the broken bone, then reward each part every day, and when the ligament is tied, restrain it.
and make the patient lie on his back, and put under him a small pillow beneath the shin, to lift the shoulder upward. If you lighten the break of the shoulder with the stretching of the shoulder, or by tying the arm to the neck, and do not loosen it in case of a bad accident, then after twenty days.
Then reapply the plaster, if you see it necessary, and bind it and leave it so that he is restored.
And she is restored to the best after twenty-eight days, and less in some cases.
of the shoulder break
But it happens rarely that the shoulder breaks or is dislocated, and neither healing occurs nor does one feel fire only by touch.
If the appearance corresponds to the shape of the break, and is reset according to its natural form, in all the ways you can.
Then put powder of the mill on the place with a lot of oil and fine ashes, and puts up a draplet double. Then puts a large and subtle stake on it, about an inch wider than the shoulder, and cuts through the stake in any place of the shoulder, so that the cut makes ashes of linen, thus making the stakes equally.
And then tightens it to the whole strong band tightly, so that the stake does not move from its place, and keeps a close eye on it every day.
And every time it swells, he tightens it again, and puts the stake back in its place if it has moved, and sets the patient on his cost (i.e. bed).
and the shoulder joint has returned to its place in twenty days or twenty-five days.
And when these numbers are completed, if the dislocation occurs again, and be sure, because it is not bone that is set in place lightly.
And if a piece of the bone protrudes and not below the level, then they do so, and put in, the bone, and do what we have said in breaking the abscess of the sharpness.
of the fracture of the foot.
The flesh is broken only once in a thousand times, but it happens often. but it breaks frequently even when not expected.
And when it is broken in the middle, if it inclines downwards, and the patient feels great pain, and shortage of blood, and swelling, and sometimes vomiting blood, and opens up the veins in the broken bone, and the sensation becomes better.
And the restoration is so that the patient's flesh heals on his back, and he puts a cloth between the shoulders, then presses the shoulders, and assembles the two breast bones to your hands, and subtly puts them in all possible ways until the figure of the bone is such as it should be.
Puis met sur emplausters and estoupes above the subtle star of salt, or other lighter fuselage, and blow out with an I-shaped draft, and tie it upon the broken bone, so that it does not move; and turn the round knot towards the back, and restrain immediately, and reward each hour the limb, and if it relaxes, tighten;
and if it seems fit to loosen, because of corrosion or itching that comes to the limb, or pain or abscess, then hasten, and loosen, and scrape the emplaster, and direct what has come from this cure.
then remove the emplaster, and restrain so that it is safe.
of the breaking of the breast
The injury from a broken rib comes only when the ribs are swollen after the back and chest, and do not flex only because they are curved; and therefore he feels very bad at the examination as if it is true.
And the remedies are such that you place equal the break, as it is fitting. And then apply plaster, and tie with a stake, if you need to.
And if the ribs are broken inward, he feels the patient great pain and puncturing, as well as pleurisy, because the bone pokes into the membrane; and he has pains, swelling and vomiting of blood, and this is from bad health, and the old men have put great effort.
And if to those who say it is fitting to administer foods that swell the belly, in order to ward off the fracture in advance.
We do not do this unless it has come from a source of flesh. And if it is from a source, that it be pure.
And they said none of them would put hot air bladders on the body, to cut out pus, and it seems reasonable; All things come to pass, doubt has led us not to attract the excesses towards the living because of weakness.
And they say that one should cover the limb with a wet linen in hot oil, and put tourniquets between the ribs to keep the joint even, then either be cured of pleurisy, meat, and medicine.
And if the patient suffers great pain because he cannot bear through the bone that has pierced the flesh, and doubt is at the patient, then it is advisable to break open the living being of the broken chest, and it is advisable to put on certain instruments to guard the wound.
And thus one must cut the bone and treat lightly, and then sew both lips of the wound if it is great, and cure with emplastries until he is healthy.
And if an abscess comes to pass, then put on moist cloths in olive oil over the wound.
and treat it until the joint is properly opened, and the swelling subsides on the affected area or where it should be, so long as it becomes sound.
and also to the spine of the back.
And when this happens and you don't know if it will be cured or not, if you see that the hands are softened and swollen and dead, and cannot move nor stretch, and when you press with a needle, if they do not feel.
Know that it is mortal in many types of conditions, and if they are silent and feel well when you restrict them with a point, know that the joint of the bone is saved, and the patient will recover from wounds, if they are put on treatment.
And if such a thing comes to the spine of the back, and you see that it will heal or not, take care: if the bones are soft, and if there are accidents in your hands, and on the back, they suddenly fall with great movement and expulsion against one's will;
and when it falls to the back of its abdomen, it suddenly expels with no will. When he is swollen on his back and it hurts him, if he cannot. It's fatal. If one does not work on his cure.
And if this happens to him repeatedly, then it is the lighter condition.
And if the treatment is such that you reward him with hot pus, apply oil of rose or oil of mutton fat until it cools down;
then put on a comfortable plaster and drying it, bind it with a bandage, and instruct the patient to rest; and does not lie on that part where he feels pain, until he is cured.
And if some bones are fractured, it is advisable to cover the wound; and break the bone, then reassemble the two sides of the wound, if it is large, with a seam, and treat with bandages soaked in vinegar, until he is cured;
And if the head of the bone is broken, which are called "head of the cow", pour water from your left hand pouch into your right, and put it equal to your power, then apply plaster and steel above, if you have need;
and then tie it up, and if it has bone exposed, make a stitch above, and bind the osteum and heal the wound until it is clean.
of the fracture of the femur
There is little that the bone of the hamstring is broken, and if it has, then do not have for much pain at the head; and treat for a long time, and incline to the padenders, and it comes to the patient pain in the limb, and point, and swell what is broken.
And let the healing begin by stretching out your hand above, until you are above the break. and know what kind of fracture and its nature is;
and if the fracture is only in the head alone, then hold that fracture equal so it may take on its natural shape.
And if the fracture is long or it curves inward, then you make the patient lie on his stomach, until the restoration of that fracture has been prepared. And when you have put it equal, then apply the plaster, and put on a splint of wood or bone, and bind the fracture so that it does not move;
and apply plaster underneath the ribs, until the limb is equal. And instruct the patient to lie on his healthy side or on his back.
And if an abscess comes in, do not touch it, until the abscess is alleviated, and apply what we have previously said; And then he returns to the restoration, and holds it in place as needed, if there is no further injury.
of the shoulder joint
The shoulder joint is the one between the arm and the head of the shoulder; and if it is broken, you should restore it according to one of the two methods:
which is that you take a flint or stone of middle size, according to this shape:
And place both shoulders on both bones, and tie them to the top, and cut the patient above the joint;
then the jointed arm is put on top of the broken limb so that it comes to a standstill, and has in it an iron bar, then tie above any weighty thing or stretch it downwards as directed by the ministers;
Now puts the mirror on the broken bone equally with his hands together, until the break returns as it should.
And another way is that they place the patient on his back, and tie the hand to his neck, then instruct both ministers to pull each of these things: one pulling above at the break with their hands, and the other below at all the joints, and stretching out each one to their part.
And if you see that the extraction is further, then tighten both the joint below and above the break, and stretch out each one of the ministers to their part.
And if the break is near the head of the shoulder, so that you must put in the middle of the bone and the other side towards the cut.
and also if the break is towards the cut, so that you must put in a light ligature, under the work, until the break is even on its original place and on the cut.
then puts it in even order, as he wishes, and holds it, if an abscess does not come.
And if an abscess comes, do not hold it tight for seven days, and put on a moist linen in isolation and oil rose, until the abscess is calmed.
Now the shoulder's head is to be strained, and the manner of straining it is that you put plaster on the break, then assemble the arm onto the shoulder, and place your hand on the shoulder or under the breast.
and put a dress on it, and strain the shoulder and arm, so that the arm is in its place, unless something prevents it from being so, or if the bone is not moved.
And if you doubt that the bone does not move, use splints, and put one larger and stronger splint on top of the break, with space between each splint of two fingers' width, and so that each splint is as large as to cover the break three times from each side.
then strain the splints, as I have said at the beginning of this chapter on the break, more firmly and less in a way that causes it to move.
If you see the opening of the vein and the strangulation, as we have said, when you restore the broken member, and you doubt the abscess is being formed, if it leaves it closed for six days, as we have said;
Then look at each one after three days the swelling, which itches and swells, does not come to the surface, or the suppurations do not come to the member because of its extreme constriction. If he is ill, as we have said.
And if no such accidents occur, and do not release the swelling after three days or longer, and the patient lies on his back, and holds his hands above his stomach;
and puts on the arm a certain skin of flax equally, and looks at each one every hour or half an hour, whether the figure of the broken member moves, or its joints are softened.
If the remedy is by virtue of medicine, and they give us meat that we had put before, in such a manner that the meat is at the first subtle. and when he tries to take it back, if it is large.
And it is customary that the shoulder and the leg should be reset after forty days from the beginning. and therefore one must unwind and administer baths and medicines for ointments to aid the remedy.
And if the constriction is swollen and blocked, so it does not open after one or two days.
of a broken arm
The arm is composed of two bones, which are called the "foscil", one small and that one who follows the pouch.
and the other is large, which is under, towards the small joint;
Because of chance break the great frost bite alone, or the small one.
When the frost bites are broken, restorations are light and cures occur.
And when the great ones are broken, it is their cure that is bad, and more grievous than when they were broken alone.
If it's a broken little finger, they can make it stretch slightly lighter, and put it even.
And if it is a great frost bite, then one must strain harder.
And they must extend it above the joint, and make the pouch of the hand higher than the others, and the small ones lower than the others, so that the patient crosses himself upon his own body, and puts the joint above him, and looks upwards before him more high, so that the patient suffers no labor.
Then extend the minister's outstretched arm to the part below to their hand or to the joint, and one other minister to the other above.
And then put it in its proper place, according to its best form.
If the break has pieces, put each one in its place, and if there is no remaining deviation that can be taken to hold the cure, and it cannot be restored to its proper place, then cut out (remove) the bone, as we have said before.
And if with a fracture there is an opening, I have told the singular surgeon about this. so take the treatment.
And if in the beginning of restoring a wound there is an opening with pus, you should apply a cloth of lard made of oil rose and white wax so that it is neither too hard nor too soft. and tie the cloth up above subtly, until the pus is eased.
And then remove the cloth, and apply a poultice made of powdered flour with abundant lye, since you put the splints, and make the splint of the fracture as strong as possible, and one piece slightly larger than the others;
And he says that he must have six joints or more of the arm affected, or else. or if it is a fracture in one of the bones, or in two.
and bind more tightly above the fracture than elsewhere, and every day for less time, as I have said from the beginning of this chapter. and let the dressings that are on top of the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or harsh.
and let the dressings that are on top of the fracture be soft and moist, and not hard or harsh. and let the threads that are strained on him be linen, neither too big nor too small, as we have said.
And reward the limb and the joint after some days. And if any other bad accident happens to the limb, such as itching that comes on the limb, you should raise the limb in hot water, until the itching is alleviated.
and let the limb rest.
And then resume the binding, and if the joints are loosened and the bones deviated, and so similar, address them.
And if the swelling does not come back to the limb, because it is too strained, then you should loosen it a little, and let it stay that way for some days, until the swelling goes away, and then bind it again.
If no such thing happens to the patient as we have said, so that he does not come to injury within 20 years.
and then turn the hands onto his neck, and let his neck be even, and guard against movement and dexterity, and sleep on his back;
and that this fracture is restored in thirty days or thirty-five, and by chance twenty days, according to the humors and the constitution of the person.
of a hand fracture
Observes that on the back of the hand, and near the wrist, there is little fracture, but only a frequent pain.
And when the finger of the hand is broken or bent, it is fitting that the patient should cross his fingers, and sit straight in front of him equally;
then puts his hand over the broken joint, and stretches out the limbs of the broken bone, and sets them even with the joints, until they are well joined;
and apply plaster and poultices, for if there is no abscess, then put a stitch according to the quantity of the wound; and be wrapped up in an arrow-shaped bandage of linen.
And if the break is in the small tendons under the stomach of the foot, make a bandage and instruct the patient to tie it to his broken foot; and then tie the bandage of linen so tight as to rival the plantar fascia of his foot, and tighten the bandage if necessary.
And if the fracture is in the elbow, so it may be fitting to put a splint above and below in the limb, so that the wrist is straightened and set right, then tie everything together around the hand, and secure the joint between the two.
And if the break comes from two sides, and it's swollen, then apply ice if necessary; And hold it with the plant, and if you see so, put a small stick straight to lift the break, and do not move.
And if the break is in another place, such as on the index or one of the others, if it's even, and you tie it with a healthy hand that is after. Or tie them tightly in the hand holding it, if you value or put on a splint, as one would.
And take care in restoration and in the arrangement of an abscess, and heal those who come to you, as I have said.
The bone of the shoulder is often broken, and it can be seen how much it is turned when she twists before and behind.
and the restoration is done by tying it to the bone above the fracture, and to the other below. And patients are given on their face, then each of these ministers stretches out the tie evenly.
and this is when the bone is completely healed into place.
And if the break is close to the root of the cross, then it is one of the ligaments at the joint and the others are below the break.
And also when it is near the joint, and then so are the bonds of the joint, and so is the extension below.
then he puts the mirrors on the bone to its two sides, so that it is according to its natural form, and then he puts in plaster, and the tie, so that no abscess comes.
And if it has an abscess nearby, he will let it calm down first and then return to its work and treatment. The limb is made in this manner.
It is necessary to wrap around the wound with a bandage that is twice as thick as a normal one, or three times thicker; and let the swelling subside, then turn the leg so that the heel comes to the base of the knee, and pour one long thread between the thigh and the leg, from below, and put the head above with the thread.
then turn up the leg and over the thigh the bandage, then put in the wound stakes, and place a stake on the bone of the leg;
then apply the eight-yard length between the thigh and the groin to tie up a soft wrap to equalize the constriction, then begin to bind the wound in a figure of three or four turns. And when you go up higher on the fracture, and it is stretched less.
Then take the two threads that you have inserted between the joint and the bone, and tie three stitches on top of them; then return to below towards the head of the thread until you find something on the ground.
and hold the strain if it does not move from its place; then let it be so, unless an abscess forms or an ulcer appears, or any other similar thing. And if it forms, cut away the part and address the thing that comes, just as we have said many times.
and if there are fragments of bone that remain, it is advisable to cover them, if possible; And if you cannot do so, then it is advisable to cut the limb, and apply force; And the treatment as we have said, for when he is healthy.
And at no time is the bone broken as it is when you meet a spear, just like in the shoulder and arm.
Every time, even in the restoration as done, does not close again the patient.
And it is known that the bone is restored in three days, or less or more, according to the diversity of the constitutions.
The thing is broken near the groin but it bends many times.
But if it breaks, then it's only a split or an opening, and there is great pain from the wound and the sensation of pain.
And the restoration is as when you put equal to what was broken at his joints, until they are assembled and can be done.
Then applies the plaster, and puts a round arrowstick if you have need, and binds as it is necessary, then rewards all the arrangements which we have said on other breaks, just like abscesses and similar appearances. If there is anyone who needs this knowledge, let them know it, so long as they are healthy.
of the break of the leg
Know that in the leg there are two bones, so that one is called "moustelle" and the other "fossicle".
And it happens that another fracture comes to the arm, and for this reason the restoration is done similarly to the arm, and all the wounds are equal. And if the two bones are broken together, turn the leg in all parts.
And if the small bones are broken, then straighten them in front.
And if the big bone is fractured, it causes great pain and one can see well. and turn below.
And then apply extension, and put it in its place, and tie the ligatures equally.
But it is advisable, if the break is ugly, and there are more pieces than not, that the extension be smaller and lighter; and apply according to your skill.
And when you have completed your work, take two wooden sticks that pinch the thigh from one side and the other, and are long as far as the knee.
then tie in two lengths of bandage above and below, and bind them at the middle, so that the leg cannot incline to the right or left, and this is well done;
and one must tie two sticks of the same length as the leg, and with them, hold the leg steady to move it, because done in this way is proper in the break where there has been an injury;
And move everyone every day the leg, to see if it has an abscess or other injury. if the cure is soothed.
of the broken bones of the foot
At the ankle there is no break, but at times with the two feet the bones come to a break and do a little damage, and there are only few cases of further damage.
And if he has a bone with a broken foot, and you see the bones forming on top of each other, if you put the sick person's foot on the ground, as it would walk, and then put your own foot on its side, where the bones are raised, press down so hard that they come into their place.
then put plaster and poultices on it, and place a small table over the foot with two flat stones, then bind the foot firmly afterwards, and wrap yourself in bandages, and other things that you need.
And when three days or four have passed, if you cut the ligament, because you will find the bones in their place, whether they are broken, dislocated, or misaligned.
And if he has any broken bones, then restore them, just like we said about the bones of the hand; Then put an arrow in the broken bone according to its length, and a little bit wider, then put on the foot that I told you about, and it will become stable;
And if there are two or three, or more, broken bones, then put an arrow in each bone according to its quantity, wrapped in a linen bandage, and strap the foot with it; And if you are standing above the head of the foot on the outside of the belly, if it is well taken.
And it is fitting that you do not forget the other things I told you about when we spoke about other broken bones. and secure each accident as it occurs.
of a bone in the finger
When the bone of the woman's nature is broken, if it becomes enlarged, then incline it towards the part behind her back, and hold it there.
then fill the bone with the cloth of the patient's gown, and put in also as much as it is in the (presumably a medical) instrument.
then bind the woman and raise her back slowly, little by little, and then put the cloth in as it comes to meet the bone, which returns with the instrument.
and when she wants to urinate, put the cloth back, and when she has urinated, remove it again, and do this for seven days before. If it is restored the break, and if you see, take a vessel of goat's milk, and tie to the puncture a thread, and pour all the vessel into nature; then blow through the thread formed, until the vessel is sucked in inside; the natural process will restore the break;
then be filled with cotton, and let it be so for some days, until it is healed.
And when the bone at the point of the elbow or in a woman's body is broken, or as we have said on the bone of the willow.
and do not conceal these close breaks in those who have put their study and practice into it, and heed my book.
For the break means more injuries on the right path of restoration: which is therefore.
In the vagina, when it is broken, take a goose's gizzard and pour it into the vagina; then wrap bandages around it inside, and let him lie there for three days or so, and he will be healed quickly.
of break with wound
It is necessary for one who has a break with a wound, especially if it is great, as the bone of the shoulder or the humerus or something similar, that they should be healed immediately, if the healings that we have said testify to it.
If the wound is clean, then apply vinegar to it. If you have no other option, then do it again on the same day, or the next day, unless an abscess appears on the site of the break.
If an abscess appears on the site of the break, then leave the restoration for the next new day, until the abscess is healed, and do not touch it or apply it again on the third day or the fourth, lest you will bring about a bad misfortune.
If the bone is broken and appears near the joint uncovered, it would be fitting to put it at a lighter point in your hands, with a small extension.
And if the splint is not suitable for putting equal weights on your hands, if the splint made of iron with seven or eight fingers and the width according to the quantity of the wound; and for this is a task on the surgeon that he applies three or four times, according to what he needs in each of these fractures;
and if it is red and small, that it does not bend at the pressure on the limb above, and so in front, and big near the middle towards the forehand, thus:
And it is called "palanch" because it must be placed on the curved bones above the skull of the bone. and it is one to one, that they are even with each other. And if the fracture is subtle and the splints cannot firmly grasp the bone, so that it fits well, then you must copy the head of the bone, as long as the splints have a chance.
And if you cannot return the bone as we have said, so that it cuts with an instrument suitable for this, or with a knife or smoother, to your power;
then remove what is stuck in the bone from sharpness and small scratches.
And when the bone is set and the patient feels great pain after, recognize that it's not in its natural place.
If you do this so it is in its place, then fill it with red wine vinegar black, and properly it is said to be like that; and do not put any clotting substance or other thing on the wound except oil, lest it bring decay and corruption;
then administer ointments as soon as you have restored the bone, and let the wound uncovered, and cover the covering all over, according to the quantity of the wound, and do well to guard that the wound is not constricted with the break;
and many have done this, and they have made the patient worse, dead, or corrupted sometimes; and so the grip is more gentle and softer than other breaks.
And if the wound is bad or severe, and you doubt that no greater accidents will come upon it, as we have said, and you find pain in the limb, so it cannot be put on a splint. but wrap and cover with hard bandages, and bind them.
And when you see after one or two days that the wound is healing because of what you put on it, and if you apply ointment to healing wounds, just as ointment has tetter (or tetanus) and similar afflictions.
It is necessary to move the limb twice a day, in the morning and evening, until it is softened and healed.
It is necessary that the limbs be covered in such a way that the wound heals quickly.
And if every day they trespass and it cannot heal but re-open with bleeding, see if there are small pieces of bone, because you must treat the wound with care, and remove all these unwanted things that make this pain come.
And if an abscess comes to the joint, or another kind of corruption, it is fitting that you cure it, according to what he writes in his book previously.
But when the bone is broken and opens up in the limb, just like the bone of the shoulder or of the elbow, and other large limbs, it should not be treated with care, because often death comes from this, but let it wait until it can mend itself.
But perhaps you will die from the wound after twenty or thirty days, then treat the wound if you can.
and if you cannot, leave it.
We come many times after the health of the fracture, particularly when it is near the joint, and see a strange thing with the figure of the limb. and by chance he may not be able to restore the limbs to their natural state.
Be cautious then, for if the limb is frozen. if you administer medicines that are bitter, such as aloes, incense, and mira, and sarcocolle, aloe, and other similar things, so that you do not take any of these things or all together, and mix them with bitter wine or with large amounts of water or with oil. and place it on the nose in poultices, and bind it well, and do not untie it in hands for a day.
and place it on the nose in poultices, and bind it well, and do not untie it in hands for a day. and then you remove the dislocation and repeat it until the knots are removed;
or you strain on a piece of bone very well done; because the property of the bone if it is that it removes all the swellings above the members;
and if the knot has become hardened like stone and it is necessary to remove it, if you cut above it, and make the superficiality appear; or you take it to no razor, until it is removed, and the treatment until it is healed;
One weak member after the guard
When the fracture of the bone is restored and it remains after the weak and subtle limbs, if it happens due to many causes; Because one was too tight, and not tied as it was needed. because of having too many ties, and the circulation does not come to the member. or for excessive bleeding; or from too great movements, not in its own hour; or because it has little blood in its body, so is weak.
And the physician is that you should make the patient eat and make the body soft, until they are multiplied in him. and administer a bath, and give joy and ease;
Then apply poultice to the limb, so that the poultice attracts great swelling, and the arm rises frequently with fever, until the swelling subsides from the member. and returns to its natural form.
The limb is twisted after the health When the limb is twisted after restoration, and the bone breaks open, and the form of the member is ugly, all that can be done is its natural repair.
if you do not believe the fools who say that one must break the limb entirely new.
and this work is blamed, and it often leads to great evils, and sometimes death.
whenever the nodations and tortures are fresh, it is advisable to arise them with hot water, or herbs cooked in a gentle manner, as those of balm, and roots, and melilot, and similar things;
And let the patient have a mollifying poultice, as quailon is well made, and take the musk of valerian, and congeal it with goose fat or olive oil, and apply poultices on.
Or take figs with fat, and grind them with flour of rye, and similar medicines that relieve the pain.
And sometimes the joint is dislocated due to continuous friction and prolonged rubbing with wet hands. And so move the limb every hour.
And if the twisted parts are old and hardened, like stones, and require the application of the hot iron, so that they will cover just with the bone, at the subtle incision. and put on a bandage and study in the treatment.
Dislocation occurs when a joint moves out of its place, which prevents it from moving, and the limb is misaligned, causing the patient great pain and injury.
When dislocation occurs, if you want to now move the joint again with care.
For if it is delayed, for the swelling of the limbs, and by chance if it is put back in place with pains at the joint;
Because of this we do not want to move it while it is swollen: many times causing pain and other evils.
whenever it happens, if you wish to heal the patient, then let him go, until the abscess is closed.
then apply a hot and oily remedy to the limb, then gently reset it, and treat each member as the healer comes to his place.
And I have ordered the physicians for treating dislocations of the shoulders with three fingers.
It often happens that the mandibles are dislocated in both, and there are two kinds of dislocation: or they have a little bit of bone in their joints, and become soft a little. When they are completely dislocated and fall toward the bone, and cut the saliva from the mouth so it cannot be held, nor can close the mouth, and move the tongue with the voice.
When the dislocation is small, so too does the movement repeat itself according to its disposition.
And if it is whole and completed, then you must reset it quickly, without delay.
and in such a way that the physicians tie up the head of the sick person, and pour into him some powder from one of his hands at the root of the dislocated mandible within the mouth, if the dislocation is two parts. and the other two from each hand are avoided, to make even.
and instruct the patient to soften his mandibles and move them in all directions. And he gives it equal, so that it returns to its place.
And if it is reset severely, especially when the two mandibles are assembled together, apply hot water and oil until the dislocation occurs lightly;
Do not try to force it back again, if as we have said.
And when they are reset evenly, and the mouth of the patient is closed well with a softening, apply moist cloths in a rose oil made from oil and wax, then tie it lightly with moist threads;
and let the patients sleep on their backs, and their shoulders be between two pillows, so that it does not move or twist to either side, nor try to force them to fix, but gently apply meat, until their pains are gone, and the jawbones stop aching;
and then handle what he wishes lightly, and do not labor to open the mouth to swallow and drink, until the mandible is well closed and healed.
And if the two mandibles cannot be returned to their place in an hour, and are not converted to their own, then it comes with fever and sweating accustomed, and by chance, vomiting from the belly, and by chance, vomiting clear.
And when you see that, then know it's a sign or portent; and many times he dies within seven days.
The arm cannot be dislocated from the breastbone inside and at the elbow, and it is never dislocated without great pain, and one can feel this always.
And the restoration is only when the patient lies on his back and extends his arms; and then press firmly on the left side of the palm, and it will return;
then puts on the plaster and the bandage, and binds it;
and the head that is towards the shoulder cannot dislocate; If it does not heal, and if he becomes dislocated any time, then settle him in his own place, as we have said;
Then put the plaster and bandage on him, and bind him, instruct the patient to rest until he is healed.
And in the same way, the head of the horse is brought back to its place when it is dislocated.
Dislocation of the shoulder
It is known that the shoulder joint can be dislocated in three ways:
because one way it is dislocated at the lower part of the shoulder, below. and the second way is at the level of the elbow; And by chance dislocation occurs at the part above, and this happens often.
and do not dislocate behind the shoulder or inside the nerves;
and more often dislocation occurs below towards the heel, particularly in those who have little strength, because they will soon fall.
but to those who have enough strength, they will break bones and return to bones.
And by chance happens to some men that percussion or crushing, and inflating the shoulder area of an abscess, and thinks it is dislocated due to this.
You should therefore try it, until you are certain. And then begin the treatment.
And it is known that dislocations occur when they fall below towards the heel, and you will find a difference between the diseased shoulder and the healthy one, and you will discover their diversity. And you will find a hollow at the shoulder, and beneath it at the top of the shoulder, just as we have said. and the patients cannot return their hand to its normal position or move it in any way.
and also, if she is swollen at the top, if it's not hidden, because you will find it clearly in the top of the shoulder.
and this type of dislocation is not very difficult to treat when it's new, or if the patient has fever.
And the manner is that you lift the hand of the patient at the top, then place your fingers under the shoulder joint, and lift the joint with force to its normal position. And let the ministers ease the hand, and extend it upwards, because it is placed below. if it comes to a swift cut.
And if it does not come to the swift cut, as we have said in our hands for many days after, it is fitting that the patient be bathed in hot water. and they should administer the remedy for mollifying and soothing, just as the decoction of aloes and fenugreek and melilot in water, and be given.
then put the patient on his back, and lay a thin cord of linen down so that it is neither too soft nor too hard, then tie Mires' foot onto the cord, and lift the shoulder joint with virtue, and treat the hand of the patient.
And let us other servants take hold of the patient's head, so that it does not move again. That shoulder returns to its place now, and if you observe how it moves accordingly;
and that you make him stay in a place where he is greater than the patient. and be straight towards the chest, and pour water over his shoulder below the arm of the patient, and lift the arm above, so that the patient hangs from the rope. And another servant treats the hand of the patient downwards towards the abdomen. And if the patient is too light, so they are weighed with no heavy thing, and the dislocation comes back now.
And you also dislocate it in another way:
and it is good to strike a long bone into the earth, where its joint is also in proportion with the piston, and not too big nor too small. and then it should be put under the patient, but if he has bandages soft on his long stick, and the patient is lying on a long staff.
and then stretch his hand towards the other side forming, and the joint will return to its place quickly.
and if it does not return for all these things which we have said, then do this cure: take a bone from the upper arm of great size and four bones of width, which have their head in front for them to enter into the hollow of the axle, in this shape:
Then tie up the head with a cloth to prevent the patient from bleeding, then place it underneath the armpit of the sick person;
And stretch one arm up to the long bone, and tie the assistant's arm to the bone, and the arm above the elbow of the hand, then place the arm on the spine of a large scale, and extend the hands downwards, and let the body hang from the other side: the joint is now set.
And when it is thus fixed, in any manner whatsoever, it is necessary that you put down the wound with a spear of wool equal, then apply the plaster made of powdered flour of the mill, with incense and wolf fat, on all the shoulder and back; then pull out from below the wound immediately, and turn the bandage upon the plaster, and embrace the hand on its neck, so that the hands remain thus.
and it is fitting that he waits for a little while, until the limbs are comfortable, because he will recover more quickly;
and then move him after five or seven days, and the joint. and if it is hardened and does not soften, then it is sound.
And if the joint is swollen from moisture that has come upon it, or from another cause, it is fitting to administer cauterization three times, as with the cauterization tool in front of or on the cauterizing instrument.
And if you do all that, and after seven days the joint does not hold, and he cannot lift even one arm up, then know that the nerves at the head of the shoulder are cut or stretched out or softened. and know that the joint is never fixed in its place.
The dislocation that occurs in the hip or knee, or behind the elbow, is done through force and stretching of the hands, and it is treated with another joint.
and cure until he is sound.
And if after the healing comes greyness to the limb and late movement, then use the patient many times in baths until the greyness is alleviated, and returns to its first nature.
of the shoulder cut
Know that the joint of the collarbone is dislocated at times and comes back.
and it has swollen all around, and itself before and behind, and the dislocation is not corrected, because one can see it well and feel it well; and swelled according to each shape. And when you join the sick with the healthy one, so you can see it openly. For when the joint is swollen, and cannot flex the arm, nor touch its shoulder at all.
And it is therefore necessary to reset it in such a way that the abscess will heal, because if the abscess comes out, then it would be a source of great suffering.
and by chance it cannot be reset entirely, especially when it is located behind. so it is worse than other dislocations, and causes greater pain, and by chance one can die.
And the restoration is so great that when it can be set, you must stretch out your two hands to each hand. Instruct the patient to let his arms be expanded and his hands be pulled in such a manner according to the length of his arm from shoulder to hand, from above down, and back again, so that the joint is loosened at its roots or on the base of his palm until it returns to its place.
And if a dislocation occurs, when he doubles his hand to his hand, and proud of the root of the palm, the wound is inflicted.
If he does not return to its place, then administer great stretching.
And that both stretch the arm and both pull the hand with equal force so that it does not move with stretching.
Then turn the arm in each direction, after having wrapped a double strip of cloth around it, long and wide.
and when the fingers hold the joint to his hand, if there is oil to anoint the joint, then pull the joint firmly until it returns.
Instruct the patient to put on plaster bandage in place on the wound with some wax of bees, and tie the strain tightly, then bend the arm against the pain of the patient, and leave it for some days, then release.
And if the joint is firm in its place, so release the bandage and leave it.
And if you see that the joint is not tight, so reapply the plaster bandage and the tie, and leave it in this way for some days, until it is firmly set. Then release.
And if he feels great pain after the restoration of the joint, and it does not move, so bathe him and rub him well, and press until he is eased. Instruct to put on the joint a swine's fat skin, then let it stay for one day and one night, then take out the bone, and make it enter into the bath. And when he cries out, rub the joint temperately, then put on the skin again, and then make it enter into the bath. And do this twice or three times, until he is cured.
And if you see, put under a fennel of vinegar moistened with hot butter and strain it.
if he returns to his condition.
Dislocation of the hand
The dislocated joint of the hand is less painful, and when it returns, it is lighter than the other joints. It is necessary to return it to its place immediately, in the same house where it was displaced, so that the joint may be swollen, or an abscess forms.
And if you return it to its place so that the doctor places his hand on a board, and extends the fingers of the other hand, and looks at it equally, so that he puts his palm on the appearance of the joint, and presses until it returns.
It is necessary that you look at him well; so then the doctor puts his foot on top of a board at extension and return. And if the dislocation is in the back of the hand, then place the patient's back against a board and straighten his fingers on the appearance of the joint.
Now that it has returned, it is good. If not, so if the strain of applying poultices to abscesses is calming the pain, then let him wait and then resume in that manner.
And if he cannot endure it, and you are not able to put him on the mend after some days, if the joint remains twisted.
and it is not wise to let the patient suffer unless his hands are completely numb, and he cannot stretch or strain anything. then know that the nerves have been struck, or the arteries.
so if there is no other remedy except to strain with cautery on the affected case, and by chance it may be worth anything.
And when the hand is in place, put the dressing on top of what we have said, then apply the strain and leave it for a day, then remove and leave as before.
If it cannot move well, and there is no great affliction, then apply the hot water to the affected area, and rub it so that he may recover.
of the dislocation of both hands
never the thumb of one hand is displaced in both directions, nor once to the back of the palm or the belly.
And then you must stand the patient, and pour out the dislocation into his pouches until it returns, then sustain the head of the joint, and direct it towards the part where it is displaced;
and leave him for two days, and then set that joint equal on the following day;
and fasten it as we have said, and on the following day, move the joint again, and secure it with a bandage;
and do this repeatedly until it is stiff, and also do so if it has become dislocated in the belly of the hand, and do it just like you did before, until it is healed.
and do this too, if he has dislocated the other side.
A dislocation of the shoulder bone at the back of the body
When the shoulder bone or the collarbone is dislocated, or if there are many dislocations and no cure, for the dead come to claim the patient.
And the signs are that the excretions fall forth without will or wish, and cannot be held, and many times some members are softened, or both legs or both arms.
And many times the swelled part turns into four parts;
the one that turns to the back is called "gill-bossitz" or gillbosis,
The treatment is that you should ward off if the gillbosis has come from childhood; if there's no cure or healing at all.
And the one that comes from a fall or percussion, or similar things, say the ancient ways of treatment with great words, where there is no great gain in all.
But I have abbreviated it according to my intention, and have formed instruments in various ways.
It is not safe for the inguinal region that comes to the front of the thigh.
And also that which comes straight down the middle in both sides, and cannot be treated with fire except for that proper one coming from behind, as I said.
And that the patients should be stretched out face to face in one place, and have a strain beneath them, so they do not bleed.
Then place one cord at the head in earthwork, and the other on the joints, and tie a linen strip between the ankles of the patient, and the other as hainches, and knees.
And two physicians observe the joints, one on the head and the others on the feet, between the two limbs;
and let the joints be firmly closed, as we have said, and the mirrors place their palms on the spine so that it heals.
And if it does not heal by this cure, take a stick of three arm spans long, and shave it against the surface, and have the patient lie on their side, and pour the chief of the stick onto the surface, then place the midpoint of the stick on the spine; and have the mirrors place their feet on the other end of the stick, and press firmly, until it heals in its proper place;
and if you see, perform the operation on a wrist that turns to the hand. And thus you insert two pins into the head of a patient with one arm and another at the feet; between each pin there is a space of about the length of a palm of fingers.
And between each pin there is a perforation or the tendon runs through, and the pins are firmly stuck in the earth so they do not move.
And between each two pins there is another pin that sticks out on the other side, so that when one tendon turns back, the other two small pins of a palm's length are inserted to make it turn.
And then tie the ligament that is between the joints to the tendon towards the head, and the other ligament towards the feet to the other tendon, and each of the attendants turns their own tendon around all the length of the ligament, and the masters put an equal pin so as we have said.
When it is evened out, put up a styptic desiccating powder with a great deal of vinegar, and then the stitches, and then the stel (of a table) of three doves' worth of linen, that purple dye the limb's color and healthy part of the spine, tie it with a string, as we have said, and use the patient subtle nursing until he is healed;
And if no remedy comes to the end of healing, it is fitting to administer softening and soothing medicines with the stel (of a table) which we have previously mentioned; And at some time administering a plug, and at other times the appearance comes in the back spine of the back, and it is thought that this is a dislocation; And it's the bone that opens up, because one shouldn't have any presumptions: by chance may lead to death.
It is known that the joints of the knee and the shoulder only come from dislocations, not from other joints.
and the joint of the knee is displaced according to four parts: within and without, and before and behind.
and the displacement is more within, and less in front of and behind.
And if a person with an injury in the knee is joined to a healthy one, it becomes longer, and opens up more the patient's knees than those of a healthy person, and cannot double his knees at the fire; And it is the joints which are inflamed with pus, because the swelling of the cubital vein comes to them.
And the sign of him to whom it happens on the foredoom, so is that this accident is contrary to these before.
And the signs of that person who happens in front of him, so that his leg is straight according to the completion. all the way, do not bend his knees in pain, and if you want him to stand up, he cannot, he holds back his urine, and his groin swells, and when he walks, it passes over the heel.
And the signs of him to whom it happens behind, so is that he cannot spread his knees, nor bend them, and that leg is more twisted than the other, and the groin is softened, and the head of the femur is displaced below the lower ribs.
The remedies for this appearance of dislocation are such that if you return to the joint which is dislocated, and it has been old, then it remains according to its constitution, if there is no cure. and it is not advisable for him to have any presumption.
And in those where the dislocation is fresh, and there are four kinds of dislocation, so hurry to return the joint, and stretch it inside and outside, and straighten both left and right. in case it returns, and there is no other remedy needed.
and if it does not return in this manner, it is wise to have the patient tied tightly with two hands or one ligature on the knee. and another kind of minister is to extend one hand in this way that it pours its hands beneath its buttocks, then tightens a soft ligature around the crotch. and another kind of tie binds the head with a rope.
And stretch upwards and downwards all at once, until the patient is raised from the earth once, and remains standing.
This method of extension is common among four types, and if a dislocation has returned, as we have said, it is well.
If this fails, it is advisable to apply treatment to his appearance.
When dislocation is at the shoulder joint, it is advisable to lift the patient on his healthy side, then put a bandage above the head, and the one that is under the arm, then tighten the bandage towards the armpit, and towards the fold.
Then grip another minister with his arms, and embrace the swollen arm of the sick person, and stretch it towards the outward form: so that it will return to its place now;
And this kind of dislocation is lighter than others.
And if you cannot tie it in this manner as we have said, then it is advisable to bind the two feet and ankles of the patient together with a strong cord, and the two legs, so that the diseased leg is extended two fingers more than the other.
then let it be suspended above the head of a staff, and above the ground two long arms.
then command the minister to encircle the head of the wound, and let other ministers encircle with him around the patient, who will encircle the wound, because the joints now return suddenly.
And when the dislocation is outside, let the patient be girt as we said in those who have gout, and tie the cord tightly on the diseased leg proper, and on the skin also.
Then put two pins, one at the head and another at the other piece, then place the pin between the joints of the patient in the shape; and place wet cloths around it so that the patient does not bleed, then stretch out each of these ministrants towards him, and put equal measures in his hand to set the dislocation.
But if it returns, that is good.
If not, place on the side of the table, and press as we have said in the gout, and instruct the patient on the healthy coast.
And when a dislocation occurs in front of it, so as to extend the patient's leg immediately, and according to what I have said; and put the measures on the patient's pain to be above the angle of his leg, then press with one hand and stretch towards his groin.
And if the dislocation is at an angle, so that it does not stretch the patient downwards, nor lift him up from the ground, but rather it should be as if his joint had been dislocated at an angle, just as we have said when resting on both knees; and so it is on its face, and the ligament is stretched as we have said before, and he must press firmly above the joint at the table. and when the patient stretches out his legs, and they are even. and then tie the knees, and put on an emplastre (bandage), and a binding with a strip of cloth, so that the hamstring does not move. and he rests for three days or four, then he is taken out, and the bandage is put on.
and if you see that they are even, as before, and tie the binding, and let him rest for three days.
then he is taken out, and make him walk gently, until the limbs are comfortable.
From the displacement of the joint
The joint of the shoulder is dislocated in three ways: This refers to being cut into and cut out, and behind.
And does not dislocate in front.
And if the signs indicate that you command the patient to bend his knee towards his groin, and if he does not straighten up towards his groin, then it is dislocated.
And if you restore all the others, then sit the patient upright, extend his knee if he can, and place your back under his face, and put his foot on your feet.
Then take his groin to your palms, and draw between them, then bend both the two sides of the groin that form. and let others stretch out their foot, until the knee returns to its place, and the signs are that they have well restored their leg lightly.
and apply plaster on it, and let the leg dry at the joint, and bind the joints together firmly for three days or four, then remove.
and do not let the sick person walk until the limbs are comfortable.
And if the limbs are not at all, then it is necessary to extend them very strongly, just as we said in the treatment of gout, until they become healthy.
of foot dislocations
The feet are sometimes swollen and sometimes completely dislocated, both inside and outside.
And when the signs are that the ankle is swollen and painful in front of where it was bruised.
the swelling is lighter, and it must be extended lightly with the hands when he is only somewhat swollen.
And when it is swollen to its utmost, if you wish, sit the patient upright, and have one assistant stand by the leg above the ankle.
Take the pie to yourself with your right hand, then with your left hand twice, and stretch it up high, and put it entirely in the top.
and do this twice, as we have said, putting and taking the pie.
as long as it returns.
if it does not return, since the wound recurs, because it comes back.
and if it cannot return so, then put the patient lying on his back on the ground, and firmly insert a splint between his legs, and tie ropes around him, lest he bleed.
then tie the leg, and one other minister stretch the foot to its hands or to the bond that is tied around the neck of the foot. After that, stretch each of these ministers equally, and the bandages be tied between the knee bones of the patient to hold the patient when we stretch them;
Then put the fingers equally with the dislocation on its hands, and one other minister tightens the healthy leg below, and the dislocation will return quickly.
And when it heals at a point, if you put the plaster and poultice on it, and the strain forms, and tie the foot to the leg, and guard the nerves that are above the ankle, so that the ties are not too tight;
then let him stay for two days or three, and if the strain;
then release him on the third day or on the fourth, and defend for four days; If he goes ahead with the term, it is not a guarantee of safety; for there is still the possibility of dislocation once more.
And if an abscess comes up, so that it is healing, then you must calm it, as we have said elsewhere, until it is sound.
From two. When the two bones are dislocated, then they should be extended as much as possible with work, and it is a light thing.
If dislocation occurs in any joint on the back of the foot, it is advisable to sit the patient upright on either a low stool or table, and place your foot under that which appears to be loose on those joints, then press down firmly with your foot until it returns.
When it is equal and there is nothing open, place under the sole of the foot a wooden board with two nails, then press down firmly and let it stay for three days, then release. and make him rest until he is cured.
Injury and dislocation together
When a wound comes with the dislocation, and one tries to restore it, many patients die.
If you are not presumptuous in the cure, if you do not know the art and have not used it for a long time, and if you are not pitiful and merciful and slow to act, be hard-hearted.
and at the beginning of things, use soothing measures for an abscess of gallbladder, and let the patient be in God's hand, if you do not see any hope of recovery. and when you see hope, now reset the limb to its proper place, so that the abscess comes out.
and when the limb is set to its place, administer soothing measures for an abscess and treat the wound, as it should be, with dry bandages.
and if with the dislocation there is fracture and small bones are broken, set the bones, and do what we have said for simple diseases.
and beware of entering into a path of fear, as I have said, because this is what you deserve according to your Creator, and for the skill of your arm and body.
