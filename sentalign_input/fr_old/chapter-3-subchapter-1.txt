It is therefore fitting that we state in the prologue of this book the summaries of the discourse and the chapters where the wise man sets his understanding and dwells on the truth, so that those who are experienced know and learn this noble art, and teach it to others.
I say that when a fracture or dislocation or twist or break comes to someone, you must hasten to bleed the patient on one side and the other, unless something prevents it, such as weakness of the body, or children, or old people;
or if the weather is not too hot or too cold; and he should eat cool foods, that is to say, cold broths, and meat of birds and goat, and not drink wine, nor eat fatty meats, and not fill himself too much with foods that fill the veins with blood, so that you do not have to worry about hot abscesses or the spreading of matter in the limb; so the patient should return to his previous diet that he has used.
And when the broken bone begins to heal, it is necessary to nourish the patient with foods that provide thick nourishment, such as wheat cooked in water, and rice, and heads, and feet, and cow tripe, and eggs, and fresh fish, and strong wine, and similar things.
For with such nourishment the fracture heals much faster.
And know that the broken bones of the old and decrepit cannot heal well or fuse according to their nature due to the dryness of their limbs, nor can those that are too tender, like the bones of small children;
but it does not matter, the broken bone forms a thick tendon that surrounds and joins the limb together, strengthening it as before; and it does not lose its function, so it must be nourished with substantial foods, as we have said.
And know that fractures are varied in many ways.
For the fracture of the head is different from the fracture of the chest or the leg, and I will tell you in this chapter all kinds of fractures.
For there are fractures that are splintered, and others that are sharp, like the cut of a writing pen.
And there are fractures with a wound, and fractures with just a small crack.
And each type has its method and its appropriate instrument for restoration, according to what memory serves in its place;
and the fracture of the bone is known by the fact that the place is twisted, and it is clearly visible from the outside, and it sounds when pressed by the hand;
and when there is no twisting or sound upon touching, and the patient does not feel great pain, there is no fracture;
but it can very well have twisting, or a crack, or a small fracture.
So you should not move it with your hand, but apply medicines that will be described later, and then gently bind it.
And know that splintered fractures, where the two parts are disjointed, must be immediately set in place evenly before hot abscesses occur;
and if hot abscesses occur, leave it for a few days until the abscesses subside;
then set it evenly as much as you can, lightly and wisely, and know that the restoration of it is easier than the restoration of one with pieces; then bind it, as will be described later.
And if the bone has broken pieces, stretch it from two sides, if it is a hand or foot, or with your hand if it is a small limb, or with two cords, or with one cord and your hand;
and set the limb according to its natural shape, so that when the parts of the broken limb are separated, bring all the pieces back to their places by all means possible, and ensure that your work does not cause the patient injury or pain;
and align the two ends of the bones according to the best forms.
And feel it well with your hand to see if it seems not right: if so, adjust it gently, and do not bind it too tightly, nor press it as those do who cause hot abscesses and contraction in the limb by their work, as we have seen many times.
And when the limb is set, instruct the patient well not to move it, neither while awake nor asleep, nor while turning, nor in any other manner;
and ensure that the limb is so secure that it does not feel any pain.
For when it feels any pain, it is not set properly, and it needs to be positioned so that it does not feel any pain;
and ensure that it is set straight, so that there is no twisting when it is healed;
and the quality of the broken limb is as I have told you.
Know that broken limbs are varied in size, length, and shape.
For there are small limbs, such as arms and fingers and similar: they need to be wrapped in soft and fine linen cloths;
and those that are large, such as thighs and legs: they need to be wrapped with a wide and hard bandage, for the wide bandage embraces the entire large limb and compresses it evenly on all sides, so that there is no flaw;
then bind around it with light tow, three or four times according to the limb, and tighten it a little with your hand with the bandage, then go above the fracture and tighten less, so that the fracture itself is slightly away from the binding;
and soften the bandage little by little, so that you cover a large part of the healthy area, then take another bandage, and wrap again over the broken place;
then go below the fracture, and bind it moderately, not too tight nor too loose, as we have said in the first binding above;
then place between the bandages flax tow or cloths, until it is all even, then bind everything with a band, and then place your well-made splints on top, if there is no abscess or swelling.
And if there is swelling or an abscess, then apply something to soothe the hot abscess and reduce the swelling, and leave it for a few days;
then bind over the splints, which should be half of a wide split cane, or made of wood used for stakes, or palm branches, and should be in this shape:
but it is necessary that the splints placed on the fracture are a little thicker and wider than the others;
and be as long as necessary for the size of the limb, whether small or large;
then bind over the splints as you did with the first binding, then bind above with a fitting thread, as with the first binding on the fracture;
tighter at the top, gradually less; and the thread should be moderate, neither too thick nor too thin, and should be of soft linen;
for if the threads are thick, as I have seen the work of fools who make their bindings with twisted linen cords, it is a great error, for the binding cannot be even if it is too thin, and there should be at least a finger's width between each splint.
And if the patient is injured by the ends of the splints after binding on healthy areas, then place under them flax tow or teased wool, so that he does not get hurt.
When the wound is with the fracture, and the skin is broken, I will describe its treatment later.
And know that it is not necessary to bind all fractured limbs with splints on the first day.
For when the limb is large, it is not necessary to place splints until after five or seven days, or more depending on your certainty of preventing a hot abscess;
and here is the method of the ancient poultices for restoring fractures, dislocations, and twists: take flour that sticks to the walls of the mill, mix it with plenty of eggs, and apply this mixture, neither too thin nor too thick, and use it; this is the common method of the poultice for restoring fractures in various conditions, especially for women and small children, as it is neither too hot nor too cold.
Another method of poultice for restoring fractures, dislocations, and twists: take 3 drachms of abareis and ladanum and enula and asafoetida and gum arabic and mastic, each 10 drachms; myrrh and aloes, each 5 drachms; frankincense 9 drachms; and make a powder, mix them with plenty of eggs; if the person's complexion is warm, use this poultice, for it is a good composition, and restores broken bones quickly, and is beneficial for many people.
Another method of poultice for twists: take mastic and mallows, each 10 drachms; myrrh and aloes, each 9 drachms; acacia 6 drachms; Armenian bole 10 drachms, and grind well, mix with water or plenty of eggs, and apply.
Another method of poultice for joints and bones separated from their places, and to soothe the resulting pain, and the cut uses the bone and the fracture: take new wool, soak it in vinegar and cooked oil, and place it on the area. This poultice does not restore, but it is good for soothing hot abscesses, and properly removes pain.
Another method of poultice that restores broken bones: take dried fig leaves, and leaves of ground ivy, and grind them together, and make a poultice.
Another method of poultice for the restoration of a bone fracture and to reduce the remainder of the abscess. Take root of mallow, chamomile, violet flowers, vetch flour, each one part; and grind, and mix with wine, and if the limb is heated, mix it with coriander water or plain water, and apply.
Another method of poultice, stronger than the first, when a hard abscess occurs during the restoration of the limb. Take roots of mallow, linseed, pomegranate flowers, melilot, and elderflowers, and violet flowers and chamomile, each one part; and grind, and mix with saltwater or fresh water, or with wine, depending on the heat of the limb and its rest.
Hippocrates says in his book that one should not place on the broken limb for restoration anything other than a cerate made of wax and oil, and nothing else, and says it should be neither too soft nor too hard.
And Galen suggests that one should put on the broken limb, for restoration, slightly warm dry things, such as myrrh and aloes and incense and similar things, as we have said.
Another method of poultice that is good for injuries and pain: take mastic and cut human hair, or bird feathers, and mallow, and salt equally, and grind them, and make a poultice and apply it.
And then untie it a little later, and see if the patient does not feel any pain, and the bone has not moved from its place; if so, do not untie it for several days
And if pain comes to the area, or itching, without rest or swelling, then hasten and untie it, and remove the poultice immediately; and take a light cloth, and a moist sea sponge, and dip it in water, and clean the area, until the itching stops, and the pain is soothed;
then let the limb rest for an hour, then put on dry wool, moistened with water or rose oil, and bind it for a night, until you are sure of preventing a hot abscess;
and relieve the inflammation of the limb, and remove the pain, then restart the subtle binding, and a little poultice, and do not bind it as tightly as before; and refine it until it is healed.
And if you see that the hot abscess and redness and pain and swelling are already gone, and you need poultice and bandage, then restart it, just as you did at first equally.
And if none of what we said occurs to the limb, do not untie it until after three days or four or five or seven; and sometimes leave it for twenty days, depending on what is seen, until the fracture heals, and the joining of the flesh approaches;
then bind it tighter than before, and enrich its nourishment, as I said earlier; and if you see the area drying more than necessary, know that nourishment cannot come to it;
then moisten it with warm water every time you untie it, and this should be every third day, and loosen the binding a little;
thus the nourishment will flow to the limb, and quickly correct what the foolish doctors do, who restore the limb crookedly: this is bad, and such work is dangerous, and I see no other way than to bind and work it properly.
