 CHAPTER THIRTY-TWO.
On cauterization of the legs and feet.
 When, in the sufferer from dropsy, these swell and become full of yellowish fluid, you should cauterize the upper surface of the feet in the depression between the little and fourth toes; hold your hand upright with the cautery; do not let it slant.
Then remove your hand and do no more cauterization whatever; for the yellowish fluid will exude.
The cautery should be of this type.
Then sear the legs with two cauterizations on each leg; cauterize with the bladed end of the cautery, and let it be along the length of the leg: one under the knee, the other lower than that, about the middle of the leg; and two more cauterizations over each femur.
Leave the burns open without treatment for a long while during which the fluid will exude from them.
Then dress with all that we have described.
