Chapter Ten.
On the treatment of pterygium that occurs in the eyelid.
Pterygium is a small fleshy mass that forms in the layers of the upper eyelid, and it most commonly occurs in children, and it makes their eyes heavy, and they experience discharges in the mornings, and they are unable to look at sunlight.
Because tears flow to them quickly.
Therefore, you see them always leaning on their faces, and they sleep on them, and their eyelids are moist under the eyebrows, swollen and puffy, and the pterygium appears clearly. When you press the area with your fingers, you feel the pterygium between them.  The procedure is that the patient places his head in your lap.
Then you take a linen cloth and prepare a wick from it and make a circle from that wick as large as it surrounds the pterygium from all sides, then you place it on it and press with your fingers from all sides to gather the pterygium in the center of the circle.
Then you make a transverse incision in the middle of that moist area with a lancet. The incision should not be larger than the incision made in bloodletting. As for the depth, you should incise the entire skin until you reach the pterygium.
In most cases, the pterygium protrudes from the incision like a piece of white fat. You pull it out with a cloth wrapped around your fingers while rotating your hand right and left until it comes free. Beware of extending the incision, lest the lancet slip into the eye and injure it.
If the pterygium does not appear to you at the first incision, you should gently extend the incision a little until the pterygium appears, then pull it out as we have said. Then dip a cloth in vinegar and water and place it on the area and bandage it softly. Some people crush salt.
And place it in the incision to dissolve what remains of that moisture, then treat it until it heals. If a hot swelling occurs in the area, treat it with soothing compresses until it heals.
