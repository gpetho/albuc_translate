Chapter Twenty-One.
On the treatment of a fracture if it has healed but the limb remains thinner than its original form.
If a bone fracture has healed but the limb remains thin and weak, it is due to many reasons.
One of them is either due to repeated loosening and improper tightening of the bandages, or excessive tightening of the bandages preventing nourishment from reaching the limb, or excessive suspension, or excessive movement at the wrong time, or insufficient blood and weakness in the patient's body.
The treatment for this is to nourish the patient and enrich his body until his blood increases, and to use the bath, and to bring him joy and happiness, and so forth. Then, apply tar to the limb so that the tar draws much nourishment to it, or continuously suspend it in lukewarm water.
Until nourishment flows into it and it returns to its natural form.
