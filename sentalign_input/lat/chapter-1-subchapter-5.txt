On the method of cauterizing in cases of ear pain.
Chapter VI.
When pain in the ear occurs due to cold, and it is treated with loosening agents and the remaining treatment mentioned in the division, and the pain does not subside, then heat the cautery, called "the Point," which has this shape.
Then, after heating it, use it to puncture around the entire ear, as it is revolved, or around both if there is pain in both ears at the same time.
And keep the cautery a little distance from the root of the ear after marking the locations with ink; let the amount of cautery be about ten points on each ear, or so.
Then treat the locations until they heal.
