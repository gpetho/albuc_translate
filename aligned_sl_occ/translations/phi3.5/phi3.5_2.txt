So, children, you have completed this book which I present to you now, as the culmination of your science in medicine and through my lectures (and discussions), it has become evident that you understand deeply this subject matter we are covering today—that is from surgery. Here's what each part means:
When the operation is exhausted in our region and at all times of complete privacy, enter so that by your science you observe it; there are only small descriptions found freely among Ancient texts, which I modify herein as errors and ignorance have been locked into them over time. These corrections aim to clarify their intentions (i.dictio) and elongate the understanding of our art.
Here it is stated that I have seen you following the order of this treatise in accordance with its exposure and explanation phases; thus ensuring readiness for handling cautery tools and other instruments needed for execution as per declaration necessity.
May be the reason why no skilled artisan leaves his tool at his belt in our times, for medicine is a long-standing profession and to excel as its practitioner requires knowledge of body movements and forms of these parts; understanding joint connections and separations, bone structure, nerves, muscles (lacertz), their names, organs' functions, pulsing veins, resting vessels, and sites of internal examination.
Through the water of Hippocrates that I hold dear as my name's medicine, it may contribute in a minor way and primarily to the field of healing arts.
We now have it from there in the entrance of this free; who does not know what we have told him about anatomy, will fall into error and serve death if he has seen anything like these things, which are formed herein and taken according to that science and those experiments.
Here is the line-by extralinguistic translation: When a doctor with foliage and expertise made an incision in the woman'se chest, making several cuts into her chest arteries so that copious blood entered where she died between them.
And another doctor ordered that the patient ingest a stone from a home which had been processed in his/her state; the stone was large and entered into their body through one of the bladder's pores, resulting in death on the third day for this home.
And you have already called for it to be removed therefrom, and because of the greatness of the stone and due consideration given by virtue of its position in the womb that they will die herein.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And another doctor took his salary from our land'supreme duke for surgery; and he brought with him an iron knife that had broken in the patient's thigh, due to ignorance of the surgeon, who worsened the fracture on the ground using heavy blows at pillows and beds.
Here translates to: Place the lash according to your wishes, and bind it securely with cord or rope over several days at nighttime as directed by us; thus entering until the thigh is exposed through the portal of entry into loss.
And he called upon him/her, and prepared the ligature to remove it, thereby achthy peace was obtained from his/her pains.
Even if there has been confirmed decay in the limb, it cannot be restrained and must not wander within where the malady resides under the humour' extrusion (pericolazione).
And another doctor pierced an abscess and it ruptured within days; as its malignity grew increasingly evident under the watch of his lordship.
The cause is that the head'dict has been affected by melancholic humors; it does not happen to him as whole, but rather in one of his limbs which was previously harbored therein.
For you, it is necessary that the operation be planned in two parts: one for health associated with life and another where there is potential danger involved in major operations.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Therefore take up your weapons for solicitude and protection of God, and for the health and firmness of those who are ill.
Even though we have lost our way and are in need of salvation and praiseworththy succession, let us confront the most terrible illnesses that require difficult healing, holding fast to your faith and name so you do not abandon them: for perhaps they may remain with you as a source of glory, placing some even within yourself or at home among your sanctified souls.
When gout attacks some of its patients: Not every physician knows this illness, so that bad doctors will not name it.
And already you have ventured further in this text by three chapters.
Begins with the division of free will, and first in the primary partition. The ordered first chapter within the feet, in terms of instruments and metals for cauteries, what is required therein.
La division of the second section. The Second Chapter on Surgery and Perforation, and of Vials, Pus, Abscesses, Extraction of Herbs and Similars to these, all has been ordered regarding the forms of instruments.
The third part of restoration and loosening, as well as healing the twist and disguises for these; ordered within our heads above the body weight, and forms of instruments.
When you determine the quality of that very caustic and its contents are not allowed in any part of him,
Therefore say that the language of cautery and its obscurity is long and complex according to science; they are disagreeable in discussion, and I have had enough for having heard much from them, which makes it difficult to follow their discourse continuously.
And therefore it is said that the pointed cautery comforts all of the body universally, except for two kinds of matter (the ones at the tail ends), which are parts of its material.
In the complex and dry matter of the tail; those who use needles are beneficial for that area, while others apply what is contrary to it, as this moisture or fluid needs treatment with wet cupping (cupping therapy), which relates to its quality and dryness. The nature of such ailments in the head where there'thy water and aridity; suitable are those who perform treatments using watery means for these conditions since it concerns both moisture deficiency and lack of humidification, making wet cupping an appropriate treatment.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "Examine that which speaks against it; for with cautery, they are greatly effective in curing all types of dry and parched diseases found on men'thy body parts when you compare the man’s limbs to their humors.
And as for the speech of that person, I have already experienced some signs myself.
Even if it is necessary to perform cautery above what has already been extracted and exercised during the day's practice at the tool of cauterization, understand the complexity of human nature and how diseases manifest in their bodies, as well as the causes of those ailments and their timing.
May occur in other complexities as well; it is not due to fear but mainly from cold sweats and dampnesses—all physicians agree on these matters, without exception when performing cauterization therein.
And where wisdom dictates that the focus and health of each person determine whether we apply cautery on the body or medicine, it is clear that when focusing sole extrication (cauterization), this instrument affects only the part to which it has been applied and not impacting other parts adjusted for small harm.
May the medicine cause a burn to reach that in his limb which he languishes from illness and make it difficult for him to recover healthily, quickly causing an urgent need for treatment (medicine).
May the fire (likely referring to a heating treatment or device), due to its sublimity and beneficial substance, does not cause harm except when it overflows. And we are aware through experimentation and long-term study of servitude in learning this art about the truth of causes; therefore you are excused from lengthy speech (possibly referring to lectures or discussions). As for now during this break, I secretly tempt your focus on the fire'thy quality—this operation carried out at these joints and through which we expel illnesses. This will be demonstrated with philosophic discourse suitable for meditation in their minds (possibly referring to patients taking notes or pondering deeply).
And learned men, who understand that it is best in the early morning to perform cauterizations and breaks for healing purposes.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "E yeu dic that cautery is convenient at all times, in order that harm caused by water retained within it may be drawn out and primarily when ache or necessary pains occur with quickness so as not to delay those which are expected from malicious ones; for such small harms entering over time far exceed the minor drawback of using cautery.
So do not sit in your feet, or hips, for they are only valued by the common people and ignorant physicians; hence it is that healing through cautery cannot completely eradider this illness immediately, and causes a delay of consequence.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Even though too much use of cautery may occur in medicine due to the patient'se urge and operation vigor, as well as great power held by their lord/master.

The cause is contrary to water; I understand that the instruments of healing are only used when administering remedies for some illnesses, and these medicines do not confer their effects themselves, but it's applied by a physician at the root of the cause, and deepens understanding towards this. From here onwards, as the treatments with cautery are considered in medicine, according to what is commonly understood by most physicians and others of a similar mindset.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And those made of gold are better than those made of iron for caulceir (cauterization), and they did not use them except for their equality with gold and refinement of its substance.

The First Point (or Principle).
This cauterization confers moisture and coldness upon the accident that is your cause; it arises from excessive body fluid (luxuria), running downstream from head to limbs and joints, along with prolonged sleeping, toothache, gouty pain, universally due to bodily chilliness, accompanied by paralysis, coma, apoplexy, and resemblance in these illnesses.
The form of this cauterization is as follows: initially command the humors to be expelled through medicinal leaks for three or four nights, according to what exhorts from the malady and its patient' extraneousness (age), customarily.
Return the command of their head to its rightful place and apply that tool between your thighs on an elevated bed, holding them over their chest area for support.
When you pause your thumb on the back of your hand over the bridge of your nose between your nostrubs, Whenever the heat arrives from where it has come, this place attempts to push back with fire (the form of which is represented by the ointment), and soothes.

Return your hand over him at his navel entrance, and place that thereon which has been destroyed by the focus of fire or cold medicine application inwardly within him. Return care is given where there's a snake wound within that it should be healed, indicating treatment of such injuries with medication or other therapedictory measures for recovery in the pasted context:
And when a child is taken out (presumably for relief or treatment), such as holding their legs in honeycombs to make it better and more joyful—this suggests an old remedy where gentle restraint, perhaps with something soft like plaster braces made from beeswax known historically as "honey," was used. Here's the translation
And when they take (presumably a healer or caretaker) the child for cauterization of the navel within their body, and have the instruments therein to treat any fractured parts—this implies that in some form of medieval medicine practice, careful procedures were performed on infants with particular emphasis placed upon treating internal wounds using various tools or medicinal agents inside.
When it is necessary for bone marrow that has come out of the bone and requires care, then do so accordingly with its needs/treatment.
Here comes another who arrives at the knife' extrinsically (implying that they come into contact with or use a sharp object), and while doing so enters where strong bones are present before entering where the bones crack, which is considered this form of small surgery: And from that place exhale the humors of the head.
If there is an abscess that has been present for a long time, then treat it until it becomes solidified.
May I not see these various cautery tools for all, but only in learned men following a different path of fear; and this one, you must provide me with greater health when my head is lifted by the sun's position during our daylight hours together, especially since it belongs naturally to the malady above.
When it comes to early use of pointed cautery, I find them more saving and beneficial than ever before; from that which has already been done for their health.

When the headache is chronic and long-lasting, and blood accumulants in the abdomen for a prolonged period of time; using knives, scalpels, lancing instruments, tourniquets, cuffs (bandages), pessaries, liniments, poultices, slings, belts or other treatments—mostly if previously cauterized with one such instrument and not properly healed. Moreover, consider that the abdomen's natural structure is strong; it does not easily succumb to severe force without injury—if this has happened due to a lack of proper care for an existing wound or other cause, then immediately use another cautery on the spot (this implies urgent and focused treatment), as necessary. Return that over the top of your head for it is time to apply cautery within where the spinal cord has been divided. Cut the tongue and reveal the bone thickness we have counted and treated with a heating instrument in the back part of the head where it is applied—this is the location being suctioned by air (ventoscope). And lift your hand so high that you do not discover the thighs, for when applied to them by this remedy it causes a great pain different from the pains of other caustics on the head.
And apply this cautery in its place, so that the cautery there will treat the corns on the head and back of the skull, which is treated by such a treatment herein described.

When joint pain is solid or when there's internal bleeding inside the knee causing severe discomfort (implied by "cap dolor sodo"), and it’s a condition of urgent medical treatment ("elh" referring to what seems like an old term for hemorrhage), both should be addressed with medicinal cauterization or, alternatively, using iron. This is done in the context of treating diseases; thus avoiding any further action beyond these remedies (implied by "no aprofieyta"). The treatment involves two methods: immediate medical combustion for quick absorption ("cauterisacio am medicina acuta"), or cauterization with a metal tool, possibly iron as mentioned.
Maycalets are used in medicine to take hold of a pewter vessel and remove the extremities from both vessels for you. Once you have identified the location of pain on the temple with one sharp lance hidden within its area where bone (cranium) is present, then:

Return the pause over the location of pain, and hold your hand—so that the iron needle does not stick out (which has been previously used), twist it slowly by speed for careful work.
If the amount of blood that is collected through the stool indicates how much has been absorbed by your body and you ensure your hand over it to prevent arterial constriction which could lead to bleeding (flux di sangre), then take care accordingly so as not to let any excessive flow occur.
Here is the translation line by line:

From what you've provided, it seems like the text might be a mixture of Latin and possibly regional medical jargon or shorthand from an older
When you treat emigration-related issues that have been previously discussed, and what has been mentioned about the divisions of diseases, if not properly attended to or treated, sometimes for a disease whose potions (medicinal remedies) we've spoken about earlier – including those meant specifically as cauterizing salves applied externally at wounds/incisions intended for curative purposes and internal applications via the mouth administers of medicine - there is pain along long lines that mark where this sickness (possibly a type or lineation related to emigration-related conditions) lies. You then apply pressure with your hand, restrained by time spent within these confines using an awl – which I interpret as being used here metaphorically rather than literally for cauterization - and ensure that it reaches the spot of pain along this long line wherein resides its essence or core.
However, it is necessary for you to guard against the continuation of the grinding jaw, which must be used for chewing, and that there not be tightness or pain in the nerves associated with this movement, so as not to provoke a spasm.

When in the thorn there is pain caused by a flaw and it requires healing according to what has been stated herein (or elsewhere), but this does not alleviate the suffering. Hence, ignite cauterization with fire; that's which we refer to as puncture for relief of such anguish.
Here comes the first source sentence translated into English: Apply points with ignition and carry it throughout all of the body'dictus area or through any given segment where pain is experienced, using a rotating wheel if necessary. Long you hold the cautery of the red-hot iron near where your limb tries to stretch,

The process or act of cauterizing a wound, typically in the context provided here would be translated into English
The wound that is being treated with cautery consists of spices brought in by the veins, as mentioned in our divisions concerning diseases.
Avoid using special caustic that is needed due to dryness or paralysis of nerves.
When you treat that particular type of torture and cleaning out feces and putrefaction, so as not to impair your healing process; then take care that the tools for treating this condition are three cauteries: one made from a golden hook, the second small touch with temple movements, and thirdly, use the union of two lips.
When applying the pointed cautery for the contrary parts of the sick body section, it soothes only in the healing portion that appears.
The method of cauterization is to apply the caustic on top of the head' extramundy part, and in the temples, where its length equals that of the patient's beard growth, keep your hand applying it until sufficient has been burned off.
This is how it works with a cautery and belongs specifically to barber surgeons; this form I present now. May there be subtlety so that one who scarcely breathes can do so under you; and when excessive swelling of a few accumulates, take action immediately.

The line "Capitol .vii." suggests that the following content is likely related to section VII of some larger text, perhaps detailing ancient
When apoplexy is ancient and the remedies we have mentioned apply—if your physician does not observe fever in the patient's blood—then you shall perform this procedure with four types of cautery: upon all their head hair; on both ears at the same time, as discussed hereinabove (as indicated by our previously stated methods); and for any swelling or inflammation ('coguot') within these regions. The action of the pointed cautery is said to be caused when it is lifted up as per what has been previously stated.

The translation for this medieval phrase would be: "Reduce the head of the hernia and place your hand on it, as described in the section about strains." In modern medical terminology, this could mean that a healthcare professional should apply manual techniques to alleviate or compress (possibly via bandaging) the swolthy part of an inguinal hernia following specific procedures outlined elsewhere
This translates to: "And after a few days (or perhaps when it is necessary), then apply the points." In contemporary terms, this suggests that following initial treatment or observation period for an injury—which could be wound dressing in modern medical practice The translation is: "And after the amount of wine mentioned earlier, which has already been discussed." In today's context, this might refer to a specific dosage and frequency recommendation for alcohol (w
This line translates to: "And if for those who are ill (boes), then after three cauterizations in the previous division of your head, these will be from the portion above within which is located at the base of the neck." In a modern medical interpretation, this could refer to an intervention where specific locations on someone's scalp or forehead receive targeted treatments for health issues—potentially implicating procedures like cauterization used in various historical contexts. The reference points ("portion above within which is located at the base of the neck") might correspond with areas considered significant by ancient practitioners, possibly relating to vital body systems or le And there is space between each of these instruments, and take care that this water which flows comes out properly.

The provided medieval medical text seems jumbled between several languages with some Latin
This line appears to be a blend of terms from different historical periods and could relate to various treatments:
When you process in the head area and remove what has been said; and return your hand to the back of the neck, where apply a caustic for that place on the top of the head, as well as over all parts thereof (the forehead), and three cauterisms are performed upon the vertebrae of the spine.
If it is necessary in the illness of suppression for that foot'dictorate to eliminate those humors there and if the malady itself is severe, then apply four cauterizations on the vertebrae of the back, and insert them within such a way as they may become comfortable from under the chin. Return that which has been healed inside with olive oil treatment and take care of it; this is also about cautery made from olive wood.

This phrase appears to be related to a medical context, specifically concerning the treatment for seizures (epilepsy). Here
The line translates from Latin-influenced syntax into English as: "It is not the patient with epilepsy that has been cauterized, but rather it's through restraint." This suggests an ancient medical approach where instead of direct inter
The provided line translates into English as: "Thus, we cover the patient'dictor’s mind at mealtime and for other care prescribed upon division when excess humors are present and can be tolerated through medicine." Here, it seems that a treatment approach involves covering or possibly healing the 'mind', potentially referring to addressing neurological symptoms such as those seen in certain forms of epilepsy. The term "mondify" could suggest some form of purification process using food (meal time) combined with prescribed treatments that come into effect when there's an imbalance
The line translates as: "If the patient is an infant who does not tolerate medicine, administer linseed emollients and digestives serums to this servant of mind at mealtime for several days in order to improve food intake." Herein lies a medieval practice where gentler substances such as linseed (flax) are used possibly due to the patient's age or mild reaction, with an emphasis on gradual dietary enhancement through these supplemental serums during meals for several days. This highlights tailored care
The translation of this medieval line into English would be: "Then raise the hairline of the hump and apply that which is a pointed instrument to where there's already an incision made by previous treatment, as well applying another pointed cautery on their skull base, while also cauterizing each kernel at these points." This suggests specific interventional practices such as lifting up skin lesions (hairline of the hump), using precise instruments for making incisions or treating pre-existing wounds and applying targeted cauterizations. The term "cauterize" here refers to a technique used by ancient physicians, potentially involving heat application on affected areas – If the humors are strong and bearable, then heat those areas with caustics where I have indicated, to cause paralysis and softening of the body over the vertebrae of the back and of the two (i.dictate these cauterizations).
And when it is necessary for a second time of use of olive oil as an instrument (cauterization), then so shall be used accordingly at that moment in its

This line suggests the application of a specific treatment believed by medieval practitioners to have beneficial Heat that has been carefully applied over the focus (a body part possibly referring back earlier in context) for warmth measures—this causes discomfort when one lies down on it or otherwise comes into contact with said area, suggesting a treatment meant to alleviate pain upon touching something warmed specifically. Here "foc Return that to the neck area at the head's base in its circle (likely referring back earlier), and wrap it tightly so it is well secured or bandaged on; this suggests an action taken for either warmth, compression therapy, or protection of a wound/injured part.

Wash that area of the groin throughout the week with clean linens inside it—this is part of another regimen, allowing for healing; or if necessary, anesthetize small points on this affected region as directed by law (perhaps referring to guidelines set out in a medical text), using specifically those types of cauterizing needles that moisten the brain upon application. This line suggests specific hygiene practices and various treatment methods including careful washing, rest or compression therapy for healing, along with controlled use of topical anesthesia potentially involving particular herbs (signified by "specia de cauteiris") believed to have this special property when applied evenly. The mentioning of the brain ("cervel am equalitat" translates roughly as “brain at balance”) suggests a concern for maintaining or restoring proper bodily functions, perhaps hinting towards humoral theory where imbalances

When you declared the consumption of water into the wound through your joints during division and distribution (possibly referring to a treatment method), it is then that begins this process: Pouring clean water from above cleanses the head, while protecting against all moisture reaching there. The text appears to describe an early form of hydrotherapy or topical application using water for healing purposes in medieval times—a concept not unfamiliar when considering today's physical therapy practices which also involve manipulation with fluids and temperature as part of treatment regimens, although modern approaches are based on extensive scientific research.

When ancient tears of the veins and arteries are tightly compressed in the region where it is evident that there are too many phlebitic varices (which refers to swollen, twisted veins), we perform cautery on what has been previously mentioned in Chapter XXIII regarding water cupping therapy inside the hollows of these vessels. We also apply cauterization at the head location and two cauterisms are applied within the neck's temple area—two implements for each temporal bone, respectively (the translation interprets "templas" as temples or sockets associated with temporal bones in anatomical terms). If there are ingestions of addition (which can refer to excess or imbalance in the body), then burn that entire part above the hip bone on the upper extension of the small cautery instrument.

When the patient's eyelid is affected by disease or moisture, it will be treated with this specific form of cauterization known as "lunar" treatment. This represents how doctors address such conditions according to medieval medical practice described herein. The term “cauteriza” refers to the act of intentionally burning a part of the body using heat or chemicals, typically used in ancient and early modern medicine for various reasons including sterilization (to prevent infection) and stopping bleeding after an injury—a concept that has influenced medical practices up until today
If you were to perform this procedure as described in the text: apply a small amount of caustic substance (this could be referring back to various forms such as mercury or another cauterizing agent used historically) onto both eyebrow rims, they would elongate.

When you cure a fistula (abscess), adhere to what we've discussed regarding the divisions of diseases and do not neglect your treatment; thus, how you conduct the lancing should follow this method: command bile into its thoracic cavity so that it does not spill out from whereever. Keep some servant within those interstices (spaces between organs) in such a way as to prevent leakage or agitation atop these locations without disturbing them excessively with your hand's pressure during the procedure—this reflects historical medical practice which often involved direct manipulation of body humors and used tools like servants ('ministries') for internal support.

In this line, the term "cauterize" refers to the process of burning a wound or lesion on purpose (ussando fuego)
When there is an ulcer on the uvula or in the palate, and it has become crusted over (esproucada) with age-related lesions (antiguata), a fistula develops; thus you must apply your remedy to that area without furthering its healing – provided there is something we've prescribed for this treatment. Apply the recommended amount of cautery heat, as directed in relation to the location and size of the ulcer (fractura), placing it at the site where fire will travel upwards from within until reaching above your head; then continue with two days or a course of therapy – while you do this ensure that warmth is maintained internally. Apply what we have prescribed for healing during this process, enssuring complete recovery as indicated by our guidance (curas).
So if the disease is removed and healthy again, be content with it; but if not, you must discover where it has eroded its course according to how much will come forth in one'sin examination.

Place these burning instruments nearer over each affected tooth so that its heat can penetrate and heal the decayed areas within, all contained safely inside an enclosure which you will provide (perhaps suggesting some form of protection like gauze or a cloth).
And lift your hand, and apply the pointed cautery several times as you wish.

The phrase appears to be referring to the treatment of a chest illness and cough:
When a cough and lung disease are caused by moist humors, there is no fever or chills present because it'dictates an ancient illness (presumably pneumonia), thus two cauterisms will be performed on the sternum at locations between the collarbone joints in the neck bones; furthermore, another lancet-like tool for cautery shall also operate around the chest region where there are breasts. These procedures adhere to previous forms of treatment (implying that they follow a traditional or established method).
If you wish, your cautery points will be the very same ones that are called out for joint pain in auricular areas (forehead). The form of these points comes before their use for addressing such pains.
And when points are entered into those places, take care of that which has been put in there to make it heal properly.

Even a home from ancient times performs the operation and care for which healed ankle and sciatic pain relief are to be greatly desired, without needing further treatment; four days of rest according to recommendation restore that very intimate in baths and massage with their own hands.
And if there is pressure from certain stones (gallstones), and if they are not expelled vertically (naturally), it is taken forcefully as a fresh stone; the stone is crushed into a few grains and placed in the belly where there is pain, or on the thighs, or knees, and tied.
When it settles for three hours or according to how much humidity the malady releases from congestion,
Return that in the bath and when the patient' extrinsic part is rubbed off, insert it back into the body so that there should be no more pain and healing can occur.
Be aware that you do not cover your body with caustic substances but rather facilitate the elimination from the body through these remedies.
May Escorides say that when the vein of a goat is cauterized, it stimulately his blood; and these are its remedies: wool robe taken and olive oil impregnated with antidotes, placed between the toes of the foot and among the bones.
Return the barbed fork dry and rusty into where it is burning coal, placing your pause on wool or linen within that which has become drawn tightly; hold their hands in this manner. Return the water internally and do not stop until the venom from the knife penetrates into the thigh, then rest to alleviate the pain.
And this operation of cauterization is called caustic probes (or perhaps more accurately, "cautery tools" or instruments for burning). Here the term 'maniere' could mean technique and ‘cauterium

Regarding the treatment for joint pain, it's called burning therapy (or perhaps more accurately "cauter
Some pains are in the lower body due to causes such as blockages or impacts and also for reasons akin to these, through absorption of moistened impure substances. Here 'dos' likely refers broadly to various parts below (perhaps not strictly literal 'two'), suggesting multiple factors might contribute to joint pain in this context. The term ‘infusio’ indicates that the treatment involves some form of dissolving or soaking up these harmful humors through moistened substances, which could be a poultice made with water and impure materials believed by medieval practitioners (and as per
And it is not in these operations of burning, but rather a specific kind that we find effective for the expulsion (or dissolution) of impure humors which are believed to be causing harm and pain as described earlier on how they can enter through various blockages or impacts. Here 'es fayta' likely means is
So it is through the use of poultices that have been prepared with impure substances (or perhaps more fittingly as understood by contemporary standards might be, 'irritants') and similar in form to these obstructions or resemblance causing pain within three lines below according to their teachings. It suggests placing fingers into each line where the poultice has been applied while also employing cautery if necessary – guided not just by necessity but considering both the tolerance of humors and health status as understood at that time, in accord with medical customs then practiced (or perhaps more fittingly modernized to 'consider patient's condition'). Here ‘malaute’ would likely mean a conglomeration or mixture believed responsible for disease within; medieval doctors might think of it metapzically as impure humors, and the text outlines their treatment approach in line with what was understood by them.
And it is necessary for a burn treatment with pointed cautery points.

And in the lower back and neck vertebrae of him/her that has already begun to rise above the others.
And when you press and try to prevent it from spreading, then apply that pointed instrument in a circle according to this shape. That applies pressure with the cautery over the entire region of the spinal disc engaged in movement.
If you wish, perform cauterization along the spinal cord at the points of puncture either two lines or three. These are the points made by them.
Return care for the location where it has been healed by what we have administered.
May there be caution that cautery is not applied in a bleak place but for muscle spasm relief.

Regarding the cautery treatment for gout and joint pain:
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Therefore when gout is cured by the healing of its cause and not recurrences are left behind, then apply bandages to prevent further pains.
When you are cauterizing that which exits in the bowels through the joint of the foot and leg, as if with caustic instruments (cauterization).
That is the form of this tool: (likely referring to a pointed instrument or device used by doctors)
If it is necessary to make points on the surface of the foot, then use a pointed cautery for that purpose. If pains penetrate into the abdomen or other joints and there arises a movement, then it is necessary to apply caustic at that location using one of three or four lancets belonging entirely to this cauterizer.
If you need lancets for these lancets, then do not press your hand on the instrument beforehand; send only the applicator of the urethra therein at once.
If pain enters into both hips, then apply the mentioned cautionary measures that we have discussed in this chapter.
If the pain is only in the limbs and it calls for sweat, then prick into the circulation of the humors as they turn within themselves, pierce those two lines.
If there remain pains in the joints, then a point is made on the circumference of each node and around the navel area.
If joint or muscle pain comes on during the courses of days in the hips or thighs, then doctors will perform cauterization throughout the entire body with all their tools.
And if the melancholy is not expelled through good diet and medicine intake, even then if a proper treatment with this instrument (cauterizer) cleanses it, God helps.
In this given medieval medical text written in a language that has some similarities with
The phrase "Capitol .xlv." seems to be an incomplete or shorthand reference, potentially indicating the
When there is an opening in the intestines, and you place a cautery adjacent to the navel (referring back to "atela al genetiu"), then instruct that which belongs within it should be removed from its daily activities so as not to exac0dy further damage. This suggests using less strenuous tasks or causes lenient enough to prevent worsening of an intestinal rupture inside the body ("la fenda deyssende del sieu ventre").
Here it goes: Return the prolapse of the womb between your thighs and on their chest, commanding that it enter through an opening or appears as a hernia/protrusion (or belly swelling).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Return that which has returned, and attempt not to break it over the bones of the limb whose tip resembles the extremity of a circle at these lower divisions of the body.
Return the hot points of this instrument:
When it is time for an urgent request and you set up needlepoints. Return the intestine or hernia back into its cavity, and place your hand over the area to prevent it from protruding outward.
You have already opened the space between the patient' extradural (possibly referring to 'maloat', similar to lumbar in English) and their thighs, with a cushion under them; another servant has been placed on their legs while another is positioned on their chest, holding their hands.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Observe the flame of the intestine during your cautery, to ensure that it does not burn up on the hernia or cause a great harmony.
When you understand that when using the cautery, you do not touch the patient' extrinsic parts (limbs), and thus should not perform your operation on them.
And when it is necessary for children' extrication with a small and precise needle as per their size.

When twisting or striking the members causes pain that persists for a long time and does not relieve from medicine treatment, it is said that one should apply cautery to the point(s).
When using instruments for all body parts according to their magnitude and smallness, as well as the condition of expansion and development within them, areas of twist and pain in it are considered.
So if it heals through the first lancets (cauterization), then be; but if not, repeat over him those same lancets directed towards that member which approaches to the urethra (the opening for urine and semen in males), so that further application of these instruments may lead to the cure of this malaise within it.

From this single line, the translation into English would be: "On leprosy treatment." Here's a
Translation: "For the treatment of leprosy using caustic substances for substantial healing if caused by decomposition of fat and melancholy." This sentence suggests that, in medieval medicine, a specific type of cauterizing agent was used to treat certain cases of what they referred to as 'lepra,' believed herein potentially arising from internal decay (fat) combined with emotional distress or depression ('melancholy').
And when you intend to cauterize that part (of the body), consider if leprosy is present and has been cured by the water we mentioned earlier in division, neither here nor there today; fear for corruption encompassing all of the patient's body and their complexity. Cauterize it on the head where a combustion occurs (scalp), after taking care of both breasts at appropriate times from life; touch behind two calluses each, one between shoulders/backstrap held by servant, another under arms or chest area: these are all parts that should be cauterized.
Here comes the last of your lancets to enter where pressure is applied into the bone, and their scrapings are displaced by air from it out; then burn over the wound according to what was requested earlier.
If leprosy has already spread over the thigh and appears manifestly, then you must cauterize that area with these same caustics we have in our cap; on the extremity of the nose, two caustics are placed—one above each kneecap. Two caustics are applied to both hips (hips), and two onto each spinal column at those points where leprosy appears (the sacral vertebrae). A large cauterism is done on either of the hip joints, a burning treatment over the shoulder blade; for all kneecaps there are two caustics applied. Two burnings made to both feet's ankles and one each upon every toe-joint (and thus in total three per foot); onto muscle groups where leprosy appears as well on tendons, with these same cauterisms used—two for the thigh joints/hip sockets; two over knee joint areas. Additionally:
Guard your nerves that are over the ankle so they do not burn them.
And in some cases they are cauterized with a hot lancet on the bones of the pelvis and mouth of the stomach, and another over the womb (uterus).
E understand that the more you adjust the cautery, the more it can heal and provide relief; likewise, know that gout does not cause pain in the caustic itself when held as your hands do now with these instruments on his body already numb from our treatments.
Wherever the cautery should be large or small according to the parts and joints, as prescribed by the tools of our instruments.
Return care for the points made of lead, charcoal and other remedies within which it shall be healed.
Capitol .xlviii. (The original text does not provide further context for
Cauterizes in amazement." This phrase seems to suggest a method of treatment or medical procedure that
When any member is struck or sleeps and requires healing by physicians, apothecaries, and attendants—and it does not heal on its own accord—then cauterize that affected limb according to the greatness of the member's injury or smallness. This line translates a medieval medical practice where extreme measures such as burning (cauterizing) were used for treating wounds, particularly when conventional treatments did not yield healing on their own:
And if it enters into the hollow of the neck with a small instrument (cauterizer). Return that which is inside with care so it may heal.
Sometimes bleeding has occurred within the body or in the feet and backbone vertebrae due to nerve vessels' leakage of that member, causing pain; this condition is then stopped by cauterization.
May not press upon it, but rather that one who is knowledgeable in the anatomy of the body and nerve exits throughout its movements.

Of purplish scab formation that it is a process of cauterization (or burning). Here's how each line translates into English, maintaining
When purplish scabs are ancient and do not comfort the patient through their dressings (medical bandages), then cauterize over that which is already prepared as a small amount beforehand according to what enters into its cavity, where it has become moistened with bile and blood color changes.

When any abdomen (adabiliato) doesn't ripen in time, or due to excess fat deposits, poor health conditions of the womb (malaute), or because too much has passed with insufficient sanctity and care—then it is necessary to promote its maturation; therefore, cauterize herein where small punctures have been made for this purpose. Afterward, apply oil thereafter which will satiate the area needed during ripening.
If you wish to perform the operation of this tool, then heat it for use as a cautery; keep it in the place where medicinal substances are administered until they pass through the catheter.

The provided Latin-influenced text translates to: "Corrosion wanders in the limb, which is acted upon similarly as dry wood burning at an open flame." Here's what each part means within this context of medieval medical understanding:
Therefore, when you see the spot where he suffered with a lancet (cauterizing tool), lightly ignite the lance tips slightly, and then apply large burns as appropriate for that location where there is decay.
Return and cauterize that which has entered in all parts, removing completely the corruption thereof without causing any further harm or damage herein.
Here it goes: Overlay that for three days, and pause over the cauterized spots until all the scars have been completely removed and there is no remaining corruption.
When that ointment is applied for curing it causes flesh growths.
May three days pass if the flesh is born in which there is no decay, then be well; otherwise, repeatedly perform the cauterizations on what has been torn apart in those places where it was ruined.
When acute illness requires medicine in its place of caution (catheterization), it means that certain pills are used for urgent treatment at the site where caution is needed. May occasionally use pointed forceps made of metal for gentle suction of purulent discharge from the joints.
And in it you already have applied medicine for its acuteness at the division, and therefore take that when they exhibit signs of urgency.
The text provided seems to be an excerpt from a medieval medical treatise
Regarding the cautery of fingers and similar parts.
Movements regularly towards the lower parts of the ill-humored body cause a leaning to the side in these areas; and for treatment are two types of burners used herein—one at the focus point, one on the tail end (anus) where they hold their hands.
May the focused area for cauterization be where sparks are produced by fire similar to pain' extrication (pun intended), which is made of fine iron as per all parts containing the keyhole and its subtle grooves, so it can effectively treat or remove the ailment.
Return the flame to that lock and turn your hand over the needle within the keyhole, so that the needle reaches the depth of the keyhole. Lay it in for three days until the beginning of bleeding starts. Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Return that waxed and ground salt applied there, apply it over them for a night; then those impurities removed from their reasons will be gone.
Return care for the place that is anointed with fresh meat within which it shall heal.
If it is not converted (i.e., if the treatment has not taken effect), and continued pressure applied to these cauteries with water or metal/iron needles, holding your hand on top; take a small amount of spring water in that utensil, wrap your hand around it tightly, twist back and forth this compression by your hand until done (usually for about an hour), then release the pressure. During all these actions ensure to keep the tip of the needle within the groove of the bolt; otherwise direct the water outlet from there towards the head nut; wait until the effusion is minimal, just after a pinch with that little spring-water device and afterwards retighten it (usually five times).
And if it is necessary for them (the patients) to enter into these things, then carry the others over all those parts of their body where they have pain in their limbs.
Return care for those pus that are removed by the knots of the joints, which occur in the flesh when it is encased within ointments.

When pus-filled blisters appear on the body after an injury involving flesh (albati), it indicates a severe infection that requires immediate treatment, such as applying caustic substances with materials like myrrh tree resin or long mastic to cauterize over each part of the abscess. This could be applied directly at the focus point where pus is concentrated ("es foc"), near an ingrown toenail (where it might become embedded underneé), on a chronic lesion, or within deeper layers like subcutaneous fat tissue ("cauterei lentecular").
At times cauterization is applied to the patient'dict process of expulsion according to this methodology; and it does not cause complications or disturbance among those excessive faculties, leading them back to healthiness.
May it be that this pain is an indication for purging through enema.

This line translates to: "Cautery of a flowing phlegm by incision with an iron knife." This sentence likely refers to the medical practice during medieval times where treatment might have involved using heat, such as from
The translation of this line is: "Guiding away the phlegm flowed from where it enters or by incision/cauterization in a limb part, and then seemingly healed; however, it's difficult to maintain." This sentence discusses an approach used during medieval times for treating certain conditions—possibly related to respiratory issues like coughing up phlegm. The process involves direct intervention with the aid of tools (like iron knives or other forms of caution), followed by a seemingly successful recovery, although maintaining this state was challenging according to medieval medical understanding and practices.
The translation of this line is: "When you seal the hernia with copper at its boundary by an iron knife'thy (their term for physician or skilled practitioner), and pause over that spot until it ceases to be where those guided phlegm flows into, preventing further leakage." This sentence describes a treatment method used in medieval medicine involving the use of metal instruments—copper here might refer to actual copper tools rather than figurative speech. The practitioner is advised not only on how and when but also intends for this procedure to halt or redirect phlegm that enters through an area, likely associated with a hernia as mentioned earlier in the text (requiring its return into place), which could be related to respiratory issues where fluid accumulation occurs. The use of
This line translates to: "Pause with the caulters of olive wood—light and substantial in number (suggesting tools crafted by hand)—and blow upon those within that are akin to flames." Here, 'caulters' likely refers to small metal instruments used for cauterization or perhaps heat application. The use of the term "olive" suggests these were possibly made from this type of wood

From the treatment of wounds for catharsis and healing, derived from parts cut off at the head (capital). This line suggests a medieval or ancient medical practice where specific sections—possibly limbs as implied by "del cap." which could be interpreted to mean
When catharsis occurs and continues, the humors of excess are exhausted in these parts, leading to their restoration; moreover, when care is taken for them—the ulcerated eyelids (palpebras) along with hair loss from illness or treatment at this point above the head can cause acute pain that penetrates deeply and intensifies continuously. This line indicates an understanding in medieval medicine of humoral imbalance leading to specific physical symptoms, wherein cathartic measures are believed necessary for healing as a result of damage done by leaking venous parts below the head (preon del cap).
And the best cure for these is: to command the humors that constitute its nature, and inscribe in that location a small fissure on the forehead'thy place of origin (and insertion therein; within bone structure), thus allowing you to withdraw them. Hereby, the bone will be revealed.
Remove all phlegm or dry cloth and restore what has been removed between the patient'gy mouth lips, in either the small crack of the tongue or under their linen clothing. When it is above on the breast and back, under oil for that reason not to become an ulcerated wound:

The given text appears to be an Old Spanish extract regarding the treatment of joint pain in hands (indicated by "las aurelhas"). Here is an attempt at translating it into modern English:
So when blood enters the ear or another cause seems similar to those causes that do not fit into the ear, and pause the ear at the window, if you see blood from it, then administer its removal, and make turns for healing wounds with this method; and oversee all patients' needs until their recovery. Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Place pressure in some of the veins or woolen bands above the artery'dictorials (possibly referring to limb joints), and extend the artery towards the parts below, as these movements are directed here for treatment.
If it is not expelled naturally, then administer its removal through the use of a small surgical tool with which this act involves.
If it is a wound that has burst forth (rupture), beware of it; and if not, administer its removal gently under the supervision of one's handful in just few small touches.
So if there is no blockage, then use an arsenic tube and insert the extremity of the tube into the ulceration in the groin area, sealing it with wax and oiled substances to ensure that only the tip of the tube protrudes. And if it is necessary to remove from below (the belly), when we have sufficiently gathered strength after having rested and fed well, then do so accordingly with the force applied for extraction.
If there is no wound in this condition, take warmth or cold device with which the needles are pressed tightly enough on your hand and pause it at the tip of the finger; then cover that area carefully wrapped as applied. When applied it enters into the weakness of the artery and removes the artery from moisture, respectively.
So if there are not all causes accounted for as mentioned hereinabove, then take up that which has come forth immediately to apply caution or restraint on the spasm.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If the cause is grease in the artery and it inflates therein, then apply treatment and removal of it; however, if you do not obey my advice, take a gentle tight band according to this manner.

Therefore, if there is any cause of worms present here, extract them gently or carefully at once; and if no such cause appears, take a quick-drying catheter from below, which this shall be the form. And insert the subtle extremity into the artery according to the amount that suffering allows; apply suction therapy there and perform regular movements until all parasites are expelled from their hiding places (the worms).
May you not obey my instructions while on the catheter with wax inserted as we have discussed; administer these remedies that have already been used in their treatment of parasites within the channel of administration.
And if it is through your discharge that you release the remedies in this vessel, which form of tool from which they come out now becomes evident to us. E there is one made of silver or lead, struck quickly in it and placed on their chest.
So it is necessary when one ascends in the throat of this continental catheter here present, which indicates that at some point during its use or insertion there may be an ascent within the instrument being used for medical treatment (probably referring to a procedure involving suction). Here If you wish, take the sponge and wrap it around your limb downwards carefully; place oil or some plant extract (or any of these medicines in the catheter — that is to say, within its channel) into the indentation where suction occurs above. Attach this item below at the site of contact with you and express through touch how quickly it dispels warmth inside as the oil/extract comes out during application, allowing for an immediate cooling sensation which affects both thigh (the patient's limb) areas in a soothing manner.
When poultices are applied in the auricular region (the ear), they shall be burnt over a small flame, or rather apply heat to them briefly with firelight. When you observe that what causes inflammation in the beard is not too harsh, for remedies applied to the beard do not suffer from it.

So that you take those things to treat or cauterize them with fire (which may involve heating), and separate these materials from their essence if needed; afterward place your hand over the specific spots where they were tied, ensuring no residue remains attached there. In this context, 'athezil' again points towards an issue affecting eyelids which requires immediate treatment with heat to remove foreign objects or substances that have caused irritation ('espatum'). The use of fire
If pain comes from the flow of bile (indicating possible jaundice or a blockage related to liver issues), then you should perform delicate cauterization on those things that require it beneath, which likely refers to directing treatment towards areas affected by excessive cholesterol buildup
The best form of treatment is to return the sharp instruments and those that have been used repeatedly after removing any remaining cause for these issues (implying an infection or obstruction); once they are cauterized at this spot, then those causes will be burned out completely so as not to come back. Here 'cauterizacio' refers to a method of treatment involving burning which was commonly used historically before the development of modern antiseptics and other methods; it implies that after applying such heat-based therapy ('comburidas') at specific body sites, practitioners believed they could permanently eliminate harmful '

Axcirnath is grays that are generated in the undersurfaces of the palpebrae (eyelids), primarily affecting children, worsen those pains and contribute to their cure; they cannot bear witness to sunlight as these droplets tend towards them." This translation suggests a medieval understanding wherein certain formations beneath the eyelid—possibly conjunctivitis or another eye-related condition treated during that time period, are responsible for causing discomfort in children. They believe this 'axcirnath' aggrathyens (worsens) these pains and is a contributing factor to their healing process; furthermore, they think the affected cannot tolerate sunlight because of it as if droplets or some aspect related with them are drawn towards exposure. The medieval context suggests an interpretation based on humoral theories
About their mouths all the time and about when they sleep; over their droopy brows which are already moistened with a swelling or impending inflammation in the eyes, you notice them once you approach that spot; whereby if you perceive it as thick discharge being present therein." This translation conveys an observation from medieval times regarding individuals who might have conjunctivitis. The condition affects not just their mouth (possibly relating to symptoms like excess saliva or frequent snacking), but also manifest during sleep and is noted by moist, swollen brow rims that suggest eye inflammation/infection upon approaching the area around them eyes. Here humoral imbalance seems linked with these visible signs on their faces indicating potential conjunctivitis needing attention or care from a healer in medieval practice. The language used points towards an understanding of physical symptoms correlating to internal health issues, as was commonly believed during that

When in the patient's eyes, their natural hair is adjusted quickly as a form of illness and excessive eye wiping causes harm to what has been referred to here by touch (presumably indicating some sort of pain or damage). The curative actions are outlined through four methods: with cautery needles; according to the treatment prescribed in acute medicine, which should be detailed within this section about sharp treatments ('capitol de cauteri'); hair extraction by means of insight and suture (implying a precise procedure); or via cannulas as directed here.

So that they may gradually enter into a position as follows:
And secure those veins with threads of finesse and subtlety, washing them away hour by hour until they are no longer swolthy from the humors within and agitated.
Even if you do not read the humors in the limbs of the spine; and if your operation during daylight occurs under the sun, ensure that only those veins are engaged which must be involved in the procedure itself.
When you have completed it all, then draw the vapor up in the cold cup or request that so be drawn to ensure that any remaining moisture is purified from within.
If it is not possible for you to collect all of that in one hour, then apply the fluid that exudes from its painful place on your hands and leave it there until the pain subsides and assure treatment by means of application (catharsis).
Once applied repeatedly until the mattress is healed (when the patient's condition improves).

When you treat arising pains with cautery or acute medicine after their description and before they heal themselves, it is not within the body but beyond where wounds develop fully; remove entirely the moisture that's in there which acts as a sustenance for bones. Translation of this medieval medical treatise line:
And when you discover bone and its decay or impairment in it, the form of this is as follows:
It is hard of nature, and its head made of iron or alum, which returns with the act of taking it out through small or subtle holes made by a chisel.
When the cushion is placed over that which has been crushed on the bone, turn it back between the thighs, and gently press your hand in small increments until you know that this crushing damage has been worn away.
When some humors are retained (meaning when there is an accumulation of waste or dry and painful conditions in the body), restore the location to its causes.
So that the location is consolidated and good flesh has arisen there from illness and disease for forty days, without renewal or puncturing of it in that place, if you know this, then one can say that healed.
If not, then it is in the body and must be reduced to its shape as that of a nose; according to this method: if you find two pieces of iron or acute medicine upon discovery, take them accordingly by their form.
It is the iron rod outside of it (the patient), and its shaft inside to that extent has been extended within the limb' extramity, repeatedly so.

Afterwards, pause over the hump with liniment composed of acacia gum and aloe (and also possibly include senna or psyllium), which provides relief; then massage vigorously around the hump area that has been pushed out by pressure - this can help in repositioning it back.

The translated line reads: "Therefore, when any cause of that is fresh worms associated with the seam (possibly referring to infestations or infections), then adjust your lips' teeth for stitching up this opening/wound, and carefully treat what inside has been healed." In a medieval medical context, it indicates an approach where barbers might be called upon not only for their cutting skills but also possibly some form of first aid related to skin or superficial wounds. This could involve cleaning the area (implied by "mouth's teeth") and suturing ("stitching up"), with a particular focus on treating any infection

This sentence implies that if an opening between parts such as nose, lip(s), and perhaps another body part has formed ("continuity"), the treatment might involve using some form of antidote provided by a local healer (the "barbers"). The term 'covering' suggests bandaging or applying salve to protect against further infection. This highlights how medieval medical Here the translation of each line would be:

When it comes to the care of teeth, experts place great emphasis on them as essential components for overall health and well-be0ne functioning.
When teeth are so prominent in their natural form and primarily on the female breast (which is highly regarded), then it's clear that one must consider: if they serve nothing else but as placeholders for other dental structures, such removal or connection with them would not be possible. Hence, we anchor our understanding here; moreover, even though there may no direct association to another set of teeth (dentition in this case), you should examine and treat it using the instrument whose form suits its purpose – much like a hawk's talon, made from Indian steel with an acute edge.

Returns back into its cavity the inguinal region (the area around the groin), using that which we have introduced within it of water for two nodes; and takes care of what is healed inside there.
If the patient's abdomen is terrifying due to his fear during cauterization, and handling of the cautery instrument in him only represents sharp water acute pain, then you should stop at the top of the belly with your hand, placing it on the tongue (the part where we mentioned holding hands earlier), which holds this tool used for today's procedure. Holding their hand comfortably and completing what is alive; meanwhile, make sure not to press hard or too subtly in that area using the instrument of sharp water acute pain here described as such:

And place your mouth with the medicine on it so that, during these hours within which you are using it, it will become blackened and numb from the bite of medicine.
If you wish, prick the wound and cover it with this over the extremity of the blade, immerse the covering in medicine, place the ray on top of that covered by the thread whereby said material adheres to within which threads inserted therein; apply such quantity so as if desired for cauterization treatment similar to gout medication. Allow it three or four days until dry and falling off has occurred (which means healing).
If you have indigestion and proceed through medicine'thy healing journey, repeat that treatment regularly; apply cauterization within the loop of the uterus at its beginning in the body boundary, cleanse whatever is present therein with water as part of medical practice, wash it thoroughly with rinse water, and treat from above downwards towards the navel for healing.
This remedy for healing is placed with care and put in a place of fearlessness, beyond doubt or concern.
Some days she is cured by the water that was applied delicately with cautery and incision, for healing in this manner: calendula, yarrow, sage, rue, Arabian scabies, chamomile, crushed herbs to these plants; adjust all of these causes or some of them into a decoction, submerged in boiling water, with bubbles rising. The broth is then ladled out gently and poured into the bath area where there's an ingrown toenail above which rests a cautery instrument made from metal following this practice: silver or iron nail.
And insert the extremity into the patient'thy throat whereby the steam puffs up over the tongue, and by which the tongue becomes obscured/diminished in visibility.
Here returns it over that motion made while dry, and ensure you do not perform this healing on the appetite of your body; too much adjustment will worsen his affliction with maggots, but if done properly by caretakers under watchful eyes, then one can manage.
May it not be that you do not have this instrument present? Then take a can and compose outside the exterior of him/her an enclosure made of wood, so that the mouth of the malady is moistened, for the wooden hood prevents vapor from burning the mouth.
This treatment is good for health.

From the removal of thorns and water that clings to the sole, as well as from other causes: (This line suggests a medieval medical perspective on treating foot pain or discomfort by removing irritants like thorns stuck in one'thy shoes ("golay
Persistent sticking or prickling sensations remain on the sole of the foot, possibly due to a thorn or some other cause: (Here we are interpreting "motas veguadas" as persistent discomfort and potentially identifying common sources such as embedded objects in
And thus you extract the visible water from those areas and place your tongue on top of it (on the foot), to deduce that there is indeed moisture present within these lesions: The text describes an empirical technique used by physicians in medieval times, where they would visually identify signs of excess fluid or "moisture" associated with painful conditions such as gout. By feeling for wetness on the surface (the foot), and possibly using their tongue to enhance sensation ("putting your tongue upon it"), a doctor could confirm the presence of water accumulation, indicative of
However if the water (moisture) that you see cannot be hidden within your foot and is being vomited up following consumption of spoiled food, this indicates a link between these issues: The moist condition inside could come from rotten meat in one's stomach causing nausea leading to expulsion ("vomiting"), or by drinking dehydrated water (less than normal), dried leeks/lentils, parched pears; and potentially sea sponge that has absorbed saltwater. Herein lies the strong connection between these problems: Once identified as a cause for vomiting moisture from within due to spoiled food ingestion leading back into your foot (which is being treated), one can take measures such as feeding on fresh, clean water and possibly introducing sea sponge devoid of saltwater. This suggests remedial actions might include hydration with pure drinkable fluids or consumption of unspoiled food sources to restore balance in the body's humors: In this text, a medieval physician describes how certain external conditions can manifest as internal symptoms and recommends dietary adjustments alongside physical interventions like massage techniques using natural materials (sea sponge) for treatment. The aim is often restoring fluid balance in the body by ensuring proper hydration with clean water, avoiding spoiled foods which could disrupt one's internal state leading to symptoms observed elsewhere—like moisture accumulation causing foot pain or other ailments: This insightful methodology emphasizes understanding bodily functions and interconnections between dietary habits (specifically Here comes the first source sentence to translate:

And if it is a large stone that enters therein, and within its cavity you insert it to ease the patient's discomfort.
Elevate your head in their position and ensure that the touch of your hand on their throat or back does not cause them pain where bones meet flesh, as this is what I intend for my treatment to achieve.
Even if the malady enters therein (enters into that place), due to its science of understanding the cause and location associated with it, they will enchant in their jaws (with instruments such as cupping or leeches) according to how much has been prepared for them inside the designated opening.

From the sanctuary taken for the grave (or tomb).
When the bloodletting fluid we have mentioned in the division of cure and medicine does not comfort you, consider that time has come for treatment at the heart'dictorium (an area related to balancing humors), use what you already own as your instrument.
Then if you happen upon gout again, extract that small or subtle discharge under careful attention.
If it is not possible to extract from there, then take a concave canula and insert that into the groove of the humerus, placing a heated iron in the concavity of the canula until enough (so long as the swelling has died out and stayed away from the groove), and prevent it from entering the limb for the duration of the day.

And it is another maneuver in the smoking process of that which they do: you grasp an oily substance within the flame and cover it with something (likely a metal or glass) on top, wherein there's a hole through which smoke passes; above this assembly rest below for heating. You hold your mouth over the end of the tube to ensure that smoking is not drawn into one’s body while knowing when you have reached sufficient heat at the site of ingestion (the stomach), whereupon it suddenly catches fire, causing pain or injury upon realization.
If not already done so, then repeat the subfumigation motions, and prevent the malady from drinking, eat salty and acidic foods, and do not drink water; as it is necessary that this regimen be followed strictly.
This is the form of the tool with which you take out when seen; it resembles pincers used sometimes, but there's no curvature in it here. The given medieval medical treatise text in Latin-influenced language can be translated line by line into English:

The pegs move as spices do, from movements of the hands, according to what they remember in this book.
So in piercing and cutting through their flesh with their hands, of which one is for the special appendages they have inserted into themselves; because from these moisture imbalances arise diseases.
The second sign is that it occurs in the places where acids accumulate within the body, and such an abscess at the head is different from one on the belly; each of them requires surgical intervention for treatment.
May some of which have not been pierced but are properly timed healings in those parts, or as an accompaniment to their illnesses at that time.
So other such instruments that are dislocated when crossed and not mature according to their purpose, as well as those intended for joints, which become a cause of contraction in that limb; or an apendicular (appendage) perforation if it occurs within the maturity period thereof towards the main body part; or inguinal one, and if you delay its penetration until it ripens therein, then this will not affect the prepuce nor elongate to the segments of the anus. May you know the hour of the puncture for the abscess, and so it is when it ripens.
E understand that it matures when the pain and fever yield, and reduce the decrease of speech and heartbeat, as well as the swelling at the site of abscessation, along with other symptoms.
When you know where the abscess opening is occurrcing, and purulent material from healing of elevation comes out,
Through piercing the flesh or limbs, if spider bites are in the parts of muscles or feet, and on joints such as knees and ligaments, even where no reflection occurs; these places use puncture according to that part which has been reflected.
When the abscess is in a muscle tissue, then you must pierce it inside until its digestion has been confirmed two times over, and if you perforate that area now, it will extend the leg of the patient and harden their lips and increase depth there.
May one insert an apastula as directed by the flesh or body'dictum, or according to what is necessary for that member which ingests it.
When administering a small incision, and for large or broad dissections according to the variety of the sizes of the incisions:
Other objects are involved where the cecum has been conquered and excised (or removed), when it hurts that there is bowel movement or inflammation, similar to what you have caused with acidity in blisters and boils.
From those who are seated and have three angles; they sit similarly to the shape of a pine tree needle or like the apices (tips) of an arrowheads.

May it not be possible for someone to pierce these surface lion'seals without much effort; when you do penetrate them directly and simply on the surface, or flatly enough so that only a small force is needed.
And when the abscess is large and has gathered pus already, do not attempt to remove all of it at once; take out one portion from that area today, treat this part inside tomorrow, and extract a larger portion on another day until completely healed through gradual treatment.
Mostly when the malady is from too much bile or phlegm produced by a man's liver and spleen—or if it concerns an old person, pregnant woman, or sick child who cannot cough up their illness for escape—the animal spirit within them strives to leave through disease excretion. And you perform the operation then.
Guard your actions with great care and place your tool where you pierce these thorns, making sure to avoid infections; consider if the worm of the thorn is small or flat, then attend to it accordingly—either for yourself or as a healer'dict. If the thorn is large, and there are fissures within your tool used for piercing (perforacio), pause often at any place where we gather together until help arrives.
If in the abscess there is detachment of part of the colon or if that area has been concave within its circuit, then sew it up with wax thread or linen cloth as when you have carried out pans and rags; keep moisture inside by day three, and process those two things to cure what comes from the bandages used for healing.
If you experience a surge of blood during your operation, then administer cold water and apply them where the clothes are tied with elastic bands; place it over the area where the blood flow is directed to prevent excessive bleeding.
If the flow of blood persists, it is necessary that you maintain your diet and care regimen as recommended here in our book and division.
If it is winter time and the location of suppuration (abscess) is a joint or in muscles, then warm poultices are applied with oil and vinegar caustics, while they press these onto the affected areas.
If it is summer and the places are meaty, then cover that you pause pulpils at the beginning with water and oil as we have said beforehand; also ensure to remove any abscesses therefrom and cleanse them for their treatment in whatever way has been agreed upon.

From the section where these worms come into the chest (assuming that "cap." refers to a part of the body, possibly head given historical anatomical terminology).
In the chest region worms are present and their bodies contain segments with protective coverings (tunicates), which in turn house internal organs; these serve as living structures for them. Here, "codena del cap" refers to a location on someone's body - possibly near or within the neck area given traditional anatomical terminology where 'chest region' might not be immediately clear due to language differences between modern and medieval medical texts

Es possible that a vein or nerve is not inserted.
If the spine does not cause gout, adjust your hand inside it or quiver up and down to disturb the humors in the uterus; if this is not necessary because there'thy no need for further insertion—if you do have to incise vein or artery during operation, then pause on shards of glass or other powders that flow out from sanctioned elements. Allow resting time until inflammation subsides and the lesion heals; afterward apply lubricating plasters so it can start being mobilized again. When the sanction has detached.
So return to your operation within which you have completed it.
And if you are inquiring whether there is any other small bumps or swellings present that could indicate a cause of these pains elsewhere in the body, then investigate those and clean them thoroughly.

When the white discharge occurs in the foreskin at the head of the penis and due to decay, erosion, or sticking together (adhesion), it is called an "albacid."

This sentence translates as: "Not cancerous (benign), which requires delicate handling and removal of the whole mass within it; then place that part in Egyptian oil to immerse thoroughly while administers a healing ointment inside." This line suggests procedures for dealing with benign masses, involving careful extraction or excision followed by treatment possibly using specific types of salves (e.g., from resources like the Nile region) and therape extraditional remedies to promote healing within these localized abnormal growths in male genitalia that are not cancerous but may still require medical attention for symptom relief or cosmetic reasons, according to medieval understanding of medicine. It reflects an approach combining physical removal with topical treat
If the white discharge is cancerous and of darker hue ("lega color"), then you must apply caustic preparations directly to its base (the head) or root, respectively—implying a more aggressive treatment approach for malignant conditions that may involve cautery as an option. Here the medieval medical treatise is suggesting specific physical interventions where removal and possibly chemical burns are used in attempts at

Translation: Circumcision is not solely for continuity of disease management like other plagues; however, with our intervention and willful action directed at these children suffering from such conditions (implied diseases), we must assign them to the better operation/procedure using a less painful method.
So it's said that ancient Jews did not perform castration among free men, and they didn't use leather or felt straps for restraints until experience dictated otherwise; this led to the majority of artisans abandoning circumcision as a practice. They now rely on hemp rope and linen cloth used in new cleansings (bathhouse) procedures, holding onto their uncut bodies' flesh.

Then place your hand on the bladder over where the moisture spreads within this cavity, especially as that moisture has already come into contact with it (indicating perhaps urinary retention or an infection). This line suggests some form of manual therapy aimed at relieving discomfort potentially associated with excessive humidity affecting the bladder inside a certain area known here as "the cavity" within which moisture has entered, possibly due to medical

Herein we find that for treatment at the forum or gatherings certain measures are taken." The speaker here elaborates further into clinical observations and therapeutic practices related to bladder stones, particularly in children ('enfants' suggests infants), which is inferred from urine 'looking like water'. They describe gentle actions used on urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body) as if it were a flowing stream and suggest interventions for these conditions during medical discussions or teachings at present locations. This ancient text blends clinical signs with treatment methods, characteristic of medieval medicine where observations led to practical treatments in an era before modern diagnostic tools existed.
And it is the cleansing of children from within that age twenty, and difficult care in their limbs. May also migrate through these waters among them.
From that from which the stone is larger and the cure less gentle; if it is scanty, contrary to that.

No need for immediate ligation of the stone in the bladder lest it returns; whereas another time when you remove that same thing from above (the ureter), then the sling comes back to its place and retrieves what was displaced down there, presumably a kidney or related structure.

When it is necessary to lift the kneecap upwards towards their parts or return them as required, and take back what has been said previously together with those who have helped you here,
The given text appears to be from an old medical manuscript with archaic language

A stone in the woman's womb is seldom produced or formed there naturally. This suggests that stones are not a common issue within this specific context of female
If there is indeed a stone present in any of them (possibly referring to the womb or gallbladder), then it's difficult to cure and forbidden for those with excessive passions due to potential risks involved. This line indicates that intervention might not only be medically challenging but also contraindicated based on a patient’s temperament, emphasizing the
One of them is particularly easy to handle for those who are strong and vigilant (likely referring back to medical practitioners or individuals with a certain disposition suited for handling
And the second one is easy to find a woman who can extract it when directed by her physician (metgyne), or if from among women there are ones skilled in this art of extraction and care for stones, typically related within familial ties as mentioned earlier (`havenz maritz`), suggesting that expertise might be passed down through generations. This highlights the significance placed on specific skills when dealing with health
The gentlest ones are those women who know this skill of stone removal; mainly through the operation itself (`ma`), indicating that hands-on experience and delicate handling by skilled practitioners is key to treatment in such scenarios. This reinforces the importance given to expertise
The fourth point is that the location of stone extraction in a woman's body can be distant from where the stone itself resides; hence anticipatory measures (like seeking out skilled practitioners) are necessary due to this complexity (`temor`), underlining caution and preparedness when undertaking such procedures. This further details considerations for safe practice as described in medieval medical texts, illustrating a thoughtful approach toward treatment despite the limited resources or understanding of anatomy at that time.
May it be necessary for you to induce flow into the body, then take hold of a female midwife'se tool and use her with little force applied.

In this section about the treatment of such cushion masses (hernias), there is fear that they may lead to death in major cases; therefore, I propose examining and removing it herein so you can be saved by a better method than previously considered or applied for treating hernias.
You are now remembering the operation performed in that manner and with these specific instruments (appliqué). The text implies a recollection of an established procedure or treatment for hernias, likely involving some form of surg
Thus you're saying that the instruments (appliqué) are used in these bones where they have been applied and inserted for various reasons: either due to acute overabundance aggravation which is then expelled into the genitals, or because of impact. Here it seems doctors might be explaining why certain treatments involving instruments (appliqué) were necessary based on these potential causes – excessive internal pressure leading to an outward flow toward sensitive areas like the genitals and perhaps injuries from external forces such as a blow ("per percuscio").
The instrument (appliqué) retains the same hue of bone and does not induce pain in place; it is serious or grave when considering its application – possibly referring to a more invasive procedure that respects natural anatomy, causing minimal discomfort without being considered severe. Herein lies emphasis

About the application of an embrace-like wrapping to resemble a shell for soothing the testicles; it is difficult in terms of exercise and ambulation on top of them. (Here, "apostema" refers to treatment or remedy applied by medical means—likely bandaging with gentle pressure), suggesting that such therapy was used historically possibly due to inflammation or discomfort associated with testicular conditions which would impede physical activity above the hernia site(s).
In treating this illness there is concern due to what has already been remembered or experienced before.

From "the care of an intestinal hernia." Here is a possible translation, assuming the text follows similar
The occurrence of this hernia happens because the cords (possibly referring to intestinal tissue or 'strings' in Latin) extend beyond what is normally contained within, due to weaknesses as if they were untethered by heavenly angels from their usual place inside one’s abdomen. Here we see a poetic and metaphorical approach typical of medieval medical texts: hernias are depicted not just physically but with celestial imagery suggesting the out-of-place elements as if they were being influenced by otherworldly forces, causing them to protrude
This rupture is of either the cords or excretion from within it; these are driven out by causes such as: through concussion (percussio), suffocating pressure like a vice grip (suzug - possibly meaning to compress and impede flow, though suzur could also mean sexual act in some texts referring ambiguously to the male genitalia with medical terms); loud noises causing distress or agitation; elevation of any significant cause might lead to – through external pressure. Here we delve into potential etiological factors described by medieval physicians, combining somatic symptoms (like those caused by concussion) and environmental influences—both physical like suff

Not from the joints themselves do we find any cause within their own structure—if there is one at all (a nod to possible anatomical issues), it's rare or scarce, and they can return throughout every hour of time; this implies that internal factors are not typically foundational in causing conditions affecting the joints.

This translation reflects a medieval medical practice that often viewed treatment as restorative manipulation and massage to ease bodily pains, suggesting an early form of physical therapy focused on manual adjustment within one's own body structure—this was seen not merely as external application (like medicines or poultices) but also internal correction through self-administered techniques.

When showing them in their entirety therein and within which they represent for the eye whatsodictates over that very same thing;
When the pain enters the patient'se head naturally, it is violent on women and difficult at their part; thereupon they use that servant who holds those hands of hers, which allows them to evaporate the discharge with fenugreek seeds and olive oil.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Return (or insert) the metal instrument between your fingers and in that place another inserted into which allows moisture, whereupon it enters as a second vessel containing fluid secretion within itself. Precede pushing the woman'dict belly until she delivers the baby.
If not done already, then cover the woman with a cloth made of pulp and seed from plantain and fenugreek; this is what she should be covered in.
Here comes the command to give it, securely fasten the bandages and apply that poultice where healing is desired; put your mouth and nose on his body until such time as he enters the forum of treatment (perhaps referring to a town meeting or gathering for medical discussion).
If the more painful parts of the body have been brought forth to common digestion (i.dict "fet so foro-getadas al comensament"), then gradually reduce that which has become easily handled ("petit"). If the patient does not obey internally, then lift the woman onto a couch and remove her feet from it, and place the couch on the ground; ensure that the woman remains upright to avoid falling during contractions (conception).
If the masses are not turned down and die within the flesh or between their thighs as it lies upon you with your cloth (drap), then extract those from there and remove them along with that which is of equal size, afterward they will be expelled through the mouth.
When the belly is on their feet, and you push them downwards, making it small, and heat that body up, holding one hand undernezymindful of those in pain and pressing gently with two hands to expand this little bit progressively:
When he is inside the thighs, then you command him to express himself and make that outflow happen if God wills it so.
If there is no water to wash away the fluid we have applied, return your child gradually within until you reach that second figure of nature'dictated by their fever; at this point, apply tepid (or lukewarm) water for cleansing and medication.
If it is prohibited to have all the fluid that we recommend for treatment, then take muscle from high altitude and soaked rubber dissolved in water, crush them thoroughly in the mortar with good percussion, apply lines of this fluid on a woman's body (the abdomen being below), containing pus coming out of her belly. Return that limb in water bathing, until you achieve relief for the epicondyles.
When parts of it are softened and become moist from myrtle (and then apply pressure there), thus treating that area with the steam produced by myrtle and applying pressure to alleviate it. When you place it under fumigation for an hour, then have the patient lay on a couch, and make that movement with their tongue (probably indicating some sort of oral treatment), removing from there and pressing down below the lower abdomen tightly compressing in this way.
Eye salve duly hanging from one of its most (the limb/body part being referred to). When it is in reduction of its state (of the body), if you cannot reduce that yourself, then lift up the woman and carry her to where she can be reduced.
If it is not possible to do so, lay the jaw on the bed and forcefully massage their thighs until they hit with violence, then administer the ligaments that you have previously mixed with mucilage as recommended.
If childbirth has occurred, then apply that poultice on the navel area, and study how to reduce swelling of the belly, shape the fetus into its second natural figure, and urge it back inside so that it enters through the same opening (presumably where labor began).
Eye examination reveals that her feet and facies are two inches from her maire'supraception (likely referring to the bellybutton or navel). When the matron holds her hand over the belly and gently turns that little one gradually, it becomes easier for them.
When it is necessary for him to sit down, and when he rests on the cushion that we have prepared with oil and poultices.
And command the patient to drink little by little, and when you have given it, direct them to take that measure on top of another cushion and order them so inclined towards their right side, and instruct them how much they should consume; this is taken for medication. Exit of the fetus prepared over the side.
When the patient vomits violently as per this malady, consider it and if you inspect inside their tongue with your own tongue to ensure that any moisture is expelled from within.
If the fetus is suspended on the face and chest of him/her, then you should incise that part which resembles an umbilical cord (the belly button), to ensure it does not remain stuck or delay in movement.
Here you place the fetus within those parts until breaks occur where pauses happen; and command the woman to take some measures on herself if God wills it, that he may assist in childbirth laboriously.
Exit of twins or many fetuses. You know that twins groan often and sometimes three or four times per day, it may be strange and unbearable; perhaps due to natural causes, but they are alive.
Given the text is in a language that borrows from Latin, Italian, Spanish and French vocabulies, here's an attempt to translate line by line:
If it is difficult for them to endure their childbearing and they come upon us with complaints about the non-natural figures we have discussed, then attend to these pains as we have described.
If the midwife is subtle and gentle in her touch that makes things easier and more refined, and if she acts slowly with all skill according to how prepared they are for healing.
Remember what formed within the womb and was aborted.
Some become pregnant in the month of May one or two times (and sometimes three to four), and I must verify whether a woman has had five abortions, another has formed seven times, which causes pain measured by the distinguished learned ones.

The text provided appears to be attempting an interpretation of medieval medical terminology into modern English while
When the fetus is removed upon death, it means that in cases where a pregnant woman passes away
When you care for the dead fetus that we've discussed in obstetrics and it is not decomposed, and today you must use a wax seal to cover it up; this should only be done if the woman was healthy before misfortile incidents occurred which made one believe she might have lost something.
When the woman is lying on her back with her head inclined downwards and thighs upwards,
The minister holds that hand of those who are in pain or tied up at the waist, so that their body does not extend beyond and extraction from the fetus is necessary:
And apply moisture to the mother of life' extrinsic damp and thickened vapor (mucus) and seed from that, holding her hands.
Here the midwife places her hand on their abdomen where the umbilical cord is located to keep it in place during childbirth:
Here are the translations line by line:
If there is discharge over the feet of your patient, it may occur in the abdomen or between the ribs and backbone (loin).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
And keep it in the position of the patient an additional unit or three (if necessary), to ensure its attachment by means of a catheter and not be extended beyond what is needed for their abdomen only.
When gout affects the entire body, it is for that reason that its removal must be done carefully as if in a toothache sensation by you (the doctor).
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Therefore if the patient'thy body part has been extracted forcefully, then they should be allowed to enter back into the place where it was removed, and at that moment their entire body will have come out.
If the leg is inflamed on the other side and it'thy not possible to reduce that limb by carrying; then wrap your cloth around it so as all of its parts come out, and trace along that limb whereever there are swellings or in the groin/thigh junction.
And where you make it in the other part of the body and both feet.
May it be that the head of the fetus is large, or compressed in labor pains, or adjusted at the top of the womb where tendrils enter between the dull spines and fissure on the crown to extract water with an instrument called "alundat," from which forms other instruments will be taken for this purpose.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate line by line:
If the head is sick and compressed by the sternum (the breastbone), then it has been opened within wherein the moisture that exists in the chest is evaporated.
May it not become complicated, nor should you eat, then immediately examine the head as much as is within your power.
If there are openings in the stomach or they protrude outwardly within it, then you must pierce that part where fluid is circulating inside.
If it is about your feet, then the attraction of you to that place (presumably for treatment) will be gentle and directed towards the mouth of the midwife (likely indicating where one should expect some sort of remedy or relief).
If the belly is being compressed and pressed on your chest, then remove that dress which covers you so tightly, tear it apart while letting out the air inside these places where the compression occurs.
May it happen that the other members are pressed and turned back to their heads; when the physician enters from the right side of the bed, he/she will insert into her mouth (the patient's), secure therein with a clasp or two, tighten around the head, and draw out those tongues within it towards its entrance.
If the mother'thy mouth is constricted by apatema that causes pain in her chest, do not allow it to worsen there; from then on, administer treatment for moist fatty effusion. And apply liniments; follow up with the patient in waters that soften and moisten.
If it is on the patient'se chest, let it be stitched if possible; and administer to it what we have said for the living body.
If it is not possible, then insert into pillows and remove them.
When there is no cause found within the secondary (referring here possibly to deeper or systemic issues).
When you have completed all of your examination, then administer what we have discussed for the treatment in these punctures caused by the mother'donkey (presumably a metaphorical or ancient term referring to inflammation).
If you have an excess of phlegm flowing into clear streams and administer another treatment.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And there was seen in her stomach a woman who had died, and placed upon that focus another gone on, which itself is also dead. Occasionally an abscess appears on the patient's limb for a long time; and as it swells up with pus, begins to ooze fluid (or "gut").
When they call for healing and have treated him for a long time, his children are not yet well established or firmly rooted in health.

This is how one should strain their free limbs where there are two spear-like tools in the extremities of both feet. May this virtue be subtle as chains and either pain or cramps of the joints caused by cold humors entering undernethy pressure points beneath them (below).
When the length of each rod is two feet and a half from both ends to their midpoint (palms), which measures three hands wide by four palms long; here are already made adjustments on these rods that have been fixed in place (which lengths measure three hands wide by four palms, with an end-to extra length of two handfuls or a half foot each).
These two additions are inserted into the mother'thy mouth so that she can swallow them when you turn over these given remedies.
Another subtle form of that which is secretly present herein; place it undernethy, and also on their legs. Here "autra" refers to something else or another thing, similar in context to the previous

In this sentence, "sia" refers back to some treatment device mentioned previously (likely similar in function to forceps), which May it be at the very end of your body with two additional lengths like this: its length is a handbreadth and its height (or depth) are two fingers' span tall; here "quays" means to measure or equal in size, so they indicate that when using these devices for treatment as mentioned earlier ("additament"), the appropriate dimensions should be one palm long by two finger spans high. This guidance suggests specific physical attributes required from an instrument used within their medical practice – possibly something like splints or
When you wish to use those devices for treatment (the ones previously discussed), make the woman stand on tiptoe over her feet; there's already that which is between your thighs – lift it up now, here "aquos" refers back to something concealed or secret within them. The instruction seems to be directing a healthcare practitioner (or possibly themselves) in an early form of manual therapy: the patient should stand on tiptoe while treating issues likely related Place your hand above the device with force applied according to how much respect you have for (or value) the mouth of the patient within which bounds set by when the mirror is held up that allows visualization as desired – here "aprecio" refers back again, indicating personal consideration or esteem towards a part of their body. This line indicates they may use tactile feedback from holding tools over parts of themselves to modulate treatment with respect for how much it affects them personally and visually monitored using an object that serves as both mirror ("metrona") in this instance, suggesting self-

Form of two entities in Latin:
All these instruments are being used and whenever the spices of that thing become multiplied and prepared by the craftsman according to their quantity is when I place it on its base, and also put some people there for each amount.
And when it is necessary for those instruments not to work together, that need cannot be waived.
From the removal of the second element (this interpretation assumes that "segunda" refers to a specific object or substance
When the second element is retained by you and causes pain to your patient, command that retainer (likely referring to an obstruction or source of discomfort) held by the caretaker/patient themselves, apply a corrective touch with authority, placing your hand firmly over their mouth and nipples as necessary. If through such action relief is provided, rest assured they are cured.
If not, then take a hot wave and pierce through the covert at that spot where burning herb exposes the mouth of the mare (the patient), apply chamomile oil with calamus and anise seeds along with cinnamaldehyde bark and juniper berries. All these herbs or some of them are submerged in water within the wave, and pause over the flame.
And place one end of the clyster (cannula) in the mouth of the woman, and insert that into where her emissions go down to the cavity of the womb.
When that part is applied as directed beforehand (as we have described), and the second servant moves swiftly,
May if you want to continue this treatment and avoid surgery, then command the matrona to immerse her left hand in sesame oil or millet paste, and insert that into your intestine where we have marked it; likewise introduce another one there as recommended by us. If she inserts furthermore within the belly button (belly), place inside also on their stomachs if desired. As soon as they find this second point inserted, take out little by little each insertion until such time that mother does not clutch tightly; at which moment remove them carefully one after another to prevent accidental injury or misplacement during the procedure. From above where it has been smoothed out both right and left are easiness of movement.
If the queen'thy mouth is constricted, we have already recommended the cauterization and medical treatment of her water with metal and plants.
May if not all causes recommended are avoided, keep you that do not touch upon it in iteration of abstraction; may but what enters from the mouth to the hip joint also be enclosed and treated with ointment and tetrafourmacon; this thing will purify those areas for healthy days ahead and dissolve any remaining issues.

Of caring for an infant' extruded bowel not reinserted (the phrase seems incomplete and a bit unclear as it stands, but I will
Of caring for an infant's bowel that is not ruptured (the phrase seems incomplete and somewhat unclear as it stands), the delicate handling ensures its safety or preservation of integrity ("ciphac" could be interpreted loosely here, possibly meaning gentle care). Please note: this translation attempts to capture general ideas but due to Therefore the mother takes care of it (presumably referring back to caring for an infant's bowel); if not already done so delicately ("ciphac"), she shall pierce gently with a sharp object, and ensure that her hands do not touch wounds or injuries. This translation attempts to convey the original meaning while providing some context where it was unclear; "perfore" here refers to making an incision carefully which is necessary for medical intervention if gentle handling
Then place it over the burning and oil (possibly referring to treating burns); similarly, provide care for that which is contained within—ensuring proper wrapping or bandaging with wax inside. This translation tries its best to interpret an ancient practice of caring for a patient's injuries where specific materials like lana (wool
If there's concern it might be tender or sore, pause for a day in the treatment room (this suggests taking rest days during medical care), and wait until the infant can endure more activity again. Here we have an interpretation of ancient healing practices where breaks are taken to allow patient recovery before continuing with treatments—a concept still relevant today when considering therapeutic procedures that must be balanced against periods for recuperation.
And heals the patient's belly to solidify offspring or applyments (the context here seems to involve medical treatment for an abdominal issue); therefore, ensure that this consolidation is done as instructed ("inscidida"), and provide care with water which we have discussed in our treatments. This translation reflects the medieval approach where home remedies were often part of a larger therapeutic regime; herein lies an indication to follow specific medical advice while using simple resources like water for healing, aligning with historical practices that valued both adherence to
Of caring for those ulcers that come about by chance.
The leaking sores that occur in the lower segment of connectivity or within one joint, from behind or in its space:
It is an ulcer or abscess.
When that ancient constriction is related to moist and sticky humors rising subtly within these ulcers, some measures are taken from them.
Those penetrating things make them fearful because they are suffering from those (the humors) exiting and breathlessness; some of these patients suffer due to the humor'dictorium exits, others suffocate as a result of it.
From those fistulas occasionally appearing in the hollow space within the bladder, and entering into the meat of the uterus; these enter through the junction of the thigh and the pubis.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: When it is in which there is a penetrating and non-penetrating (abscess) within the belly, you insert your thread here into the abdomen, and introduce delicate rods or iron into the abscess when not turbid.
If in that narrowing you feel pressure undernethy or the tail of a horse within where you sense the tightness, it means:
If you do not feel that one of them for any cause of obstruction or worms and windiness, as we have said before, then understand they are non-permeable, and take care of yourself accordingly.
When the fistula penetrates into the bladder or urethra, it means that its purpose is to expel the fluid from that place so that the location becomes medicine and gets healed properly.
May if something penetrates the joint of the thigh or enters into the bone and causes pain throughout the circuit, then this person is said here as one who attempts to enter without being blocked by obstruction in the bone itself; they will undergo a swift treatment immediately. In no way does it have value in medicine nor can it be solidified with wax (as some preparations might suggest).
In all those perforating ulcers it is not healing completely, and the treatment of these by doctors works hard on which becomes firm again.
May heal as expected if it is not impenetrable and old-aged; such recovery hoped for when you follow my advice, which has already been applied.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If that person feels cholera entering their colon, then immediately insert your finger into the area of discomfort in the colon.
If you feel a thrust in the belly and perceive that it is attempting to pierce through there as well, then surely you know that this thing penetrates; therefore do not attempt anything on or around where that which perforates occurs, for indeed we have already said.
Mayhap there have come rightethy men who heal in hospitals of saltmen's houses.
From the medical practice in which you hope well, as before it was done, and whereby that flame inserted into the fistula shall ascend until it escapes through the cloak; and after inserting such fire repeatedly (as many times—up to three—you know have become exhausted all those bones padded with this fistula resembling a feather from quill),
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If the attack is within and does not penetrate inside where it enters therein (the anus), between that which one hopes for flesh or chest organs, then you form a fistula on its surface above the navel; once formed, dry out the umbilicus of the part containing the fistula, so as to enter into and through this within the region whereby ends said limb's extremity. Hereafter dries that which is in contact with the wound (the treated area), achieving liberation from it via the intervention itself (through drying out).
Return cleanlinzymes those constricted veins which have been assembled with the penis catheter and do not break due to any cause.
May the fluid from sanctity sometimes flow between you and your covering when those stones are inside it; then take up with lymph or pus-filled instruments for cauterization at the focus, so that adjusted stones' inflammation will be alleviated, and the discharge of bad humors removed.

So if hundreds of trials and between you (the healer) and her are the flesh or meat, it is for permeation now not to be operated upon in her but by a second route of trust and hope.
The given text is a medieval medical treatise discussing various methods for treating certain conditions: And in some cases the fistula is closed according to this methodology: when you insert an instrument into the fistula, and it reaches the skin of the abdomen and at the edge of the navel, a needle inserted by the surgeon' extricates the intestines accordingly:
And insert into that faithful wrapping of fields or around those areas, and attempt to insert the foot in the forked part wherein lies the continuation of its cavity.
Might if it penetrates into the margin of the anus intentionally, then extract the nail from that traumatic intromission you have made in your anus; and remove its tip, adjust both ends to their respective examples, first-time cleaning each with water for one day or two days at most. Whenever possible, once again insert the nail into those flesh pieces wherein the extremities of the nail intersects between the legs' limbs.
Return care where it has been made firm and healed.
May it be that the orifice of the fistula is not penetrating, but rather there'thy pain originates within you and cannot be cured by me alone. Therefore, I must enter where needed according to my preparation so as not to introduce any additional injury; meanwhile holding your hands which are supposedly healing inside.
The form of spigastle is what causes the fistula: its curvature makes it sharp and the other division does not—so that without necessity, take measures sometimes.
From the seam of hemorrhoids where blood flows in that part of it.
Here comes the first sentence to translate: "Inflammation of the joints appears as twofold in origin; either it is due to carbohdictum (indicating that these are like grains of rice), or those things herein appear between the patient's buttocks, similar to fat. From those small and large, which the sanctus cor verifies through these timespans, and thus it is within the abdomen area, in the limbs of him/her.
Even if there is a lack of moisture in the small intestine'se cavity according to its limited water content and by its skin tone, it must be addressed accordingly:
And the cure for that which they have inserted into her colon is to command the malady (disease) to settle and express itself within where it inserts, so that you can see its humors appear therein with your hand. Now you sit and hold your nails down or up against the skin where they touch it with your own nail, applying pressure on those areas of their flesh which are yours to heal.
May if the points are not held in those places due to their moisture and softness, then take a rough cloth or woolen material for them, fix it with threads at that spot where they should be attached, scatter some ash dust onto these areas as part of cauterization; apply cautery according to the procedure established beforehand. Return that care for those things which have been healed within it so far is applied there again.
If the belly does not expire (evacuate), then crush it with pestle in which small biting is done, and wash it with that water present in the colon where obstruction occurs to facilitate evacuation when the intestine squeezes.
If the hernias are deficient at the belly button (navel), then their cause is leprosy (leprous condition), and you must grasp those areas with your finger or tongue, insert them back inside where they were before so that they can be healed as we have discussed.
Here is the translation line by line:
When it is necessary for all of them (the humors), and only one remains unused from that which has been taken away, then the surplus of this humor will flow out of that particular part.
And place your hand over the belly, roasted or in a chestnut case; and put that there on the colon (large intestine) to command the humors back inside. Return that which is within the cavity; and when it has discharged itself, care for those inside of it who are ill or other forms of cure contained within (that they may heal).
When such conditions are considered outdated or ineffective according to the prevailing medicine of that time, they advocate cutting off those bony prominency points with either a spatula (bone point) tool or their own blunt instrument which is moistened and held over where pus discharges from beneath it. This action prevents further spread; thus proper care for these conditions should be sought within them once they have solidified. Here, the treatise implies that removing certain hard bony structures at joints could help in managing purulent (pus-filled) effusion by cutting off its source and stopping progression before consolidation or setting of pus occurs—a technique possibly reflective of medieval practices aimed to address such conditions. This approach underscores the holistic view often found within these ancient texts, where physical interventions are considered alongside an understanding (or misconception) of bodily fluids and humoral theory that dominated medical thinking
When you have initially cut off the violent discharge of purulent matter that was first within and are red, indicating inflammation or infection—and care for those once healed: Herein lies an emphasis on immediate attention to acute conditions presenting with signs like pus exudate following incision. The treatise seems advocating prompt post-operative (or surgical) intervention and monitoring of wounds, aimed at prevention or early treatment before any serious complication such as infection ens
Understand that this is not standard Latin and blends elements of multiple Romance languages as well as some older medical terminology; however, here's a rough translation attempt:
And when the fluid that has entered is located in the joint of the knee and between its bones or ligaments, and it has been removed from their body; take care of it.
If you wish, then cauterize the second that came before in his chest.
May small ulcers appear rough and round on the surface of the body, and they often come into motion in children.
In caring for him/her, extend and insert that which is faithful or within the box inserted by you; perhaps it's a needle of faith (or material) used in treatment inside this container. If you wish, then burn it as we have mentioned before, at the focus or in urgent medicine.
May a small and thickened flea be upon the surface of the body inside you (the patient), when it is crushed, it causes pain all over your body.
Care for him involves inserting a catheter made of either goat or tortoise bone into the body cavity he contains within which the loop is positioned; and with your hand inside that through which it has been inserted, rotate while stopping its movement so as not to harm his flesh. And when this material (the substance being a part of the catheter) reaches where currents flow in the formulated body cavity, pause there on top of the meat covering it; and continue rotating until you remove all residues from inside him entirely.
If you wish, use a lead or iron tube according to this manner:

And you have it divided into the part of healing for these ills that were suitable to free them accordingly, and hereby declare how this curative action should be performed with those remedies in accordance with their complementary nature.
So it is said that sores are diverse according to where they were formed and how the pus was collected (inoculated).
When the causes of motion are arises due to humors accumulated in conjunction with a heavy stone or rolling on thresholds and floors, hitting furniture, fistulas, or being close to these sources causing such movements.
May the humors that are present in the body' extrinsic parts such as head, neck (col), chest (pietz), abdomen (ventre), belly button (fitge), and resemble those of the limbs be alleviated with a poultice.
And when recommending a cure for some diseases, it allows thinking and rules to be applied concerning the other diseases as well.
When you consume foods of simple diseases, the recall of complex ailments will arrive at the feasting table of the third capital (which could imply an internal understanding or recognition during treatment).
So say when you have simple boils that are not fractured, consider: if it is a stone or resemblance causing them, then press and rub the head region immediately, without delay; extract from there according to the quantity of fluid present if no cause prohibits cauterization, mainly if what has come out so far belongs to the simple boil itself.
When there is a procedure on the contrary side of the affected party, and one must keep watch over their abdomen for retching and vomiting, especially after consuming heavy foods.
If from careful observation you find no cause at all, then reduce intake of food and do not approach meat or drinks again.
When pressure is applied over mud or water where the patient has been caustically treated with hot oil or vinegar and seizes it tightly (seized firmly), likely an infection may be addressed:
If you are sure of an abscess and it has been recently formed by the patient' extrinsic (external) factors, pause over the soil where such intervention is needed, provided that this dust/soil hasn't changed due to external weather conditions which may have affected its purity.
If the air has changed its quality, place your hand inside where you put onlinen until it is healed.
May it be that the child is large or because of insufficient space and appearance, and their lips are not adjusted properly for sewing as recommended by them; in such a case, adjust those ones with stitches accordingly.
May you find the child inside bone and flesh, not restrained by it but held with a small suspensor; inspect that which is found therein carefully using medicine to restore their body'se tissue back into place where tendons reside, instructing the humors (fluids) within them to digest foods containing seeds or grains and fruits/vegetables similar in form.
If you find decay in the spine and it does not stick to the bone, then cut off all this putrefied flesh with water, and apply careful attention (to remove or cleanse).
If in these diseases an artery or vein from which blood may flow is not severed by medicine, then look at the artery, and if you have cut that one too much, cut it with a sponge or ligature (tube), as long as what we are saying does not worsen your condition. If so, perform cauterization within which blood has flown out once severance is done.
If these pains are simple and small, then the cause of them is humidity; therefore sprinkle this dust over those places until the air dries them out.

If the nerve of the colon or artery is involved (suggesting some form of neuropathy, possibly pain), it remains as much in medicine that this issue should be avoided rather than directly treated with immediate action; instead take care to soften stools using water alongside remedies like dietary changes and herbs. Here the text advises a gentle approach focusing on prevention through hydratsation ("cu aquo")—and possibly other interventions, such as modifying one' extrinsic factors (diet) or taking specific supplements ('ziniar,' which could refer to zinc known for its role in digestion and nerve function).

In preparation for experiments or study throughout one'se lifetime.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
First point/chapter (assuming "Capitol" refers to
Summaries and collections from the essence of bone fractures are required before we begin to recall details about the broken bones themselves, whether one or several. Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Now that we speak in this introduction of these subjects, and within which comprehension for our craft occurs; here you and they are quickened who know or learn this noble work from us.
And when you experience a fracture or dislocation or twisting (sprain), then coil yourself for the treatment of this injury with cauterization of that place, if there is no specific cause preventing it, take care to relieve vertigo, and such pain may be due either from weakness in general health, crushing fractures causing swelling or severe heat accompanied by intense fever.

Be aware that bones break and become weak when they are in the bodies of those who are young or decrepit; it is impossible for them to continue being connected together according to their natural state due to drying out (loss of moisture).
Mightily nature adjusts and contracts upon the broken bones of any part taken by reason similar to gluts wherein excessively thickened flesh adheres within that which binds together those ensnared individuals, inside therefrom venom from fortitude and firmness emerges akin to flame at supper time—and no cause forbids one'thy execution of these works.
For this reason, it is necessary to take breaks from the foods of humors that have gravity and consistency and thickness, as we have mentioned.
Be aware that the instruments for breaking bones are various according to the different parts of the body, and a break in the thigh bone is different from a break in the skull'supremacy; and a fracture of the chest bone differs from a fracture of the armbone. Similarly, all other members vary among themselves.
When all types of bone breakage occur, they are remembered separately in their designated part of the skull.
Motion of various types in him/herself (possibly referring to different movements or symptoms) indicating a possible injury or condition related to bone fract There are various kinds of bone breaks in them (referring to different individuals), including an arched type break when they fall on their elb0r or knee; and some fractures depend on the length of the bone: these include wrist/arm fractures, pelvic fractures from falls or impacts both direct and indirectly (as in slipping), head injury resulting in a concussion when struck against something hard enough to cause pain like during an accident; as well as small linear skull fractures.
The whole specialty is in dealing with pain as it arises after the restoration of the patient, at their specific locations:
Moving title of bone breakage. For this translation I will first break down the sentence into smaller parts and then translate them:
And when there is neither twisted appearance nor pain upon touching the bone and groin without causing great suffering, then it'dict not be a fracture here.

Return that strong member which will come with recollection of him/her.
If the bone is satagated (inflamed or rigid), then it becomes necessary to extend this broken part of the body, whether it's leg or arm/hand; if your own hand is small, use yours; otherwise, one must use either both arms and hands, or a single cord.

However, if the splint placed on that fracture is thick and a small one has been applied to other splints, then its length according to how it fits onto the limb both in height and size; also apply firm pressure over those splints as per your first bandage direction; place this force under the foot accordingly (to where you have discussed about fracture), so that when extension from the fracture occurs with elongation, then the tightness of your bandage corresponds to the location of the break.

This is how these devices were used by the ancients to treat injuries such as fractures and dislocations, which are restrained over breaks in bone structure (translation with some contextual interpretation):
Manipulation of immobilization post-fracture repair is convenient for complex cases and mainly concerning women' extraneous parts: where no heat nor effusion arises, use talcum powder on the casts, and it is the bone marrow from flour that facilitates movement in these extremities.
When comforting him as you are doing so, but if that same book has humor too dense or heavy (indicating the presence of excessive "humors"), do not make his ease neither light nor subtle—use it accordingly.
Autotherapy remedy for fracture and dislocation: recipe of asphodel, mandragore, acacia, myrrh, and magnesia (ground into powder), which is mixed with the juice or wine from all ten thistle heads. With this mixture applied to a place where bone damage has occurred; use it for good healing composition in order to restore broken bones naturally:
Other forms of impalement that cause fracture and twist: mixture of white dragon'thyng, myrrh from the same dragon’s fruit, aloe from another dragon’s fruit, frankincense (or possibly Arabian) dragon. xx;
All are ground in mortar and crushed into powder or pulverized with water or alum, and they take their medicine as directed.
Manipulation of the splinter and bones apart, there arises pain in those places, with a tightly wound thread tied around them, immersed in oil and vinegar, and fixed upon that location: such is its binding.
In this bandage nothing has been done for restoration or healing by poultice and purgation as they should be handled properly.
Other means of cautery that restore the cuts: olive pits and poppy seeds together make an effective dressing; all are used for treatment.
Manipulation of the plaster applied for bone fracture restoration and when you want to resolve ossification: a mixture of alumina, pillowcase, violin flowers, wheat flour, all parts divided into three portions; these are crushed and mixed with water in which (if) the limb is not cut.
If it is cut (injured), then apply that same water from the colon and urine to soothe or cleanse the wound.
Another method of plastering for restoring the limb when you have a hard abscess that must be drained at once: recipe with raspberry and wheat germ, honey, myrtle berries, mint leaves, violet flowers, chamomile blossoms; all are crushed and mixed in water from rose petals or double-infused water according to the quality of the limb and rest period needed.
May Ypocras does not prescribe a free that is resting on the limb injured, but rather pains treated with wax and oil, nor any other cause; he recommends moving between coarseness and subtlety.
May Gualia have seen that there are pauses on the broken part of them and their causes for exsiccation due to warmth taken in with myrrh, grains, and spirits recommended by these things we use herefor.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Manipulation of plaster that comforts injury and pain: recipe for bruises from teeth or home insides, and honeycomb (spelled as "altea"), chopped parts; crumbly pieces and powder are they, this is their compress.
When the quantity according to which you tear down and separate it is considered, if there's not pain or bleeding nor bone fracture at its place, then do not delay your work for days. If you experience severe or sharp pain at the location, then bend or dislocate that part in time, and apply a plaster from it.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Return that subtle restriction and apply the plaster small and not tightly by your initial compression, and delicate handling is necessary for healing within this space.
If times come when the abscess and swelling and pain and inflammation have all gathered together from there, and indigestion requiring enema and strictures as well, then repeat that action which you performed for the patient'thy entire body at once.
If there is no injury to any of the causes we have mentioned before, then wait three days or four at most (or seven), and some treatments may be applied over the course of twenty days as long as they appear following the detachment of the limb, until fracture consolidates, just like what we've described.
When it adjusts within the tightness you may have nowhere in your initial restriction at all, and fasten to the belly'dictum of humors (the stomach), as soon as memory returns for that matter.
May if you open the fracture site it may dry out and weaken even further, so be wise that nourishment is forbidden to prevent this; therefore bring water for your thirst every day of feverishness until three days have passed, alleviate swelling with a small pill, through which nutrition will enter the limb, healing the body.
May those who heal the fracture of another limb when not yet restored at meals observe their timing and follow its curvature, according to which they perform it; this is error in their work, great fear – if rightly timed and executed correctly with care, large Antics will expand freely without water being imposed upon them.
When they have not seen any doctor for them (their fluid), it is reasonable that their humors do not balance well.
Capital Second: When a fracture occurs in the head.
The spices of fractures are motions, and their forms are various, with distinct causes: for any given type of bone break is caused by the impact from a space (likely referring to air or fluid), which enters into the cranial cavity where it can cause pain in the skull. Consequently, this spice/type of fracture gets named; when the gap penetrates through part of the body'thy bone and cuts through flesh without passing beyond its exterior side (this phrase is a bit unclear), then this type of fracture comes to be known as complete displacement.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
This break or perforation that has already penetrated the periosteum (the outer layer of bone), is either in the face of the bone itself, and/thy pus from these breaks or punctures can be large or small.
And when it is a bone fracture in the subtlety of the hairline, that' extrinsic name for this particular type of fine crack has not been given yet.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
Mostly it hurts in the bones of the joints when they are covered with phlegm (or effluvium).
So as all these severe breaks are bandaged with separate strips of cloth like pillows. When all this fluid returns to its place in the body, that is where it should be accordingly.
With all these tools for detection and inquiry into their attempts at healing corrupted flesh that is upon them.
A special vessel is found when it has been discovered in the bone and withheld, laid upon it for a little while until the fracture appears blackened.
In the healing of fractures consider the accidents of humors, and if through those accidents signs are manifested as vomiting from cholera, distension, loss of understanding, abscesses, syncope, acute fever, symptoms of these patients, and their likeness to such accidents in major dispositions, they do not heal.
If you witness an accident due to incorrect movement, then you begin its treatment.
When the cause is that pus comes into your stomach with food during fever days in the twelfth day of entire arrangement, as you study on the bone's exterior at noon today (the Roman numeral "XII" represents the number twelve).
If it is in the summer days, then when you press on your bones from morning until evening, they are said to be rotten due to sweat (the humoral excess), and thus prone to having accidents as recommended.
If the fracture has reached the skull covering bone and is made of small pieces and hardness, it's time to remove those broken parts carefully as advised by you.
When you raise the head of the patient affected by humidity (plague), and observe over their bones second in use and manner according to your experience with children, so that they lie down on the sickbed.
If you suspect bone fracture or osteomyelitis (infection of the bone), apply cold water poultice, and then press on it with what is dripping from there; this will help rest the swollen flesh within so that infection stops spreading. Begin at the site of injury to the bone and start incision work here as well.
And it is one of two methods for operation.
One of the maneuvers is to insert one instrument into another such that it lies inside as follows: And this is how you do so: Insert a smaller tool within this one, just enough for it not to fall out. This describes the technique whereby a medical practitioner carefully inserts and positions instruments during an examination or procedure without them becoming dislodged.
And thus it is that we apply medicinal herbs placed below for the second time.

Using their ease in touch upon the joints, that they may not strike the head and guide it along here.
If the bone is hard and sharp, then when you administer injections into its channel immediately before applying pressure with pillows (which are not deep), do so accordingly.
Even though there is no name given for the condition, it occurs when these points stop at the end of the bone inside where fluids accumulate that have been previously brought to this area by movement or other means; because they are located on either side of what appears as a rounded extremity or small circle near the head of the limb (which resembles an edge), it prohibits being submerged and passing through the bone'dict:
It is convenient that you grasp these many trays, each corresponding to the degree of sharpness in any part of your body where this present apex resides within all parts of the brain, and its quantity shall be according to the amount of spicitude therein.

And where you must exercise utmost caution that the scissors do not touch any cause of apoplexy (commotio cerebri).
And when the bone perforates and if it continues along its path within you (the patient), extract that outwardly soaked with water from where fluids have entered, which in the hardness of this fluid appears similar to nails; but also consider whether there is blood or subtle matter extracted as well, like other splinters.
If there is any misalignment or displacement of the small bones, take that which will make it easier for you to handle them from their joints; and use water and ointments made with honey and liniment where these hands have been used.
The other aspect of the operation is painful and far-refaltening, which Gualia and Laze pursue for great praise; this is their discourse: it's necessary for you in your attendance to discover where the bone fracture was forcefully and clearly placed, as soon as you have discovered that location and paused briefly with a slow and cheerful movement of which this forms its shape.

If there is any additional cause related to the patient'thy hip joint in its location (likely referring to a hernia or prolapse of the bladder), then insert that specific one at the extremity of the instrument used for exploration, and release it from within such means. Once released, this will alleviate harm and fear as it leaves his body/self.
If the bone fracture does not penetrate into the periosteum, and what is broken off or remains of the bone are its surface roughness and small fragments, you must take care that this roughness and these tiny pieces are removed using tools prepared for such purposes from various quantities so as to be able at all points conveniently administered where they should belong (to the bone) according to when your operation is complete.

May there be any of the other small vessels or fragile breaks in your body that you have lost and need to heal through proper care according to what has been lost.
It is because they have not been taught about all these things in that art. When we write about great breaks that have been shown us,
If the pancreas is inflamed when you are removing the bone, then take hold of two or three layers of cloth as much as the pus present and immerse that in olive oil; submerge it over the wound dressing until such time while which fluid (pus) can be drained from above. Then wrap another layer of doubled or triple-folded cloth, soaked in vinegar and oil, immersing this also underneilement as before but with intervals for drainage; administer internally to that wound sinew using the amount by which blood flows at a time from above. And do not tighten it until such quantity of flow has been reached where no more can be drained (i.dict, meaning: apply without overdoing).

When the patient complains of chest pain upon being struck on their bone and it is felt more intensely when nearing recovery from treatment, consider if there are accidents that have occurred to them in total; be aware that all may need attention accordingly.
If you do not alleviate the blackness through medicine that is withheld from below, then make such remedies of honey and olive oil in three parts each, drape them over these lines herein mentioned; furthermore apply it to where this ailment has occurred. Also provide care using curative spices as you find appropriate for healing should occur.

When you crack your nose, it can cause discomfort and sometimes pain due to the stretching or potential injury to the cart
Though it's not the nose that is broken but two bone parts separated by nasal bones which have been pushed apart—perhaps due to some missteps, as there are now two or more fragments in your face; these pieces do not break into larger shards nor get fractured further. They simply suffer from displacement and twisting movements without causing additional injury internally within the skull cavity where they belong.
If one of the bones breaks in its place, then insert a small object into your nose to compress that fracture down towards their chest and backward as indicated by this body part; until you can return it naturally upwards according to the shape of the person's body. If it is needed for your ease (to have pain relief), and ensure that you do not harm yourself during this operation on the patient'thy thighs.
If the break is in the upper jawbone and does not go to that place, then have it measured on the part of the beak where it has become large or swolthy.
If the bone is broken into parts, then you make it seem as if there are two (or more).

If you do not curse the abscess with caution (using cautery), then put that same warm poultice made of barley flour and pomegranate seeds mixed in almond milk over their leg bone, and place it above where a snake might lie without any cause.
If the bones of the nose are slightly broken or displaced, then you must separate those fragments and extract them with instruments suitable for these purposes; also fix that fracture using fluid (blood) necessary to nourish and consolidate it, as well as apply bandages appropriate for this purpose.
If you crush worms in the nose, then treat it with this medicine and insert iron rods inside so that healing occurs throughout the body.

Ensure this does not get destroyed during application/use.
Command the humors that they take rest and calmness, and pause their consumption of solid foods with a stomach' extrusion (or diarrhea).
If your figure has become distorted due to any malady, then you should sit down and stretch that which is altered today until the third day; afterward rectify what already exists from clay or white lead paint (alabaster), place these remedies undernethy where they are bound with woolen lining.
And when that bandage is placed and positioned on it, so as not to alter the bone'setup, let him who has been healed and strengthened from his broken limb stay outside for three days; these movements are repeated regularly with this fracture.
If another inflammation occurs due to applied poultice, apply what we have mentioned for these pains within the patient'thy body until it heals and alleviates that abscess.
If the fracture is young (implying fresh), consider if it'thy bone has been separated or shattered, then you should apply pressure on those fragments that are located near water in the body region of those joints/bones.
If the poultice applied by you is drying out, then increase it as much as your need requires.

When it is bent, the sternum (or breastbone) should be repaloaded or fixed in place as part of a chest injury treatment. This phrase suggests
Continuously moved is the broken sternum of the player due to their movements and that fracture falls into one of three classifications: simple (or closed), comminuted (with bone fragments spread apart but not displaced, suggesting a clean break with multiple small pieces remaining in place relative to each other without shifting) or compound/open where the broken ends may have pierced through the skin.
When it is broken or separated into two parts that do not touch each other, and restoration to its state therein occurs—and when crushed in such places, healing becomes difficult, and the bone may become crooked: this requires special attention for repair; one must be patient at these fractured sites.
When the operation on that bone is complete, it means you make two servants present: one to aid and hold the broken jawbone in place, and another to extend the chest where the fracture occurred.
Return and set the fracture in the bones within which it is broken according to its shape as determined by observation, ensuring that there are neither small elevations nor deep hollows present.
If indigestion lasts for days, then you must press gently the spot on the malady patient' extramundane part (belly) with a cloth or woolen piece according to your need; and expand and lift the chest, contracting it through your hand where you apply pressure as needed.
If you cannot lift the extremity of the shoulder blade to the parts outside, it will come down to the sternum, and the humid becomes over the chest area, causing a limb swelling movement.

It appears that the text is from an old medical treatise with a mix of archaic language structures and vocabulзу which makes it reminiscent to Latin as well as modern languages like Italian, Spanish, and French due to their common historical roots in Latin-based Romance linguistic tradition. Here are my translations line by line:

The phrase points out that these severe consequences may remain hidden within ("occulta") until they become sympt
For the restoration of them (the patient), it is positioned with their abdomen upwards and a pillow between their shoulders; we then address the muscles around him, adjusting his back to two places accordingly—this follows all mannerisms that are possible at present time which suit our methods. This indicates an approach taken by medieval physicians focusing on proper body positioning for restoration or treatment of injuries and illnesses consistent with their understandings ("ad equacio segon manieyra") while accommodating the current state's capabilities (“entro que retorne la figura del os”). Here, "equatio" might mean alignment as part of a healing process or simply positioning for comfort and effective treatment. The mention of muscles suggests that they are concerned with maintaining physical support structures around affected areas ("subtilia te en la operacio"), possibly to aid recovery post-injury—emphasizing caretaking strategies within the limitations (or "maniera") imposed by their medical understanding and available resources. The phrase also touches upon an aspect of patient interaction, suggesting gentle handling or manipulation ("subtilia te en la operacio
Here comes the translated sentence by line:
If it is necessary to provoke the dismemberment of that which corrupts or pricks therein, causing pain or abscess (which I call decay), then you must remove and rectify what causes this through your healing art; if such removal affects the face, also reduce swelling.

When the fracture of the coastline does not occur in large rocks but rather where there are thinner, more brittle stones; and from their extremities they do not fall directly into those areas with dense bedrock but through porous or less solid ground." - This translation aims to convey that when it comes to injuries related to the coastline being broken (which likely refers to accidents at sea involving rocks), fractures are more associated with smaller, weaker stones rather than large boulders. The injured individuals' limbs would not directly fall into dense rock areas but might instead land in softer ground I understand that you are afraid of the questions I have for you here." - This line suggests empathy towards someone's fear regarding an inquiry or set of interrogations they might be anticipating, with a possible context related to medical exam
The restoration should be such that the fracture is enclosed according to possibility within there where it happened; and afterward you apply an ointment or splints tightly for strengthening of broken bones if necessary." - Here, the guidance appears to focus on a practical approach to healing fractures. The text suggests placing any debris around the break (possibly crushed earth) back in place within as per local tradition and then applies an ointment or splints for additional support of broken bones if required by individual need. It reflects medieval practices possibly combining folklore remedies with some degree of medical understanding, albeit rudimentary compared to modern standards.
If the fracture of the backbone is declining towards the parts involved, it causes severe pain and piercing sensation, similar when you experience a puncture while crying (in other words, emotional distress can worsen physical symptoms), and thus one must apply pressure to the area with clothing; this condition also makes breathing difficult, induces coughs and vomiting of phlegm; all these indicate it is hard to heal.

The phrase you've provided appears to be in Latin and relates to a medical procedure concerning the vertebrae of L5 (Little Five) and C1 (First One),
Translation: "Sometimes the vertebrae of L5 and C1 are broken in falls or accidents, which is then similar to fractures of the neck." The text you've provided discusses injuries that can occur when a person suffers a fall or accident. Specifically, it describes damage to two critical regions within the spine: When you have caused fluid to rise in the neck and veins know if it will heal or not, then consider that if your own fluids are already softened and stupefied (essentially dead) and cannot be purged nor extended from those places, when they constrict there, hands on theirs become needles where pain is felt; you understand thusly it will not heal. In the times of preparation for dispositions [death], one knows that this condition does not improve.
If there are pains in those places and they become tightened or require a piercing, then you will understand that the bone of the body is saved, and humors circulate for healing.
If you see how his backbone looks towards water and wish to know if it heals or not, then pay attention to the state of his feet.

And when one of the cushions for comfort and existing, rests upon that which forms a ligament; commanding the humors to take repose and calmness, so they do not sleep on the part where pain resides until it is healed.
If you injure the bone' extrusion or any cause that has already separated from it, then apply pressure on the spine and put strain on the affected bone; and if there is a large wound, suture accordingly; also provide care for those encased in bandages until they are healed.
If the bone of the hip is broken and it' extruded thigh marrow (the femoral head), which you insert into the left side groin area until it reaches the other knee joint; then stop applying pressure on top, but if necessary apply force with these tools or your hands.

And when they use forceps (or in this context, potentially as a tool for medical procedures). Here is how each
And when they pause over the fracture that has been pushed and prodded by other forceps; between each pair of them lies a distance, which is determined according to how much bone separation there exists throughout (in this case) three-inch sections of all fragments removed. Here it suggests medical personnel are assessing the extent or degree of fracture displacement when multiple pieces have been extracted from an injury site and using forceps as diagnostic tools during examination, possibly preparation for further treatment such as setting bones into place correctly (reductio).

When the patient's fire (body/energy) is broken for a long time after an injury to them, their healing becomes difficult.
When that limestone from there was broken into two pieces (or fragments).
So if the bone that is broken it's the small one above (possibly referring to a hip or pelvis), then it is convenient for the doctor, and you must provide restoration of it until such time as this becomes comfortable again for the patient.
May it be that if a large fire is what you seek (or desire), then cease the vigorous extension of force/energy immediately.
If the two flames are entwined together, then when you withdraw the incision forcefully, do it with strength.

Regarding the treatment of a hip bone fracture, here is the translation:
The bones of the thigh are cracked and declared according to what is converted into motion downward toward the buttocks, which pertains to their sensation below as well.
The restoration of him is done so that the sinew tightens over the fracture, and another sinew immediately afterward, with the humors being pressed upon his stomach and face.

If the dislocation is due to wind, then it will be set with silk and stretched out over the parts immediately (or right away).
And place the doctor' extricates the two halves of their legs together in a natural manner and aligns them for good union; if there are constrictions or spasms present which prevent healing, address those as well. If there is an ulcer present, then you should keep it bandaged for several days until the ulcer heals and return to your usual care routine.
The constriction of him is caused: the covering that wraps around the fracture, and folds it twice or thrice times over, removes excess; then apply another wrapping until reaching up to the ankle bone and kneecap stone (the patella).
When you insert a long pin far into the thigh and leg area of each department as needed for excess from the bandage, turn it over to those areas where the extremities of the inserted pin are found on the upper part of these departments' limbs, ensuring that no additional length is wasted.

The treatment of the calcaneus fracture." The phrase refers to medical attention focused on healing a broken heel bone, known
You know that in the calcaneus there are two bones of which one is large and called heel-bone (calcaneum), while the other is smaller and referred to as talon." This line from a medieval medical treatise describes anatomical features associated with the calcaneus or heel bone, identifying its major component – typically larger for support – and referring to the subtler part known colloquially as 'talon'. The terminology used here draws upon classical Latin
And for the healing of these waters that strengthen both bones in the arm and likewise aid restoration here alongside general limb repair, it is considered surgery." This excerpt acknowledges a therapeutic practice involving certain liquids – possibly medicinal or mineral-rich 'waters' – used for their alleged healing properties on both bones in the arm. It further indicates that such treatments are parallel to standard limb repair surgeries and therefore categorized as surgical interventions themselves within this historical medical context.
If you find two bones in the calcaneus entwined with each other," suggests that upon such discovery within an individual's heel bone (calcaneum), this structure effectively becomes 'entirely divided'. This statement likely pertains

When there is any cause for operation on the arm, and when you clamp down with tongs to perform the entirety of the surgery, take wooden splinters that have been paused in time already (presumably from previous treatments or injuries), handle them carefully as white palm fronds; apply these same ones where there is swelling. Do not use fingers for this task and ensure their length corresponds to that of the affected area, inserting into it immediately after stopping any bleeding has occurred within seconds.
Wrap a covering over any cloth on the patient' extrications as per their length; pause one at the juncture of each leg cushion and place it within the body cavity below the joint, made up entirely of flesh (tissue).

This line appears to be discussing issues related to the break of the calcaneus (heel bone) and the phalanges (bones in the foot), as well as possibly referring to tendons
The line translates as follows: "Not all heel sprains involve breaks of the entire calcaneus; some may affect only parts of the foot bones (phalanges). Those with tendon injuries do not break but instead become detached within their joints." This sentence from a medieval medical perspective indicates an understanding that different types of fractures can occur, and specifically notes how tendons are affected differently than when bones actually crack or shatter.
The translation of this line is: "If the foot bones are fractured and sometimes those very same bones rise above one another, then gout (a type of arthritis) will place its burden on the patient's feet upon preparation for rest." Here we can see a medieval conception that not only does joint pain manifest in conditions like gout but also has specific implications about how such illnesses affect parts of the body, and an understanding that certain fractures might lead to further complications. This reflect
This line translates as: "Then stop the foot above what is raised from those bones and apply pressure to them within their respective places." This suggests an early form of medical intervention where specific techniques, such as applying direct force (pressure) are used in treatment methodologies. It indicates a belief that proper positioning can alleviate pain or harm caused by fractures – possibly reflective of the kind of home remedies commonplace during medieval times before advanced orthopedic procedures were
Return and apply pressure above, stopping bleeding from the abdomen into which two cups are placed; here is where you will stop blood flow with these small containers (cups).
Return strength to that part of the body with its structure for downward movement, after you have wrapped it and addressed other potential reasons related thereto by which weakness may arise.

At word in dislocation." This line appears to be referring to a situation or topic related to
On the topic of dislocation (dislocatio). It is an injury to any part of one's body that results in immobility and requires medical attention; it brings about painful bruises and serious injuries." The line describes a condition whereby something has caused a joint or limb within someone’thy body structure ("lo seu loc") to become dislocated, leading to restricted movement (immobilization), necessitating professional care. Pain is likely experienced as large, potentially severe ('lesios grans'), and this may also involve bruising due to
Then when you suffer from a joint or limb being out of place (dislocation), urgent measures must be taken to return it back into position, and if not promptly done so, the affected area may become swollen with painful difficulty in reducing such dislocations." This passage stresses immediate action required for correcting a dislocated joint or limb. Delayed treatment can lead to complications wherein inflammation (swelling) makes repositioning ('reducing') more challenging and potentially agonizing, highlighting the urgency of proper medical intervention in such cases during medieval times as depicted by this treatise on medicine from that era.
Therefore if someone is not restrained or straitjacketed during reduction (the process of setting a dislocation back into place), it will lead to muscle contractions and sharp pains." Here, the treatise warns against unnecessary movements ("not being restricted") in patients with joints that have been manipulated for repositioning. Movement can induce spasms—involuntary muscular contractions characterized by severe pain

Here comes the first source sentence to translate: Place rest upon that plastering, and pillows, and compression; command the humors to settle down and regain balance while it heals.
At this moment of treatment in this place, reduction is achieved for the patient' extrinsic part when it gets separated from its original location.
The given text appears to be in an archaic form of Spanish or Italian
When it comes to the reduction (manipulation back into place) of a muscle dislocation, here's what this might mean line by line in
When it comes to the reduction (manipulation back into place) of a muscle that is not actually dislocated but rather torn apart or separated, here are three ways by which this can be addressed: one way involves realigning what was presumed as 'dislocation' at once. Here’s how we could interpret and translate the provided line in contemporary English for clarity within medical context:
And the second is that it is dislocated above the tendon'dict, and this pain occurs therein; nor in parts behind by the shoulder joints or forwards through nerves:
Mostly it is a displacement and departure of the body from its parts, especially in those areas where bones are thin, dislocation occurs; possibly also when there are movements involving thickness of the bones, they exit with difficulty.
And with the cold applied through pressing or casting, and his body is set apart from asthma by application of heat to it, where he has already been dislocated.
Now that you have called out what has entered overly into yourself and are proceeding with the treatment of it all at once, continue with your healing process.
Here comes the first source sentence: When dislocation occurs at joints away from touching; so that you can distinguish between the displaced muscle and its counterpart; wherein within the concavity of the affected limb'sup, neither metal hook nor malady allowed reduction to the area under examination by any means.
If you have a displacement of either hip or shoulder, and it shows signs through touch without causing pain, do not attempt dislocation correction yourself.
From this dislocation it is felt that cooling and inflation of the malady occur.
The reduction of the swelling is what makes its minister lift it up from undernethy thereupon placing gentle pressure on the pulsing parts below, and raising that part to their location; as well as lifting its mother tongue back into place slowly until return homeward again.
May it return not and from the commencement that dislocation occurs, hurrying days when the humidity is high (and thus bloat), then apply liniments made of honey mixed with coriander seed in wine, administered to both legs above their joints where they are bound tightly by thongs.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If you wish, reduce that second symptom following this manner: and make a present home long than the belly, from where it belongs, and insert your muscle quickly into the area of the abdomen through which the belly has protruded; another servant should immediately pull out the ma (intestine) within those parts just above while you are doing this. If the thigh is swolthy (possibly meaning "swollen" or having a distended appearance), then when another cause becomes apparent that keeps it hanging down, after returning to its place so severely may it be dislocated again.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: And another reduction method is as follows: make a long staff with which its figure can be seen like a mason' extraterrestrial tool (which should not be thick nor subtle), and set it up on the patient's thigh, ensuring that it rests firmly there; place this stick atop of the staff cover, keeping the malady in line with the length of the staff. Extend your hand over each section immediately after placing them to strengthen their connection back to where they belong quickly for a secure joint return.
If it is difficult to reduce him for all the reasons mentioned above, then use this treatment: grasp a stick with its length equal to two arm'dicts and hold that at an angle of four digits from the thumb knuckle according to this form.
Over his head place these heavy cloths in such a way that it does not press on the belly (the abdomen).
And it is placed timely on the tightness of the patient' extramundus (the exterior parts), and its arm or hands are extended over/inside the carriage within their divisions, holding onto the cart with both arms and hand-extension as well.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When the patient's interior is completed in any way that you can do it, and when you pause to stroke their hopeful wool lining with its quantity; a poultice made of molten lead mixed with egg whites has been prepared over all muscle tissue as needed for turning away from above (likely referring to reducing swelling), intermittently stroking the area tightened by stricture, and binding it together. The padding is placed on top of this preparation; attached to the patient's chest, tied down securely without making a hissing sound over seven days.
When food from humoral excess is stopped and the body part is comforted, then healing begins for them.
And when food is given more in portions seven or eight and exercise with it so that they do not close tightly shut nor soften up, then already the disease will be cured.
May the joint be dislocated due to humidity that you introduce into it or for another reason; in such cases, administer three treatments as described in the manual of therape extrictive measures:
If all of a sudden there is pain and the ligament and joint are not fixed in place for several days, then reduce swelling with plaster or tightness over time; moreover, that arm cannot be raised to the parts above, which means you understand that these patient'se nerves, which are located at the top of their muscles, either as extensions/stretching outwards or softened (mollified), and know that joints will never remain fixed in place on their own.
Of the dislocation that you feel in your pelvis and thighs (peitz and mammilla or lower parts), reduction is made by force and extension until return to normal position; within this context returns back.
When it is administered in that other stricture, and care for it while healed.
If you harden the healing process in the limb and slow down its movement, then let the humidity be bathed as directed until that gravity is alleviated and it returns to its original nature.
Capitol .xxvii.: (The specific translation of this Latin-influen
Of the care for the dislocation of the hip: "Curaci de dislocacio del coyde." translates
You understand that the hip joint is dislocated and appears difficult; it's generally displaced towards the back part of its cavity—whereas if you gently manipulate or touch as per any form in which it has been dislocated, then this becomes evident when realigning the misaligned pelvis. This indicates a concavely deformed joint that cannot bend one'thy arm nor reach for oneself with said limb.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
And when the restoration of it is possible – that is to say, its breast should be extended with both hands and arms widened outwards, along with the doctor's hands being on their hips and thighs, while they press down on the joint located at the tips of one’se hands or in the palm of their hand where it returns into place.
If the dislocation is in the parts ahead, return it by bending your hand around its own part, entering where you touch the groin area with the back of your hand.
If dislocation does not submit to reduction, then apply vigorous extension and motion forcefully.
When two ministers stretch out their arms, they hold that instrument with both of them to prevent it from being overextended.
And turn his arm completely over it (the body), wrapping the drape or cord around its middle, holding on with a leather strap.
When the doctor touches the joint with his hand, apply some oil there to help alleviate those causes that aid in lubricating the joint, and strengthen it by pressing firmly until its return.
And reduce the pressure where it has been paused upon that coating in which there is stiffness and accumulation of phlegm within the constriction, with the arm hanging from the shoulder, being held for a few days by hands.
And if it is necessary to separate them (the parts), then there must be separated in that place the sinew of him/it and make such separation therein.
If you see the joint not being stronger (meaning weak or inflamed), then apply bandaging and binding it tightly for several days until it protrudes out again, and afterwards remove that which has come outside.
If you apply pressure on the joint for its reduction and positioning is in motion, then use moist wetting combined with dry friction while inside that moment it has been alleviated; or pause over the joint which corresponds to a fatty movement area; and bind it securely, leaving those hands placed above the joint throughout the day and night. Return that one and immerse the other in bath; when they suckle (suck), rub the joint where it is cold with warmth quickly several times so as not to cause dizziness or motion sickness—the first treatment, second application after a pause. Am inserted within that which is moistened (likely with some form of liniment or medication), wherein it resides securely/com
If you wish to do so, pause over that moistened and split gap at the cow's border edge, and press on it firmly; apply several times until that area becomes dry/wet again (referring back) returning its natural state or positioning. This line suggests a therapeutic action where liniment is applied to an injured part of the body near calf muscles – possibly for treatment purposes like reducing swelling, and then reassessment after applying multiple times until there's no longer visible moisture from exudation or persp
Capitol XXVIII: (This is likely a reference to the chapter number in
About treatment of joint displacement; it's located at the junction where the arm meets (or connects) with another body part or limb—possibly referring to a shoulder injury in context, which would align well within medieval medical practices focused on physical dislocations and their restoration
When the joint of your body part is dislocated and returning it to place (repositioning) involves ease; however, in other junctions more caution must be taken if relocation happens quickly at the moment when displacement occurs or developments into an apoplectic condition occur. This suggests that while some immediate action may suffice for joint repair without specialized treatment required urgently (likely referring to a shoulder dislocation), in other cases, extra care is needed due possibly to complications such as compartment syndrome when the affected area swells rapidly and pressure builds up within muscles preventing proper circulation. The mention of 'apoplectic' could imply an onset or exacerbating situation requiring prompt attention by a medical practitioner, considering medieval medicine’s limited scope in dealing with such acute conditions without modern interventions.
The reduction of the dislocation is that you stop the joint'sup (groin) of the malady above a table and extend it outwards from there; then let your doctor or palm rest on the imminent juncture, pressing gently until it returns to its proper place.
Even if it is considered that the palm is protruding towards the belly of her/him, then let the hump press down on two sides of her body onto a table to extend and reduce; and if dislocation precedes, position her so that her center overlays the tabletop directly, thus enabling the doctor' extrication hand to rest upon the imminent joint.
And if it returns soon enough, good things; but if not, that painful spot will harden and cannot be cured here anymore; do not attempt to heal what has passed these days.
Even though the knee joint follows its twisted nature; and there is no cause in the malady itself, but it becomes softened and cannot be stricken for a reason—know that your nerves are compressed or squeezed, and you should not rest them here. Rather, prepare to strike with cautery specifically designed for this treatment (and make sure any additional causes of discomgy by water accumulation receive proper attention).
So when the treatment is returned, place your pause over what we have prepared for them (recommendation), and let it be laid down with strength for days; furthermore, cut and exercise their limbs' flesh, as well as exerthyze that which lies on top of it.
May it be that if the patient'se movement is stiff and painful in there, apply warm water to his tail end and some herbs for several times until he feels relieved.
Capitol .xxix. (This line appears to be an in-
From the treatment of displacement.
Alcùmes times have led these joints out of place for the entire body.
When a limb is dislocated from either side of the hand or abdomen of him/her, then they bend and thrust to return it into place until restored.
And support the head of this person, and suspend that which is where it has become displaced, allowing for two days.
Return those within it that have been raised up and extended into today, placing them there where they currently rest or stand.
When the pain worsens during the day and ceases at night, he (the patient) should listen to that second account of it as well, not neglecting either one in daily life and movement; this happens for a few days until relief comes.
When it seems to be water (referring likely to a fluid imbalance or excess of body fluids), and if displaced from the abdomen, bring that element back together with this first operation in order for healing to commence.
When it appears as if fluid is coming out at other parts of the body.
The given text seems like an excerpt from an old medical document
This line appears to be in a language with roots that are reminiscent of Latin, as it pertains to the treatment of vertebral displacement (
When any of the vertebrae in your back or neck are completely dislocated and scattered around (in that case), it's not treated here; for then death is brought about by internal bleeding (
This line discusses the consequences when an individual voluntarily increases their internal bleeding (
So it's already been dislocated to behind and is said not to heal properly or recover, leading to poorly repaified conditions (
This line suggests that when the patient is a child and still developing (in infancy), it's not treated here nor healed (
This line indicates that in some cases the treatment for these injuries may involve lifting or tapping on them (asymmetric movements, percussion), and if necessary even cutting to remove it because of its proximity (
From those it is not healed except for that which you apply directly into them, as recommended by water (presumably a poultice or treatment).
The malady is extended over the patient'thy face above their chest as quickly as possible during emesis (vomiting), and it spreads moistly throughout, to ensure that not even the patient’s breasts are exposed.
And place one staff upright on the ground at the foot of the bed and another in the arms holding up their feet on the other side of the body.
The minister holds the staff and it is not fixed in a pit; another minister grips the other following that shape.
Envelop the sinew above the thigh and tighten it with strong bands, extending its tip to where you must secure the head; bind that part in place, and attach another band across the legs' bones, securing them as well; fasten all straps together on this staff which holds your patient'se feet.
Here the minister extends the ligature to the part of the beam where they are fixed, but not allowing it to tighten excessively as we have mentioned before.
Here comes the medical treatise to translate: And let the doctor place their palms on the spinal column where it is strong so that it can return (possibly indicating healing or stabilization), and adjust their weights upon this structure, ensdicting them as per customary practice.
May it not return in this way, then take a table of which the length or width is three feet, and cut into the wall where we have indicated that the swelling should be within the extent of the table' extrême. Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
If you wish to turn the quality that has been revolved in your ma (body), then stay on ground until the head of the malady is at the back end of two sticks; and these lengths are one arm'sup, and for its head again reach down till the end of a stick. At this length between each staff stands a palm-sized space, in which you have already become sick (the condition manifesting itself). Each foot that turns there is fixed firmly on earth so that it does not wander off.
When one has a staff in which they turn it between the two halves of the sticks,
In the limb there is a defect where it forms wood of such length that equals a handful when turned over, and in the other two sticks they resemble each other.
Here is the line-by-line translation of the provided medieval medical treatise:
And for each turn and position that you need, apply one minister who turns it at the patient'se place, whereby the doctor manipulates the spine as we have described.
Here comes the sentence to translate: And apply that the spine is returned, and its cavity has been refilled with albumen paste, and putty; place it over the astragalus stone of the chair from which three fingers or an inch are removed outwards, length according to what puffs up the space where there was a hernia, on the spine itself.
And return its ligaments as we have mentioned before, and place it under the nourishment humidity within which it can heal.
If there is any urgency in the location at the end of healing, then those who are administering medicine must use ointments that moisten and cleanse for a long time to be applied as directed; and this has already been applied on that spot with a layer of lead.
And when there are signs of impending danger in the lower back vertebrae due to dislocation; it is this one that you have noticed for which no further pain will arise from now on with this medicine, lest great harm come upon you.
Capitol XXVII. (Note: The text provided does not contain
Regarding a hip dislocation, it might be translated as "Concerning the treatment of a dis
Concerning the joint of the hip and the muscle connection which only becomes dislocated singularly, without causing harm to those other smaller bone connections with their respective curvatures where you might otherwise injure them if injured elsewhere in your body.
The joint of the wide is dislocated according to four ways: at the divisions of the bones above, below, in front, behind, or undernethyre/towards it.
Mostly it is dislocated at the joints below and scarcely in the parts ahead or behind.
When the dislocation of his limb is broken up here in these parts it becomes long and narrow that has been stretched out from healthiness; this malady cannot bend its knee nor use tongue, whereby the appointed point for apostemy cautery arrives at this location via the thigh'dictating landmark.
And when that which causes his displacement is located outside the body parts, these accidents are contrary to it.
When the patient's dislocation spreads to their knee joint from here and cannot bear weight on it anymore; urine is retained in him/her, and his or her footwear becomes calloused (hardened), walking must be done with bare feet on the heel.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
May reduction of these spices for this dislocation that you consider is that if the dislocation is old and ancient, then it has already been addressed by your previous management here in Rome according to its disposition; hence, there'dict not be a prognostication made about it. And so we shall continue without making any further predictions concerning her condition at this time.
In that where the dislocation is recent and among the four species of dislocation, then take up what has been displaced to restore the joint' extraneous or misaligned parts must be returned (to their original positions). Moreover, ensure it returns firmly on both sides; no further treatment will suffice.
May it be that if the condition does not return in this treatment phase, then you must prepare strong medicine and extend the cushion under your patient' extricated justly at intervals (or immediately), or over their bodies overall; another servant extends said remedy from below upwards to where they touch my hands.
When extension occurs from here or at the end of this section related to the shoulder joint or between the ribs and sternum area, it means:
When all of them experience extension for as long as the malady is lifted up and falls down on its ground,
This particular type of extension is common throughout all four (Italian/Spanish). Here's my translation for each line based on context and vocabulзу from the text provided:
And if the dislocation returns when we have mentioned it (implying previous treatment), then such is required by water that they've spoken about for healing itself; but otherwise, entirety of what has been said herein regarding its own remedy must be applied. Here I translated 'E aquesta specia de extencio es specia cominal a totas quatre.' as "This particular type of extension is common throughout all four (Italian/Spanish).
In the reduction of itself, when it is dislocated and located at joints between its muscles (the limbs), wherein water has risen above one's belly; hold pause for tendons in that area which lies between thighbone ends near what shoulder bones attach to their respective skull parts. Here I translated 'E aprop reduzeys le budel o l’atela.' as "In the reduction of itself, when it is dislocated and located at joints (the limbs), wherein water has risen above one's belly; hold pause for tendons in that area which lies between thighbone ends near what shoulder bones attach to their respective skull parts.
Here comes the next sentence to translate: Assign another servant with strong forceful arms and massage deeply into the hollow of the thighs and extend it over all parts for vigorous extension; when that returns to its place, you understand that the method is effective.
This particular substance is for purulent inflammation with which this limb is reduced, and the other species are beneficial as well.
If you are able to stand on your feet and do not obey the entrance of this specific healing practice for both thighs at once, which serve as pillars strong enough like ligaments in each leg bone and muscle tendon, then:
Whenever any part of the body exceeds four cubits in length and when one thigh is extended as much as two cubits, that indicates a certain condition or imbalance within the patient'dictated by humoral theory at this time (medieval understanding).
And raise the patient' extramundane body (the humoral balance outside of oneself), and have it on the head like a crown; thus, two cubits from the ground is its length upon earth.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate: "Appoint a strong lad to shorten the head of the thigh, and have another boy suspended therein by it; yet another boy will lower the thigh at its strength, so that the juncture returns swiftly to its place.
In the reduction itself, when it is dislocated from its place outside, where the hump of ugliness presses on the knee according to what we have recalled in this manual; and his ligaments are placed directly over the swolthy part and chest.
E two stakes are set up, one under the patient's foot and another on their head; and with these stakes in place, adjusted according to where they lie upon which clothes have become damp due to sweat (which is enveloping them), so that moisture doesn'thy can not wet your tunic (clothing) between the thighs of you, preventing exacerbation from displacement.
And each minister extends towards its respective portion, and the doctor takes hold of their hand for reduction according to art.
When dislocation occurs towards the parts below, then cover that change with bandaging as directed hereinabove; and let your doctor's palm rest on the affected thigh area for some time while holding another hand over it to pause extension of this injury at its location in lower body.
If the dislocation is in the parts behind, do not cover that which has spread to the lower parts and stands on earth—there are those who have covered it over a hard cause; their face and ligaments should be extended as mentioned earlier (in this text), there being no need for further covering.
When compression is applied with a table over the location where joint pain occurs, it means that medical practitioners use pressure at this specific spot to alleviate discomfort caused by issues related to body humors as per their customary treatment methods for such conditions like
So once the reduction is complete, as indicated by our term for 'reduction,' it should not bother you to do so yourself (meaning that after performing self-treatment or manipulation of an injury), and when those who have been previously instructed extend these cushions back out on their legs, they push further until the swelling outside has spread beyond this point; thereafter, make sure to adjust your hips and pause pressure with a bandage that does not strain too tightly across any part of the body. Stick it in place for three days or four.
Return the strap and bandage, and compare one cushion with another.
And if you see those joints locked in a position, then you understand that the dislocation has already been set, and thus proceed with treating the humors.
If you see any cause of softening, then return and bandage that part according to your first application, and leave it for three days.
Return that part of it and make him walk on these crutches for as many days until he is comfortable.

The translation of the first source sentence would be: "It is his name for loosening, that you command the hump to apply its cushion at the thighs; heed well when it becomes dislocated.
Here comes the first source sentence to translate:
When it is necessary for the patient's cushion (or pad) to attach at the hip joint without labor, that becomes its role or purpose in recovery care.
Return that and apply it to the couch at the thighs, applying those adhesive pieces there for three or four days, and return them as needed:
Not use the humoral fluid from walking for more than a few days until it is healed and comforted.
If your reduction of him is considered excused (presumably by the patient or doctor), then apply a strong extension to his ligaments, as previously narrated in the treatment of the joint.
Given that "Capitol" does not provide contextual text or specific
The phrase in question appears to be related to the treatment of a tarsal dislocation, which is an injury affecting one of the bones
The phrase translates to: "Sometimes the ankle is sprained for a short period of time and sometimes it's dislocated, which can be due to forces applied either internally or externally." Here are line-by-line interpretations in English:
The translation of the medieval medical treatise line by line into English is as follows:
May the cure of his return be through gentler relief and to make it easier for him both in walking outside where he can retreat again.
When the treatment of him comes according to the second complement, make sure you straighten his hips and hold that strong minister behind his back at the place where he lies down there.
Return yourself the sound of your left hand to where it belongs in the place of the abdominal cavity and apply pressure with your right hand on its position, which is at the bottom of the thigh'dictating from below the knee joint.
Return the leg to its cavity and adjust it with your left hand for two passes, then extend the leg further using both hands while guiding the foot' extrusion back into place by force of three beats from each side.
When joint pain is caused by cold humors that infiltrate each part of the body, and pain occurs in the feet, it is customarily called gout by doctors.
Returns the foot'se bone to its proper place in the cushion gently and you are at the navel (referring possibly to where someone might hold or support something using their hands). The original text seems to be advising on how a healer should handle patients with joint pain, suggesting gentle movements back into position
So you return the foot's bone gently into position and if done correctly (with gentleness), all is well—and in that case, no further action need be taken; but otherwise repeat this procedure until proper alignment has been restored for which additional attempts may be necessary. The text continues to give guidance on how a healer should treat conditions like joint pain by carefully manipulating the affected body parts back into place if they have become misaligned or dislodged, emphasizing gentle handling and patience in treatment methodologies typical of medieval medicine practices.
But if you are not permitted to reduce it (the dislocation) when we have applied pressure on him/her already, let the hernia speak about its two positions over land; and first throw in a winding sheet firmly into position upon earth's surface—and between his thighs place your hands wrapped within cloth as protection so that he does not expose himself to further injury. Here, we see an alternative method whereby if direct manipulation is contraindicated or forbidden due to the condition of the patient (possibly because too much force could cause harm), a more cautious approach involving observation and providing support with cloth bandages might be recommended by medieval healers for treating hernias. The advice continues in line with maintaining safety while still attempting conservative treatment methods where possible, showing an understanding of when to apply direct physical intervention versus protective measures or alternative
Here comes the first sentence to translate: The minister of his tongue holds their thighs together, and another minister extends either the body or the bandage that lies over the chest area; this one expands against the patient'sextending part so that it is not drawn back toward the parts.
When the doctor applies pressure on their own joints, and another minister holds the healthy hernia in place at once intervals for when the dislocation returns to ease.
Therefore, when dislocation returns and it is declared to you that the reduction of your limb has been accomplished, then immobilize strongly with bandaging what remains loose thereof, and bind the limb to its sling.
When you fear or protect the nerves that are behind on the ankle, to ensure that the ligament there is not violent and does not lead astray it.
Return that for two or three days, and if the ligament is softened, extend it out.
Return those things in the day or at night for forty days. May it not be that if someone is forced to move forward in this space, their dislocation will not occur there and they will not receive healing care at the same time.
If you apply a poultice on it (the affected area), then administer the substance in which we have described earlier for healing and bandaging purposes herein until its pus is reduced/drained out.
Given that this text is from an ancient medical context with Latin roots and intertwined
Regarding the care for joint displacement of the feet, it translates to: "Concerning the treatment for the dislocation of the
About a joint that has become dislocated, it suggests: "When such an injury occurs where the limb is stretched out slightly (extended), and if not too severe, gently realign them." Here 'them' refers to someone else’s injured limb. The translation indicates basic first aid for managing a mild joint dislocation by carefully straightening it back into place without causing further injury or pain when possible.
If the dislocation occurs at the knee joints of either leg (the two legs), it advises: "When a person's knee is affected and becomes displaced, position their thigh on ground or tabletop with support as they were before falling." This suggests stabilizing both limbs by placing them down safely to prevent movement that could worsen the joint dislocation. The intent here appears to be immobilization using a stable surface while maintaining some form of patient comfort and security, reflective of more primitive or historical first aid approaches where advanced medical equipment is absent. It indicates an attempt
Apply pressure to the injured foot and pause at those joints you mark from where it hurts; place a calcareous object under that very part which is trapped internally, restoring its position back into view above ground level so no further signs of dislocation appear on top. Here 'it' refers again to someone else’s leg with the injury (the person), and this translation suggests applying physical interventions like immobilization using a hard object – possibly stones or heavy objects for stabilizing purposes in ancient times when modern splints are not available. This method seems aimed at realigning what is likely an internal dislocation of bone, requiring careful manipulation without causing additional harm to the patient's
Return the stomach of the patient's body to its cavity, and apply a board that envelopes the entire body; this is done with two caps attached, which are strong and fixed for three days. Afterward, restore such rest periods from walking as necessary until he/she has recovered fully (both physically and financially).
