 CHAPTER FIFTY-FIVE.
On the treatment of boys born with imperforate urinary meatus; or with the meatus small or not in the proper place.
 Sometimes a boy is born from his mother's womb with the glans penis not perforate.
So at the moment of his birth you should be quick and make a perforation with a fine scalpel figured thus.
Then put in the opening a slender leaden sound, tie it and keep it in for three or four days.
When he wishes to make water, it will be removed and he will do so; then put it back.
If you do not put in the leaden sound it may be that the urine passing through the place will prevent the wound from healing.
The case having too narrow a meatus should be treated with the leaden sound, as we have said, for many days until it is wide enough.
In those cases having a misplaced meatusâ€”for example, there are some born with the opening at the edge of the glans so that they cannot make water forwards until the opening of the penis is lifted up by hand, nor can they beget, since the semen cannot reach directly to the uterus, a disorder which is very ugly.
The manner of operating in this case is for the patient to lie back; then with your left hand draw out his glans firmly and cut the end of the glans at the place of the meatus with a broad knife or sharp scalpel, as if sharpening a pen, or as if you were whittling something, so that the middle of it protrudes like a glans penis and the opening falls in the middle as it should.
And beware, in your operating, of haemorrhage, which often happens; meet it with styptics and dress the wound until it heals.
