 CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE.
On cutting for staphyloma.
 When a rupture befalls the uveal membrane so that it swells and protrudes outside the eyelids looking like a grape, and on this account the man's features are disfigured; if you intend to cut it away the operation will be as I am about to describe.
You introduce a needle to the root of the uvea from the lower to the upper segment; then you introduce another needle threaded with a double thread, from the region of the canthus major where you will perforate it; and leave the first needle in its place.
Then cut the place of doubling of the doubled thread, and with it ligature that part of the excrescence around the needle and tie it well.
Then remove the needle and apply to the eye wool moistened with egg-white; and leave till the thread falls away with the growth.
Then treat the eye with fortifying dressings till the wound be healed.
Sometimes the uvea is tied all round with a circle of material so that the prominence of the eye is greatly increased.
Then you perforate it with a fine scalpel going to the depth of the eye; and an albuminous humour will flow out and the eye will shrink and return at once.
Then bandage till healed.
