When the teeth are loose
When the front teeth are loose, either from a blow or from falling, and the patient cannot press on what he eats without them falling out, and you have treated them with constricting medicines, and that does not work; then they must be restrained with a gold thread, because the silver thread turns green and rots, but the gold does not change; and the thread should be medium, neither too thick nor too thin, according to the size of the space between the teeth; and if you want to align the teeth, take the thread and insert it doubled between the two healthy teeth, then place the ends between the loose teeth, if there is one or more, until you wisely reach the healthy tooth on the other side; then start the binding again until the part where you began, and tighten your hand delicately and wisely, until it does not move; and let your binding be at the root of the tooth so that it cannot escape. Then cut the ends of the thread with forceps, and reinsert them between the healthy teeth, and place it so that it does not hurt the tongue; and then leave it tight as long as it can stay, and if it comes loose, or the thread breaks, tighten it with another thread; it will stay and serve thus for a long time, and this is the form of the teeth and the figure of the alignment of the two healthy teeth and the two loose ones, as you see:
And when the teeth fall, they are put back in their place, again and again, as we have said; and no one should handle it who is not wise and patient, and sometimes the form of a tooth is made from cow bone, and it is placed where it is missing, and tightened as we have said, and it stays and serves for a long time.
