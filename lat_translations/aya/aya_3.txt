Praefatio.	Preamble.
Postquam compleui uobis o Filii, librum hunc, qui est postremus scientiae in medicina cum complemento ipsius, et consecutus sum finem in eo, ex expositionibus eius, et ipsius declarationibus, uisum est mihi, ut compleam ipsum uobis cum hoc Tractatu qui est pars operationis, id est, chirurgiae cum manu.	After I have completed to you my son this book, which is the last of the science of medicine with its supplement, and having come to an end in it from its expositions and declarations, it has seemed good to me to complete it for you with this treatise which is part of surgery, that is, with the hand.
Quoniam operatio cum manu prostrata est in regione nostra, et tempore nostro priuata omnino: donec fortasse periit scientia eius, et abscissum est uestigium eius: et non remanserunt ex ea, nisi descriptiones paruae in libris antiquorum, quas mutauerunt manus: et accidit eis error et haesitatio, donec clausae sunt intentiones eius, et elongata est uis ipsius: Visum est mihi, ut uiuificem eam cum ordinatione huius Tractatus in ea secundum uiam ex positionis, et declarationis, et abbreuiationis: et ut ueniam cum formis ferramentorum Cauterii, et reliquorum instrumentorum operis: cum fit ex declarationis additione, et ex properatione eius quod est necesse.	Since surgery with the hand is lying in our region and is private only at our time: until perhaps science has perished, and the trace of it has been lost: and there remain from it only a few descriptions in ancient books, which hands have altered: and it happened to them that they made an error and had hesitation, until their intentions were closed and his vision was prolonged. It seemed good to me that I should uiuify it with this arrangement of this treatise according to the second meaning of exposition and declaration and abbreviation: and that I may make it with the forms of instruments, and the rest of the tools of the operation: for so is it from its addition and its propering that it is necessary.
Caussa autem propter quam non inuenitur bonus artifex eius cum manu sua in hoc nostro tempore, est: quia ars medicinae est longa, et oportet auctorem eius exercitari ante illud in scientia anatomiae, quam narrauit Galenus, donec sciat iuuamenta membrorum, et ipsorum formas, et eorum coniunctionem, et separationem, et habeat cognitionem ossium, et neruorum, et lacertorum, et numerum ipsorum, et eorum egressionem, et uenarum pulsatilium, et quietarum, et locorum exitus earum.	Because for this reason an excellent craftsman with his own hand cannot find good surgery in our present time, it is: because the art of medicine is long, and the author of it must be exercised before it in the science of anatomy which Galen told, until he knows the movements of the limbs, and their forms, and their connection, and separation, and has knowledge of the bones, and nerves, and ligaments, and numbers of them, and their egression, and pulsatile beatings, and quietures, and places of their exit.
Et propter illud dixit Hippocrates, quod nomen cum nomine est multum, et cum opere est paucum, et praecipue in arte manus.	And because of that Hippocrates said, for a name with a name is much, and with work it is little, especially in the art of the hand.
Nos uero iam diximus de illo in introitu huius libri.	We have already spoken about it at the beginning of this book.
Quoniam qui non est sciens, quod diximus de anatomia, non euacuatur, quin iam cadat in errorem, quo interficiuntur homines: sicut ego uidi multos ex illis, qui formantur de hac scientia, et iactant se de ea absque scientia, et sine experimento.	Since who does not know that we have spoken about anatomy, will not be cleared up, unless he falls into error, in which humans fall into, as I saw many of them who form themselves out of this science, and boast themselves from it without knowledge and without experiment.
Quod est, quia uidi medicum stolidum secuisse apostema scrophulosum in collo mulieris, et incidit quasdam arterias in collo: quare fluxit sanguis mulieris, donec cecidit mortua inter manus eius.	A doctor was sawing off an apostema scrofulous wart on the neck of a woman, and he cut some blood vessels in her throat. Why did the blood flow from the woman until she died between her own hands?
Et uidi medicum alium, qui praesumpsit ut extraheret lapidem uiro, qui processerat in aetate, et lapis erat magnus.	I also saw another doctor who thought he would pull out a large stone from the urinary bladder that had been present for some time; but the stone was big.
Peruenit ergo ad eum, et extraxit ipsum cum frusto uesicae.	So he approached it, and removed it with a twig of bamboo.
Quare mortuus est uir in tertio die.	Why did the man die on the third day?
Et ego quidem iam uocatus fueram ad extrahendum ipsum: et uidi ex magnitudine lapidis, et dispositione infirmi, quod moriretur.	And I had already been summoned to remove it; and I saw from the great size of the stone and the care taken by the nurse that he would die.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui accipiebat stipem apud quendam Ducum terrae nostrae propter medicinam: et accidit eunucho nigro, qui erat apud ipsum, fractura in crure eius prope calcaneum: et properauit medicus cum ignorantia sua, et strinxit fracturam super uulnus cum puluinaribus, et astellis strictura forti, et non dimisit uulneri expirationem.	I also saw another doctor who was taking a fee from the Duke of our land for medicine; and a black eunuch, who was with him, broke his thigh near the heel; but the doctor went away without knowledge of the matter, and he bound the fracture together with thin bands and strong nails, and did not let the wound heal.
Deinde absoluit eum secundum desyderia sua.	Then he released it according to his desires.
Postea dimisit eum diebus aliquot, et praecepit ei, ne solueret ligamentum: et stetit sic donec apostematum est crus eius, et ipsius pes, et peruenit ad perditionem.	Then after a few days he sent him away with instructions not to loosen the bands; but he stayed as he was until his leg became rotten, and it came to ruin.
Vocatus sum ergo ad eum: et properaui ad soluendum ligamentum: et consecuta est tranquillitas, et euasit a doloribus suis.	So I was called to him; and I relieved him of the bands; and so it was quiet, and he was free from his pains.
Verumtamen corruptio iam confirmata erat in membro: et non potui refraenare ipsam.	However, the corruption had already become established in the limb; and I could not prevent it.
Pon ergo cessauit corruptio perambulare in membro, donec periit.	Then the corruption ceased to spread in the member, until he died.
Et uidi medicum alium, qui perforauit apostema cancerosum: et ulceratum est post dies, donec magnificata est malicia eius cum domino ipsius.	I also saw another doctor who was piercing a cancerous pustule; and it got worse day by day, until the malignancy of it appeared to its lord.
Quod est, quia quando est cancer purus ex humore melancholico, tunc non oportet ut perueniatur ad eum cum ferro omnino, nisi sit in membro quod toleret, ut abscindatur totum eius.	That is, because when it is cancer pure from the melancholic humor, then it should not be approached with iron at all unless it is in a member that can bear it so as to be cut off completely.
Et propter illud o Filii, necesse est uobis, ut sciatis, quod operatio cum manu diuiditur in duas diuisiones: scilicet, operationem cui associatur salus: et operationem, cum qua est periculum in pluribus dispositionibus.	For this reason, my sons, it is necessary for you to know that surgery is divided into two parts: namely, the operation which is associated with health and the operation with which there is danger in many dispositions.
Et ego iam excitaui in omni loco huius libri, in quo uenit operatio, in qua est terror et timor.	And I have already begun to explain in all the places of this book where surgery occurred, where there was terror and fear.
Quare necesse est uobis, ut caueatis illud, et dimitatis ipsum: ut non inueniant stolidi uiam ad loquendum, et dehonestandum.	Why is it necessary for you to be careful about that, and to avoid it? So that we do not find stupid people talking, and disgracing themselves.
Accipite ergo mensuram cum sollicitudine et protectione, et infirmos uestros cum facilitate et firmitudine, et utimini uia meliore perducente gratia Dei ad salutem et successionem laudabilem: et dimittite aegritudines terribiles difficilis sanationis: et tollite animas uestras ab eo quod facit uos timere, ut ingrediatur super uos haesitatio in fide uestra et commodo uestro.	Therefore, receive with caution and protection, and guide our sick with ease and strength, and use a better path led by the grace of God to health and the admirable succession: and remove the terrible illnesses that cause difficulty in recovery: and take away our souls from there, since it makes you fear, so that it may come upon you a hesitation in our faith and comfort.
Est enim magis remanens ad gloriam uestram, et sublimius in mundo isto, et postremo ad quantitates uestras.	For there remains more to remain for our glory, and higher in the world this is, and finally for the quantities of ours.
Galenus enim iam dixit in quibusdam suis admonitionibus.	Because Galen has already said in some of his advices:
Non medicetis aegritudinem malam: ne nominemini medici mali.	Do not treat diseases that are bad: do not call yourself a doctor of evil.
Iam autem diuisi hunc Tractatum secundum tria Capitula. ¶	I have already divided this treatise into three chapters.
Capitulum primum.	Chapter one:
De Cauterio cum igne, et Cauterio cum medicina acuta, capitulatum, et ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum, et ferramentis Cauterii: et omni quod necessarium est in operatione. ¶	Chapter one:
Capitulum secundum.	Chapter two:
De sectione et perforatione, phlebotomia et uentosis, et uulneribus: et extractione sagittarum, et similibus illius: et totum capitulatum, ordinatum formis instrumentorum. ¶	Chapter two:
Capitulum tertium.	Chapter three:
De restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus illius: capitulatum, ordinatum a capite usque ad pedes, et formis instrumentorum.	and the cure of twists, and similar cases: a treatise, ordered from the head down to the feet, and forms of instruments.
Soli Deo Gloria.	To God alone be glory.
Liber Chirurgici Albucasis.	The Surgery Book of Al-Bāṣīs.
Pars I.	Part I:
¶ De Iuuamento, et Nocumento Cauterii: et quibus complexionibus conueniat, et quo tempore: et si cum ferro, uel auro.	Regarding the Preparation of the Surgeon and the Wound: with which complexions he should be, and at what time: and if with iron, or gold.
Caput I.	Chapter 1.
Sed Ante Quidem Quam rememorer operationis cum eo, oportet ut dicam qualitatem Iuuamentorum eius, et Nocumentorum ipsius: et in qua complexione exhibeatur.	But before that, as soon as I remember the operation with him, it is necessary for me to say the quality of his incisions and wounds: and in which complexion he presents himself.
Dico ergo, quod sermo de qualitate iuuamenti Cauterii, et nocumenti eius, est sermo prolixus, et subtilis, scientia, et secretum occultum.	I will therefore say that the speech about the quality of cauterization's incision and wound is a lengthy, subtle, learned, and secret speech.
Etiam locuta fuit in eo multitudo sapientum, et dissenserunt in eo: et mihi quidem sufficit parum ex sermonibus eorum, timens prolongationem.	Even many wise men spoke in it, and disagreed with each other: and for me alone a little of their speeches is enough, fearing extension.
Dico ergo, quod Cauterium confert uniuersaliter omni complexioni, quae est cum materia, et absque materia: excaeptis duabus complexionibus, quae sunt complexio calida absque materia, et complexio sicca absque materia.	I will therefore say that cauterization is universal to all complexions, whether with substance or without: excepting two complexions, which are a warm complexions without substance, and a dry complexions without substance.
In complexione autem calida et sicca cum materia dissenserunt.	In complexion, however, the warm and the dry, with substance, disagreed.
Quidam enim dixerunt, quod Cauterium iuuatiuum est in ea.	Some have said that cauterization is in it.
Et dixerunt alii contrarium illius, scilicet quod Cauterium non est conueniens in aegritudine, quae est ex caliditate et siccitate: quoniam natura ignis est caliditas: et inconueniens est, ut sanetur ex agritudine calida et sicca, cum calido et sicco.	And others said the opposite of it, that cauterization is not fitting for a sickness, which is from heat and dryness: because the nature of fire is hot; and does not suit, that it should heal a sickness from hot and dry, with hot and dry.
Et dixit ille qui dicit contrarium illius: quod per Cauterium fit iuuamentum in omni aegritudine calida et sicca, quae accidit in corporibus hominum: quoniam quando tu comparas corpus hominis, et humiditates eius, ad complexionem ignis, inuenis corpus hominis frigidum.	And he who says the opposite of it said: That through cauterization is made a healing in all sicknesses hot and dry, which happens in human bodies: for when you compare the human body, and its moistures, to the complexion of fire, you cool down the human body.
Et ego quidem dico per sermonem eius: quia ex perimentum iam detexit mihi illud aliquotiens.	And I myself also say through his speech: because from experiment I have already discovered that sometimes.
Verumtamen non oportet, ut ueniat super illud, nisi qui iam probatus est, et exercitatus in capitulo Cauterii exercitio ultimo, et cognouit diuersitatem complexionum hominum, et dispositionem aegritudinum in se ipsis, et caussas earum, et accidentia ipsarum, et spacium temporis earum.	But it is not necessary that you make it about that, unless he has already been tried, and exercised in the exercise of the chapter on cauterization, and has known the diversity of human complexions, and the disposition of sicknesses to themselves, and the causes of them, and the accidents of them, and the space of their times.
Ex reliquis autem complexionibus non est super uos timor: et praecipue in aegritudinibus frigidis et humidis.	Do not fear also the residue of the poultices; and above all in cold and damp diseases.
Iam enim conuenerunt omnes medici super eas: et non dissenserunt in iuuamento cum Cauterio in eis.	For indeed all doctors have come together on them, and they do not disagree with cautery in them.
Et scitote filii, quod ex secreto curationis per Cauterium cum igne, et bonitate eius super Cauterium cum medicina comburente est: quoniam ignis est simplex, cuius actio non peruenit, nisi ad membrum quod cauterisatur: et non nocet membro alio coniuncto cum eo, nisi nocumento paruo.	And you sons, know that from the secret cure by cautery with fire, and its goodness over cautery with medicine burning is simple: because the action of fire does not reach, unless to the member that is cauterized; and it does not hurt another member joined with it, except with small damage.
Medicinae uero comburentis actio peruenit ad illud quod elongatur ex membris: et fortasse facit accidere in membro aegritudinem difficilis sanationis, et fortasse interficit.	But of medicine burning action reaches to that which is elongated out of the member; and perhaps makes happen in the member difficult disease of cure, and perhaps kills it.
Ignis autem propter subtilitatem suam et bonitatem substantiae suae, non facit illud, nisi superfluat.	But fire because of its subtleness and goodness of its substance does not do that, unless it overflows.
Iam uero innotuit nobis illud per experimentum, propter longitudinem seruitutis et studii cum arte, et stationem super ueritatem rerum: et propter illud excusor a longitudine sermonis.	Indeed I have already made it known to you that by experience, because of the length of practice and study with skill, and station on verity of things: and because of it I excuse from the length of speech.
Et si non esset, quia non licet huic libro meo, afferrem uobis secretum occultum in igne, et qualitatem operationis eius in corporibus expulsionis suae, qua expellit aegritudines sermone philosophico demonstratiuo, qui acueretur a mentibus uestris.	And if it were not, for it is not allowed to my book, I would bring to you the secret and hidden thing in fire, and quality of its action in the bodies of its expulsion, which expels diseases by philosophical demonstration of speech, which was added from the minds of your men.
Et scitote filii, quod ipsi dissentiunt in tempore, in quo conuenit fieri cauterium, et ponunt melius tempus ueris.	And you sons, know that they disagree in the time, in which it is to be made cauterium, and put better time of the wound.
Et ego dico, quod cauterium conuenit in omni tempore: propterea, quod nocumentum accidens propter tempus submergitur in iuuamento, quod attrahitur cum cauterio.	But I say that cauterium is to be made at all times: for the damage that happens because of time is hidden in the healing, which is attracted with cautery.
Et praecipue si cauterium est propter dolores ex doloribus necessariis, fortibus, festinis, qui non tolerant tarditatem: propterea quod timetur ex eis, quod accidat malicia quae est maior, quam paruum nocumentum intrans propter tempus.	And above all if the cauterium is because of the pains from necessary pains, strong, feasts, which do not tolerate tardiness: for they fear them, that happens mischief which is greater, than small damage is intrans because of time.
Et non cadat in mentibus uestris o filii illud, quod non extimant, nisi uulgus et stolidi medici, scilicet quod illi aegritudini quae sanatur per cauterium, non est reditio semper: et ponunt illud consequens, et res non est sicut putant: propterea quod cauterium non est, nisi loco medicinae, quae alterat complexionem, et exiccat humiditates quae sunt caussae, quare accidunt dolores.	And may not fall in the minds of your sons that son, who does not hold back, unless you are common and stupid doctors, namely, that he who has a sickness which is healed by cauterization, is not always returned: and they put down this consequence, and the thing is not as they think: because cauterization is not, except in medicine, which changes the complexion, and dries up the humidities which are the causes, why pains occur.
Verumtamen cauterium superfluit super medicinam per uelocitatem ualetudinis suae, et uirtutem suae operationis, et uehementiam dominii sui: et possibile est, ut redeat aegritudo hora aliqua temporis secundum complexionem infirmi, et locationem aegritudinis suae, et uirtutem eius: et quod praeparatur in corpore eius ex aggregatione superfluitatum in eo: et quod peruenit ad ipsum in acquisitione sua ex cibis, et similibus illis ex caussis, nisi fit aegritudo, in qua administratur cauterium.	However, cauterization surpasses medicine in the speed of its healing power, and the excellence of its operation, and the swiftness of its lordship: and it is possible that it may bring back a sickness at some time of the day according to the complexion of the patient, and the location of his sickness, and the excellence of its cure; and because it is prepared in his body from an excess of gathering in him: and it comes to itself in acquisition from food, and similar things from causes, unless it be a sickness, in which cauterization is administered.
Aegritudo subtilis in membro paucarum superfluitatum, et humiditatum, sicut cauterium dentis, propter dolorem, et similia illi, possibile est enim, ut non redeat in eo ille dolor.	A sickness of the body is less likely to be healed by cauterization than an excess of little members and humors, such as a toothache, because of the pain, and similar ones; for it is possible that this pain may not be healed in him.
Sed illud fit in paucis.	But this happens in a few.
At uero sermo uulgi iterum, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, est sermo rectus: non ad illud quod ipsi intendunt in illo: quoniam ipsi credunt, quod non est curatio quae conferat cum medicina, neque cum alio post occasum cauterii.	But the word of the common people again, that cauterization is the last medicine, is a straight word: it does not refer to what they intend in him; for they believe that there is no cure which is brought about by medicine, and by nothing else after the occasion of cautery.
Res autem est econtrario illius, et intentio, quod cauterium est postremum medicinae, non est, nisi quod quando nos administramus modos curationis in aliqua aegritudinum, et non conferunt illae medicinae: deinde administramus in fine rei cauterium, et confert: tunc inde cadit, quod cauterium est postremum mediciuae, non secundum intentionem quam intelligunt uulgus et multistolidorum medicorum.	But the opposite of this is true, and the intent, that cauterization is the last medicine, is not, unless when we administer methods of cure in some illnesses, and they do not confer these medicines: then we administer at the end of the thing cauterization, and it confers; then it falls, that cauterization is the last medicine, not according to the intent which the common people and many stupid doctors understand.
Antiqui autem dixerunt, quod cauterium cum auro est melius, quam cauterium cum ferro: et non dixerunt illud, nisi propter aequalitatem auri, et sublimitatem substantiae suae: et dixerunt, quod non facit pus locus cauterii.	But the ancients say that it is better to apply cautery with gold than with iron; and they did not say this except for the reason that gold is equal in strength to flesh and yet does not corrode it; and they say that there is no need of a place for cauterization.
Verum non est illud absolute: quoniam ego iam probaui illud, et inueni, quod ipsum non facit illud in quibusdam corporibus absque aliis.	But this is not absolutely true; for I have tried it myself and found that it does not work in certain parts of the body without other means.
Et cauterium cum ipso est bonum, et melius quam cum ferro, sicut dixerunt.	And cautery with gold is good, and better than with iron, as they say.
Verumtamen quando tu ignis cauterium in igne ex auro, non declaratur tibi, quando ignitur secundum quantitatem quam uis, propter rubedinem auri: et quando properat ad ipsum frigus, et si addis super ipsum ignitionem, liquescit in igne, et uertitur in laminas.	But when you ignite the cautery from gold in fire, it is not revealed to you, when it burns according to the quantity that you use, because of the redness of gold: and when it comes to itself, and if you add ignition on it, it melts in fire and becomes thin sheets.
Quare cadit artifex ex illo in occupationem: et propter illud fit Cauterium cum ferro apud nos uelocius et propinquius, ex rectitudine ad operationem.	Why does the artisan fall from that in business; and because of that do we prefer cautery with iron among us more quickly and closer, from its rightness towards the work?
Et ego quidem iam ordinaui hoc Capitulum in Cauterio, secundum capitula: et ordinaui ea a capite usque ad pedes: ut alleuient quaerenti illud quod uult ex eo.	And I too have already arranged this chapter on cautery according to chapters; and I have arranged it from the head to the feet, that you may easily find what you want from it.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Caput in commissura coronali.	About the way of cauterizing the top of the nose.
Caput II.	The second top.
Confert hic cauterizatio ad dominium humiditatis et frigiditatis super cerebrum: quae duae sunt caussae sodae, et multitudinis fluxus humorum ex capite ad partes oculorum et aurium, et multitudinis somni, et doloris dentium, et doloris gutturis: et uniuersaliter omnis aegritudinis, quae accidit ex frigiditate, sicut paralisis, et sodae, epilepsiae, et apoplexiae, et similia illis ex aegritudinibus.	Confirm here cauterization towards the domain of humidity and coldness over the brain: which are two causes of blood, and multitude of flow of humors from the head to the parts of the eyes and ears, and multitude of sleep, and pain in the teeth, and pain in the throat: and universally all sickness, which happens from coldness, such as paralysis, and soya, and epilepsies, and apoplexies, and similar ones from those illnesses.
Modus cauterizationis est, ut praecipias infirmo: ut euacuetur in primis cum medicina solutiua mundificante caput tribus noctibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod exigit uirtus infirmi, et eius aetas, et consuetudo eius.	The way of cauterizing is, that you draw out with a soluble medicine the head three nights or four, according to the need of the sickness, and its age, and custom of it.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radi faciat caput suum cum nouacula.	Then tell him to cut his head with a scalpel.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas quadratum, ita quod iam posuit manus suas super pectus suum.	Then have him sit between your hands and face the fourth side, so that he has already placed his hands on his chest.
Deinde pone radicem palmae tuae super radicem nasi sui inter oculos suos.	Then place the root of your palm over the root of his nose between his eyes.
Vbicumque ergo peruenerit digitus tuus medius, signa locum illum cum incausto.	Whatever way your middle finger goes, mark that spot with a bit of pepper.
Deinde igni Cauterium Oliuare: cuius haec est forma.	Then put olive oil on the cautery, which has this shape.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum signatum cum incausto, descensione, qua constringatur manus tua paulatim, et tu reuolues ipsum.	Then place the specimen at the marked spot with the oil, and compress your hand slowly, and you turn it around.
Deinde leua manum tuam uelociter, et aspicias locum.	Then quickly lift your hand up, and look at the spot.
Quod si uides iam detegi ex osse quantitatem capitis alkiel, aut quantitatem zeuherbi, tunc eleua manum tuam.	If you see that he has already removed a quantity of skull, or a quantity of hair, then quickly lift your hand up.
Et si non, itera manum tuam ferro ipso, aut cum alio ab ipso si infrigidatur: donec uideantur ossa, quae dixi tibi.	And if not, repeat the motion of your hand with the iron, or with another one if it is cold: until you see the bones, which I told you.
Deinde sume aliquid ex sale, et solue illud in aqua, et imbibe in ipso cotum, et pone super locum: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then take some salt and dissolve it in water, and drink it with the bag, and place it on the spot: and release him after three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum cotum imbibitum in butyro, et dimitte illum super locum, donec destruatur eschara ignis.	Then place the soaked bag on top of the specimen and release it on the spot, until the fire goes out.
Deinde cura illud cum unguento tetrapharmacon, usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of that with the four-part ointment, until it heals.
Iam dixerunt, quod quanto uulnus plus remanet apertum, emittit pus: quare est melius et magis iuuatiuum.	They have already said that as long as there is a wound open, it will discharge pus: why is this better and more beneficial?
Et dixerunt quidam eorum, ut cauterizetur cutis usque ad os: et teneatur Cauterium, donec aduratur quiddam spissitudinis ossis.	And one of them said: 'The skin should be cauterized all the way down to the bone': and the cautery should be held, until some ossification appears.
Deinde radatur post illud quod adustum est ex osse, deinde curetur.	Then scrape after that which is burnt from the bone, then cauterize again.
Et dicunt alii, quod oportet ut cum cauterio perueniatur ad ultimum, donec imprimat in os impressionem for tem, ita quod cadat os, quod fit sicut forma kirate: aut instrumentum quod mulieres ponunt infuso alphabeti parui: et extimant, quod exspirantur ex hoc loco uapores capitis, et dimittatur uulnus apertum tempore longo.	And others say that it should be scraped with the cautery up to the last part, until it makes an impression on the bone like a stamp, so that the bone is made as in the shape of a crown: or an instrument that women put in a little cup and pour out, which they call alpha, and measure it, since from this place vapours of the head are exhaled, and the wound is closed after a long time.
Deinde curetur, donec consolidetur.	Then treat, until it has healed.
Mihi autem non uidentur hae duae species Cauterii omnino nisi in quibusdam hominibus secundum uiam timoris.	Which, however, are not evident to me at all these two kinds of cauterization unless they are present in some people according to the first fear.
Et dimittere ipsum, apud me est melius cum salute ipsius.	And let go of him, with me it is better when he is healthy.
Debilitatur enim caput ex solutione continuitatis ipsius naturalis: sicut testificati sumus in reliquis membris: et praecipue quando caput infirmi debile est natura: et species quidem Cauterii prima est magis salua et melior apud me, et ea utor: operare ergo cum ea in salute.	For the head is weakened by the continuation of its natural solution: as we have testified in the other members; and especially when the head is weak with sickness: and the species of cauterization is first more healthy and better to me, and I use it: then let's operate while he is healthy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi capitis in dolore totius capitis.	The mode of cauterizing the head when it is whole (in one piece).
Caput III.	Head III.
Quando in toto Capite accidit dolor chronicus: et prolongatur illud in infirmo, et utitur hyeris, et cochiis, et caputpurgiis, et oleis, et empleumatis.	When there is a chronic pain in the whole head and it is prolonged in the sick, and he uses ointments, and poultices, and washings, and oils, and employments (such as).
Et praecipue si iam cauterizatum est cauterio uno, quod narrauimus, et non confert ei aliquid ex illis: tunc considera.	And especially if it has already been cauterized by one kind of cauterization, which we have described, and does not benefit from any of them: then examine.
Nam si caput infirmi est fortis creationis natura, et non est debile, et inuenit frigus uehemens: tunc cauteriza cum cauterio alio sub illo parum.	For if the head is sick with the strength of nature, and is not weak, and there is a sharp coldness: then cauterize it with another kind of cauterization under it little by little.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio, do nec pertranseat cutis, et discooperiatur ex osse quantitas, quam narrauimus.	Then cauterize him on all the horns of his head with his own cauterization, and don't let it pass through the skin, and disclose a quantity from the bone, which we have described.
Et cauteriza ipsum cauterio uno in occipitio capitis sui, in loco qui nominatur uas: et est locus in quo ponitur uentosa: et eleua matum tuam in hoc, et non discooperias os.	And cauterize him with one kind of cauterization on the back of his head in the place which is called the "wind" and this is a place where there is a breeze; and dip your finger in water in this place, and do not disclose the bone.
Infirmus enim inuenit propter illud dolorem uehementem, et diuersum a dolore reliquorum cauteriorum capitis omnium.	For the sick is troubled by that sharp pain, and is far from the pain of all the other heads' cauterization.
Et ego dicam hoc Cauterium in loco suo: et oportet quod sit cauterium, quo cauterizantur cornua capitis, et occiput eius subtilius cauterio, quo cauterizatur medium capitis.	And I will call this cauterization in its place; and it must be a cauterization by which the horns of the head are cauterized, and the back of his head is cauterized with a smaller kind of cauterization, by which the middle of the head is cauterized.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is his form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in hemicrania, tam cum medicina adustiua, quam cum ferro.	In case of a headache, whether with or without medicine, as with iron.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando accidit in parte capitis dolor et soda, aut extenditur dolor usque ad oculum, et euacuatur cum medicinis mundificantibus caput, et administratur reliqua curatio, quam dixi in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert illud totum: tunc cauterizatio in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterizatio cum medicina acuta comburente: aut cum ferro.	When it hurts in one part of the head and soapes, or extends the pain to the eye, and the head is washed with cleaning medicines, and the rest of the treatment is administered as I have mentioned in the division of illnesses, and does not give all of that: then cauterization is according to two ways: either cauterization with burning medicine: or with iron.
Cauterium autem cum medicina acuta comburente, est, ut accipias dentem unum allii, et excortices ipsum, et abscindas extremitates eius ex duobus lateribus.	But if cauterization is with burning medicine, it is as if you take one of the teeth of a cow, and you cut it into two sides.
Deinde scinde locum doloris in tempore cum phlebotomo lato, donec fiat in eo locus sub cute, in quo dens capitur.	Then cut the area of pain at the time with a blade on one side, until a place appears under the skin where the pain is caught.
Intromitte ergo eum in ipso sub cute, donec occultetur: deinde stringe super ipsum cum puluillo constrictione decenti, et dimitte ipsum quantitate quindecim horarum deinde solue eum, et extrahe allium, et dimitteuulnus duobus diebus, aut tribus: postea pone super ipsum cotum submersum in butyro, donec locus efficiat pus: deinde cura ipsum cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then introduce it into that under the skin, until it is hidden: then tie it tightly with a thread of constricting knot, and let it go for fifteen hours, then unravel it, and remove it on the second day or third: then put a covered thing over the spot immersed in butter, until a pus place appears: then heal the spot with ointment until it heals.
Et si uis fac illud cum quibusdam medicinis comburentibus, quas ego scripsi in tractatu duodecimo, de Medieinis adurentibus.	And if you want to do that with certain medicines that burn, which I have written in the 12th book, on Medicinal Incantations.
Cauterizatio uero eius cum ferro, est secundum hunc modum.	But if cauterization is with iron, it is according to this way.
Igni Cauterium, cuius forma haec est.	Fire cauterization, whose form is this:
Et nominatur Clauilis: quoniam forma capitis eius est sicut forma claui, in quo est quiddam curuitatis, et in medio eius est quaedam eminentia parua.	And it is called a Klis; because the form of the head is like the form of a kleis, in which there is some curvature, and in the middle of it there is a small eminence.
Deinde pone ipsum super locum, et retine manum tuam: et tu reuolue ferrum paulatim cum uelocitate: et sit quantitas quae aduritur ex spissitudine cutis, sicut medietas eius.	Then put the iron on that place, and hold your hand: and you turn the iron little by little with speed: and let the amount that burns be according to the thickness of the skin, such as half of it.
Et eleua manum tuam, ut non aduratur arteria, quae est inferius, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And pray that your hand does not hurt, so that the artery below does not rupture and blood flow occurs.
Deinde imbibe cotum in aqua salis, et pone super locum, et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus: deinde pone cotum cum butyro: postea cura cum unguento usquequo sanetur.	Then dip the bandage in salt water and place it on the spot, and leave it for three days: then dip it with butter: afterwards apply ointment until it heals.
Et si uis, cauteriza hanc hemicraniam cum extremitate cultellari secunda Cauterii.	And if there is a headache, cauterize this headache with the point of a scalpel, second time with cauterization.
Et caue ab incisione arteriae in hac hemicrania, non antiqua proprie.	And do not cut the artery in this headache, but use the old one's own.
¶ De modo cauteriezandi in hemicrania antiqua.	The mode of cauterizing in a headache:
Caput V.	Head 5.
Quando curas hemicraniam, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione praecedente, et quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum, et non confert curatio: et uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei quod diximus ex cauterio primo cum medicina, aut cum cauterio cum igne, tunc oportet ut ignias Cauterium cultellare, donec albificetur postquam signas super locum doloris cum linea, cuius longitudo sit medietas digiti, aut quasi illud: et depone manum tuam uice una, et stringe eam donec incidas arteriam, et peruenias usque ad os.	When you are healing a headache, with the method we have mentioned before in connection with cures for diseases, and as we have mentioned in respect of divisions of illnesses, and when there is no effect from this treatment: then you will see from the illness that it does not suffice to apply the cautery at first with medicine, or with the cautery with fire; then you must apply the fire of the cauterization until it turns white after the signs on the spot of pain with a line whose length is half a finger, or almost like that: and place your hand in a grip and squeeze it until you hit the artery, and reach as far as the mouth.
Verumtamen necesse est tibi, ut caueas a continuatione mandibulae, quae mouetur apud masticationem, ne aduratur latus, aut neruus qui mouet ipsam, unde accidat spasmus.	However, you must cauterize the jaw which moves during chewing, so that it does not hurt on one side or the nerve which moves it, from which spasm occurs.
Et esto super custotiam, et cautelam de fluxu sanguinis arteriae, quae abscisa est.	And be on guard, and take care with regard to the flow of blood from the artery which has been cut off.
In abscisione enim eius est timor, et praecipue ei qui ignorat illud quod facit, et non est studiosus, nec expertus: et dimittit operationem cum eo in primis.	For there is a danger in cutting it off, and especially for one who does not know what he is doing, and is not learned or experienced: and he dismisses the operation with that.
Et ego ueniam cum rememoratione regiminis fluxus sanguinis accidentis ex arteria secundum modum suum, et in loco suo huius libri.	And I come with a reminder about the treatment of blood flow from an artery according to its way, and in its place in this book.
Quod si uides ex aegritudine, quod non sufficit ei hoc Cauterium, et uides corpus infirmi tolerans cauterium in medio capitis, sicut narrauimus, cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	If you see from illness that this cautery does not suffice, and you see the body bearing up the cauterization in the middle of the head as we have told, take care of a wound, until it heals.
Et si uis, administra Cauterium, quod diximus in capitulo extractionis arteriae cum Cauterio habente duos cultellos.	And if you see it, administer cauterization, which we have said in the chapter on arteriotomy with a cautery instrument having two knives.
Est enim cauterizatio melior hac et magis conferens.	For cauterization is better and more beneficial than this.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in dolore Aurium.	(On the method of cauterizing in ear pain.)
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Quando accidit in Aure dolor a frigore, et curatur cum solutiuis, et reliqua curatione quam diximus in diuisione, et non remouetur dolor, tunc igni Cauterium: et est illud quod nominatur Punctum, cuius forma est haec.	When pain occurs in the ear from cold, and the cure is with solutions, and the remainder of the treatment as we have said in the division, and the pain does not disappear, then fire cauterization: and that is what is called a point, whose form is this.
Deinde puncta cum eo post eius ignitionem in circumitu auris totius, sicut reuoluitur: aut in circumitu utriusque, si simul dolor est in utrisque.	Then the points with it after its ignition around the whole ear, as it resolves itself: or in the circumcision of both, if at the same time pain is in both.
Et elonga te cum Cauterio a radice auris parumper, postquam signaueris loca cum encaustro: et sit cauterii quantitas decem punctorum in omni aure, et quasi illa.	And lengthen it with the cautery from the root of the ear slightly, after you have marked the places with the caustic: and let the amount of the cautery be ten points all over the ear, and almost the same.
Deinde cura loca, donec sanentur.	Then cure the place, until they are healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tortura.	(On the method of cauterizing in torture.)
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.Et si uis, administra Cauterium
Tortura quae curatur cum cauterizatione, non est nisi ex speciebus, quae accidunt ex phlegmate, secundum quod diximus in diuisionibus aegritudinum.	And if you want to administer cauterization in torture, it is not except for the species that occur from phlegm, according to which we have said in the divisions of diseases.
Et deuita cauterizationem speciei, quae accidit ex exiccatione, et spasmo nerui.	And distant cauterization of a species that occurs from dryness, and spasm of a nerve.
Quando curas hanc speciem torturae cum hyeris, et caputpurgiis, et gargarismis, et non confert curatio tua, tunc oportet ut cauterizes infirmum tribus Cauteriis: uno apud radicem auris, et secundo parum inferius a timpore suo, et tertio apud coniunctionem duorum labiorum.	When you cure this species of torture with hipirrhea, and caputpurgia, and gargarisms, and your treatment does not bring about a cure, then you should cauterize the sick person with three cauteries: one near the root of the ear, and a second a little below its edge, and a third at the junction of the two lips.
Et pone Cauterium tuum ex contrario partis infirmae.	And place your cautery on the opposite side of the weak part.
Quoniam mollificatio non accidit, nisi in parte quae apparet sana.	For softening does not occur unless in the part that appears to be healthy.
Et forma cauterizationis est, ut cauterizes ipsum Cauterio in directo extremitatis auris superioris sub cornu capitis parum: et alio in timpore: cuius longitudo sit secundum longitudinem pollicis.	And the form of the cautery is that it cauterizes itself at the very tip of the upper ear by the corner of the head slightly: and another in the timpan: whose length should be according to the length of a thumb.
Et depone manum tuam cum cauterio, donec comburatur quantitas medietatis spissitudinis cutis.	And lay your hand with the cautery, until a quantity of half-thickness of skin has burned.
Et haec est forma Cauterii, et est species ex cultellari, cuius forma praemissa est: uerumtamen non est subtilior ea parum, sicut uides: et oportet ut sit cultellus in eo superfluae grossitudinis parum.	And this is the form of cautery, and its shape is from a scalpel, whose shape is as follows: indeed it is not more subtle by a little, as you see: and it should be that the blade is in it slightly too thick.
Deinde cura loca, cum eo quod praecessit: donec sanetur.	Then care for the place, with what preceded it: until it heals.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Apoplexia antiqua.	§ On the way of cauterizing in ancient apoplexia.
Caput VIII.	CHAPTER VIII.
QUando antiquatur Apoplexia, et curas eam cum eo quod diximus, et non confert medicatio tua, et infirmus non habet febrem, tunc cauteriza eum quatuor cauteriis super omne cornu capitis sui, et cauterio in medio capitis, sicut diximus, et cauterio in occipitio capitis, secundum quod praecessit: et modus cauterii sit secundum quod praecessit.	When an ancient apoplexia is established, and care for it has been as we have said, and your medicine does not help, and the patient has no fever, then cauterize him with four cauterizations on all the horns of his head, and a cautery in the middle of his head, as we have said, and a cautery in his occiput, according to what preceded: and the mode of cauterization should be according to what preceded.
Etiam cauterizatur cum Cauterio super os stomachi: et est magis ultimum.	Also cauterize with the cautery above the throat of the stomach: and it is more final.
Deinde curetur, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then care for it, with what preceded it.

Deinde rade caput infirmi totum, et pone super occipitium eius emplastrum de synapi descriptum in tractatu emplastrorum: et pone ipsum aliquotiens.	Then wash his head entirely with milk, and put over his occiput a plaster of myrrh described in the treatise on plasters: and put him on occasion.
Ipsum namque est modus Cauterii: et fac illud secundum ordinem eundem, quem dixi illic.	But this is the mode of cauterization: and make it according to the order given there.
Si ergo sanatur per illud, bonum est.	If then he heals by that, it is good. Sed si non sanatur, iterum curetur, et iterum, usque ad qu
Si non: tunc fac ei cauteria tria in posteriori parte capitis sui, quae sint descendentia a superiori parte capitis usque ad inferiorem partem oculi: et pone inter omne cauterium grossitudinem digiti.	But if not: then care for him again, and again, until he is healed: then put between every cautery slightly the thickness of a finger.
Deinde cura Cauterium, cum eo quod praecessit.	Then care for the cauterization, with what preceded it.
Si autem uis additionem, et infirmus est tolerans illud: tunc fac ei Cauterium in medio.	If however you wish to add a stitch, and he is a weak one who accepts it: then make him a cautery in the middle.
Quod si uis additionem: tunc cauteriza ipsum super duo cornua.	That if you wish to add a stitch: then cauterize him himself on two horns.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: sitque Cauterium oliuare secundum formam, quae praemissa est.	Then take care of the wound, until it is healed: and let the cautery be greased after the form, which has been mentioned above.

Deinde rade caput infirmi: postea cauteriza ipsum cauterio in medio capitis, et cauterio super omne cornu capitis, et cauterio super posterius ipsius, et tribus super spondiles colli.	Then wash the head with milk: then cauterize him with a cautery in the middle of the head, and a cautery on all the horns of the head, and a cautery on the posterior part, and three on the spine of the neck.
Si autem indiges in aegritudine mollificatione corporis pluribus illis, et infirmus est tolerans, et aegritudo est fortis: tunc cauteriza ipsum quatuor cauteriis super spondiles dorsi, et ultima cum cauterio, donec comburatur ex cute plurimum eius, et eleua manum tuam.	If however you are indigent in the softening of the body with many of these, and he is a weak one who accepts it, and the disease is strong: then cauterize him with four cauteries on the spine of the back, and the last with a cautery, until it is burned out from his skin by fire, and wash your hand.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur: et sic cauterium Oliuare.	Then take care of the wound, until it is healed: and let the cautery be greased.

It is necessary that you should first purify his brain with hyssop, and with the other purification which I have said in the division: when he is a great weakling, or accepts medical treatment.
Si autem est puer, qui non tolerat medicinas, tunc administratur gargarisma, et masticationes mundificantes cerebrum, ante illud diebus multis cum bonificatione ciborum.	If however he is a youth who does not tolerate medicine, then administer a gargle, and chewing which purifies the brain, before those days with many good foods.
Deinde rade caput eius, postea cauteriza ipsum Cauterio uno in medio capitis, secundum quod praecessit in modo: et cauterio alio in occipitio eius, et super omne cornu capitis sui cauterio.	Then wash his head with milk, then cauterize him with a cautery in the middle of his head, and another on the occiput, and on all the horns of his head.

Et si caussa melancholiae est superfluitas decliuis ad melancholiam, et est corpus infirmi humectum, tunc da ei in potu quod mundificet cerebrum eius, secundum quod praecessit in diuisione: deinde rade caput infirmi, et fac postea tortellam decenter factam ex lino, sicut circulum.	And if the cause of melancholy is a superabundance of release into melancholy, and his body is wet with humidity, then give him in a drink what will mend his brain, according to that which has preceded in division: and then shave his head, and afterwards make a tortious thread made of linen, like a circle.
Deinde pone ipsam in medio capitis: et infirmus sedens quadratus teneatur ab omni parte.	Then put it in the midst of his head: and the sick one, sitting, should hold himself at a distance from all parts.
Deinde praesenta linimentum.	Then present the ointment.

Et custodi ipsum ab omnibus humiditatibus, et fac eum sedere in balneo, in ieiunio diebus aliquot.	And keep him away from all moisture, and let him sit in a bath, on a few days of fast.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut radat caput suum, et cauteriza ipsum in medio capitis sui.	Then command him to shave his head, and cauterize it in the middle of his head.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum super duo timpora duobus cauteriis, si est incaeptio descensus aquae in duobus oculis simul: aut ex latere uno, si est incaeptio aquae in oculo uno: et abscinde cum cauterio omnes uenas et arterias quae sunt sub cute: et sint cauteria in ea longa in latitudine timporum: et caue a fluxu sanguinis.	Then cauterize him over two temples with two cauterizations, if the beginning of water is present in both eyes simultaneously: or from one side, if it is present in one eye only: and cut off all the veins and arteries which are under the skin: and let there be cauterizations in her long in length.
Quod si uides aliquid ex eo, tunc abscinde eum statim cum quacumque medicina est possibile: et ego ueniam cum sapientia, quae est in extractione arteriarum, et abscisione earum, et cautela a fluxu sanguinis.	What if you see anything of it, then cut it off immediately with whatever medicine is possible: and I will come with wisdom, which is in the extraction of arteries, and in their dissection, and in caution to stop the flow of blood.

When the tears of the eyes are old and persistent, and they stand on the veins and arteries that are on the outside of the head, it is known that this is from cold and phlegmatic humours: then cauterize with the same cautery which I have mentioned in the beginning of descending water, cautery in the middle of the head, and two cauterizations over two bones, and two cauterizations in the hair under two bones.
Et si indiges additione, tunc cauteriza ipsum in omni latere caute oculi, super extremitatem supercilii cum cauterio paruo.	And if he can stand to add a little, then cauterize him in every side of the eye, at the end of the brow with a small cautery.

And if there is a need, cauterize it above the two eyelids with two cauteries on the whole part: and let them extend by two hands: and let the length of each cautery be according to the length of the lid: and do not put your hand near the cautery, but according to the quantity that burns, let there be a third eyelid.

¶ De modo cauterizandi Palpebram cum pili inuersantur pungentes oculum.	The way to cauterize the eyelid with hair that pierce the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter 17.
Cauterium in eo est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum igne: aut cauterium cum medicina comburente.	The cautery is in two ways: with fire, or with burning medicine.
In cauterio autem cum igne, praecipe infirmo ante illud, ut dimittat pilos suos, si est ex illis qui mundant eos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	But in the cautery with fire, instruct the patient beforehand to stop shedding his hair, if he is one who cleans it, until it grows and becomes even.
Si autem pungunt eum apud ortum suum: tunc constringe oculos eius cum uitta, ut non moueantur, donec nascantur.	But if it pierces him at the root: then tighten the eyes with poultice, so that they do not move until they are healed.
Cum ergo nascuntur et aequantur, tunc pone caput infirmi in sinu tuo: deinde signa super Palpebram oculorum eius cum encaustro, signo quod sit secundum figuram folii myrti: et sit principium signi prope pilos.	When they are healed and even, then place the head of the patient in your lap: and afterwards mark the eyelids of his eyes with encaustum, a mark that is according to the shape of the leaf of myrrh: and let the beginning of the mark be near the hair.
Deinde pone cotum imbibitum in albumine oui: aut in mucilagine psilii super oculum.	Then place the poultice wet with albumin on the eye or in silk mucus.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius forma est haec.	Then the fire cautery, whose form is this:
Deinde cauteriza super figuram, quam signasti paulatim in uicibus multis, donec comburatur superficies cutis, quae est sicut figura folii myrti, totam apparentem proprie.	Then cauterize on the shape, which you have marked little by little in many places, until it is burned through the surface of the skin, which is as if the figure of a palm leaf, all apparent by itself.
Et signum sanitatis operis tui est: ut si uideas Palpebram oculi iam contrahi, et pilos eleuari apud puncturam oculi.	And the sign of the work of your health is: if you close the eyelids of the eye already and remove the hair at the point of the eye.
Eleua ergo manum tuam tunc: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	So then raise your hand: and send it away for three days.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur eschara.	Then place on the spot a poultice with butter until the sore is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the spot with ointment until it heals.
Quod si redeat aliquod ex pilis post horam, et mollificetur palpebra: tunc itera Cauterium super illum locum, sicut fecisti in primis.	That if any of the hairs return after an hour, and the eyelid becomes soft: then repeat the cautery on that spot, as you did in the first place.
Si autem pili sunt in inferiori: tunc cauteriza ipsam, donec eleuetur ad locum suum naturalem: et aequetur ut non pungant pili oculum.	But if the hairs are in the lower part: then cauterize the spot until it returns to its natural place: and adjust so that the hairs do not sting the eye.

Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII.
Est ut praecipias infirmo, ut dimittat pilos, donec prolongentur et aequentur.	It is as you instruct the sick person to let the hair grow on, until it grows long and even.
Fac ex charta de panno formam folii myrti.	Make in the shape of a palm leaf form out of a sheet of cloth.
Deinde accipe ex sapone cognito, et ex calce non imbibita ex unoquoque pondus uncia I aut quasi illud: deinde tere ea simul contritione bona, et fac illud cum festinatione, ut non infrigidetur.	Then take out of known soap and not imbibed in water from each pound of a pound or almost like that: then dry it all at the same time with good wringing, and make it with urgency, so as not to grow cold.
Deinde ex pande ex eo super chartam quam fecisti sicut formam folii myrti, et pone ipsum super palpebram oculi unius, aut duorum.	Then out of the cloth from that which you made in the form of a palm leaf, and place the spot on one eyelid or both.

Et tu moueas ipsum quotiens sentit infirmus mordicationem medicinae: quoniam inuenit eius mordicatio sicut ignis.	And thou shall move him when he feels sick to the touch of medicine: for his touch is like fire.
Dum ergo perseuerat hoc quod ipse inuenit mordicatio, tunc dimitte medicinam, et moue ipsam cum digito tuo.	But while this was so that he found out about the touch, then dismiss medicine, and move it with your finger yourself.
Cum ergo quiescit mordicatio, tunc remoue medicinam, et ablue oculum cum aqua.	But when the touch of the medicine has ceased, then remove medicine, and wash the eye with water.
Et considera tunc, si uides palpebram eleuari, sicut eleuatur apud contractionem cum igne, aut cum incisione, est bene: et si non, tunc itera super ipsam ex medicina super locum, in quo non imprimit medicina, et non denigrat, donec aequetur operatio tua, et contrahatur oculus.	And consider then, if you see the eyelid go up, as it were removed from contraction with fire, or with incision, is good: and if not, then repeat on him out of medicine on the spot where medicine does not print, and does not deteriorate, until your operation is adequate, and the eye closes.
Deinde pone super ipsum Cotum cum butyro, donec eradicetur cutis adustionis.	Then put on top of it the poultice with butter, until the skin of the injury is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento diaphinicon, aut alio, donec sanetur.	Then care for him with the ointment diaphanum, or other, until he is healed.
Et necesse est tibi apud operationem, ut custodias ultima custodia, ne in oculum cadat aliquid ex medicina.	And it is necessary for you near the operation, to keep the last guard, so that nothing falls into the eye from medicine.
Quod si mollificatur palpebra post dies, et pugnat ex capillis aliquid in oculo, tunc itera medicinam super illum locum, qui mollificatur ex palpebra proprie, sicut fecisti in primis.

Then put the cotton wisp soaked in the infusion on his eyeball, or in the slippery elution of psillium; then apply fire cautery, whose shape is thus: and if the wisp sits penetrating all the way to one end, with which it makes the cauterium; and if the wisp sits up high like this.
Verumtamen hoc concauum est melius ad opus tuum.	However, this cotton wisp is better for your task.

Et tene cum eo manum tuam parumper apud Cauterium ab oculo, ad partem nasi, ut non erret manus tua, aut inquietetur infirmus: et ponas Cauterium in adipe oculi, et corrumpas ipsum.	And hold it gently near the fire cautery from the eye, toward the nose side, so that your hand doesn't wander or shake; and place the fire cautery into the fat of the eye, and dissolve it.
Si ergo peruenis in principio Cauterii tui usque ad os, erit bene.	If then you hold the fire cautery near the eye as described above, it will be good.

And if you wish, dip the thread, or wrap it in cold butter, and place it on the tooth that is hurting; and place iron which has been heated on top of it, until the fire reaches the depth of the cavities of the tooth.
Cauterizatio autem eius cum igne est, ut intendas ad cannulam aeris, aut cannulam ferri.	But cauterize it with fire, so that you may direct it towards the hole of air, or the hole of iron.

Fac illud aliquotiens, nam dolor remouebitur, aut in illo eodem die, aut die alio.	Do this sometimes, because the pain is relieved, or do it on the same day, or on another day.
Et oportet in impressione illius Cauterii, ut impleat infirmus os suum buyro bono, et teneat ipsum hora una: deinde exspuat ipsum.

Quando accidit exitura, et uis scire, si illud apostema est in carne Epatis, aut in tunica eius: tunc si est in carne Epatis, inuadit infirmum dolor, et grauitas absque acuitate: et si est in tunica Epatis, cum dolore est acuitas uehemens: et uides iam, quia fatigauit medicos eius curatio.	When the problem has developed and you need to know, if that pustule is in the liver or in its membrane: then, if it is in the liver, you will see a dull pain, and there will be no sharpness: and if it is in its membrane, the pain will be sharp; and you will see that the treatment of doctors is tiring.
Oportet ergo ut resupinet infirmus super ceruicem suam.	Therefore, let the sick person lie on his back.
Deinde figura locum apostematis cum encaustro: deinde ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	Then determine the position of the pustule with respect to the surface of the body. Then set fire to the cautery so that it radiates.
Et haec est forma eius.	This is its form.
Et cauteriza cum eo cauterium unum, donec comburatur cutis tota, et perueniat ad siphac, donec egrediatur sanies tota: deinde cura ipsum curatione exiturarum, donec sanetur.	And cauterize it with one cautery, until the skin is completely burned over and reaches the syphac, until all the pus has come out: then care for the person who is treating the pustules, until they heal.
Et non oportet ut hac cauterii specie utatur, nisi cuius studium in arte medicinae prolongatur: et per cuius manus concurrunt aegritudines istae cum experimento aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super huiusmodi operationem.	And it is not necessary that the appearance of this cautery be used, unless the study of medicine is prolonged in someone: and because, from time to time, some disease can be brought about by experiment: then one should dare to perform such an operation.
At uero dimittere ipsam, apud me est melius.	But, if you want to stop it, it is better with me.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Pleuresi.	Regarding the method of cauterizing in the pleura.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Dixerunt antiqui, cauterium cum radicibus aristolochiae ad Pleuresim frigidam secundum hunc modum.	The ancients said that they used to cauterize with radices of arista lochaea on the pleura in this way.
Et est, ut recipias ex radicibus aristolochiae siccae longae, radicem unam longiorem, quae ex ea inuenitur, et sit sicut grossitudo digiti.	And it is as you should receive from the roots of dry aristea long, a root which is found in it, and sit like the thickness of the finger.
Deinde submerge eam in oleo: et accende ipsam in igne.	Then immerse it in oil: and light it on fire.
Deinde cauteriza cauterio uno in eo quod est inter continuationem furculae cum collo, et duobus cauteriis paruis sub guidezi parum decliuibus ad partem, quae est sub barba.	Then cauterize with one cautery in that which is between the continuation of the fork with the neck, and two small cauteries under guidices somewhat declining to the side, which is under the beard.
Et duobus cauteriis etiam in eo, quod est inter costam quintam et sextam decliuibus ad posteriora parumper: et cauterio alio in medio pectoris, et alio supra stomachum.	And two cauteries also in it, which is between the fifth and sixth rib declining somewhat to the rear: and one cautery in the middle of the chest, and another above the stomach.
Et tribus cauteriis a posterioribus: uno in eo quod est inter duas spatulas: et duobus cauteriis a duobus lateribus pectoris, inferius cauterio quod est inter duas spatulas.	And three cauteries from the rear: one in it which is between two spatulas: and two cauteries from the sides of the chest, lower cautery which is between two spatulas.
Et non oportet ut comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit in manifesto cutis odorando.	And it is not necessary that you should squeeze your hand with the cautery, but let it be in the open skin smelling.
Et iam dixerunt quidam antiqui, quod ex hominibus sunt qui utuntur cauterio ex ferro simili radio: et igniunt, et intus mittunt ipsum in eo quod est inter costas, donec perueniatur cum eo ad ipsum apostema, et egrediatur sanies: sicut diximus in apostemate Epatis.	And some ancient ones said that from men who use a cautery of similar iron rod: and they light it, and put it inside him which is between the ribs until it reaches with it to the apostema of the liver, and comes out pus: as we have said in the aposteme of the liver.
Sed in hac perforatione cum cauterio est ex timore, quod aut moritur infirmus statim, aut accidit in loco fistula, cui non est sanatio.	But in this piercing with the cautery there is a fear that either the weak man dies immediately, or happens to the place a fistula, which has no cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Splenem Caput XXXII.	§ On the mode of cauterizing the Spleen [Kaput XXIII].
Quando tu curas aegritudinem splenis, cum eo quod diximus ex curatione in diuisione aegritudinum, et non confert curatio tua, tunc cauterium in ea est secundum tres modos, qui omnes sunt recti.	When you cure the disease of the spleen, with it which we have said from the curing of diseases in a division of diseases, and your curing does not bring about a cure, then cauterize in it according to three modes, which are all correct.
Quorum unus est, ut facias tria cauteria, aut quatuor lineando secundum longitudinem splenis secundum figuram cauteriorum Epatis, quorum praecessit figura.	Of which one is that you make three cauteries, or four lined according to the length of the spleen according to the figure of cauterias of the liver, of which preceded the figure.
Et sit inter omne cauterium quantitas grossitudinis digiti, aut plus parum.	And let there be between every cautery quantity of thickness of the finger, or less.
Et sit modus cauterii, quem diximus in cauterio epatis aequaliter.	And let the mode of the incision, which we have said in the liver is equal.
Et non comprimas manum tuam cum cauterio: et sit infirmus resupinus super dorsum suum.	And do not compress your hand with the incision; and let the patient be laid down on his back.
Et modus alius de cauterizatione est: ut ignias cauterium habens duo uerua, quod diximus in capitulo dislocationis humeri: et eleua cutem, quae est in directo splenis, ubi peruenit cubitus infirmi sinister: et sit eleuatio tua qua eleuas cutem secundum latitudinem corporis, ut cadant cauteria secundum longitudinem corporis.	And another mode of incision is that the patient has two hands with fire to incise, which we have said in the chapter on shoulder dislocation: and wipe clean the skin that extends from the direct side of the spine where it reaches the bed of the sick man to his left: and raise up your hand so as to wipe clean the skin according to the length of the body, so that the incision falls according to the length of the body.
Deinde intromitte duo uerua ignita ualde, donec cum eis penetres cutem a parte altera: deinde extrahe cauterium: fiunt ergo cauteria quatuor.	Then introduce two hot hands until they penetrate the skin on both sides: and then remove the incision; so that four incisions are made.
Et si uis cauteriza cum cauterio alio habente tria uerua.	And if you want to cut with a different incision having three hands.
Deinde cura cauterium postquam dimittis ipsum emittere pus diebus multis: est enim magis conferens quamque reliqua quae praecesserunt ex curatione.	Then take care of the incision after you have removed it, to emit pus for many days: because it is more healing as much remains that preceded from the cure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Hydropisi.	The mode of incising in the Hydropsis.
Caput XXXIII.	CHAPTER XXXIII.
Cauterium non cadit in Hydropisi, nisi ascliti proprie.	The incision does not fall in Hydropsis unless it is raised properly.
Quando tu curas Hydropicum cum modis curationis, quos diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, et cauterio uno super stomachum, et cauterio alio super epar, et cauterio super splenem, et cauteriis duobus post dorsum inter spondiles, et uno in directo pectoris, et alio in directo stomachi: et sit quantitas profunditatis cauterii propinqua spissitudini cutis.	When you cure Hydropsis with the modes of cure which we have said in the division, and there is no improvement in the patient, then let four incisions be made around the navel, and one incision on the stomach, and one incision on the liver, and one incision on the spleen behind, and two incisions at the back between the vertebrae, and one on the right side of the chest, and one on the left side of the stomach: and let the depth of the incision approach the thickness of the skin.
Deinde dimitte cauterium apertum, ut emittat pus tempore longo.	Then remove the incision open, so that it emits pus after a long time.
Et non euacues infirmum a curatione post cauterium cum eo: quod oportet ut aggregentur ei duae intentiones: et festinabit ad ipsum sanatio cum auxilio Dei.	And do not make the patient sweat after the incision with it; because two purposes should be gathered to him, and he will hurry to heal himself with the help of God.
Forma uero cauterii cum quo cauterizatur uenter, sit clauilis: secundum quod praecessit forma eius: et illius cum quo cauterizatur dorsum, sit oliuaris secundum quod praecessit eius forma.	The form of the incision when the stomach is cut should be a slit: according to which it precedes in form; and its back, when cut, should be ovoid, according to which it precedes in form.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Pedes, et Crura.	To cauterize the feet and the legs.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter IIII.
Quando apostemantur in Hydropico, et replentur aqua citrina: oportet ut cauterizes super dorsum Pedis in nocrati, quae est inter auricularem et anularem: et eleua manum tuam cum cauterio, et non torqueas ipsum: deinde eleua manum tuam: et non iteres ipsum omnino.	When they are submerged in water, and become yellow: you should cauterize on the back of the foot, between the auricular and the ring fingers: and wash your hand with the cautery, and do not twist it: then wash your hand: and do not repeat the operation at all.
Resudet enim aqua citrina, et sit cauterium secundum hanc formam.	For the water turns them yellow, and sits the cautery in this form.
Deinde fac super duo crura duo cauteria in omni crure, et fiat cauterium cum extremitate cultellari cauterii: et fiat cauterium secundum longitudinem cruris, unum sub genu, et alterum inferius eo, circiter medium cruris: et super omnem coxam cauteria duo: et dimitte cauterium apertum absque curatione tempore longo: ut resudet ex eo aliquod aquae: deinde cura ipsum cum reliquis quae diximus.	Then make two cauteriums on the two legs, and let the cautery go with the edge of the knife-edge of the cautery: and let the cautery go along the length of the leg, one under the knee, and the other lower down by that, about halfway down the leg: and make two cauteriums on all the back: and do not close the cauterium for a long time: so that it is healed from it some water: then care for the rest as we have said.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in solutione Ventris.	The way to cauterize in the solution of the belly.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXV.
Quando est solutio uentris ex frigore et humiditatibus, donec debilitet uirtutes retentiuam et digestiuam, quae sunt in stomacho et intestinis: et curatur illud cum modis curationis, et non sanatur: et uides infirmum tolerantem cauterium exuberantis uirtutis, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio magno super stomachum suum, secundum quod praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi cum cauterio circuli, et quatuor cauteriis in circumitu umbilici subtilibus, cum cauterio clauili subtili: et cauterio super alcatin supra alhosos magno, aut duobus cauteriis.	When the solution of the belly is weakened by cold and moisture, until it loses its holding power and digestive power, which are in the stomach and intestines: and cure that with the ways of curing, and does not heal: and you will see a bearing tolerating the violence of the cure, then cauterize him with a large cautery on his stomach, following what preceded in the cauterization of the stomach with a circle-shaped cautery, and four small cauteriums around the navel, with a fine knife-edge: and a large cautery over the palate above the molars, or two small cauteriums.
Et si uides humiditates exuberantes, et infirmum tolerantem illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cauterio super pectinem, et cauterio super omne ilium: et fortasse addes duo cauteria parua super stomachum prope magnum.	And if you see exuberant moisture, and a weak bearing of that thing, then cauterize him with a cautery on his chest, and a cautery on all his loins: and perhaps you will add two small cauteriums on the stomach near the large one.
Est enim curatio proficiens, cuius iuuamentum non errat.	For the cure is perfect, whose sign is not mistaken.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Hemorroidas.	To cauterize hemorrhoids.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter 36.
Quando in ano sunt Hemorroides antiquae multae, aut una, et sunt ex humoribus grossis, frigidis, aut humiditatibus corruptis, et curantur cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: tunc cauteriza tribus cauteriis super inferiorem spondilem dorsi sub almeidati parumper triangulatim, et cauterio sub umbilico quasi duobus digitis.	When there are many old hemorrhoids, or one, and they are of gross humor, cold, or corrupt humors, and treat them with the same means as we have said in the division, and there is no cure: then cauterize three cauterizations on the lower back of the trunk under an egg-shaped triangle, and a cauterization under the navel almost like two fingers.
Et si cogitas, quod stomachus eius infrigidatus sit, et cibus eius non digeratur, et faciem eius uides apostemari, tunc cauteriza eum super stomachum cauterio magno, secundum quod praecessit: et cauterio super Epar eius, et alio super Splenem ipsius, cum cauterio clauili: et dimitte cauterium apertum tempore aliquo: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if you think that his stomach is cold, and his food is not digested, and you see that his face is pale, then cauterize him on the stomach with a large cautery, according to what preceded it: and cauterize on his spine, and another on his spleen, with a cautery of the claw: and leave the cautery open at some time: and then take care of him, until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi althelul post abscisionem eorum.	Chapter 37. The method for cauterizing the arterioles after cutting them off.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37. The method for cauterizing the arteri
Quando tu abscindis althelul, tunc ignias cauterium quod assimilatur radio.	When you cut off the arterioles, then set fire to the cautery that is radiated.
Deinde intromittite ipsum ignitum in ipsum althelul abscisum: et ultima manum tuam, donec perueniat cauterium ad orificium uenae, ex qua currit sanguis: fac illud semel, aut bis.	Then introduce the fire into the arterioles that you have cut off: and with your last hand, until the cautery reaches the opening of the anus, from which runs the blood: do it once, or twice.
Si ergo althelul fuerint multa, tunc cauteriza unumquodque cauterio secundum quod narrauimus.	If there are many arterioles, then cauterize each one with a separate cautery, as we have described.
Deinde cura ea, cum eo quod confert eis ex unguentis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them, with the ointment that is used for them, until they are healed.
Et si cauterizas eum cauterio magno super alcatin, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if you cauterize him with a large cautery on his back, it is more final in the procedure.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Fistulam in ano.	Chapter 38. The method for cauterizing a fistula in the anus.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38. The method for cauterizing a fistula
Quando non obedit infirmus sectioni et operi quod narrauimus in loco suo, et terretur ab illo, fortasse sanatur cum cauterio.	When the sick person does not obey the section and operation that we have described in its place, and shudders because of it, perhaps he will be healed with a cautery.
Cum ergo accidit alicui Fistula, et antiquatur, currit pus ex ea, et humiditates corruptae.	So when a fistula occurs in someone, and it is old, pus runs out of it, and corrupted humors.
Dignius ergo quod oportet est, ut probes eam cum tenta subtili.	It is fitting that you should examine it with care when you attempt it gently.
Deinde cognosce quantitatem profunditatis eius cum tenta.	Then recognize the depth of its extent when you attempt it.
Deinde ignias cauterium, quod est simile radio.	Then apply the cautery of fire, which is like a ray.
Deinde intromit te ipsum ignitum in ipsam Fistulam et quantitatem in qua intrauit clauus.	Then insert yourself into it with an ignited rod and measure how far it enters.
Et itera super eam cauterium, donec comburantur illa omnia corpora corrupta, semel, aut bis, aut ter, secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	And repeatedly apply the cautery to her until all corrupt bodies are burned up, once, twice, or three times, according to the amount of your need.
Et custodi te ab adustione nerui, si est illic, aut uenae magnae: aut si Fistula uadit ad corpus uesicae, aut ad corpus intestini, tunc custodi te ab istis locis omnibus.	And guard yourself against the burning of the nerve, if it is there, or a large vein: or if the fistula opens into the woman's body, or into the body of the intestine, then guard all these places.
Et non facias illud, nisi quando fistula est in loco carnoso: et cogitas, quia non est penetrans.	And do not make it unless when the fistula is in a muscular place: and consider that it is not penetrating.
Deinde cura locum usquequo sanetur.	Then take care of the place until it heals.
Si autem sigillatur locus, et abscinduntur ab eo materiae, et remanet sic tempore longo: tunc scias, quia iam sanatus est integre.	But if the place is sealed and tissues are removed from it, and remains so for a long time: then know that it has now been completely healed.
Et si non abscindunt ab eo materiae, tunc scias quia est penetrans, aut in profundo eius est os corruptum, aut quasi illud ex illis: quorum rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And if they do not remove the tissues from it, then know that it is penetrating, or its bottom is corrupted, or something like that among them: whose remembrance will remain in its place.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Renes.	As for the way of cauterizing the perineum.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39. The Head.
Quando accidit in Renibus dolor ex frigore, aut ex uentositate grossa, et minuitur propter illud coius infirmi, tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum super almethenem super ipsos renes, cauterio super omnem renem cum cauterio clauili, cuius praecessit rememoratio.	When a pain arises in the kidneys from cold or coarse wind and is soothed by sleeping, then you should cauterize that part on top of the perineum, cauterizing each kidney with a cautery, preceded by the remembrance.
Et fortasse cauterizamus ipsum secundo in ipso almeidatu.	And perhaps we will have cauterized that part second in the same place.
Quare uenient tria lineata.	Why are there three lines drawn?
Ergo erunt magis ultima in iuuamento.	So they will be more effective in the process of cauterization.
¶ De modo cauteritzandi Vesicam.	As for the way of cauterizing the vagina.
Caput XL.	Chapter X.
Quando accidunt in Vesica debilitas, et mollificatio a frigo re et humiditatibus, donec non retineat infirmus urinam, tunc cauteriza ipsum in inferiori parte suminis super Vesicam, ubi incipiunt pili pectinis, et cauterio a dextra suminis, et alio a sinistra illius: et sit longitudo illius cauterizationis lateris secundum quantitatem nodi pollicis: et cauteriza ipsum cauterio inferiori dorsi, aut duobus cauteriis, si indiges illo: et sit secundum quod praecessit cauterium clauile.	When weakness and relaxation occur in the bladder, and there is a softening due to cold and moisture, until the sick person no longer retains urine, then cauterize him in the lower part of the scrotum above the bladder, where the hairs begin to grow, and cauterize with fire on the right side, and with another on the left: and let the length of the cautery on the side correspond to the length of the nail of the thumb: and cauterize him with two cauteries, if you can bear it: and let the second cautery be made according to what came before.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Matricem.	With respect to the mode of cauterizing the womb:
Caput XLI.	Chapter XLI.
Quando accidunt in Matrice frigus et humiditates, et prohibetur per illud ab impregnatione, et corrumpuntur menstrua eius, et tardatur prouocatio eorum, et accidit ei apud aduentum eorum dolor, tunc oportet ut cauterizetur tribus cauteriis in circumitu umbilici, sicut diximus in cauterizatione uesicae, et cauterio super alcatim inferius dorso, aut duobus cauteriis: et sit cauterium clauile.	When cold and moisture occur in the womb, and pregnancy is prevented by it, and her menstrual periods are delayed, and pain occurs with her menses, then three cauteries should be applied around the navel, as we have said in the cauterization of the bladder, and one cautery on the back below, or two cauteries: and let the length of the cautery on the side correspond to the length of the nail of the thumb.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Ancham in dislocatione.	With respect to the mode of cauterizing the vagina in a case of dislocation:
Caput XLII.	Chapter XLI.
Quando effunduntur humiditates mucosae ad pixidem Anchae, et fiunt caussa exitus eius a loco suo: et signum illius est, quod prolongatur crus super alterum, quando comparantur adinuicem: et inuenitur locus dislocationis in eo uacuus.	When the mucous membrane of the vagina flows with moisture towards the anus, and there is a cause for its exit from its place: the sign of this is that the skin protrudes over the other when they are placed face to face: and the site of dislocation is found in that which is hollow.
Oportet ergo ut cauterizes infirmum super pixidem Anchae ipsius cauterio simili circulo: postquam tu signas cum encaustro in circumitu pixidis, sicut reuoluitur: et ut cadat ipsa pixis in medio circuli.	Therefore, let the sick person be cauterized on his own vagina with a similar circle of fire: after you have marked the signs with caustics around the vagina, as it recedes: and let her fall into the middle of the circle.
Et sit cauterium cuius forma praecessit in cauterizatione stomachi.	And let the shape of that which came before be applied to the cauterization of the stomach.
Quod si tibi non est praesens hoc cauterium, tunc cauteriza ipsum tribus cauteriis, cum cauterio oliuari magno: et fiat cauterio profunditas secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis totius.	If you do not have this kind of cautery, then cauterize him with three cauteries, with a large oil-filled cautery: and let the depth of the cautery be according to the thickness of the skin of all.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Afterwards, take care of himself, until he gets well.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Sciatica.	The mode of cauterizing in sciatica.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter LIII. On the treatment of sciatica.
Quando accidit dolor in pixide anchae, et sunt caussa illius frigus et humiditates: et curatur infirmus cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio, et antiquatur illud: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum ab humoribus grossis cum pillulis foetidis, aut cum pillulis artificialibus, et similibus.	When pain occurs in the sciatic nerve, and there is cause for this pain, coldness, and moisture: the sick person should be cared for with the remedy we mentioned in the division, and if there is no benefit from it, and it becomes worse: then one should remove the sick person from thick humors with fetid pills, or with artificial pills, and others.
Deinde cauteriza eum.	Then cauterize him.
Et modus cauterii in ea est secundum duos modos: aut cauterium cum medicinis adurentibus, aut cauterium cum igne.	And the method of cauterization with it is according to two ways: either with cautery with burning medicines, or with fire.
Cauterium cum igne, est secundum multos modos.	With fire, there are many ways.
Quorum unus est, ut cauterizes super pixidem anchae ipsius tribus cauteriis triangulatis, secundum hanc formam.	Of which one is that he cauterizes over the sciatic nerve of his own body with three triangular cautery wicks, according to this form:
Et fac eis profunditatem bonam, uel malam.	And make them a good depth, or a bad one.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne cauterium quantitatis grossitudinis digiti: sitque cauterium oliuare.	And there should be space that is between each cautery of the quantity of the thickness of the finger: and let there be oil cautery.
Quandoque autem fit cauterium in medio super caput anchae ipsius.	When, however, cautery is made in the middle on top of the sciatic nerve of his own head.
Quare sunt quatuor cauteria.	Why are there four cauteries?
Et si uis cauteriza cum circulo, cuius praecessit forma in cauterizatione dislocationis anchae, uno: ut sit circulus continens ancham totam.	And if you want to cauterize with a circle, whose form precedes the cauterization of sciatica, one: so that the circle contains all the sciatica.
Et combure spissitudinem cutis totius.	And burn away the thickness of the skin of all.
Iste est modus cauterii in Sciatica, quando dolor est adhaerens anchae ipsi, et non extenditur usque ad coxam et crus.	This is the method of cauterization in sciatica, when pain is attached to the sciatic nerve itself, and does not extend as far as the hip and thigh.
Si autem extenditur usque ad coxam et crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum duobus cauteriis super coxam, super locum ad quem innuit illic infirmus, in quo est dolor, et cauterio tuo super cauillam quatuor digitis ad partem syluestrem parumper: et sit cauterium cultellare.	If, however, it extends as far as the hip and thigh: then cauterize him with two cautery wicks on top of the hip, in the place where the pain is, and a little to the left: and let there be a knife cautery.
Et sit profunditas cauterii secundum profunditatem spissitudinis cutis.	And let there be depth of cauterization according to the depth of thickness of the skin.
Quod si infirmus innuit quod dolor extenditur usque prope digitos pedis, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic ubi innuit cum cauterio puncti, tribus, aut quatuor, aut pluribus, si indiget illo.	If the sick one signals that the pain extends up to almost the toes, then cauterize him there where he signals it with the cautery of a point, three, four or more, if he needs it.
Et si innuit dolorem esse sub genu uersus crus, tunc cauteriza ipsum illic cauterio uno cultellari.	And if he signals pain being under the knee towards the leg, then cauterize him there with one scalpel.
Et caue tibi in omni cauterizatione tua, ut non ultimes cum cauterio ad hoc ut comburas neruum, aut arteriam magnam, et attrahas per illud super infirmum nocumentum malum, aut contractionem.	And let your cauterization be such that you do not hurt with the cautery towards this thing so as to burn nerves, or a large artery, and do not attract it by that means on top of a bad wound on the sick person, or contraction.
Et ego quidem iam uidi unum et alium, ex eis qui cauterizauerunt supra cauillam, et ultimauerunt in cauterizatione, et inflatum est crus, donec tumor consecutus est pedem, et perforatus est totus, et corruptus est totus pes: deinde accidit solutio uentris, et mors post illud.	And I have already seen one and the other who cauterized above the knee and finished off in the cauterization, and the leg was inflamed until the tumor followed the foot, and it was completely perforated and completely corroded: then the solution of the wound came out, and death after that.
Quod si dolor est in duabus partibus simul, cauteriza utramque secundum hunc modum.	If the pain is on both sides at the same time, cauterize each one according to this mode.
Et sapientes quidam dixerunt in cauterizatione anchae, cuius cauterii iste est modus.	And some wise men have said in cauterization of the anus, whose cauterizing is this mode.
Fac simile samio ex ferro, cuius diametrus sit medietas palmi: et sit apud orificium suum secundum grossitudinem nuclei dactyli, aut minus parumper: et intra illud samium sit samium tertium.	Make a similar punch from iron, whose diameter is half of the palm: and let it be at the opening of its third finger according to the thickness of the finger nail, or less; and inside that third hole there is another third.
Et sit spacium quod est inter omne samium per quantitatem nodi pollicis: et sint samia aperta a duabus partibus: et sit altitudo eorum quasi nodus, aut duo nodi: et fac eis manubrium ex ferro decenter aptatum in samiis.	And let there be a space between each punch according to the quantity of the nail of the thumb: and let the punches open on both sides; and let their height be almost like a knot, or two knots: and make them handles from iron that are unevenly fitted in the punches.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is his form.
Deinde igniatur in igne, donec rubeat, et proiiciat scintillas: deinde ponatur super pixidem anchae infirmo accubitato super latus sanum.	Then let it be lit in fire, until it turns red, and let it throw sparks off: then let it be placed on a plate of the anus lying down on the healthy side.
Cauteriza ergo eum tribus cauteriis rotundis in uice una.	Then cauterize him with three round cauteries in one line.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus.	Then let go of him after three days.
Postea emplastra cum butyro: et dimitte uulnus apertum diebus multis.	Then bind with butter: and let the broken bone remain open for many days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then heal him with ointment, until he is well.
Inquit Albucasis, hac specie cauterii o filii, parum usi sumus, propter terrorem aspectus eius: et propterea, quod paucos inuenimus qui expectent super ipsum.	Says Albucasis, with this kind of surgery on the son, we are not very fond, because of the fearsome appearance: and therefore, because there are few who wait for him.
Verumtamen est ex bonis cauteriis ei qui suffert, et inuenit cum eo locum eius.	However, from good surgery he who endures, and remains with him at his place.
Cauterium autem cum medicinis adurentibus est, ut tu facias duo samia habentia perforatam armillam, in quam descendit cardo portae eius ex aere, aut ferro, longitudo parietis: quorum in altitudinem eorum sint duo nodi, aut quasi ipsi.	The cauterizing should be done with the doctors present, so that you make two knots on either side of the arm, which is pierced with the pin of his door frame, made of iron or brass, with its length at the height of their backs: whose ends are almost like themselves.
Et sit spacium quod est inter utraque quantitas grossitudinis digiti, et sint aperta inferius et superius: et sit quod contineant se adinuicem, secundum hanc formam.	And let there be a space what is between either quantity of the thickness of the finger, and let them be open above and below: and let it hold itself toward the one and the other, according to this form.
Deinde depone eam super pixidem anchae, infirmo iacente super latus sanum.	Then place it on a wooden tray, the sick man lying on the sound side.
Et comprime manum tuam super pixidem anchae multum.	And squeeze your hand much on the wooden tray.
Deinde funde inter duos circulos ex aqua calida, quae sit calefacta cum igne parumper, et tene eam quantitate horae temporalis: et toleret infirmus mordicationem eius, et ipsius adustionem, nam ipse inuenit mordicationem sicut ignis, donec quiescat mordicatio.	Then pour between two circles of hot water, which is heated with fire a little, and hold it for a time: and let the sick man feel the prickling, and his burning, for he feels the prickling like fire, until he is at rest from the burning.
Deinde eleua manum tuam cum instrumento, et absterge aquam calidam ab ancha tota cum aqua dulci: deinde dimitte illud tribus diebus.	Then wash your hand with an instrument, and wipe off all with sweet water: then let it be for three days.
Et pone super illud butyrum, donec remoueatur nigredo adustionis: et dimitte illud diebus aliquot, et curret ex eo pus.	And place on it the butter, until it moves away from the burning; and let it be for some days, and let the pus run out from it.
Est enim ultimum in iuuamento.	For this is final in healing.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then heal that with ointment, until he is well.
Quod si extendatur dolor usque ad coxam, aut crus: fac ei statuam in eo quod continet aquam, secundum quod fecisti in ancha aequaliter.	If the pain extends to the hip or leg, make him a sitting place in it that holds water, according to what you have made in the width is equal.
Et iste est modus aquae calidae: et ego iam scripsi eam in tractatu rectificationis medicinarum.	And this is the way to make warm water: and I have already written about it in the book on the rectifying of medicines.
Sume alcali, et calcis non extinctae amborum ana partem unam: tere utraque, et pone ea in ollam nouam, cuius inferior pars sit perforata foramine uno paruo, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum radius: et pone sub fundo ollae ollam aliam uitreatam: et proiice super alcali et calcem ex aqua dulci, quod submergat utraque per digitum: post quam tu comprimas ea manu tua compressione bona: et dimite ollam, donec descendat aqua acuta inferiori parte ollae uitreatae.	Take alkali and burned lime, each a part of one; separate them, and put them into a new crucible, the lower part of which is bored with a small hole; add to it the quantity of substance to be treated; and put another crucible, full of water, below; and pour on the alkali and lime from above by way of a stream: then compress them well in your hand; and let the crucible go until the sharp water has run out at the bottom of the hole.
Deinde aggrega illam aquam totam, et proiice eam super aliam calcem: et cola, donec renouetur.	Then pour all the water together, and pour it on to another lime; and filter it, until it runs clear again.
Ipsa enim erit tunc fortis acuitatis ualde, quae administratur in multis operationibus medicinae, et in cauterizatione reliquorum membrorum.	This will then be very sharp, which is used in many surgical procedures and in cauterizing the remaining parts of the body.
Quoniam efficit operationem ignis ipsius.	For it effectually performs the operation by the fire itself.
Et ex medicinis sunt, cum quibus cauterizantur ancha, etiam sicut tesisie, et mel anacardi, et calx cum sapone, ita quod utraque sint permixta. ¶	And from among medicines there are those which, when mixed with each other, cauterize widely, like caraway, and also myrrh, and lime mixed with soap, so that both are mixed together.
Et Galenus quidem narrando retulit, cuiusdam uiri ex antiquis curationem, qua curatus est dolor anchae et uenae sciaticae: et magnificauit esse eius ualde.	And Galen himself related the story of a certain man from ancient times who was cured of pain in his hip and sciatic pain: and he said that it was very effective.
Et dixit, quia non indiguit alia curatione, et quia sanatus est ex uice una, donec retulit, quia ipse fortasse intrauit balneum delatus, et exiuit ex eo iam sanus.	And he said, "I do not like another cure, and I was cured from one hip, until he related that perhaps he had entered a warm bath, and came out healthy.
Et est, ut accipiatur ex seitaragi uiridi: et si non inuenitur uiride, sumatur siccum, recens: et teratur multum cum aliquanto adipe, et ponatur super ancham, ubi est dolor, aut crus, aut in coxa: et ligetur, et dimittatur quantitate trium horarum, aut per quantitatem quod sentiat infirmus sedationem adustionis.	And it is taken from the oil of the gopher-lark; and if gopher-lark oil is not found, it is made up like this: a little is mixed with fat, and put on the hip where the pain is, or in the groin, or in the thigh: it is bound, and left for a certain time, three hours or more, so that the sick person feels a sedating pain from the heat.
Deinde intromitte eum in balneum.	Then introduce it into the bath.
Cum ergo roridum fit corpus eius, intromitte ipsum in solium.	When the body then becomes wrinkled, introduce it into the bed.
Nam dolor recedit, et sanatur.	For the pain has subsided, and he is healed.
Et scias, quia non oportet ut utatur aliquis cauterio cum istis medicinis, nisi post euacuationem corporis.	And you should know that these medicines should not be applied to the body without first evacuating it.
Et Dioscorides qui dem dixit, quod stercus caprarum, quando cum eo cauterizatur uena sciatica, confert ei: et fit cauterium secundum hunc modum.	And Dioscorides who said that when sheep dung is applied as a poultice to the sciatic pain, it will benefit him: and it becomes a second-degree burn in this way.
Sumatur lana, et imbibatur oleo antiquo, et ponatur super locum profundum, qui est inter pollicem pedis, et inter focile, et est propinquior focili.	The wool is to be soaked in old oil and laid on a deep place, which is between the thumb of the foot and the heel, and is closer to the heel.
Deinde accipe stercus caprarum siccum, et inflamma ipsum in igne, donec fiat carbo.	Then take sheep dung that has been gathered up, and set it on fire in a fire until it becomes a coal.
Deinde pone ipsum super lanam, et dimitte ipsum, donec extinguatur.	Then place the coal on the wool and leave it there until the fire is put out.
Deinde itera illud.	Then repeat this.
Non cesses ergo facere illud, usquequo perueniat sensus super mediatione usque ad ancham, et quiescat dolor.	Do not then cease to do this until the sensation has become accustomed to the stimulation up to the ankle, and the pain rests.
Et iste modus cauterii nominatur cauterium Vaccinum.	And this method of poultice is called Vaccine Burn.
¶ De cauterizatione doloris Dorsi.	The cauterization for sciatic pain.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 44.
Quandoque accidit dolor in Dorso ex caussis multis, aut a casu, aut a percussione, aut euacuatione superflua, et illis similibus, ex infusione materiei frigidae, et humidae: et cauterium quidem non cadit, nisi in hac specie sola, quae fit ex infusione materiei frigidae.	When pain occurs in the back due to various causes, or from injury, or from excessive evaporation, and similar causes, and does not respond to cold infusion alone: then the burn should not be applied unless it is done in this one way only, that is, with a cold infusion.
Oportet ergo post euacuationem infirmi cum pillulis foetidis, et eis similibus, ut fiant super Dorsum, ubi est dolor, tres lineae secundum latitudinem almeidati ipsius, postquam signas cum encaustro in omni linea quinque cauteria, aut plura secundum quantitatem quae uenit ex tolerantia infirmi uirtute eius: et fiat cauterizatio cum cauteriopuncti.	Then after the evacuation with pillules of the bitter herb, and similar ones, let them be applied to the back where there is pain, three lines according to its width, having marked the lines with encaustum in each line; then five cauterizations, or more according to the quantity that comes from the tolerance of the healing power: and it should be done by cauterizing with the cautery needle.
Et si uis, cauteriza tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor, cum cauterio clauili mediali, secundum hanc formam.	And if you wish, apply three cauterizations, or four, with the middle clava of the cauterizing tool, in this way:

Caput XLV.	Chapter LXV. On cauterization in the case of
Multotiens accidit haec aegritudo infantibus paruis.	Many times this disease has occurred in infants.
Et signum incaeptionis eius in pueris est: quod accidit super eum strictura in anhelitu apud eleuationem, et motum: et inuenis in ultima spondilium Dorsi et nodorum eius, quod iam incaepit eminere super reliquos spondiles.	And the sign of the onset of this disease in children is: that which occurs on him stricture during defecation, and movement: and inflammation in the last spine of the back and knots of it, which has already begun to emerge over the remaining spines.
Cum ergo uides illud, et uis facere illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum cum cauterio quod sit circulus secundum hanc formam.	When you therefore see that, and wish to do that, then cauterize it with a cautery which is in the form of a circle.
Et capiat cauterium super omnem partem spondilis aequaliter: et si uis cauteriza in circumitu spondilis cum cauterio puncti duas lineas, aut tres: et sint puncta propinqua adinuicem.	And he takes the cautery over the entire spine evenly: and if you wish to cauterize around the spine with a needle-point cautery two lines, or three: and let the points be close together side by side.
Deinde cura locum, donec sanetur cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of the place, until it heals with him which we have said.
Et caue, ne administres cauterium in gibbositate, quae fit in spasmo nerui.	And be careful, do not administer the cautery to gangrene, which is made in a spasm of a nerve.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Podagra, et doloribus iuncturarum.	The way to cauterize in podagra, and pains of joints.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter LXVI. On cauterization in podagra, and pains
Quando dolores iuncturarum sunt ab humiditatibus frigidis, quae effunduntur ad cuiuslibet membra corporis, tunc quando accidunt dolores in pedibus, de consuetudine medicorum est, ut nominent illud Podagram proprie.	When the pains of joints are from cold humors which flow to any part of the body's limb, then when pains occur in the feet, it is the custom of doctors to name that properly as podagra.
Cum ergo curatur Podagra frigidae caussae cum modis curationis, et non remouentur dolores, tune cauterium remouet eos.	When therefore podagra of cold cause is cured by means of the cure, and do not remove the pains, then remove the cautery to remove those.
Et est, ut cauterizes eum post euacuationem in circumitu iuncturae pedum, cauteriis multis: et sit cauterium Oliuare.	And it is so, that he is cauterized after evacuation around the joint of the feet with many cauteries: and let the cautery be of olive oil.
Cuius haec est forma.	Whose this form.
Et si indiges ut punctes super faciem pedis, tunc fac cum cauterio puncti.	And if you are able to bear it that you touch the tip of the foot with a needle: then do so with a needle-point cautery.
Quod si ascendunt dolores usque ad genua, aut reliquas iuncturas, et multotiens accidit illud, tunc cauteriza ipsum super omne genu tribus cauteriis, aut quatuor ab omni parte, cum hoc eodem cauterio Clauili.	That if they ascend pains as far as the knees, or other joints, and many times this happens: then cauterize it over all the knee with three cauteries, or four from all sides, with this same cautery of cloves.
Si autem necessaria sunt tibi plura hoc cauterio, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	If, however, you need many more of this antidote, then cauterize yourself.
Et non submergas manum tuam cum cauterio, imo sit circiter spissitudinem cutis tantum.	And do not submerge your hand in the antidote, but instead dip it only in the skin's thickness.
Si autem ascendunt dolores ad genua, et dorsum: tunc administra quod diximus ex cauterio in capitulo suo.	If, however, the pains rise to the knees and back: then administer what we have said about the antidote in our chapter.
Quod si dolores sunt in manibus tantum, tunc puncta in circumitu focilium, sicut reuoluuntur duae lineae.	That if the pains are only in the hands, then pierce around a flame, as the two lines resolve.
Si autem remanet ex doloribus in digitis, tunc puncta eos, super omnem nodum punctum, et super pectinem manus.	If, however, some pain remains in the fingers, then pierce them, over every knuckle a point, and over the palm of the hand.
Si autem ascendunt dolores post dies ad cubitos, aut ad humeros, tunc cauteriza utrosque ab omni parte.	If, however, the pains rise after days to the elbows or shoulders, then cauterize both completely.
Et non euacues infirmum ex regimine bono, ex recaeptione medicinarum.	And do not leave the sick person without treatment, from the taking in of medicines.
Nam si bonum fiat regimen, et euacuetur phlegma, sanabitur auxilio Dei cum isto cauterio.	For if a good regime is established and the phlegm is expelled, it will be healed with the help of God and this antidote.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Rupturis.	On the Method of Causing a Burns to Heal.
Caput XLVII.	Head 57.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, et descendit intestinum, aut zirbum ad testiculum, et est illud incipiens propinquum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo dimittere comestionem in die suo.	When a Rupture has occurred in the groin, and the intestine has descended, or has touched the testicle, and it is beginning to be close to the scrotum: then you should order the sick person to cease from his food on that day only.
Et utatur ex lenientibus, quo descendat stercus a uentre suo.	And he should use laxatives so that the stool falls from his bowels.
Deinde sedeat inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et praecipe ei, ut teneat anhelitum suum, donec egrediatur, uel appareat zirbum, aut intestinum.	Then let him sit between your hands on his back: and order him, that he hold his breath, until he has gone out, or until the testicle appears, or the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum digitis tuis, et signa cum encaustro sub Ruptura super os pectinis, cum signo cuius extremitas sit similis medietati circuli ad superiora corporis.	Then let him reduce the person with your fingers, and mark with the causticum at the edge of the Rupture above the pelvis, with a mark whose extreme is equal to a half-circle to the upper part of the body.
Deinde igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma, donec ueniat album, et proiiciat seintillas.	Then light the fire of the causticum, which has this shape, until it becomes white, and throw off sparks.
Deinde reduc intestinum, aut zirbum ad concauitatem suam.	Then let him reduce the intestine, or the testicle to its opening.
Deinde ponat minister manum suam super locum, ut non exeat intestinum: et tu iam aperuisti inter crura infirmi, et posuisti sub eo puluinar, et seruiens alius super crura eius, et alius super pectus eius qui tenet manus.	Then let the attendant place his hand on the wound, so that it does not come out of the intestine: and you have already opened between the legs of the patient, and placed under him the pulley, and serving as another over his legs, and another over his chest which holds his hands.
Deinde depone cauterium super ipsum signum, manu tua cum cauterio stante recta.	Then place the cautery on the wound, your hand standing straight with the cautery.
Et tene ipsum, donec cum eo consequaris os: aut itera cum eo uice alia, si non consecutus fueris cum eo in prima usque ad os.	And hold him, until you succeed in getting to the teeth: or else try again with another force, if you do not succeed in getting to them with the first one all the way to the teeth.
Et prudenter obserua ab exitu intestini in hora cauterizationis tuae, ne comburas ipsum, et eueniat per illud super infirmum aut mors, aut malicia magna.	And carefully observe that the intestine does not come out in the hour of your cauterization, so that you do not burn it, and let it go through it into the sick or death, or great evil.
Et scias, quod quando tu non consequeris cum cauterio os, non confert operatio tua.	And know that when you do not succeed in getting to the teeth with the cautery, your operation is not effective.

And it is necessary that you provide for him food according to the length of his healing time, which softens his stomach: so that he does not lose the intestine by effort and defecation.
Deinde quando uult surgere post quadraginta dies, tunc administra ligamentum decenter factum, et teneat ipsum quadraginta diebus aliis.	Then when he should rise after forty days, then administer loose ligaments that have been made, and hold him for another forty days.
Et minoretur a labore, et repletione cibi et potus, et uocibus uehementibus.	And let him stay away from work, and with full food and drink, and with loud speaking.
Nam quando utitur hoc regimine, ita sanatur sanatione integra.	For when he uses this regimen, so does he heal with whole healing.
Et ego dicam curationem Rupturarum cum incisione in capitulo suo.	And I will speak about the healing of ruptures with an incision in its chapter.
Quando autem Rupturae accidunt in reliquo uentre, et sunt incipientes, et uis ut non addantur, tunc cauteriza Rupturam eius cauterio rotundo secundum quantitatem eius: et sit illud quod aduritur ex tunc sicut tertia eius.	When, however, ruptures happen in the rest of the flesh, and are beginning, and do not add to them, then cauterize his rupture with round cautery according to its quantity: and let it be as dry from then on as the third part of it.
Deinde cura ipsum, cum eo quod diximus: et non addetur.	Then care for himself, since we have said: and do not be drawn away.

¶ De modo cauterizandi in doloribus propter casum, aut percussionem.	The way to cauterize in pain because of a fall, or because of percussion.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 58.
Quando accidit in quibusdam membris a casu, aut percussione dolor: et perseuerat ille dolor tempore longo, et non confert in eo curatio cum medicinis: tunc oportet ut cauterizetur cum cauterio Puncti.	When it happens to some member by a fall, or because of percussion: and this pain persists for a long time, and does not yield to treatment: then it should be cauterized with the Pointed Cautery.
Et sit cauterium omnis membri cauterium secundum magnitudinem eius, et ipsius paruitatem, et debilitatem eius, et ipsius uirtutem, et locationem torsionis, et doloris ex eo.	And let the cautery be to any member according to its size, and its health, and weakness, and its strength, and its twist, and the pain from it.
Si ergo sanatur ex cauterio primo, est bene.	If then he is healed by first cauterization, it is well.
Si non: tunc itera super ipsum cauterium.	But if not: then repeat over him the cautery.
Quoniam de consuetudine horum dolorum est, ut permutentur ex membro ad illud quod appropinquat ei.	Because of the custom of these pains is that they should change from one member to that which approaches it.
Quare oportet ut consequaris eos cum cauterio, donec sanetur infirmus.	Why it should be that those members should be cauterized until the sick one is healed.

Leprosi autem quandoque iuuantur cauterio iuuamento maximo.	But the lepers are often cauterized with a hot iron.
Et praecipue species Leprae, quae fit propter putrefactionem phlegmatis et melancholiae: cum ergo uis cauterizare ipsam considera.	And especially the species of leprosy, which is produced by putrefaction of phlegm and melancholy: so that you carefully consider the way to cauterize it.
Si ergo Lepra est ineipiciens, et curasti eam cum eo, quod diximus in diuisione, et non descendit, neque stat: et times super infirmum, quod comprehendat corruptio super totam complexionem eius: tunc cauteriza eum super caput quinque cauteriis: uno in medio capitis noto, et secundo inferius eo uersus frontem apud finem capillorum, et duobus super duo cornua, et uno posterius super nucea ceruicis.	If then Leprosy is resistant and you have treated it with the same cautery that we have said and it has not fallen, and does not stick: and if you wait for the disease to include a corruption on the whole complexion of it: then cauterize it over the head five cauteries: one in the middle of the hairline, and the second below it towards the front at the end of the hair, and two above two horns, and one behind the cheekbone.
Et ultima manum tuam cum cauterio parumper, donec imprimat in os impressionem paruam, et dislocentur ex eo cortices: ut alleuietur expiratio uaporum grossorum ex eo, et cauteriza cauterio etiam super ipsum splenem, secundum quod praecessit.	And lastly bandage your hand slightly with cautery, until it impresses a rough impression on the throat, and the membranes are dislocated from it; so that the exhalation of large vapors is eased from it, and the cauterization is also applied above the spleen, according to what preceded.
Sin autem Lepra iam sparsa est super infirmum, et apparet manifeste: tunc oportet ut cauterizes cum istis cauteriis, quae diximus in capite, et cauterio super extremitatem nasi, et duobus cauteriis super duas maxillas, et duobus cauteriis super spondiles colli, et sex super spondiles dorsi, et uno magno super alhahosos apud gran caudae et uno supra ipsum, in ipso almeidati: et duobus super anchas: scilicet super omnem ancham uno, et duobus super genua: uno super omne genu, et duobus super humeros, et duobus super cubitos, et duobus super teneritudines pectoris sui: et cauteriza ipsum super omnem iuncturam, ex iuncturis digitorum manuum suarum, et pedum suorum: et cauteriza super omnem calcaneum pedum suorum, et focilia manuum suarum.	But if the leprosy has already spread on the sick person and appears manifestly: then it is necessary that you should apply the above-mentioned cauterizations, which we have mentioned in the head, and cauterize also on the tip of the nose, and two cauterizations on the two cheeks, and two cauterizations on the two ears, and two cauterizations on the two shoulders, and six on the back, and one great one on the loins near the tail end, and one above it, in the middle: and two on the breasts: namely, one on each breast, and two on the knees: one on each knee, and two on the arms, and two on the cubits of the arms, and two on the tender parts of the chest: and cauterize also on all the joints, from the joints of the fingers of his hands and feet: and cauterize also on all the heel of his feet and knuckles of his hands.
Et caue tibi a neruis qui sunt super postremum calcanei, ut non comburas eos.	And let you be careful of the nerves that are above the heel of the foot, so that you do not burn them.
Et quandoque cauterizatur cauterio super os pectinis, et alio super os stomachi, et alio super epar.	And when one is cauterized with the cautery on the bone of the jaw, and with another on the bone of the stomach, and with another on the spine.
Et scias, quod quanto plus addis cauterium, est magis iuuamentum, et magis conferens.	And you should know that the more you add cautery, the greater the benefit is, and the more it cures.
Et scias, quod infirmus non inuenit in cauterio dolorem, sicut inueniunt ipsum sani: propterea, quod corpus eius iam stupefactum est.	And you should know that a sick person does not feel pain in the cauterization, as they do when they are healthy: for this reason, his body is already stupified.
Et oportet ut sint cauteria ex magnitudine, et paruitate secundum membra et iuncturas: secundum quod praecessit ex speciebus ferramentorum.	And it is necessary that the cauterizations should be of a certain size and thinness according to the limbs and joints: for what has preceded from the appearance of the instruments.
Deinde cura cauterium ex farina herbi cum melle, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the cauterizations with a paste of herb flour mixed with honey, and with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.

When a limb is numb and does not respond to medication, oils, plasters, or poultices; then, the limb that is numbed should be cauterized according to the degree of its numbness or the extent of its pallor.

Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then care for the limb with ointment until it heals.
Et quandoque cauterizatur ad quiddam stuporis, qui accidit manui, et pedi, in spondilibus dorsi apud exitum neruorum, qui mouent illud membrum: et remouetur stupor.	And at times when cauterization occurs due to some numbness that happens in the hand or foot, in the vertebrae of the back near the exit of nerves that move that limb: and the numbness is relieved.
Verum non praesumat super illud, nisi qui est sapiens in anatomia membrorum, et egressione neruorum mouentium corpus.	But do not be hasty about it, unless you are knowledgeable in the anatomy of limbs, and the exit of nerves that move the body.

Quando antiquatur Albaras, et non confert in eo aliquid ex ingeniis medicinae: tunc cauteriza super ipsam cauterio profundo parumper, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis cutis, donec remoueatur albedo, et mutetur color eius.	When Albucasis is applied and does not produce any effect with medical techniques; then, apply a deep caustic slightly to the area, according to the thickness of the skin, until the color changes and the tone is relieved.
Deinde cura ipsum cum farina herbi, et lentis cum oleo rosa, et foliis arnoglossae, et sanguine columbae, et sanguine hyrundinis: de unoquoque sit pars una: misceantur haec omnia, et liniantur super pannum, et adhaereant loco, donec sanetur.	Then care for the limb with wheat flour, and with rose oil, and with leaves of arglosh (a type of herb), and with pigeon blood, and with hen blood; let one part be used; all these things are to be mixed together, and spread on a cloth, and adhered to the area until it heals.

Sapientes autem dixerunt, ut cauterizetur cauterio ultimo in medio.	But the wise have said that it should be cauterized with the last caustic in the middle.Et si forte uoluitur, et non potest sanari cum medicinis, noli u
Mihi autem non uidetur illud: quoniam timeo quod ulceretur: et ego iam uidi illud aliquotiens.	But I do not consider this suitable: for I fear it will ulcerate: and I myself have seen it happen a few times.Et si forte uoluitur, et non potest sanari cum medicinis, noli u
Et rectius est, ut cauterizetur in circumitu eius cum circulo, sicut diximus: aut cauteriis multis.	And it is better that it be cauterized around its circumference with a circle, as we have said: or with many cauterizations.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Adubelati.	On the mode of cauterizing on the abdomen.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Quando aliquis habet Adubelati, et tardatur in maturatione, aut propter superfluitatem facientem eam, aut propter aetatem infirmi, quando est decrepitus pauci sanguinis, aut propter tempus, et uis festinare in maturatione Adubelati, tunc cauteriza in circumitu eius cum cauteriis paruis multis punctando.	When anyone has an abdication, and is delayed in maturity, or is doing it for no reason, or because of old age, so that it is little blood, or because of time, and the pulse does not hasten in the maturation of abdication, then cauterize around its circumference with a few cauterizations by puncturing.
Deinde dimitte eam.	Then let go of it.
Nam ipsa festinabit cum maturatione.	For it will hurry up with the maturation.
Si autem uis perforationem eius cum cauterio, tunc igni cauterium, cuius haec est forma.	But if you want to pierce it with a knife and then cauterize it, then this is the form of the cautery.
Et depone ipsum in medio Adubelati, donec penetret cutem: et sit cauterium ab eo quod sequitur infirmus, ut alleuietur cursus puris.	And place it in the middle of abdication until it penetrates the skin; and let the cautery be behind it so that it does not get weak, so that the course of blood is eased.
Deinde cura ipsum donec sanetur.	Then take care of the patient until he is healed.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in malo corrodente.	On the mode of cauterizing on a sore corroding.
Caput LIIII.	Chapter LIIII.
Corrodens non est nisi corruptio in membro ambulans, et corrodit ipsum: sicut ignis comedit ligna sicca.	A sore does not corrode unless it is a member that walks and corrodes the member itself; as fire devours dry wood.
Si ergo uides corrodentem in loco qui toleret cauterium cum igne, tunc igni cauteria multa, clauilia parua et magna, secundum quod conueniet illi loco in quo est corrodens.	But if you see a sore that tolerates cautery with fire, then let the many cauteries be small and large, and suit them to the place where the sore is;
Deinde cauteriza ipsum ab omni parte donec eradices corruptionem totam, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid penitus.	Then cauterize the member from all parts until you eradicate the whole corruption, and do not leave anything hidden in it.
Deinde dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, et pone super loca cauterizata sulphur tritum cum oleo, donec eradicentur escharae omnes, et omnis corruptio.	Then let go of the member for three days, and put sulfur mixed with oil on the places that have been cauterized; until all the escarments are eradicated, and all corruption.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis generantibus carnem.	Then take care of the patient with ointments that generate flesh.
Si ergo uides, quod post tres dies caro nascitur natiuitate sana, in qua non est corruptio, est bonum.	But if you see that after three days the flesh is born healthy and there is no corruption, it is good.
Et si non: tunc itera cauterium super illud quod remansit ex locis corruptis.	And if not: then apply again cautery to that which remains in corrupted places.
Et corrodens medicatur quandoque cum medicina acuta.	And when the corrosion is healed, it is sometimes cured with acute medicine.
Ipsa namque surgit loco cauterii.	For it itself rises up at the place of cauterization.
Verumtamen cauterium cum igne est uelocioris iuuamenti: et ego quidem iam dixi cauterizationem eius cum medicina acuta in diuisione: accipe ergo eam illic quando ea indiges.	However, cauterization with fire is faster in action: and indeed I have already said that cauterization with acute medicine is division: so take it there when it is digested.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Clauis, et Verucis.	On the mode of cauterizing in clefts, and warts.
Caput LV.	Chapter 50.
Multotiens accidit in inferioribus partibus pedum haec aegritudo: et est res grossa, filtrata, quae laedit pedem.	This affliction of the lower parts of the feet often occurs; and it is a gross disease, which affects the foot after filtration.
Et cauterium quidem in eis est secundum duos modos: cauterium cum igne, et cauterium cum aqua calida.	And there are two ways of applying cauterization: with fire, and with warm water.
Quantum autem cum igne est, ut ignias cauterium concauum simile pennae uulturis: quod fiat ex ferro, secundum quantitatem quod contineat clauum ab omni parte: et sit subtilium marginum.	How much, then, is it with fire, as the fire of a brand is like the feather of a fowl: which let be from iron, according to the quantity that contains the cleft from all parts: and let the edge be slight.
Deinde depone ipsum ignitum super clauum.	Then deposit the burned thing on the cleft.
Deinde reuolue manum cum cauterio in circumitu claui, donec perueniat cauterium ad profunditatem claui: et dimitte ipsum tribus diebus, donec incipiat emittere pus.	Then, with the thumb, rotate the thumb with cautery around the cleft, until the cauterization reaches the depth of the cleft: and let it be for three days, until it begins to emit pus.
Deinde emplastra ipsum cum maluis syluestribus, contritis cum sale: et dimitte emplastrum super ipsum in nocte.	Then bind the thing with soft silk threads, crushed with salt: and let it be for the night.
Ipse enim eradicabitur ex radicibus suis.	For he will himself be removed from his roots.
Deinde cura locum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the place with a soothing ointment of flesh, until it is healed.
Quod si sunt non conuersi, et multotiens accidunt in superficie corporis, praecipue in manibus et pedibus: tunc administres in eis cauterium cum aqua calida: et est, ut accipias cannulam ex aere, aut ferro, aut ex penna uulturis: et depone eam super clauum, aut althelul.	If they are not converted, and often happen on the surface of the body, especially in the hands and feet: then apply to them cauterization with warm water: and it is, as you may get a tube from iron, or steel, or from a fowl's feather: and deposit it on the cleft, or on a hard thing.
Deinde proiice in cannulam ex aqua calida quantitatem paucam: retine manum tuam, et tu reuolue eam cum compressione manus tuae parumper, ut imprimatur margo cannulae in radice claui, et inueniat aqua calida uiam ad profundum, ad radicem claui: et expectet infirmus parumper super mordicationem aquae calidae hora una.	Then throw into the tube a little quantity of warm water: hold your hand, and rotate it with your thumb, so that the edge of the tube is pressed into the root of the cleft, and let the warm water find its way into the depth of the cleft: and expect for a while on the tingling of the warm water.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, nam clauus eradicatur cum radicibus suis.	Then let go of him, for the clamp should be removed with its roots.
Ita fac cum eis uno post unum, donec uenias super omnes qui ex eis sunt in corpore.	So do it with them one by one, until you have done all of them in the body.
Deinde cura eos postquam eradicantur, cum eo quod generat carnem ex unguentis.	Then take care of them after they are cut off, with that which generates flesh from the scar.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in Tremore.	The way to cauterize during a tremor.
Caput LVI.	Chapter LVI.
Quando accidit alicui Tremor ex frigore in neruo, aut ex febre quartana, aut alio: tunc oportet ut cauterizes ipsum quatuor cauteriis, aut quinque super spondiles dorsi, et inter omnem spondilem cauterio, et in pectore eius cauterio, et super stomachum eius cauterio.	When it happens to someone that there is a tremor due to cold in the nerve, or from a quartan fever, or some other thing: then one should cauterize the person with four cauterizations, or five on the back of the spine, and between each vertebra with a cauterization, and in his pit with a cauterization, and over his stomach with a cauterization.
Tremor enim quiescit cum cauterio oliuari, et festinat sanitas aegritudinis frigidae.	For a tremor ceases with an olive oil cauterization, and a feverish condition speeds up with health from cold.
¶ De modo cauterizandi Albathir.	The way to cauterize according to Albatar.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quandoque expelluntur in corpore Albathir foedae, id est, pustulae, quae fiunt a materiis grossis corruptis.	When certain aliments are expelled from the body, that is, pustules which arise from corrupt dry matter.
Oportet ergo in primis cum apparent, ut cauterizentur super omne caput pustulae cauterio subtili cum ligno myrti, cuius extremitas accensa est cum igne.	Then, when they first appear, they should be cauterized with a fine wood cautery on the whole head of the pustule, whose tip is lit with fire.
Aut cum radice aristolochiae longae.	Or with the root of aristochnoke long.
Aut cum cauterio lenticulari.	Or with a lenticular cauterizer.
Et quandoque cauterizantur ademenul, in principio expulsionis suae secundum hunc modum: et non augentur: et disrumpitur superfluitas faciens eos, et sanatur ex eis.	And when they are cauterized with iron, at first their expulsion follows this mode: and they do not increase: and they break up their excess, healing from them.
Verumtamen oportet ut fiat illud post euacuationem cum phlebotomia.	However, it should be done after evacuation with phlebotomy.
¶ De modo cauterizandi in fluxu sanguins ex arteria in uulnere.	The way to cauterize during a blood flow from an artery in the ulnar.
Caput LVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, quae incisa est apud uulnus, quod accidit extrinsecus, aut apud incisionem apostematis, aut cauterium membri, et similia eis: et fit difficile abscindere eum.	This often happens with a blood flow from an artery which is cut at the ulnar, either from outside, or at the incision of a pimple, or from cauterizing a member, and similar to them: and it is difficult to remove it away.
Cum ergo accidit alicui illud, tunc propera cum manu tua ad orificium arteriae, et pone super ipsum digitum tuum indicem: et stringe eum multum, donec obsessus sit sanguis sub digito tuo, et non egrediatur ex eo aliquid.	So then, when this happens to someone, then grasp the artery with your hand and place your finger on top of it: and tie it tightly until the blood is blocked beneath your finger and nothing comes out of it.
Deinde pone in ignem cauteria oliuaria parua, et magna numero plura: et suffla super ea, donec fiant ignita ualde.	Then put on a small amount of olive oil fire, and a great deal more: and blow over them until they are very hot.
Deinde accipe ex eis unum, aut paruum, aut magnum, secundum uulnus et locum, in quo disrupta est arteria, et depone cauterium super ipsam uenam, post quam tu remoues digitum tuum festinanter: et tene cauterium, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then take from them one, or small, or large, second knuckle and the place where the artery is broken, and place the fire on top of it; then remove your finger quickly: and hold the fire, until the blood comes off.
Quod si expellatur cum eleuas digitum ab orificio arteriae, et extinguis cauterium, tunc accipe cauterium aliud festinanter, ex cauteriis quae in igne sunt praeparata.	That if it is expelled when you remove your finger from the artery's opening, and extinguish the fire, then take another fire quickly, from those that are prepared on fire.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum uno post aliud, donec abscindatur sanguis.	So then do not stop doing this with one after the other, until the blood comes off.
Et caue, ne comburas neruum qui est illic, et accidat super infirmum malicia alia.	And be careful, so that you do not burn the fire that is there, and misfortune happens to another illness.
Et scias, quod quando ex arteria fluit sanguis, tunc non est possibile abscindere ipsum: praecipue quaudo arteria est magna, nisi cum uno quatuor modorum.	And know, that when blood flows from an artery, it is then impossible to stop it: especially when the artery is large, unless with four measures.
Aut cum cauterio, sicut diximus.	Or with fire, as we have said.
Aut cum extractione, quando non est extracta.	Or with extraction, when it is not extracted.
Nam quando extrahitur, contrahuntur extremitates eius, et abscinditur sanguis.	For when it is extracted, its ends contract, and the blood comes off.
Aut ligetur cum filo ligatione forti.	Or is bound with a strong ligature.
Aut ponantur super ipsum medicinae de proprietate, quarum est abscindere sanguinem, et stringatur cum puluinari constrictione decenti.	Or are placed on top of medicine by virtue, which stops the flow of blood, and is tied with a decreasing constrictive pull.
Qui autem administrat abscisionem eius cum ligamento, et strictura cum panno, aut positione rerum comburentium, et similium, non confert ei penitus, nisi raro.	Whoever performs this dissection with a ligature, and constriction with a cloth, or position of burning things, and like things, does not give it a complete cut, unless rarely.
Si autem accidat alicui illud, et non sit ei praesens medicus, neque medicina: tunc incipiat cum positione digiti indicis super orificium uenae ipsius, sicut narrauimus, et constrictione eius ualde, donec obsessus sit sanguis a superiori parte uulneris, et super arteriam.	But if this happens to someone, and there is no present doctor, nor medicine: then begin with the position of the index finger on top of the wound's opening, as we have described, and constriction of it very much, until the blood is blocked from the upper part of the wound, and over the artery.
Et digitus non remoueatur, desuper ipsum cum aqua frigida uehementis frigoris semper, donec congeletur sanguis, et ingrossetur, et abscindatur.	And do not move the finger, above it with cold water always cold, until the blood is congeleth, and groweth, and is cut off.
Et interim consideret in eo, quid indiget ex cauterio, aut ex medicina.	And while you are considering this, what does it need from the poultice or medicine?

¶ De Incisione, Perforatione, et Phlebotomia in uulneribus, et his similibus.	On Incision, Puncture, and Bleedings on Wounds and Similar Matters.
Iam Diximus in Capitulo Primo, omnem aegritudinem in qua conueniens est cum igne cauterium et medicina comburente, et occasiones eius, ipsius caussas, et instrumenta eius, et formas cauteriorum.	We have said in the first chapter, all disease can be cured with fire as a cautery and medicine to burn together, and the causes of it, its causes, and instruments for doing it, and forms of cauterization.
Et posui illic capitula a uertice usque ad pedem.	And I set out those chapters from the top to the bottom.
Et ego procedam in hoc capitulo illa eadem uia: ut alleuietur super quaerentem quaesitum eius.	And I shall proceed in this chapter in the same way: that is, to allay the curiosity of the quester as to what it seeks.
Et antequam incipiam illud, oportet ut addiscatis o filii, quod in hoc capitulo est ex terrore illud quod est in capitulo primo de cauterizatione.	And before I begin that, you should learn, O sons, that fear which is in the first chapter regarding cauterization.
Et propter illud oportet, ut sit cautela in eo uehementior, quoniam in operatione quae est in hoc capitulo, multotiens cadit euacuatio cum sanguine, cum quo stat uita apud apertionem uenae, aut incisionem super apostema, aut apertionem exiturae, aut curationem uulneris, aut extractionem sagittae, aut incisionem super lapidem, et illis similia: ex quibus omnibus associatur tremor, et timor, et cadit in pluribus eorum mors.	And for that, you should be more cautious regarding the matter, since in the operation described in this chapter, often drops of blood fall with which life is lost at opening the wound, or incision on a pustule, or opening an exit, or curing a wound, or extracting an arrow, or incision on a stone, and those similar matters: from all of which trembling and fear arise, and death falls in many of them.
Et ego moneo uos, ne cadat super uos illud in quo est haesitatio, nam quandoque cadunt ad uos in hac arte modi hominum cum modis infirmitatum.	And I warn you, do not let that concern you, for when it falls on you in this art of surgery with the modes of human weakness, in various diseases.
Ex eis enim est qui irascitur cum aegritudine sua, et est leuis apud eum mors: propter uehementiam eius quod inuenit ex infirmitate sua et longitudine eius maliciei.	For from them is one who becomes irritated with his illness, and is less concerned about death: because of the severity which he finds in his illness and the length of his disease.
Et cum aegritudine est ex timore quod significat mortem.	And when illness is accompanied by fear, which signifies death.
Et ex eis est, qui dat tibicensum suum, et ditat te cum eo, sperans sanitatem, et aegritudo eius est perniciosa.	And from these he gives you his scalpel, and tells you to use it in hope of healing, but his sickness is harmful.
Non ergo oportet ut consentiatis ei qui uenit ad uos ex eis, cuius modus est talis.	Therefore it should not be that you agree to him who comes to you from these, whose way is such.
Et sit cautela uestra uehementior, quam cupiditas et uestra rapacitas.	And be your caution much greater than your desire and your avarice.
Et non praesumatis super aliquid ex illo, nisi post scientiam certam, quae uerificat apud uos illud ad quod peruenit successio laudabilis.	And do not presumptively claim anything from him unless after certain knowledge which confirms among you that which he attains to the success of praise.
Et utimini in curatione omnium infirmorum uestrorum, prognosticatione et indicatione de eo ad quod conuenienter sit salus.	And so you may heal all your sick patients, by prognosis and indication concerning that where there is healing.
In illo namque est uobis adiutorium super acquisitionem famae et gloriae, et memoriae et laudis.	For in him is the aid of you to gain fame and glory and memory and praise.
Inspiret uobis Deus o filii, intellectum suum, et non auferat uobis directionem et inspirationem: quoniam illud est in manu eius.	May God inspire you, O son, with his understanding, and may he not take away from you his guidance and inspiration: for it is in his hands.
Et ego quidem ordinaui hoc Capitulum distinguendo per capitula, secundum quod praecessit in capitulo Cauterii, a ceruice usque ad pedes: ut alleuietur uobis quaesitum quod uultis ex eo, et quo indigetis.	And I have arranged this Chapter distinguishing it by Chapters, after what preceded in the Chapter of Cautery from the hair to the feet: that you may be relieved in your request which you wish from him, and where you need it.
¶ De curatione Aquae quae aggregatur in capitibus puerorum.	Of the Cure of Water which is added to the heads of boys.
Caput I.	Chapter I.
Scias, quod haec infirmitas multotiens accidit pueris apud partum: aut quando stringit obstetrix caput pueri absque leuitate.	You should know that this illness often occurs in boys at the time of circumcision: or when the midwife tightens the head of the boy without lightness.
Et quandeque accidit etiam ex caussa occulta quae non scitur.	And whenever it also happens for an obscure cause which is not known.
Et ego quidem non uidi hanc aegritudinem in aliis quam in pueris: et ad omnem quem ex eis uidi properauit mors: propter illud ergo uisum est mihi dimittere operationem in ea.	And I have not seen this illness in any other than in boys; and I would see all of them die, for this reason therefore I have quit the operation to them.
Et ego quidem uidi ex eis puerum, cuius caput impletum erat aqua, et caput magnificabatur in omni die, donec non poterat sedere super seipsum, propter magnitudinem capitis sui: et humiditas augmentata fuit, donec mortuus est.	And I have seen a boy of these whose head was swollen with water, and the head became magnificent every day, until he could not sit on himself, by the size of his head; and the moisture increased, until he died.
Et haec quidem humiditas, aut aggregatur inter cutem et os: aut aggregatur sub osse super sifac.	And this moisture, or gathered between the skin and bone: or gathered under the bone over the sinus.
Et operatio in illo, si est humiditas inter cutem et os, et apostema est paruum, tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis fissura una in latitudine: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo nodi, donec currat humiditas.	And the operation in that, if there is moisture between the skin and bone, and the pus is small, then you should find a crack in the middle of the head in width: and the length of the crack is almost two knots, until the moisture runs.
Et haec est forma spatumilis.	And this is the shape of a little knife.
Si ergo humiditas est magis augmentata, et apostema est maius, tunc pone eas duas fissuras, secundum formam hanc.	But if the moisture is increased and the pus is larger, then place two cracks, according to this form.
Et si humiditas est sub osse, et signum eius est, quod uides commissuras capitis apertas ab omni parte: et aqua deprimitur quando comprimis eam manu tua ad interiora, et non occultatur tibi illud: tunc oportet ut findas in medio capitis tribus fissuris, secundum hunc modum.	And if the moisture is under the bone, and there is a sign of it, that you see the scalps open from all sides: and when you press it with your hand towards the inside, it does not disappear from before you: then it is necessary for you to find in the middle of the head three cracks, according to this way.
Et post incisionem extrahe humiditatem totam.	And after the incision has been made, remove all the moisture.
Deinde stringe fissuras cum pannis et puluillis.	Then tighten the cracks with rags and powder.
Deinde embroca illud desuper cum uino et oleo usque ad diem quintum.	Then immerse it from above with wine and oil until the fifth day.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et cura uulnus cum tentis, et unguentis.	Then loosen the ligaments, and care for the neck with linen bandages, and ointments.
Et non dimittas stringere caput cum aequalitate.	And do not stop tightening the head with equality.
Et ciba infirmum omni cibo sicco paucae humiditatis, usquequo confortetur membrum, et sanetur.	And feed the sick with dry food of little moisture, until their members are comforted, and the wound heals.
Et modus alius incisionis est, ut consideres ubi apparet magnitudo apostematis, et collectio aquae.	And another way to make an incision is to consider where the pus appears in size, and the collection of water.
Quoniam quandoque est in occipitio plus, aut in sincipite, aut in dextra, aut in sinistra.	For when it is more in the back, or in the forehead, or on the right, or on the left.
Ascende ergo cum incisione ubi apparet tibi apostema et impletio aquae: et scinde illud secundum quod tibi possibile est.	So go up with the incision where you see the pus and the water fills: and cut it according to what is possible for you.
Et obserua, ne incidas arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis, et moriatur infirmus ex illo fluxu cum euacuatione humiditatis.	And observe, so that you do not hit an artery, and does not happen a flow of blood, and the sick dies from that flow with the discharge of moisture.
¶ De incisione Arteriarum quae sunt post aures.	Of the arteries that are behind the ears.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Quando accidunt alicui catarri ad oculos, aut ad pectus, et antiquatur illud, et non confert curatio medicinarum: tunc magis ultima curatio est in illo, incisio harum duarum arteriarum.	When a cataract occurs to the eyes or to the chest, and it has been there for some time, and does not respond to medical treatment: then the last resort is to cut these two arteries.
Oportet ergo quando uis incidere eas, ut radat infirmus caput suum.	Therefore, when you are going to incise these two veins, let the sick person's head be covered so that they do not see.
Deinde frica locum cum panno aspero, ut appareant arteriae.	Then prepare the place with a rough cloth so that the arteries appear.
Deinde stringat infirmus collum suum, cum quolibet panno suo.	Then the sick person should tie their neck with whatever cloth they have.
Deinde considera, ubi pulset uena.	Then consider where the pulse is beating.
Et loca utriusque sunt loca quae sunt post aures depressa: et raro occultatur, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	And the places are those that are behind the depressed ears: and rarely隠れたり, except in some people.
Deinde signa cum encaustro super utraque: et incide utramque cum spatumili utrimque acuro, incisione perueniente ad os: et fiat illud per latitudinem capitis.	Then mark with caustic on each: and cut both with a sharp knife, while looking into the mouth: and let it be done across the width of the head.
Et si uis, intromitte spatumile sub arteria, et incide eam ad superiora cum incisione.	And if you see any blood vessels, insert the needle under the artery, and cut it from above with an incision.
Et sit longitudo incisionis quasi duo digiti iuncti.	And let the length of the incision be almost two fingers joined together.
Nam quando inciditur uena, egreditur sanguis egressione pulsatili, qui salit ad interiora saltu frequenti.	For when the vein is incised, blood flows out with the pulse, which rises to the inside at a regular interval.
Si autem arteria non apparet sensui, tunc oportet ut mensures ab aure quantitatem spacii trium digitorum.	If, however, the artery does not appear in the sense, then you must measure the distance from the ear to the length of three fingers.
Deinde signa cum encaustro, et finde usque ad os.	Then mark with caustic and find until it reaches the mouth.
Et illud quod oportet emittere ex sanguine, est VI uncia et fortasse emittis ex eo plus, aut minus.	And what should be released from the blood, is six minutes, and perhaps you release more or less of it.
Totum illud secundum quantitatem quae apparet tibi ex uirute infirmi et repletione arteriae eius.	All this depends on the quantity that appears to you from the vein and is filled with blood.
Deinde considera ad uulnus.	Then consider towards the eye.
Tunc si remanet ad os ex sifac aliquid, tunc incide illud, ut non accidat apostema calidum: tunc stringe uulnus cum liciniis ex panno lini.	If there is anything stuck in the throat, then cut it so that it does not cause a sore throat: and tie the eye with a linen cloth.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the person with ointment until he is healed.
¶ De extractione arteriarum, quae sunt in timporibus.	Regarding the extraction of the arteries, which are in the temples.
Caput III.	Chapter III.
Quando accidit homini hemicranea antiqua, aut catarri acuti propter humiditates acrimoniales, et caliditate in lacertis timporum, aut soda antiqua, uehemens, et similia illis: et medicatur cum modis curationis medicinae, et non confert illud: tunc experti sumus in his aegritudinibus extractionem arteriarum ex timporibus, aut cauterizationem earum, sicut narrauimus.	When a person has an old headache, or sharp cataracts due to acrid humors and heat in the lacunae of the temples, or ancient soda, harsh, and similar things: and he is treated with the methods of medicine, and this does not work: then we are experienced in these ailments by extracting the arteries from the temples, or cauterizing them, as we have related.
Et modus operationis in extractione earum, est, ut radat infirmus pilos qui sunt in timporibus, et intendat ad arteriam apparentem in timpore.	And the mode of operation in extracting them is, that the sick person whose hair is on the temples should be shaven, and the artery apparently visible in the temple should be intended.
Ipsa namque ostenditur tibi ex pulsu suo, et raro occultatur nisi in paucis hominibus, aut uehementia frigoris.	And it itself is shown to you from its pulse, and rarely hides unless in a few people, or when there is a sudden change in temperature.
Quod si occultatur tibi, tunc stringat infirmus caput suum cum quolibet panno suo: deinde frica locum cum panno aspero.	If it hides from you, then the sick person should tie his head with any kind of cloth: and then bring the dry place with a rough cloth.
Aut uapora locum cum aqua calida, donec appareat tibi apparitione manifesta.	Or wet the place with hot water until it appears to you in a manifest way.
Deinde accipe spatumile, quod paulo ante formaui.	Then take a thin knife, which was made little before.
Deinde excoria cum eo cutem cum facilitate, donec peruenias ad arteriam.	Then scrape with it the skin easily until you reach the artery.
Deinde proiice in eam uncinum, et extrahe eam ad superiora, donec extrahas eam ex cute, et facias eam euadere ex tunicis quae sunt sub ea ab omni parte.	Then throw it into her a hook, and extract it upward until you pull it out from the skin, and let it ooze from under any part of it.
Si autem arteria est subtilis: tunc inuolue eam cum extremitate uncini.	If the artery is thin: then turn it around with the end of the hook.
Deinde incide ex ea partem secundum quantitatem qua elongentur extremitates eius, et contrahantur, et non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Then cut from that part according to how long its ends are stretched out, and turned in opposite directions, and do not cause a flow of blood.
Nam si non inciditur, et si non abscinditur, non ascendit sanguis penitus.	For if it does not cut, and if it does not separate, the blood will not rise deeply.
Deinde euacua ex sanguine ana VI unci, usque ad .III.	Then pour out the blood from six ounces, up to III.
Quod si arteria est magna: tunc oportet ut liges eam in duobus locis ex filo duplo, forti, ex serico: aut ex chordis alhohod, ut non properet ad ipsam putrefactio ante consolidationem uulneris, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	If the artery is large: then it should be tied to it in two places with a double thread, strong, from silk: or from a string of alhohod, so that it does not adhere to it before the consolidation of the wound, and blood flows.
Deinde incide superfluitatem, quae est inter duo ligamenta.	Then cut through the superfluity, which is between two ligaments.
Fac illud in illa hora, aut post horam aliam.	Do that at that time, or after another hour.
Et si uis, cauteriza eam cauterio usque ad os, cum cauterio cultellari: donec incidantur extremitates eius, et stabit loco eiusdem operis.	And if you wish, cauterize it with a cauldron until the nose, with a knife: until the extremities are cut, and remains in place of that work.
Et est melius opus, nisi si infirmus habet febrem, autest calefactae complexionis.	And this work is better if he has a fever or a hot skin.
Quoniam cauterium est ex eis, quae iuuant ad finiendas humiditates.	For the cauldron is from those that remain to finish the moisture.
Ergo est melius iuuamentum.	Therefore it is better to cut.
Et oportet post extractionem arteriarum, ut impleatur locus cotto antiquo: et ponantur super ipsum puluilli decenter facti.	And after the extraction of the arteries, so that the place may be filled with an old cooking: and they are placed on top of it feathers made haphazardly.
Et post solutionem curetur cum medicinis siccis, quae faciunt nasci carnem, et cum liciniis, donec sanetur.	And after the solution with dry medicines, which make the flesh grow, and with liniments, until it heals.
Quod si interim dum operaris accidit fluxus sanguinis ex arteria, tunc propera ad abscindendum eum cum cauterio, aut ut impleas locum cum zegi: et stringe manum tuam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	That if while you are working a flow of blood comes out from an artery, then come closer to cut it off with a cauldron, or to fill the place with a poultice: and grasp your hand tightly, until the blood is cut off.
Quod si nihil ex illis est tibi praesens, tunc pone super locum digitum tuum, donec congeletur sanguis.	That if there is nothing of those for you at hand, then place your finger on the spot, until the blood has frozen.
Et embroca locum cum aqua uehementis frigoris, donec quiescat acuitas, et stringatur secundum quod oportet.	And soak the place with water of chilly temperature, until the sharpness subsides, and is clasped tightly according to what is necessary.
Et ex eo quod est leuius et facilius extractione arteriae, est, ut cauterizes uenam cum hoc cauterio habente duos cultellos: sitque acuitas duorum cultellorum similis almagdatem.	And from that which is lighter and easier to extract the artery, it is, as a cauldron with two knives has: and the sharpness of the two knives is like an almond.
Verumtamen sunt multo minoris acuitatis, quam duo cultelli.	However, they are much less sharp than the two knives.
Quoniam si sunt acutae, sicut duo cultelli, properat utrisque frigus: et non incidunt carnem cum uelocitate.	For if they are sharp, like the two knives, it is better that they have coldness: and they do not cut into the flesh with speed.
Cum ergo in eis est aliquantulum grossitudinis, tenetur in eis calor ignis, et abscinditur caro uelociter: cum hoc ergo opus est melius omni opere, et leuius, et facilius.	And so if there is some roughness in them, a heat of fire is held in them, and the flesh is cut off quickly: so this work is better for every work, lighter, and easier to do.
Et sit spacium quod est inter duos cultellos quantitas grossitudinis digiti, postquam tu signas duo loca cum encaustro: et depone utrosque ignitos ualde, donec perueniant ad os, et incidant uenam in duobus locis: ut elongetur quod est inter extremitates eius.	And make a space between the two scalpel-like objects according to the thickness of the finger, after you have marked the two places with fire; and put the both on fire widely until they come to the mouth, and fall together in the two places: that it may become longer what is between the extremities of it.
Nam non consolidantur cum hoc cauterio penitus.	For with this cauldron they do not harden when placed inside.
Et haec est forma cauterii.	And this is the form of the cauldron.
¶ De cura cursus lachrymarum acutarum assiduarum ab oculis.	¶ Of the care for the course of acute tears and persistent tears from the eyes.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Quando sunt lachrymae assiduae, et est cursus earum ex uenis, quae sunt super craneum capitis exterius: et non confert in eis aliquid curationis medicinae cum medicinis, et uides faciem infirmi iam rubere, et sentit in fronte sua deambulationem, sicut est deambulatio formicarum: et oculi eius sunt extenuati, humidi, ita quod iam corrosi sunt pili eorum cum corrosione: et calefactae sunt palpebrae eius ex acuitate lachrymarum: tunc antiqui indiguerunt in curatione earum hac operatione, et denominauerunt eam curationem, cum Ense.	When there are persistent tears and the course of the tears from the eyes runs from the top of the head outside: and does not bring anything into them of medicinal care with medicines, and their eyes become red, and feel a movement in their front as if it were the movement of ants: and their eyelids are heated because of the acute tears: then the elderly people used to cure them with this operation, and they called this cure Ense.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere pilos qui sunt in fronte sua.	And it is, as you command to the sick to shave the hair that are on his forehead.
Deinde incide in fronte tres fissuras aequedistantes secundum longitudinem frontis: et sit longitudo fissurae quasi duo digiti, et fissura una sit aequedistans longitudini nasi in medio frontis, et secunda secundum longitudinem parumper a motu lacertorum, et tertia a parte altera: et caue ab incisione arteriarum quae sunt in duobus lateribus: et elonga manum tuam a continuatione duarum mandibularum, et sit spacium omnis incisionis quantitas trium digitorum coniunctorum: et sit tibi frustum spongiae praeparatum, aut panni siccati multi, cum quibus exsicces sanguinem.	Then cut in the forehead three slits equidistant according to the length of the forehead: and make the length of the slit almost like two fingers, and one slit be equidistant in length to the nose in the middle of the forehead, and the second be according to the length of half a snake's move, and the third from the other part: and take care not to cut the arteries which are on both sides: and make your hand extend from the continuation of the two mandibles, and make the space between each incision equal to the quantity of three joined fingers: and have you prepared a sponge fragment, or many dry fabrics, with which you dry the blood.
Deinde intromitte spatumile duarum acutarum extremitatum, cuius mox sequens est forma.	Then introduce the spatula between the two acute ends, whose subsequent form is as follows:
Ab incisione quae est a parte timporis, usque ad incisionem secundam: et excoria cum eo totam cutem, quae est inter duas incisiones, cum sifac, quod est super os.	From the incision which is from the temporal part, until the second incision: and scrub with it all the skin which is between the two incisions, with chafe, which is on the bone.
Deinde fac illud etiam ab incisione media usque ad incisionem secundam.	Then also make this from the incisions middle to the second incisions.
Deinde extrahe hoc spatumile, et intromitte in incisionem primam iterum instrumentum aliud, quod nominatur cultellare acutum, ab una parte lene, non acutum ab altera parte.	Then extract this bone also, and introduce into the first incision again another instrument called a sharp chisel, soft on one side, not sharp on the other.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et pone latus eius acutum uersus carnem annexam cum cute, et latus eius lene uersus os: et impelle ipsum, donec perueniat ad fissuram mediam: et abscinde cum eo omnia uasa, quae descendunt a capite ad oculos: praeter quod continuetur incisio usque ad illud quod apparet de cute.	And put his sharp side opposite the flesh attached with skin, and his soft side opposite the bone: and push him, until it reaches the middle opening: and cut off all the tools that come down from the head to the eyes: except that it continues the incision until that which appears from the skin.
Deinde fac illud in fissura media usque ad fissuram aliam.	Then make also this in the middle opening until another opening.
Et postquam currit ex sanguine quantitas aequalis, exprime loca ex frustis sanguinis coagulati.	And when an equal quantity of blood has run out, express the places from the clotted blood.
Deinde pone in omnem fissuram licinium ex cotto ueteri, et pone super eos puluillos imbibitos in uino, et oleo, aut aceto.	Then put into every opening a chisel made of hardened iron, and put on them flints dipped in wine, oil, or vinegar.
Et uide ut non accidat apostema calidum.	And see that it does not happen that the blood clotted is hot.
Et in die tertia solue ligamentum, et administra infusionem multam cum aqua tepida.	And on the third day loosen the ligaments, and administer a strong infusion with warm water.
Deinde cura illud ex unguento basilicon, et reliquis quibus curantur uulnera: usquequo sanetur.	Then care for that with the ointment of Basilicon, and with the others which are treated with wounds: until it is healed.
¶ De cura lachrymarum acutarum et catarrorum ad oculos ex interioribus capitis.	§ Of the treatment of acute lacrimation and cataracts on the eyes from within the head.
Caput V.	Head
Quando accidunt alicui catarri acuti, acres, assidui: et uides oculos eius extenuatos, paruos, et iam debilitatus est aspectus eorum: et palpebrae ulceratae, et cadunt pili ex eis, et in profundo capitis est dolor acutus, laedens, et sternutatio consequens: tunc sume ex istis accidentibus, quod illae materiae, et catarri non ueniunt, nisi ex uenis multis.	When there occur to anyone acute, sharp, and persistent tears: and his eyes look pale, thin, and their appearance is weak: and the eyelids are ulcerated, and hair falls out from them, and there is a sharp pain in the deep part of the head, and subsequent sneezing: then remove these accidents, that those materials and cataracts do not come, unless they are taken away with many.
Et melior curatio in eis est haec.	And the best treatment for them is this.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo radere frontem suam.	And it is, as you instruct the sick person to shave his forehead.
Deinde incide in eam fissuram unam in medio frontis, aut alterius parumper per latitudinem, et incipe cum fissura a timpore sinistro ad timpus dextrum: et sit incisio usque ad os: et elonga manum tuam a lacertis timporum, qui mouentur apud masticationem: donec quando detegitur os: et exsiccabis totum sanguinem cum spongia.	Then cut in it one opening in the middle of the forehead, or a little more around the width, and begin from the left side of the time to the right: and let the incision go down to the bone: and extend your hand from the teeth which move at mastication: until when it has been uncovered the bone: and you will dry out all the blood with a sponge.
Tunc separa inter duo labia fissurae cum cotto ueteri, aut cum liciniis ex lino.	Then separate between the two lips of the fissure with dried old wax, or with linen liniments.
Deinde stringe desuper cum puluillis: et imbibe puluillos cum uino et oleo, ut non accidat apostema calidum.	Then bind above with dust: and dip the dust in wine and oil so that hot pussing does not occur.
Et quando soluis illud, et uides quod apostema calidum iam imminuitur: tunc oportet ut frices os, donec incipiat in eo nasci caro.	And when you dissolve that, and you will see that the hot pussing is about to begin coming out: then it is necessary that you cut the flesh of the nose, until the baby begins to come out.
Deinde cura ipsum cum regimine exiccatiuo quod facit nasci carnem: sicut si accipias ex farina tritici partes duas, et ex colophonia quatuor partes: et praepares ex eis emplastrum, et administretur ad natiuitatem carnis in istis uulneribus.	Then take care of the baby with drying treatment that makes the baby come out: as if you took two parts of wheat flour and four parts of colophony: and prepare an ointment from it, and administer it to the birth of flesh in these wounds.
¶ De cura eius quod cadit in Aurem.	The care that falls on gold.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Omne Quod in Aurem cadit, est una quatuor specierum: aut lapis mineralis, aut simile lapidi, sicut ferrum, et uitrum: aut est ex planta, sicut est cicer, et fabae: aut est res fluxibilis, sicut aqua, et acetum, et eis similia: aut aliquod animal.	All that falls on gold is of four kinds: either the mineral rock, or similar rocks, such as iron and lead; or it is a plant, like beans and peas; or it is a liquid substance, like water and vinegar, and similar things; or it is an animal.
Quando ergo cadit in aurem lapis, aut genus lapidis ex eis quae non adduntur, neque crescunt in aure, expone Aurem soli: si ergo uides lapidem, tunc distilla in Aurem aliquid ex oleo uiolato, aut sisamino.	When therefore gold falls on a rock, or a kind of rock that does not contribute to gold and does not grow in gold, expose gold to the sun alone: but if you see a stone, then distill into gold some oil that has been cooked, or put it in mustard.
Deinde administra extractionem eius, et fac sternutare cum condisi, et opila nares apud aduentum sternutationis, postquam tu ponis in circumitu auris frusta ex pannis, aut lana, et extendis aurem ad superiora.	Then administer the extraction of it, and make it snort with condiments, and rub the nostrils near the coming of sneezing, after you have put on gold-colored bandages from rags, or wool, and spread the gold towards the top.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum hac cura.	Many times has this treatment gone out with this care.
Si autem non egreditur, tunc administra extractionem eius cum Gesti, id est, Pizigarolis subtilibus: cuius forma est haec.	But if it does not go out, then administer the extraction of it with gentle gestures: whose form is this.
Si ergo egreditur cum gesti, est bonum.	But if it goes out with gentle gestures, it is good.
Et si non, tunc administra extractionem eius cum uncino caeco subtili paucae duplicationis.	And if not, then administer the extraction of it with a slim black hook made from a few twists.
Si ergo non egreditur per illud, tunc fac cannulam ex aere, et intromitte extremitatem cannulae in foramen auris multum, et opila quod est in circumitu cannulae cum caera mollificata cum oleo, ut non sit uento uia nisi cannulae: deinde extrahe cum uento tuo attractione forti.	If then he does not come out by that [method], then make a tube from brass; and introduce the extremity of the tube into the ear hole very much, and the resin which is around the tube with softened wax with oil so that there is no wind going except through the tube: then draw it out with your breath in strong吸引.
Multotiens enim egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus.	Indeed, he comes out many times when he hears us [speaking].
Si autem non egreditur hoc modo: tunc accipe ex helkalimbat, aut ex uisco, id est, gluten praeparato, cum quo capiuntur aues, rem modicam: et pone ipsum in extremitate radii postquam tu inuoluis super eam cotum decenter positum: deinde intromitte ipsum in foramen auris cum facilitate, postquam tu exiccas aurem ab humiditate.	But if he does not come out in this way, then take from the ash wood or from the stream, that is, the gluten prepared with which they are wetted, something like it: and set [it] at the end of a stick after you have dried up the ear with [the use of] moisture. Then introduce [it] into the ear hole with ease, after you have removed the wax from the ear with your finger.
Si ergo non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc propera ad scindendum, antequam accidat apostema calidum, aut spasmus.	But if he does not come out with all that we have described, then approach to cut off before the feverish heat or spasm occurs.
Et modus fissurae est, ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis in cephalica: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum mensuram uirtutis eius.	And the mode of the incision is so that the phlebotome takes away the blood from the head first: and draw out [it] by the amount of the power of his skill.
Deinde fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et conuerte aurem eius ad superiora, et finde fissuram paruam in radice auris apud adipem eius in loco depresso ipsi: et sit fissura lunaris figurae, donec peruenias ad lapidem: deinde aufer eum cum eo, quod est tibi possibile ex instrumentis.	Then make the sick person sit between your hands, and turn his ear upward, and find a small hole at the base of his ear where his fat is depressed in the shape of a moon: and make the lunate shape remain until you have reached the rock: then remove it with that  [tool], as far as you can do it with your instruments.
Deinde sue fissuram ab hora tua cum uelocitate, et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then heal the hole from your own hand with haste, and take care of it until it is healed.
Quod si res cadens in aurem est ex uno granorum, quae crescunt, et inflantur: tunc administra extractionem eius.	If something that has fallen into the ear comes from one grain which grows and swells: then administer extraction of it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc accipe spatumile tenue, subtile, secundum hanc formam.	But if it does not obey you to come out, then take a small, fine straw, according to this form.
Et administra cum eo abscisionem illius speciei ex granis, quae cadunt in aurem, et non facias illud, quando tu cogitas, quod illud granum iam humectatum est per uaporem auris, donec ponis ipsum frusta multa: deinde extrahe ea cum uncinis, aut cum gesti subtili, aut cum suctione, sicut diximus, nam extractio eius alleuiatur.	And with that administer the cutting off of its species from the grain which has fallen into the ear, and do not consider that it is already moistened by the ear's moisture until you have put on many straws: then draw out it with a hook or with a gentle hand or with suction as we have said, for the extraction of it is comforting.
In aqua autem quae ingreditur in aurem, oportet ut utatur infirmus sternutatione cum condisi in primis: et iam impleuit aurem suam cum aliquanto cotto ueteri: et est iacens super illam aurem, in qua est aqua.	In the water that is added to the ear, it should be used by the sick with sternutation first and foremost, and the ear has already been filled with some of the old cooked [water]: and he lies down on his side on top of the ear where the water is.
Si ergo egreditur per illud, est bonum.	If so then come out through that, it is good.
Et si non: tunc accipe lapides multos, secundum longitudinem digiti, tenues, lenes, et calefac eos cum igne parumper, et intromittat infirmus ex eis unum in foramen auris suae: et saliat super pedem suum unum ex illa parte, et percutiat cum lapide alio super lapidem qui est in aure.	And if not: then take many stones, according to the length of a finger, small, soft, and warm them with fire slightly, and insert one of them into the hole of his ear: and let him sweat on one foot from that part, and hit against one stone with another stone in the ear.
Non ergo cesset facere illud cum lapide et lapide, donec egrediatur tota aqua.	So then do not stop doing that with stones and pebbles, until he comes out all the way with water.
Et iam egreditur aqua ita, ut accipias ex parpyro, aut ex iunco unum, et intromittas extremitatem eius unam in aurem: et accendas extremitatem alteram cum igne, donec comburatur plurimum eius.	And already he comes out with water so that you take it from a branch or a vine and introduce the end into his ear; and you light the other end with fire, until it is burned well.
Deinde itera iuncum alium, et fac illud multotiens, donec egrediatur tota aqua: et extrahe ipsam cum cannula secundum quod praemissum est in lapide.	Then again take another branch, and do this many times, until he comes out all the way with water; and draw it out with a tube according to what has been said above in the stone.
In extractione autem animalis intrantis in eam, si est parui corporis, ut pulex, et ei simile, cura ipsum sicut dixi in diuisione.	In the extraction however of an animal that enters into it, if it is a small body like a flea, and similar to it, take care of it as I said in the division.
Sed si est corporis magni, quod appareat sensui: tunc administra extractionem eius cum gesti, et uncinis: et res eius est facilior omnibus, quae tenentur in aure.	But if it is a large body, which seems by touch: then administer its extraction with movements and hooks: and the matter of it is easier for all those who hold it in the ear.
In extractione autem uermis generati in aure, quando curas eum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et in tractatu distilationum, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut aspicias aurem in sole.	In the extraction however of a foal that is born in the ear, when you take care of it with that which we have said in division and in the treatise on distillation, your treatment does not bring about its cure: then you must examine the ear under the sun.
Si ergo apparet illic aliquid ex uermibus, tunc extrahe illud cum gesti, aut cum uncinis subtilibus.	If so then it appears there something of a foal, then extract that with movements, or with a subtle hook.
Si autem non apparet illic aliquid, tunc accipe cannulam, cuius haec est forma, stricta inferius, ampla superius: et intromitte extremitatem subtilem in aurem secundum quantitatem quod tolerat eam infirmus: deinde suge cum ea suctione forti.	If there is nothing visible there, then take a cannula, which has this shape, narrow from below, wide from above; and introduce the thin end into the ear according to the quantity that the sick person can bear: then suck strongly with it.
Fac illud multotiens, donec egrediantur omnes uermes.	Do this often, until all the wax has come out.
Si autem non obediunt tibi ad exitum, tunc opila circumitum cannulae cum caera, sicut dixi in lapide.	If they do not obey you up to the exit, then cover the cannula with wax, as I said on the stone.
Quod si non egrediuntur cum eo quod diximus: tunc administra distillationes quas iam experti sunt antiqui in interfectione uermium: et inuenies illud in tractatu distillationum.	That if they do not go out with it which I have said: then administer the distillations which the ancient ones have experienced in the infection of wax: and you will find that in the book of distillation.
Et sit effusio tua qua effundis olea et medicinas in aurem cum hoc instrumento, cuius forma depicta est hic.	And let your flow be as it flows with oil and medicines into the ear with this instrument, whose shape is depicted here.
Sicut uides fac ipsum ex argento, aut aere, inferius strictum, in quo sit foramen paruum, amplum superius.	As you see do yourself from silver or brass, narrow from below, where sits the small hole, wide from above.
Sit ergo ut impellens quod est in concauitate cannulae, sit ex aere decenter factum.	So that it is pushed out what is in the concern of the cannula, let it be made of brass and be crooked.
Et si uis, accipe radium, et inuolue in extremitate eius cottum inuolutione decenti: deinde proiice oleum, aut succum, aut quod uis ex istis medicinis in cannulam: et ipsa sit in aure: deinde intromitte radium cum cotto desuper, et exprime ipsum manu tua compressione temperata, donec impellatur oleum in concauitate auditus, et sentiat ipsum infirmus interius: et illud quod infunditur in aurem, sit iam calefactum cum igne parumper: et caue ne sit res quae distillatur in eam frigida ualde: medicinae enim non tolerant illud.	And if you want, take a radium, and wrap it with a cotton wisp that is gently wet; then pour oil, or liquid, or what you want from these medicines into the cannula: and let it be in the ear: then insert the radium with the cotton at the top, and squeeze it slowly by your hand, until it pushes out oil in the concern of hearing, and feels it inside the sick person: and that which has been poured into the ear, may already be warmed a little with fire: and let there not be anything that distills in it quickly: for medicines do not tolerate that.
¶ De cura opilationis accidentis Auri.	On the treatment of the loss of hearing due to an injury of gold.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Quandoque egrediuntur quidam infantes ex uentribus matrum suarum non perforati.	When certain young men come out of their mothers' wombs unharmed.
Et iam accidit etiam quibusdam hominibus opilatio in meatu Auris a uulnere, aut carne nata in ea.	And has also happened to some men that they have wax in their ears due to a cut or flesh born in it.
Et haec opilatio quandoque fit in profundo foraminis Auris, quam non consequitur uisus: et quandoque accidit ad exteriora foraminis parum, et consequitur eam uisus.	And this oileation sometimes occurs in a deep hole of the ear, which does not follow on from the injection: and when it comes to occur at the outer holes a little, and follows on from the injection.
Illa ergo quae accidit in profundo Auris, et quam non comprehendit aspectus, est in pluribus dispositionibus difficilis sanationis.	Now that which occurs in a deep hole of the ear, and what does not follow on from the view, is difficult to cure in many positions.
Et in illa quam consequitur uisus, oportet ut ponas Aurem infirmi in sole, et aspicias in ea: tunc si uides opilationem apparentem, aperi eam cum spatumili subtili, cuius forma est haec quae sequitur, sit extremitas eius in qua sit quaedam latitudo parua, cuius quaedam pars sit acuta: et reliquum spatumile sit duarum laterum lenium: ut non laedat aurem.	And in that which follows on from the injection, it is necessary that you should place gold-plaster on the ear and examine it: then if you see the oileation apparent, open it up with a very fine awl, of whose shape this is one that follows on; let the end of it be in that part where there is some little width, of which some sharp part is: and let the other part of the awl be soft on both sides: so that it does not wound the ear.
Si ergo opilatio est a carne nata in meatu auris: tunc tene eam cum uncino subtili, et incide eam cum facilitate uehementi, donec auferatur tota caro.	If then the oileation is born from the flesh at the top of the ear: then hold it with a very fine hook, and cut it easily with a sharp instrument, until all the flesh is removed.
Quod si opilatio est in profundo auris: tunc accipe radium subtilem, lenem, et calefac ipsum cum igne parumper: deinde mitte ipsum in meatum auris.	That if the oileation is in a deep place of the ear: then take a very fine ray, smooth it, and heat it slightly with fire: then send it into the ear.
Si ergo senseris opilationem cum eo, quod inuenit infirmus cum grauitate auditus, conare apertionem eius cum facilitate: et caue, ne uulneres neruos auris.	If then you feel the oileation with it, that it is located in a weak place of the ear, be careful to open it up easily: and carefully, so as not to wound the nerves of the ear.
Deinde pone in aurem licinium secundum quantitatem amplitudinis foraminis, quod inuoluisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud aliquot diebus, donec sis securus de consolidatione uulneris.	Then put into the ear a liquid second to the quantity of width of the hole which you have opened with Egyptian ointment: leave it for several days, until you are sure that the wound is healed.
Aut accipe licinium, et infunde ipsum in aqua rosata, et pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, et utere ipso.	Or take liquid, and pour it into rose water, and powder it on top of it, and use it.
Quod si uides aurem iam apostemari: tunc oportet ut extrahas licinium, et permittas ipsum cum licinio alio, quod inuolues in caeroto quod sit factum cum oleo rosato, donec sedetur apostema calidum: deinde cura ipsum usquequo sanetur.	That if you see the ear already blistering: then it is necessary that you should take liquid out, and let it with the liquid which you have used in the green ointment made with rose oil, until it is healed by itself: and then take care of the ear until it is cured.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis: tunc submerge spongiam, aut pannos in aqua frigida, et pone super eam aurem: et utere reliqua curatione, quae abscindit fluxum sanguinis praedicta in tractatu distillationum.	If however there is a flow of blood: then dip the sponge, or cloth into cold water and put it on her: and use the remainder of the cure, which has cut off the flow of blood predicted in the treatise on distillation.
¶ De cura Altheli palpebrarum.	On the Treatment of Athers of the eyelids.
Caput VIII.	Head VIII.
Isti Althelil qui accidunt in Palpebris oculi, quandoque sunt humidi, et sunt sicci.	These are Althelis that occur in the eyelids when they are wet, and dry when they are.
Oportet ergo ut teneas eos cum tenaliis: aut cum uncino, et incidas eos cum spatumili a radicibus suis.	Therefore you should hold them with tenails: or with an iron hook, and strike them with an awl from their roots.
Deinde pone super loca zegi tritum.	Then place on the affected areas ground pepper.
Si autem ex eis fluat sanguis, tunc cauteriza eos cum cauterio lenticulari subtili.	If however any blood flows from them, then cauterize them with a thin lens cautery.
Et cauterizare eos, est melius post incisionem.	And cauterize them, it is better after an incision.
Multotiens enim redeunt quando remanet ex radicibus suis aliquid.	For often they return when some of the roots remain.
Et quando cauterizantur cum igne, comburuntur illae radices, et non redeunt.	And when they are cauterized with fire, those roots are burned, and do not return.
¶ De cura Grandinum palpebrarum oculi.	On the Treatment of Athers in the eyelids of the eye.
Caput IX.	Head IX.
Multotiens accidit in palpebris aliquid quod assimilatur Crandini in fortitudine sua, et sua duricie, et propter illud nominatur Grando: et est aggregatio humiditatis grossae in palpebra superiore, et palpebra inferiore.	Often there occurs in the eyelids something that is congealed on Crandin in its strength, and hardness, and because of this it is called Grandin; and is an aggregation of moist grossness in the upper eyelid, and lower eyelid.
Operatio ergo in eis est, ut consideres tunc, si est Grando procedens in eo, quod apparet de palpebra, et mouentur ad omnem partem, et res eius est facilis.	Operation on them is, that you consider then, if there is Grandin going out from it, which appears on the eyelid, and move to all parts, and the thing is easy to perform.
Finde ergo super eam fissura per latitudinem.	Then find on her a slit across the width.
Deinde excoria eam ab omni parte cum facilitate, donec euadat.	Then scrape off that skin from all parts with ease, until it bleeds.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncino, et abscinde ipsam.	Then hang her up by the hook, and cut off that one.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi abscisio eius, nisi postquam tu penetras palpebram cum incisione parumper, tunc nocet infirmo illud in aliquo.	If however you are not prepared to cut off that thing, unless after you make an incision slightly in the eyelid, then it will harm that thing which is bad.
Quod si fissura est magna: tunc aggrega ipsam cum sutura: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	If however the slit is large: then aggregate it with a stitch: and care for it, until it heals.
Et si est parua, non superueniet tibi malum ex ea.	And if it is too much, do not let a bad thing come out of it.
Vnguentum enim restaurat ipsam, et incarnat eam.	For he will restore her, and make her flesh grow.
Et si grando est decliuis ad interiora auris uersus superficiem intrinsecam, tunc inuersa palpebram, et suspende grandinem cum uncino: praeter quod indigeas incisione, et preme eam ab omni parte.	And if there is a great hole towards the inside of the ear from the surface inward, then turn the lid upside down and hang the ring with a hook: except that you should cut it and press it from all sides.
Quod si elongatur palpebra per incisionem, non nocet illud in aliquo.	That if the eyelid is stretched by cutting, that does not hurt in any way.
Deinde ablue oculum post incisionem grandinis, cum aqua salsa: et cura locum cum eo quod incarnat, donec sanetur infirmus.	Then wash the eye after cutting with salty water: and take care of the place with it when it is inflamed, until the wound heals.
¶ De cura Axirnath palpebrarum.	§ On the Care of the Eyebrows.
Caput X.	Chapter Ten.
Axirnath est adeps qui generatur in tunicis palpebrae superioris: et plurimum quidem accidit illud pueris: et ipsum grauat oculos eorum, et accidunt eis catarri in matutinis, et non possunt intueri lumen solis, propterea, quod lachrymae properant ad eos, et propter illud uides eos discumbere super facies suas semper, et super eas dormiunt, et sunt palpebrae eorum sub superciliis humidae, quas iam cooperuit inflatio: et eminentia quidem Axirnath apparens est oculo, et quando tu premis locum cum digitis tuis, sentis Axirnath inter eos.	Axirnath is the grease that is generated in the eyebrows; and it happens very often to boys: and it damages their eyes, and they are afflicted with cataracts in the morning, and they cannot see the light of the sun, because the tears go to them, and therefore they lie on their faces all the time, and sleep on them, and their eyelids are always wet, which has been cured by inflation; and the prominent Axirnath is apparent to the eye, and when you press the spot with your fingers, you feel Axirnath between them.
Et modus operationis eius est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the way that it works is that he puts the sick head in your lap.
Deinde accipe pannum lini, et praepara in eo licinia, et fac ex illo licinio circulum secundum quantitatem quod continet Axirnath ab omni parte.	Then take a piece of linen cloth and prepare it with strings, and make from it a loop according to the amount that contains Axirnath from all parts.
Deinde pone eum super eam, et preme cum digitis tuis ab omni parte, ut aggregetur Axirnath in medio circuli.	Then put him on it, and press him with your fingers from all parts, so that the Axirnath is gathered up in the middle of the loop.
Deinde finde in medio illius humiditatis cum spatumili incidente fissuras per latitudinem, et non sit fissura maior illa quae fit in phlebotomia in profundo.	Then find in the middle of it a wet spot with a sponge that is incident on cracks by width, and there is no larger crack that is made in the depth.
Aut oportet ut findas cutem totam, donec peruenias ad Axirnath in pluribus enim dispositionibus procedit Axirnath ex fissura secundum formam frusti pinguedinis albae.	Or you should find the whole skin, until you reach Axirnath; for in many ways Axirnath proceeds from a crack: and with a white sponge, when it has been driven out, it is called Axirnath.
Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.	Extrahe ergo eam cum panno, quem infiltrasti inter digitos tuos ad exteriora: et tu reuoluis manum tuam ad dextram et sinistram, donec dispergatur: et caue, ne addas in fissura, ut non peruenias cum spatumili ad oculum, et laedas eum.
Si autem non appareat tibi Axirnath in principio fissurae, tu addas in fissura parum cum facilitate, donec procedat Axirnath.	But if you do not see the axillae at first in the groove, then you insert a little bit into the groove until the axilla comes out.
Deinde extrahe eam, sicut diximus.	Then take it out, as we have said.
Deinde submerge pannos in aceto et aqua, et pone eos super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis.	Then dip the cloth in vinegar and water, and place it on the spot, and tighten it with powder.
Et ex hominibus sunt qui terunt salem, et ponunt ipsum in concauitate fissurae, ut liquefiat quod remansit ex illa humiditate.	And there are people who put salt on, and place it in the crack so that what remains of the moisture is liquified.
Deinde cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of this, until it heals.
Si autem accidat in loco apostema calidum, tune cura ipsum cum emplastris sedatiuis, donec sanetur.	But if there is a hot swelling at the site, then take care of it with soiled plasters, until it heals.
¶ De modis Ataxmir oculi, id est, cum palpebra mollificatur oculi, unde fit ut rugetur sicut non debet.	As for the methods of eye treatment, that is, when the eyelid becomes soft to the eye, so that it does not rub like it should.
Caput XI.	Chapter 11:
Quando nascuntur in palpebris oculi pili additi praeter cursum sub pilis naturalibus, et antiquantur: tunc ipsi nocent oculo, et faciunt accidere modos aegritudinum, sicut lachrymas assiduas, et mollificationem palpebrarum, et albuginem, donec fit illud caussa destructionis oculi.	When hairs grow out in the eyelids, adding to the natural course of them, and become ingrained: then they hurt the eye, and cause diseases such as constant tears, enlargement of the eyelids, and whiteness, until the cause of destruction of the eye is reached.
Et Ataxmir quidem oculi curatur secundum quatuor modos.	And the treatment for Ataxmir eyes, that is, eyes that rub, is treated in four ways.
Aut per cauterium cum igne.	Or with a caustic, using fire.
Aut cum medicina acuta, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo cauterii.	Or with acute medicines, according to the precepts given in the chapter on cauterization.
Aut curatur Ataxmir per incisionem et suturam.	Or treated by Ataxmir through incisions and suturing.
Aut per cannas, secundum quod ego dicam.	Or with reeds, according to what I say.
Oportet ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	It is necessary that you place the head of the patient in your lap.
Deinde conuerte palpebram oculi manu tua sinistra.	Then turn the eyelid of the eye with your left hand.
Si ergo conuertitur, bonum est.	If so, it is good.
Et si non: intromitte acum in eam, in qua sit filum ab inferiori parte palpebrae, et fac penetrare acum cum filo desuper, et sit illud prope pilos ipsos, id est, prope marginem palpebrae, in quo nascuntur pili: et trahe filum ad superiora cum palpebra, et conuerte eam cum radio.	And if not: insert now into it, where sits the hair from the lower part of the eyelid, and let the thread go through with a thread from above, and let that be close to the hairs themselves, that is, close to the edge of the eyelid, where the hairs grow out: and pull the thread up with the eyelid, and turn it around.
Deinde finde in interiori parte palpebrae sub pilis additis cum spatumili incidente a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus.	Then find in the inner part of the eyelid under the added hairs with the knife incident from the larger tear to the smaller tear.
Deinde extrahe filum, et pone sub palpebra puluillum paruum ex cotto, aut panno: deinde signa super palpebram cum encaustro, quod sit sicut figura folii myrti.	Then pull out the thread, and put under the eyelid a small tuft of wool from wool, or cloth: then mark on the eyelid with the encrustation, which sits like a figure of a leaf of mulberry.
Verumtamen oportet, ut fit figura secundum quantitatem et eleuationem palpebrae: quoniam iam diuersificatur illud in hominibus.	However, it should be made according to the size and height of the eyelid: for this has been varied in humans.
Ex eis enim est, qui indiget ut incidatur ex palpebra quantitas magna, secundum quantitatem quae mollificatur a palpebra.	For from them is he who does not wish that the thread should go out from the eyelid according to the quantity that softens it from the eyelid.
Deinde cum spatumili finde super duas lineas quas signasti, et incipe a lachrymali maiore usque ad lachrymale minus, et sit fissura una prope pilos naturales, sicut est grossitudo radii.	Then with the knife find above the two lines that you have marked, and begin from the larger tear to the smaller one, and let there be a groove next to the natural hairs, as is the height of the radius.
Deinde intromitte uncinum in uno duorum angulorum cutis.	Then insert the hook into one of two angles of the skin.
Deinde excoria ipsam totam.	Then scrape all of it out.
Deinde aggrega cum sutura duo labia, cum acu et filo lana subtili: et absterge sanguinem, et fac adhaerere quod superfluit ex filis super duo supercilia, cum quibusdam rebus inuiscantibus, si uis facere illud: et si non, non cures.	Then bring together with a stitch the two lips, with an aiguille and a thread of fine wool: and wipe away the blood, and let whatever excess remains from the hairs on the two eyelids stick to the two eyelids, with certain things that are slippery, if you wish to do so: and if not, it is not important.
Deinde dimitte suturam et fila usque ad tres dies, aut quatuor: postea cura illud.	Then let go of the stitch and the thread until three or four days: then take care of it.
Et si uis, dimitte uulnus absque sutura, et cura ipsum cum eo, quod exsiccat et constringit.	And if you wish, let go of the hook without a stitch, and take care of it with it, that it dries up and tightens.
Nam palpebra eleuatur apud sigillationem uulneris et aggregationem eius: sed futura est melior.	For the eyelid rises by the sigillation of the wound and its aggregation: but a better one will come in the future.
Hunc modum curandi Ataxmir docuerunt antiqui.	Thus they taught the method of treatment of Ataxmir in the ancient times.
Verumtamen in eo est sollicitudo super infirmum, et est ex bona operatione, et non est in eo timor.	Indeed, in it is concern for the sick, and it is from a good operation, and there is no fear in it.
Et modus alius est in Ataxmir etiam: et est, ut signes super palpebram figuram, quae sit sicut figura folii myrti, sicut narrauimus.	And another mode also in Ataxmir: and that is, as signs on the eyelid a figure, which is like the figure of a bay laurel leaf, as we have told.
Deinde eleua palpebram cum tribus uncinis separatis, aut aggregatis, secundum formam hanc quae sequitur, deinde incide quod superfluit cum forficibus paruis, secundum hanc formam, cum aequalitate incisionis.	Then wipe the eyelid with three separate or joined hooks according to this form that follows, then cut what exceeds with small blades according to this form, with an equal incision.
Si autem non est tibi possibile tenere uncinum, et non aequatur illud: tunc accipe acum in qua sit filum, et intromitte ipsum in medio figurae: et intromitte filum aliud prope lachrymale maius, et filum secundum prope lachrymale minus: et aggrega inter digitos tuos fila cum aequalitate.	But if you are not able to hold the hook, and it does not match: then take an acme in which is a thread, and introduce it into the middle of the figure: and introduce another thread near the larger tear, and a third thread near the smaller tear: and gather between your fingers the threads with an equality.
Deinde eleua manum tuam eleuatione aequali: et eleua cutem super quam est signatum cotum, sicut narrauimus.	Then wipe your hand with an equal wiping: and wipe the skin over where is marked the spot, as we have told.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound with a stitch: and take care of it, until it heals.
Si uero accidat apostema apud incisionem tuam, aut fissuram tuam: seda illud apostema cum caeroto, et his similibus, ex unguentis sedantibus.	But if there happens to be a blister on your incision or a crack: but that blister with white of egg, and these similar ones, from a ointment sitting.
Et quandoque accidit palpebrae etiam, ut conuertantur pili eius.	And when the eyelids also happen to turn inward so that their hairs come together.
Oportet ergo ut utaris in ea quod diximus in incisione: sed sutura utrisque magis est artificialis.	It is necessary, then, for you to use on it what we have said in the incision: but the stitch on both sides is more artificial.
¶ De cura Ataxmir cum cannis.	Of the care of Ataxmir with hooks.
ET Est, ut conuertas palpebram, et scindas fissuram quae est deintus, secundum quod narraui.	And is, as you turn the eyelid and divide the crack which is within, according to what we have told.
Deinde arte fac duas cannas, aut duo ligna subtilia: quarum longitudo sit secundum longitudinem palpebrae, et latitudo earum sit minor latitudine spatumilis: et tu iam incidisti in extremitatibus utriusque ab utrisque partibus ubi tenes fila.	Then, with art, make two hooks or two thin pieces of wood: whose length is according to the length of the eyelid, and whose width is less than a fingernail's breadth: and you have already incision on the extremities of both sides where you hold the threads.
Deinde aggrega utramque cum subtilitate super illud quod superfluit ex palpebra oculi, et stringe duas cannas ab utrisque partibus strictura forti, et dimitte eam diebus aliquot.	Then collect it with subtlety on what exceeds the eyelid of the eye, and tightly tie two reeds from both sides with a strong constriction, and let go after a few days.
Cutis enim stricta morietur, et denigrabitur, et putrefiet, donec cadet per se.	The skin, however, will die, be degraded, and decompose until it falls away by itself.
Si ergo tardatur, tunc incide eam cum forficibus.	If it therefore is delayed, then cut it with scissors.
Deinde cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it until it heals.
Cum ergo consolidatur, eleuatur palpebra: et non pungunt pili.	When it has thus consolidated, remove the eyelid: and the hair no longer prickle.
Et haec est forma duarum cannarum, quas facies secundum hanc figuram, et quantitatem in longitudinem et latitudinem.	This is the form of two reeds which you shall make according to this figure, and in quantity in length and breadth.
¶ De eleuatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.	De elewatione pilorum pungentium in oculo cum acu.
Caput XII.	Head XII.
Operatio in illo est, ut accipias acum subtilem, et intromittas in eam filum ex serico subtile, lene.	Operation in that is, that you take a fine acme, and insert in it a thread of silk, soft.
Deinde aggreges extremitates eius, et nodes utramque nodo subtili ualde: et sit longitudo filorum palmus unus.	Then gather together the ends thereof, and tie each with a small knot; and make the length of the threads equal to that of a palm.
Deinde compone in Alinxotati filum aliud subtile sub eo in breui, et noda extremitates eius si uis.	Then compose in the Alinxotatus a second thread under it, and tie the ends thereof if you wish.
Deinde ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo, et sit prope solem ut declaretur operatio: quoniam est operatio subtilis, uel minuta.	Then lay his sick head in your lap, and bring it near the light that the operation may be declared; for it is an operation of subtlety or minuteness.
Deinde intromitte acum cum alinxotati in radicem palpebrae, et fac eam penetrare in palpebram festinanter, donec extrahas eam desuper pilum naturalem.	Then insert the acme with the Alinxotatus at the root of the eyelid, and let it penetrate into the eyelid swiftly, until you draw out a natural hair.
Deinde trahe pilum usque supra alinxotati: et intromitte in alinxotati illum pilum: si est unus, aut duo, aut tres, non plures.	Then pull the hair up above the Alinxotatus: and insert in the Alinxotatus that hair; if one, or two, or three, not more.
Deinde trahe manum tuam cum eo, donec egrediatur pilus cum alinxotati in palpebra cum pilo naturali.	Then take your hand with it, until the hair and Alinxotatus come out of the eyelid with a natural hair.
Si autem trahatur alinxotati, et non egrediatur pilus cum ea: trahes alinxotati ad inferiora, cum filo quod tu composuisti in ea, donec egrediatur alinxotati ex foramine superiori, et uideas eam uisione oculi: tunc enim trahes alinxotati, et filum: et extrahe utraque, et claude oculum: et dimitte ipsum clausum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec adhaereat pilus loco suo, et nascatur super ipsum caro.	If it is not drawn out with the Alinxotatus, and a hair does not come out with it: then draw out the Alinxotatus downward with a thread which you have composed therein, until the Alinxotatus comes out of the upper opening, and close the eye thereof; then let go the eye for two days, or three, until the hair adheres to its place, and grows on the top thereof.
Quod si pilus est breuis, tunc aut associa ei pilum longum ex pilis naturalibus, et eleuatur cum eo: aut dimitte ipsum, donec elongetur post spacium, et tunc eleua ipsum.	If the hair is short, then either attach a long hair from natural hairs, and cut it off with it; or let it go until it grows out after a space, and then cut it off.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae accidit in palpebra superiori.	On the treatment of Al-Ashtar's disease which occurs in the upper eyelid.
Caput XIII.	Head XIII.
Quando accidit oculo haec Alxatrati, nominatur Leporina.	When this occurs to the eye, it is called Leporina.
Et haec Alxatrati est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	And this disease of Al-Ashtar is either natural or accidental.
Accidentalis ergo fit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et similium illis.	So the accidental one is caused by the union of a wound, or a cut, or cauterization, and similar things.
Et modus operationis in ea est, ut tu findas illam consolidationem, et ut separes labia eius, et ponas in eo quod est inter ea licinium ex lino, et liges eam, donec sanetur.	And the mode of action in it is, that you may find that union, and that you separate its lips, and put into it what is between them from linen, and bind it, until it heals.
Et non oportet, ut utaris in curatione eius rebus quae exiccant et constringunt: nam si tu facis illud, redit Alxatrati deterior quam fuit: imo utere in ea rebus quae mollificant, sicut foenumgraecum: et embroca cum aqua, in qua cocta sit althea, semen lini: et unguento dyaquilon, quod liquefactum sit cum aliquo ex oleis: et inuolue cum eo licinium, et cura cum eo.	And it is not necessary that you should use for its cure the things which dry and tighten; for if you do so, Al-Ashtar returns worse than it was: but use for it the things which soften, such as fennel seed; and bathe with water in which has been cooked aloe, and oil: and anoint with it, and apply with it.
Et thesaurus curationis tuae est, ut coneris omni ingenio, ut non consolidetur, secundum formam quae fuit in primis.	And the treasure of your cure is, that you may keep any idea, so that it does not harden, according to its form which it had at first.
Et haec quidem operatio quam diximus, non est nisi quaedam rectificatio Alxatrati, ut non redeat forma loci secundum quod fuit omnino.	And this operation which we have described is no more than a certain correction of Al-Ashtar, so that the form of the place does not return to what it was altogether.
¶ De cura Alxatrati quae fit in palpebra inferiori, et est rugatio uel contractio sursum ad dextrum et sinistrum.	On the treatment of Al-Ashtar's disease which occurs in the lower eyelid, and is either a swelling or a contraction upward toward the right or left.
Caput XIIII.	Head XVIII.
Haec Alxatrati quae fit inferius, est quae uere nominatur Alxatrati.	This disease of Al-Ashtar which occurs below is the one which is called Al-Ashtar's in truth.
Et est naturalis, et est accidentalis.	And it is either natural or accidental. Et haec Alxatrati est quae accidit ex sectione
Et accidentalis fit ex uulnere, aut fissura, aut cauterio, et illis similibus.	So the accidental one is caused by a wound, or a crack, or cauterization, and similar things. Et haec Alxatrati est quae accidit ex consolidatione uulneris, aut sectionis, aut cauterii, et
Et uia operationis in ea est, ut accipias acum, in qua sit filum duplum, et tingas eam in carnem, et facias eam penetrare a lachrymali sinistro usque ad lachrymale dextrum, donec perueniat filum in duabus extremitatibus carnis.	And when you have grasped the operation on it, so that you can see two filaments therein, and wet it with flesh, and make it penetrate from the left lacrimal to the right lacrimal until the filament comes into contact with both ends of the flesh.
Deinde extende carnem ad superiora cum acu, et incide eam cum spatumili lato.	Then extend the flesh toward the top with a sharp knife, and cut it with a chisel from the side.
Si ergo redit figura palpebrae secundum quod oportet, est bonum.	If therefore the shape of the eyelid returns according to what is necessary, it is good.
Et si non, accipe radium, et pone ipsum in fissuram, et conuerte cum eo palpebram: et finde duas fissuras in latere interiore palpebrae, et sint extremitates duarum fissurarum ex duobus angulis incisionis, donec concurrant et fiat ex eis angulus: donec quando aggregantur fiat figura earum haec figura, et est litera lauda graeca.	And if not, take the beam, and put it in the notch, and turn it with it: and find two notches in the inner side of the eyelid, and are the ends of the two notches from two angles of incision, until they meet and make this figure, and is the Greek letter pi.
Deinde aufer illam carnem per quantitatem, quod est latus eius acutum inferius, ab eo quod sequitur palpebram.	Then take off that flesh according to its quantity, which is the acute lower side of it, from there that follows the eyelid.
Deinde aggrega partes separatas: sue eam cum filo lanae.	Then bring together the separated parts: sew them with a woolen thread.
Deinde cura eas cum eo quod diximus, de medicinis mollificantibus, et liciniis, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with what I have said, about the soothing medicines and poultices, until they are healed.
Et si Alxatrati accidat ex fissura, et sutura, aut cauterio: tunc oportet ut findas fissura plana sub pilis palpebrarum, etiam secundum quod praecessit.	And if it happens to be from a notch, and stitching, or cauterization: then you should find a flat notch under the eyelids of the hair, also according to what preceded it.
Deinde separa inter duo labia cum licinio, secundum quod diximus.	Then separate the two lips with a lint, according to what we have said.
Et summa sermonis de cura Alxatrati, quando est desuper, aut inferius, est, ut currat in ea operatio, secundum quod praeparatur ex forma Alxatrati.	And the whole speech about the care of Al-Khazini when it is above, or below, it is as follows: let it run in that operation, according to what was prepared from the form of Al-Khazini.
Ipsa namque est multarum diuersitatum in forma: et artifex prudens praeparat ingenium cum quocunque modo est possibile ei, donec redire faciat figuram ad formam naturalem, aut prope eam, et ipsemet infirmus, secundum quod conuenit ei ex operatione et instrumentis in plurimis dispositionibus.	It itself is a diverse form: and the prudent craftsman prepares his mind with whatever way it is possible for him, until he makes a figure return to a natural shape, or close to it, and himself sickens, according to what suits him from operation and instruments in various dispositions.
¶ De adhaerentia palpebrae oculi cum coniunctiua, aut cornea.	Of the adhesion of the eyelid of the eye with the conjunctiva, or cornea.
Caput XV.	Chapter XV.
Quandoque accidit haec consolidatio multis hominibus, ita ut consolidetur palpebra superior cum albedine oculi, et prohibeat ipsum ab operationibus suis naturalibus.	And this consolidation sometimes happens in many people so that the upper lid with white of the eye is consolidated and prevents itself from its own natural actions.
Oportet ergo quod intromittas extremitatem radii sub palpebra, et eleues eam sursum: aut extendas eam cum uncino: deinde incide adhaerentiam cum spatumili subtili, quod non sit cum acuitate incisionis spatumilium, imo sit obtusum parumper: ut non inquietetur infirmus apud operationem, et remoueatur spatumile, et laedat oculum cum acuitate sua: et sit incisio tua quasi tu excories illam adhaerentiam cum facilitate, donec quando redit palpebra secundum formam suam naturalem, et sanetur adhaerentia tota.	It is necessary that you insert the end of the radius under the eyelid and lift it up: or that you extend it with a pin: then cut the adhesion with a very fine spatulum which is not sharp in cutting the spatulum, rather it is slightly blunt: so that the sick one does not stir during the operation, and moves the spatulum, and hurts his eye with its own sharpness: and let your incision be as if you were taking away the adhesion with ease, until when the eyelid returns to its natural form, and cures the whole adhesion.
Funde tunc in oculum aquam salsam, cum aqua ablue ipsum: aut distilla in ipsum ex sief facto, ex ziniar dissoluto cum aqua.	Then at that time pour into the eye water which is salty, with water cleaning it up: or distill into it from a distilled liquor, from a dissolved tin with water.
Deinde separa inter palpebram et oculum cum licinio lini: et pone super oculum lanam infusam cum albugine oui: et post diem tertium utere sief, et cum solidatiuis, donec sanetur.	Then separate between the eyelid and the eye with a string of linen: and put over the eye wool infused with alumen: and after three days use a distiller, and with consolidations until it is cured.
¶ De incisione ungulae et eminentiae carnis lachrymarum.	Regarding the incision of the nail and the eminence of the flesh of tears.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod ungula est secundum duos modos.	You know that the nail is according to two ways.
Aut est neruosa: et est similis sifac duro, subtili.	Or it is nervous: and it is similar to soft bone, thin.
Aut est non neruosa, similis humiditati congelatae albae: quae quando tangit cam ferrum, aut conaris capere eam cum uncino, abscinditur, et non figitur in ea uncinus.	Or it is not nervous, similar to frozen moisture of white: which when it touches a hot iron, or a sharp instrument with a hook, tears off, and does not stick to it.
Et utraeque species non incipiunt, nisi a lachrymali maiore, usquequo uadit paulatim, donec cooperit uisum, et prohibet lumen, et motum oculi.	And both kinds of nails do not begin, except from the greater tear: until they are gradually discovered, until they cover the eye, and prevent light and the movement of the eye.
Et modus operandi in incisione eius est: ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the method of operation for its incision is: so that the sick one puts his head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et eleua palpebram manu tua.	Then open his eyes, and lift the eyelid with your hand.
Deinde collige ungulam cum uncino paucae duplationis, et extende eam ad superiora.	Then take the nail with a few twists, and extend it to the upper part.
Deinde accipe acum, et intromitte in eam pilum ex pilis equi, et bouis, aut uaccae: et sit filum forte, et duplica extremitatem acus parumper, et fige eam in medio ungulae: et penetra eam cum acu, et liga cum filo ungulam, et extende eam ad superiora: et excoria cum pilo latus ungulae quod sequitur pupillam, ac si tu serres eam cum pilo usque ad postreimnum eius.	Then take the nail, and insert it into the hoof with a few twists; then pierce it with an awl or a twig: and fasten the thread strongly to one end of the nail, and fix it in the middle of the hoof: then drive it in with a needle, and tie it with a thread around the hoof, and extend it towards the top: and scrape off with a hair the side of the hoof that follows the pupil, as if you were holding it with a hair until it reaches its tip.
Deinde incide residuum in radice lachrymalis cum spatumili subtili, aut cum forficibus paruis: et dimitte carnem lachrymalis naturalem, ut non accidat ex incisione eius cursus lachrymarum assiduus.	Then cut off the residue in the lacrimal root with a fine chisel or with tiny tweezers; and let go of the natural lacrimal flesh, so that the regular flow of tears is not interrupted by the incision.
Et quandoque extenditur ungula cum uncino solo: aut cum filo, sicut diximus.	And when the nail is extended with the hook alone: or with a thread, as we have said.
Deinde excoriatur cum spatumili leni, cuius haec est forma.	Then scrape off with a fine chisel, which has this shape.
Et caue, ne tangat spatumile tunicam corneam, et accidat in ea ruptura, et perforetur pupilla.	And beware, so that the chisel does not touch the horn tunic, and a tear does not occur, and the pupil is punched through.
Deinde post incisionem, proice in oculum aliquid salis contriti, aut ex sief facto ex ziniar, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then after the incision, pour into the eye some crushed salt, or made from a solution of zinc, and let it rest until the next day.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur.	Then take care for the eyes, with what is necessary, until they are healed.
Quod si ungula est non neruosa, et non potes intromittere in eam acum, neque figitur in ea uncinus, tunc multotiens curatur haec species ungulae cum medicinis, et sanatur sicut narraui in diuisione.	That if the hoof is not nervy, and you cannot drive a nail into it, nor can you fix an móng in it; then this kind of hoof treatment with medicines should be carefully applied, and he will heal like a narrative in a division.
Quod si uis incidere eam, tunc aperi oculum infirmi, et accipe spatumile subtile, lene, debilis acuitatis, secundum hanc formam.	That if you want to cut it with a knife, then open the eye of the patient, and take a fine chisel, slightly sharp, according to this form.
Et rade ungulam desuper rasione cum subtilitate.	And scrape off the upper part of the hoof with a subtle razor.
Quod si uides quod ipsa rarificatur et confringitur, et imprimit in eam rasio, tunc distilla ex hora tua in oculum ex sief facto ex ziniar, aut ex sief rubeo, aut sale trito: et opila oculum usque ad diem alium.	That if you see that the eye has become red and inflamed, and it has been impressed by the razor; then pour into the eye from your own tears, made from a solution of zinc or red wine or salt: and rub the eye until the next day.
Deinde itera super ipsam operationem, donec remoueatur totum eius.	Then repeat over himself the operation, until he has entirely removed him.
Nisi contrarium sit tibi in oculo apostema calidum: tunc enim dimitte ipsam, et cura apostema, donec sanetur.	Unless there is an opposition to you in his eye a hot apophtheme: then indeed dismiss her, and care for the apophtheme, until he is healed.
Deinde itera operationem super ipsam cum rasione, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the operation on himself with reasoning, until he is healed.
Eminentia autem carnis lachrymalis, si nocet in oculo nocumento magno, suspendatur cum uncino, et incide ex ea partem eius: et non ultimes incisionem, ut non accidat cursus lachrymarum.	But the eminence of the flesh of the eye, if it hurts greatly in the eye a great harm, it should be suspended with an anchor, and cut off from her that part: and do not make the last cut, so that does not happen run of tears.
Deinde stilla in lachrymale sief rubeum, aut factum ex ziniari, donec sanetur.	Then drop a rubies in his tear-ducts, or made from zinc, until he is healed.
¶ De incisione Alguardenic, et carne nata in oculo.	Of the incision of Algordainic, and the flesh born in the eye.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Nascitur quandoque in quibusdam oculis hominum caro rubea composita, uel superposita, donec cooperit pupillam, aut appropinquat, aut stringit super palpebras, et fortasse conuertit palpebras ad exteriora: et assimilatur rosae balaustinae.	It is born when and in some eyes of men there is a red flesh put together, or placed on top, until it covers the pupil, or approaches, or squeezes the eyelids, and perhaps turns the eyelids outward: and is absorbed by the roses of the balastine.
Et operatio in ea etiam est, ut ponat infirmus caput suum in sinu tuo.	And the operation on her is also, that he puts his sick head in your lap.
Deinde aperi oculos eius, et collige illam carnem totam cum uncinis conuenientibus ad illud: et tene illud cum forcipe uno, aut gesti.	Then open his eyes, and take her off all that flesh with an anchor suitable for it: and hold her with one pince, or grasp.
Deinde incide carnem in primis, donec finiatur totum eius cum incisorio.	Then cut the flesh first, until he has finished all of him with a scalpel.
Et caue ab oculo, ut non laedas ipsum apud operationem: et sit incisio tua qua ipsam incidis, aut cum spatumili, quod narrauimus in incisione ungulae: aut cum forficibus paruis, cum quibus colligitur asebel, secundum quod ueniet forma eius post hoc capitulum.	And caustica from the eye, so that you do not scar him during the operation: and let your cut be which one you cut off, or with a chisel, which we have mentioned in the incision of nails: or with small tongs, with which the asebel is caught, according to which it will come after this chapter.
Cum ergo completur incisio tua, et remouetur tota alguardenici, tunc imple oculum ex sale contrito: aut distilla in eum puluerem rubeum, et similia illi ex medicinis corrosiuis: et pone super oculum deforis cottum cum albugine oui: ut securetur ab apostemate calido.	When your cut is complete, and all the Algordainici has been removed, then fill the eye with crushed salt: or distil into it a red powder, and similar drugs that burn: and put on the eye a woolen cloth with alume, so that he is secure from the hot apophtheme.
Quod si remanet ex alguardenici aliquid, et dominatur tibi sanguis calidus, et times apostema calidum: tunc dimitte oculum, et cura ipsum cum eo quod sedat apostema.	If something remains of the algyd in your eye, and warm blood flows to it, and you see a red swell: then let go of the eye, and take care of the swelling with it while it is lying there.
Deinde itera super ipsum cum operatione, donec sanetur.	Then go over the eye with the operation until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum carne addita quae accidit in oculo ex hac specie.	And do the same for the flesh added which has happened to the eye from this kind.
Verumtamen oportet, ut alienes curationem omnis oculi debilis ex uia naturali, aut ex uia accidentali, operando cum ferro: et non intromittas manum tuam in aliqua harum operationum, donec uideas, quod illud membrum est tolerans illam operationem.	However, it is necessary that you do not interrupt the healing of any weak eye from its natural way, or from an accidental way, while operating with iron: and do not put your hand in any of these operations until it has healed, since this member is tolerant of that operation.
¶ De collectione Sebel ex oculo.	Regarding the collection of sebaceous matter from the eye.
Caput XVIII.	Chapter 18.
Sebel sunt uenae rubeae quae texuntur super oculum, et prohibent uisui operationem suam: et debilitant oculum cum longitudine dierum.	Sebel are red swellings that cover the eye and prevent the performance of surgery: and they weaken the eye with the passage of days.
Necesse est ergo tibi in primis, ut consideres, si oculus in quo est Sebel, est fortis, et non est in eo aegritudo aliqua, praeter Sebel: tunc collige Sebel eius.	Therefore you must first consider, if the eye in which there is sebaceous matter is strong, and there is no other illness in it apart from the sebaceous matter: then gather the sebaceous matter.
Et est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut ponat caput suum in sinu tuo.	And it is, as you have ordered for the sick person, to put his head in your lap.
Deinde suspende illas uenas cum uncino uno, aut duobus secundum prudentiam tuam: et sit uncinus subtilis duplationis, secundum hanc formam, aut sint duo uncini gradat in corpore uno, secundum hanc formam.	Then hang those swellings with a hook, one or two according to your discretion: and let the hook be thin, double according to this form, or let there be two hooks separated by a double length, according to this form.
Deinde collige cum forficibus subtilibus illas uenas cum subtilitate, et absterge sanguinem hora post horam, donec uideas illas uenas remoueri ex oculo, et resoluuntur: et caue ne laedas oculum cum extremitatibus spatumilis.	Then pick them up with slight hook-like things, carefully, and wipe away the blood hour by hour until they have healed over, and dissolved: and do not leave the eye with its edges wet.
Et sit operatio tua in meridie coram sole, et sis firmus in operatione tua ualde: ut non incidas nisi illas uenas.	And let your operation be in the middle of the day before the sun, and be steady in your operation very much: so that you do not fall except on those swellings.
Et cum tu expleueris, tunc distilla in oculum sief uiride, aut rubeum: ut sua acuitate corrodat quod remansit ex sebel.	And when you have emptied it, then pour into the eye clear water or red water: so that its own sharpness may corrode what is left of the sebaceous matter.
Si autem non est tibi possibile colligere illud totum in illa hora, tunc emplastra oculum cum eo, quod sedat dolorem oculi: et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur dolor eius: et securetur ab apostemate calido: deinde itera super ipsum secundum modum eundem, donec sanetur.	If, however, you are not able to collect that whole [amount of] medicine at that time, then bind the eye with that which soothes the eye's pain; and leave him for a few days until his pain subsides: and keep him away from heat [contingent] on the eye. Then repeat over him in the same way again until he is cured.
Et haec est forma forficis.	And this is the form of the knife.
¶ De reductione Arissati ad nasum.	The treatment of arsy-varsy [a kind of fever] to the nose.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX.
Nominant medici Arissati Fistulam, quam curas cum cauterio, aut cum medicina acuta comburente, secundum quod praecessit eius narratio.	They call the treatment for arsy-varsy with a funnel, which they apply with caustic or sharp medicine, as per the previous description.
Et si non sanatur, tunc non est ingenium in ea: nisi ut findas super apostema apud natiuitatem eius, et extrahas totam humiditatem quae est in eo et pus, donec detegatur os.	If he does not recover, then there is no skill in it: unless you discover the pus  [the cause of the arsy-varsy] under his birthmark and remove all the moisture that is in it and the pus until the hole is exposed.
Cum ergo detegitur os, et uides in eo corruptionem, aut nigredinem, tunc rade ipsum cum instrumento, cuius forma est haec.	When, then, the hole is exposed, and you see corruption or blackening in it, then shave him with an instrument, the form of which is as follows:
Et nominatur Asperi capitis.	And it is called Shaving of the Head.
Fiat ex ferro indo, et sit caput eius rotundum sicut azir, quod sit punctatum punctatione limae, aut punctatione aliskilferi punctatione subtili: et pone ipsum super locum corruptum ossis.	Let it be made of iron rod, and let the head be round like a wheel, so that it is pierced with a file or fine chisel   [a type of tool]: and place him on the site of the corruption of the bones.
Deinde reuolue ipsum inter digitos tuos, et tu preme manum tuam parumper, donec scias quod illa corruptio iam rasa est: et fac illud aliquotiens.	Then roll him between your fingers, and press your hand upon him moderately, until you know that that corruption has now been shaved off: and do it sometimes.
Deinde restaura locum cum medicinis exiccatiuis stipticis.	Then restore the site with dried-out styptic   [a type of medicine].
Si ergo consolidatur locus, et nascitur in eo caro, et abscinditur cursus saniei: et remanet quadraginta diebus, et non renouatur, et non apostematur, et non accidit in eo accidens: tunc scias quia iam sanatus est.	If, then, the site has healed, and flesh has grown there, and the scar has disappeared   [the scar indicating a healing]: and remains for forty days, and does not return to its former state or cause any irritation: then know that he has been cured.
Et si non, tunc non est in eo ingenium, nisi reducere fistulam ad foramen nasi, secundum hanc formam.	If not, then there is no skill in it except to apply a funnel to the nose, as per this form.
Et est, ut detegas ab osse secundo cum ferro, aut cum medicina acuta: et cum detectum est os, tunc accipe terebrum secundum hanc formam, sit extremitas ferrea, triangulata: et lignum eius sit pyramis extenuata usque ad extremitatem, sicut uides.	And it is so that you remove the second bone with iron or sharp medicine; and when the bone has been removed, then take this kind of hammer, its end being made of iron in the form of a triangle: and make its wood an elongated pyramid up to its end, as you see.
Deinde pone illud super os ipsum: et sit illud prope lachrymale: et elonga manum tuam ab oculo parum.	Then put this above the bone itself: and let it be near the tear: and extend your hand from the eye a little.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum terebro, donec penetret os, et sentiat illud infirmus: per hoc quod inuenit uentum exire ex eo, quando tenet manum suam super nasum suum.	Then rotate your hand with the hammer, until it penetrates the bone and feels weak: by this you will see a vapour emerge from it when it holds its hand over its nose.
Ergo tunc restaura locum cum medicinis stipticis exiccantibus, sicut docui te.	Therefore then restore the place with sharp medicine that dries up, as I have taught you.
Cum ergo nascitur caro, et induratur locus: tunc materia quae effundebatur ad exteriora, redit ad nasum: est ergo leuius illud super infirmum.	When then does the flesh grow and the place hardens: then the substance that flowed outside returns to the nose: so it is lighter over the weak one.
¶ De reductione eminentiae Oculi.	De reductione eminentiae Oculi.
Caput XX.	The Reduction of Ocular Prominence.
Quando eminet Oculus cum totalitate sua, et non accidit in uisu nocumentum, neque diminutio: tunc oportet ut soluas infirmum: deinde phlebotomes eum: postea ponas uentosas in ceruice absque scarificatione, sed cum suctione.	When the eye emanates with its entirety, and does not occur to damage the sight or decrease it: then you should remove the weak one: then let blood be drawn: then put vents on the skin without scarring, but with suction.
Deinde pone super Oculum linimentum quod fit ex acacia, et aloe, et olibano, et sarcocolla.	Then put over the eye a lotion that is made of oak, and of aloe, and of pine resin, and of sarcocolla.
Deinde stringe Oculum desuper super emplastrum cum puluillis multis.	Then tie the eye down from above over a plaster with various powders.
Et modus puluillorum est: ut accipias pannos lenes, multos, et duplicetur omnis pannus ex eis super quatuor: fac ex eis multos: deinde pone eos unum super alium, secundum quantitatem qua indiget Oculus: deinde stringe super ipsos cum panno duro strictura forti.	And the method of the powders is this: that you take soft cloths, many and double, each cloth out of four: make from them many: then put them one on top of the other, according to the quantity that the eye requires: then tie them together with a stiff cloth, strong fastening.
Et itera uentosas cum suctione sine scarificatione.	And again put vents on without scarring.
Deinde aufer uentosas, et dimitte oculum strictum die et nocte.	Then remove the vents, and let the eye rest during the day and at night.
Si autem ligamentum iterum mollificatur, tunc oportet ut stringatur multum: deinde aufer ligamentum post diem et noctem, sicut diximus.	If however the ligature again softens, then you should tie it very tight: then remove the ligature after a day and night, as we have said.
Si ergo uides oculum iam redisse uuae tunicae, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam, et uentosas, donec sanetur.	If you see that the eye is now red again with new wounds of the sheath, it is good; and if not, then apply again plaster, and dust, and tighten, and wettings, until healthy.
¶ De incisionie Vuae tunicae.	§ On the Incision of the Sheath.
Caput XXI.	Chapter XXI.
Quando accidit disruptio in tunica Vuea, deinde eminet et procedit extra palpebras sicut granum Vuae, et foedatur forma hominis propter illud, et uis incidere illud: tunc operatio in eo est, secundum quod narro: et est, ut intromittas acum in radice Vuae ab inferiori ad superiorem partem.	If a disruption occurs in the sheath of the eye, then let it be cut and removed outside the eyelids like a grain of wheat, and let it be shaped like a human form because of it, and let it be incised: then the operation on it is, according to what: and that, so that you insert the acumen into the root of the eye from below to above.
Deinde intromitte acum aliam in qua sit filum duplum a parte lachrymalis, et fac eam penetrare: et dimitte acum primam secundum dispositionem suam.	Then introduce another ακουμ (acumen) which is at the place where there are two nerves from the lacrimal side, and let it penetrate; and release that other one according to its placement.
Deinde incide locum fili dupli, et liga cum eo partem Vuae in circumitu acus: et stringe eam multum.	Then incise the place of the double nerve, and tie with it the side of the sheath around the ακουμ; and tighten it much.
Deinde extrahe acum, et pone super oculum lanam infusam in albugine oui: et dimitte eum, donec cadat filum cum Vua.	Then remove the ακουμ , and place on the eye wool that is infused with albumen on the whites of the eye; and release it, until the nerve drops with the sheath.
Deinde cura oculum cum eo, quod confortat ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care for the eye that comforts it, until its wound heals.
Et quandoque stringitur Vua ab omni parte cum circulo ex panno, donec addat oculus eminentiam magnam.	And when the sheath is tightened all around with a circle of cloth so as to give the eye great prominence.
Deinde perforetur cum spatumili subtili, quod perueniat ad profundum oculi, et currat humiditas albuginea, et descendat oculus, et ingrediatur statim: deinde stringe eum, donec sanetur.	Then it is pierced with a thin awl that reaches to the depth of the eye, and moistened with albumen, and drops down, and enters immediately; then tighten it, until it heals.
¶ De curatione Alcomnati.	§ On the Treatment of Alconostia.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Haec Aegritudo quae nominatur Alcomnati, non, est nisi sanies, quae aggregatur in oculo, similis aquae descendenti, et non est ipsa.	This ailment called Alconostias, is not unless it is a deposit, which is gathered in the eye, similar to water that has dropped down, and it is not itself.
Et modus operandi in ea est, ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem praeparatum, uel directum.	And the way of operation in it is, so that you make the sick sit on a prepared seat, or straight.
Deinde accipe caput eius manibus tuis a partibus duabus, et moue ipsum, donec uideas saniem peruenire ad inferiora oculis tuis.	Then take its head in your hands from the two sides, and move it so that you do not see the deposit coming down to the lower part of its eyes.
Deinde figatur, et non descendat, et absoluatur lumen: et uideat infirmus res sicut uidebat: et si non descendit inferius, scias quia est aqua.	Then stop it from flowing out and let the light be made whole; and let the sick person see things as they are seen. And if it does not flow down to the lower part, know that it is water.
Si autem non praeparatur descensus saniei cum eo quod diximus, tunc fac sedere infirmum inter manus tuas.	But if the descent is not prepared with him as we have said, then make him sit between your hands.
Deinde accipe spatumile subtile, et finde cum eo supra panniculum corneum parumper apud continuationem coniunctiuae cum tunica cornea in corona, donec egrediatur sanies.	Then take a very fine spatula and find it with him above the horny layer a little bit towards the edge of the joining with the cornea in the crown, until it comes out.
Cum ergo egreditur, tunc distilla in oculum aquam calidam in qua miscuisti mel: aut aquam in qua iam bullisti foenumgraecum et mel: deinde curetur cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When it has come out then distill into the eye hot water in which you have mixed honey: or water in which you have already boiled wheatgrass and honey; and then let the rest of the cure take place, until it is healed.
¶ De cura aquae, quae descendit in oculo, uel cataracta.	Of the cure of water that comes out of the eye, or a waterfall.
Caput XXIII.	CHAPTER XXIII.
Iam Diximus species aquae in diuisione, et quae conuenit ad perforandum sermone declarante et exponente, tunc accipe illud idem secundum sanitatem.	We have already spoken about the kinds of water, and which is suitable for piercing by revealing and explaining, then take the same water according to its suitability for healing.
Tunc ergo oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas quadratum, oppositum lumini, prope solem: et liga oculum eius sanum, et stringe eum ualde: deinde palpebram oculi eius manu tua dextra, si oculus in quo est aqua, est oculus sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then it is necessary that you make the sick person sit between your hands square-wise, opposite the light, near the sun: and bind the eye of the healthy hand, and tighten it tightly: then with your right hand palm the eye of the sick person if the eye in which the water is is on the left: or with your left hand, if the eye is on the right.
Deinde accipe manu tua dextra almagda, si oculus est sinister: aut manu tua sinistra, si oculus est dexter.	Then take in your right hand almagest (a kind of mineral), if the eye is on the left: or in your left hand, if the eye is on the right.
Deinde pone extremitatem almagda prope coronam per grossitudinem radii in ipsa albedine oculi apparente lachrymalis minoris: deinde impelle almagda cum uirtute: et tu reuoluis cum eo manum tuam, donec penetret in albuginem oculi: et sentias, quod almagda iam peruenit ad rem uacuam.	Then put the end of the almagest a little bit towards the crown by the thickness of the radius in the same whiteness of the eye apparent tear: then push the almagest with force; and you will feel that the almagest has already come to the tear.
Et oportet, ut sit mensura itineris almagda ad profundum, mensura spacii quod est a pupilla usque ad finem nigredinis: et est corona oculi.	And it is necessary that there be a measure of the journey of the almagest to the depth, a space which is from the pupil to the end of the darkness: and this is the crown of the eye.
Uidebis enim ea in ipsa pupilla uisione oculi, propter claritatem tunicae corneae.	You shall cut off this eye, because of the clarity of the corneal membrane.
Deinde pone almagda usque ad locum in quo est aqua.	Then put on the almagra until such time as it reaches the place where the water is.
Deinde preme ipsum inferius uice una post aliam.	Then press down on yourself with one hand after another.
Si ergo descendit aqua statim, tunc infirmus uidet illud super quod aperit uisum suum statim, et almagda in oculo suo.	If then the water has descended at once, then he sees that eye at once, and the almagra in his own eye.
Deinde quiescas paululum.	Then you rest for a little while.
Si ergo descendat aqua, tunc depone eam secundo, praeter quod egrediatur almagda.	If then the water has descended, then put it down again, except that the almagra comes out.
Quando ergo figitur, et non ascendit: tunc extrahe almagda cum facilitate: et tu reuoluis manum tuam paulatim.	When then does it stop, and does not rise up again: then pull out the almagra easily: and you relax your hand little by little.
Deinde dissolue in aqua aliquid ex sale claro gemmae: et ablue cum eo oculum deintus.	Then dissolve in the water some of the clear salt of the lens: and wash the inside of the eye with it.
Deinde pone extra oculum totum stuppam, aut lanam infusam oleo rosato, et albugine oui: et liga cum eo oculum sanum.	Then put out all the eye with a cloth, or a woolen yarn immersed in oil and stained with albus: and bind it up with it so that the eye is healthy.
Nos autem, et illi qui sunt nostri temporis, ponimus super eum ciminum tritum cum albumine oui.	But we, and those who are of our time, put over it a finely-ground chalk mixed with albus.
Quod si non obedit tibi almagda ad introitum in oculum propter duriciem suam, quoniam ex hominibus est, cuius oculus est durus ualde: tunc oportet ut accipias spatumile, quod nominatur Alberid, cuius haec est forma.	That if the almagra does not obey you at the entrance to the eye because of its hardness, since it is from a man whose eye is very hard: then you should take the plant called Alberidge, which has this form:
Pefora ergo cum eo ipsam coniunctiuam tantum, et non ultimes manum tuam in foramine: et non est nisi ut facias uiam ad almagda locum subtilem.	Then open with it the connection only for a little while, and do not put your hand at all into the hole: and is there not except that you make the way for the almagra to the small opening.
Deinde intromitte almagda, secundum quod diximus.	Then introduce the almagra, following what we have said before.
Et apud complementum operis tui, praeparetur infirmo dormitorium decenter factum, in quo dormiat super dorsum suum in domo tenebrosa: et prohibeatur ab omnibus motibus, et a tussi: et pone cibum eius illud quo lenitur natura eius: et non moueat caput suum dextra, neque sinistra omnino.	And when you have finished your work, prepare for the sick person an awkward bedroom in which he may sleep on his back in a dark room: and prevent him from all movements, and from coughing: and let him eat that food by which nature nourishes him: and do not move his head to the right or left at all.
Et sit ligamentum secundum dispositionem suam usque ad diem tertium.	And let it rest until the third day.
Deinde solue illud in illa domo tenebrosa, et experire uisum eius: et fac eum uidere res.	Then remove it from that dark house and test its vision; and make him see things.
Deinde reduc ligamentum usque ad diem septimum.	Then reduce the ligament up to the seventh day.
Et non oportet ut faciat illud in hora curationis, aut post incisionem statim: imo oportet, ut alienes illud: propterea quod aqua ascendit uelociter per aspectum uehementem.	And it is not necessary that he make it do the work of cure at the time of the operation or immediately after the incision; but it is necessary that he keep it apart: for the water rises quickly through a slanted surface.
Si autem accidit apostema calidum: tunc oportet ut soluas oculum ante septimum: et rectifica illud cum eo quod sedat apostema, donec sedatur: tunc absolue ipsius uisum, et pone super faciem eius orale quo regatur uisus eius sub eo diebus aliquot, ipso existente in illa domo tenebrosa.	But if it happens that the swelling is warm: then you should open his eye before the seventh day: and make straight that which is wrong, so that it may be right when it has rested; then you shall test his vision, and put it on his mouth where his vision goes under while he rests those days, while he is in that dark house.
Deinde egrediatur a domo gradatim, et conuersetur in casis suis.	Then let him go out of the house little by little, and let him walk about in his rooms.
Et scias, quod in zaltea non excusatur discipulus a uisione aliquotiens: tunc enim audeat super operationem.	And know that the pupil is not exempt from vision sometimes: then he should dare to look at the operation.
Et iam quidem peruenit ad nos quidam ex illis qui sunt de Alayrach, qui dixit, quod factum fuit in Alayrach magdan perforatum, quo sugitur aqua.	And indeed some of those who are from Al-Ayyelah have come to us, who said: "It was done in Al-Ayyelah that the eye was pierced, so that the water comes out.
Verum ergo non uidi aliquem in terra uostra, qui fecerit illud: neque legi illud in aliquo ex libris antiquorum: et est possibile, ut sit illud nouum.	But verily I have not seen anyone in your land do such a thing; and I have not found it written in any of the ancient books; and it is possible that it is new.
Et istae sunt formae specierum ex magda, ut stet super ea qui ea ignorat.	And these are the shapes of the eyes, so that they may stand over them who do not know them.
Fiant ex aere proprie: et sint extremitates eorum cum hac eadem subtilitate triangulatae, et extremitas acuta.	Let them be made of pure brass; and let their edges be of the same delicate triangular shape, and the acute point.
Formae magda.	The shapes of the eye.
¶ De cura Carnis natae in naso.	Regarding the cure for the birthmark that is born on the nose.
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Quandoque nascuntur in naso Carnes diuersae additae, ex quibus est aliquid quod assimilatur scorpioni multorum pedum: et ex ea est caro cancerosa, lapidea, fusci coloris: et ex ea est quae est caro lenis, non fusci coloris.	When and how do they grow on the nose: from which there is something that is like a scorpion with many feet; and from it is the flesh of cancer that is hard, pale-colored, and fuzzy; and from it is the soft meat that is not pale-colored.
In ea ergo quae ex istis carnibus est lenis, non fraudulenta, neque cancerosa, oportet ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas oppositum soli, et aperi nares eius, et proiice uncinum in illas carnes: deinde trahe eas ad exteriora, et incide quod comprehendisti ex eis cum spatumili subtili acuto a parte una, donec scias quod caro tota iam ablata est.	In the part that is soft from among these flesh, not fraudulent nor cancerous, you should make the sick person sit with his hands opposite the sun, and open his nostrils and insert hooks into those flesh: then pull them towards the outside, and cut what you have gathered with a thin sharp blade from one side, until you know that all the flesh has been removed.
Quod si remaneret aliquid ex ea cuius abscisio non est possibilis: tunc rade illud cum uno instrumentorum subtilium cum facilitate, donec non remaneat ex eo aliquid.	That if anything remains of it from which removal is not possible: then shave that with one sharp tool easily until no more remains of it.
Si autem sanguis tibi dominatur, aut accidat apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei per id quod oportet: aut est ex apostematibus malignis, tunc propera cauterizando eum, donec abscindatur sanguis, et auferantur omnes carnes.	If, however, blood rules over you, or an infection is hot: then oppose it with what is needed: or it is from malignant sores, then approach it with cauterization, until the blood stops flowing, and all flesh is removed.
Deinde proiiciatur in nasum post incisionem acetum, et aqua, aut uinum.	Then pour into the nose after cutting vinegar, and water, or wine.
Si autem aperitur nasus, et procedat ex eo humiditas usque ad palatum, tunc scias quia iam sanus est.	If, however, the nose is opened, and moisture proceeds from it up to the palate, then you should know that he is already well.
Si uero non penetrat humiditas, secundum quod oportet, tunc scias quod intra ipsum est caro nata in superioribus ossibus naris, ad quae non peruenit cum incisione instrumentum.	If, however, the moisture does not penetrate, as should be the case, then you should know that flesh is born inside the upper bones of the nose, to which the cutting tool does not reach.
Tunc ergo oportet, ut intromittas filum lini cui sit quaedam grossitudo, et noda in eo nodos multos: et pone inter omnem nodum quantitatem digiti, aut minus: et ingeniet infirmus, ut mittat extremitatem unam fili in nasum cum radio, aut cum quo possibile est ei postquam fecerit ipsum simile azer: et trahat odoratum suum, donec perueniat usque ad caassum, et egrediatur super guttur suum.	Then you should put a thread of linen with some thickness, and make many nodules on it: and place between each nodule the length of a finger or less: and the sick person should bring one end of the thread into his nose with a jaw, or with whatever is possible for him to do after he has done himself like this: and he should smell it, until he reaches the palate, and comes out onto his throat.
Et multotiens quidem faciunt simile huic Attomi pueri in scholis: et est res facilis ei, qui uult.	And many times indeed young men do this thing like this in school: and it is an easy thing for him who wants to do it.
Deinde pone duas extremitates fili, extremitatem unam quae egreditur super nasum, et alteram quae remansit in naso.	Then place the two ends of the thread, one end that goes out over the nose, and the other that remains in the nose.
Deinde ac ministra serraturam carnis cum nodis qui sunt in filo.	Then apply a massage to the flesh with nodules which are on the string.
Fac illud donec scias quod carnes iam sunt cum nodis fili.	Then apply a massage to the flesh with nodules which are on the string.
Deinde extrahe filum: et pone in nasum post abstersionem sanguinis licinium quod imbibisti in unguento aegyptio: fac illud tribus diebus, aut plus, donec unguentum corrodat totum quod remansit ex carnibus.	Then take off the string: and put into the nose after abstinence of blood the liquid which you have imbibed with the Egyptian ointment: do this three days, or more, until the ointment has eaten up all that remains of the flesh.
Deinde pone in fine rei in nasum cannulam de plumbo, diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	Then put into the end of the matter a plummifed tube in the nose for a few days, until it is healed.
Si autem indiget curatione quae exiccet, utere illa.	If however the cure requires that which dries up, use that.
Ad caputpurgium faciendum, cum quo distillantur olea, et aliae medicinae in nasum, fac illud ex argento, aut aere: quod sit simile lampadi paruae, apertum sicut conchula: et meatus eius similiter.	For the making of a poultice for the head, when with it are distilled oil and other medicines into the nose, make that of silver or brass: which is like a little lantern, opened as an oyster: and its outlet likewise.
Et si uis fac cannulam clausam, sicut canna.	And if you wish to make a closed tube, like a reed.
Et conchula instrumenti ad caputpurgium faciendum, sit plena, detecta: cui sit manubrium in postremo eius, cum quo teneas ipsam, quando calefacis in ea oleum, aut quod uis ex succis, et rebus fluxibilibus.	And the oyster of the instrument for making a poultice for the head, is full, and closed: which has at the end a handle, by which you hold it, when you heat it in the oil, or what you wish to put into it, and fluid things.
Et haec est forma instrumenti.	And this is the form of the instrument.
¶ De cura Thelul nasi.	On the treatment of the nose.
Caput XXV.	Head XXXV.
Multotiens nascitur in extremitate nasi Thelul, et magnificatur, et augmentatur cum diebus, donec foedus fit aspectus eius.	Theul often grows in the end of the nose, and becomes larger and more noticeable with the days going by, until it makes a sort of crust.
Et propter illud oportet, ut in cidas illud in principio apparitionis eius, et eradices totum eius.	And for this, at the beginning of its appearance, you should cut off all of it.
Deinde pone super locum, aut cauterium, aut medicinam comburentem quae stat loco eius.	Then put over the place, or caustic, or medicine that burns where it is.
Si ergo tardatur incisio eius, donec magnificetur, tunc considera, si est lapideum, durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro: quoniam apostema est cancerosum.	If however the cutting away of it is slow until it becomes larger, then consider, if it is hard and dull in colour and not very sensitive: then do not touch it with iron: for it is a kind of cancer.
Multotiens enim uidi, qui incidit hmoni apostema, et accidit ex eo malicia magna super illum qui ipsum habebat.	Often has been seen that which incised the flesh of man and made thereon a bad sore, and has happened from it great mischiefes to the one who had it.
Et si apostema est lenis tactus, non fusci coloris, et uides quod incisio possibilis est in toto eius, tunc euacua infirmum, et incide ipsum sine timore, absque pauore: et cura locum cum eo quod exiccat et constringit, donec sanetur.	And if the apoplexy is mild and not discolored and you see that an incision can be made in all of it, then clean the sick part and make the incision without fear or anxiety, and heal the place along with it until it heals.
¶ De sutura nasi, et labii, et auris.	On the suture of the nose, lips, and ears.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter 26. On the suture of the head.
Scias Quia quando accidit solutio continuitatis in una harum cartilaginum, parum confert in ea operatio, nisi in quibusdam hominibus.	You know that when there is a rupture of the continuity of one of these cartilage pieces, surgery is little use unless in certain individuals.
Oportet ergo quando accidit alicui aliquid ex illo, ut consideres, si est uulnus recens cum sanguine suo: et tunc aggrega duolabia uulneris cum sutura: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	It is necessary that when such a thing happens to someone, you should consider whether it is a recent wound with its blood: and then add the pain of the wound to the suture: and then heal the wound itself until it heals.
Et si solutionis continuitatis labia iam separata sunt, et facta est unaquaeque pars sana: tunc oportet ut excories omnem partem a cute sua apparente, donec sanguinetur.	And if the rupture has separated the lips and made one side healthy while leaving another unhealthy part, then it is necessary to remove all of the skin on that side until it bleeds.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cum sutura, et stringe ea, et pulueriza super ipsum sanguinem draconis, et olibanum trita: et pone supra pulueres frustum emplastri diafinicon, et alicuius alterius ex emplastris consolidatiuis: et dimitte ipsum ligatum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then add the two lips together with the suture and tighten them and sprinkle dragon's blood on it and crushed olibanum: and put a fragment of hardened plaster on it, and some other piece of consolidated plaster: and let it be bound for two days or three.
Deinde solue ipsum, et permuta medicinam: et dimitte ipsum, donec abscindantur fila per se.	Then remove the dressing and change the medicine: and let it go until the threads separate by themselves.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then heal the wound with ointment until it heals.
Modus autem suturae est, ut aggreges solutionem continuitatis, aut cum acubus, sicut narrauimus in sutura uentris: aut aggrega solutionem cum filo, sicut feci te scire.	The method of the suture is that you add the solution of continuity, or with a thread as we have told you about the suture of the eye: or you add the solution with a thread, as I have told you.
¶ De extractione nodorum labiorum.	On the removal of bumps from the lips.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter 27. On the head.
Multis Quidem hominibus accidunt plaerumque in interioribus labiorum suorum apostemata dura similia granis herbi: et quaedam eorum minora, et maiora.	Many people have hard bumps similar to small grains of herbs inside their lips, and some smaller ones, and larger ones.
Ergo oportet ut conuertas labium, et findas super omnem nodum eius, et suspendas ipsum cum uncino, et incidas ipsum ab omni parte.	Therefore, when you have turned the lips inside out, and found all of the bumps, and suspended them by a thread, and cut them off from all sides.
Deinde impleas locum post incisionem zegi trito, donec abscindatur sanguis.	Then fill the place where the incision has been made with dried earth, until the blood is dried up.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto, et curetur locus cum eo, in quo est stipticitas, usquequo sanentur uulnera.	Then clean it with vinegar and treat the spot with that, in which there is a staph, until the wounds heal.
¶ De incisione carnis natae super gingiuam.	A wound that has come from cutting through the flesh near the gums.
Caput XXVIII.	Head XXXVIII.
Multotiens nascitur super gingiuam caro addiat, quam antiqui nominant abuluss.	しばしば口唇に肉がはみ出し、古い人はこれをabulusと呼んだ。
Oportet ergo ut suspendas eam cum uncino: aut teneas eam cum forcipibus, et incidas eam apud radicem suam, et dimittas saniem currere, aut sanguinem.	It should be suspended with a hook; or you should hold it with tongs, and cut it at the root of its attachment, and let the blood run or the blood flow.
Deinde pone super locum zegi tritum, aut alios pulueres stipticos, exiccatiuos.	Then put on top of the place where the incision was made, or other dry powder that is astringent, to dry it up.
Quod si redit illa caro post curationem, nam multotiens redit, tunc incide eam secundo, et cauteriza ipsam: ipsa namque non redit post cauterium.	If that same flesh returns after treatment, for it often does, then cut it a second time and causticate it; but it does not return after the application of the caustic.
¶ De rasione Dentium cum ferro.	The shaving of teeth with iron.
Caput XXIX.	Head XXIX.
Quandoque aggregantur in superficiebus Dentium ab interiori et extetiori parte, et inter gingiuas cortices asperi, turpes, et quandoque denigrantur, et citrini fiunt, et uirides, donec peruenit ex illo corruptio ad gingiuam, et foedi fiunt dentes per illud.	When the teeth are gathered in the surface from within and from outside, and between the gums there are rough parts, and sometimes they corrode and turn yellow, causing the teeth to become rotten through that corruption, which is called "dentinous" dentin.
Oportet ergo ut facias sedere infirmum inter manus tuas, et caput eius in sinu tuo, et rade molam et dentem, in quo apparent tibi cortices, et res similis arenae: donec non remaneat ex eis aliquid, et similiter fac de nigredine, et uiriditate, et citrinitate, et aliis donec mundentur.	It should be so that you can sit the ill person between your hands, and their head in your lap, and grind the tooth and the gum where you see the nerve, and any similar material like sand: until none remains of it, and likewise for yellowing, rotting, and citrifying, and other defects until they are clean.
Si ergo auferatur quod in eis est a principio rasionis, bonum est: et si non, tunc itera super eos rasionem die alio, secundo, et tertio, donec ad ultimum perueniat studium in eo quod uis.	If then what is taken out from the beginning of shaving is good: and if not, then shave them again another day, and a third time, until you have come to the end of your working in it.
Et scias, quod dens indiget rasoriis diuersarum formarum, multarum figurarum: secundum quod praeparatur operationi tuae: proptera, quod rasorium quo raditur dens ab inferiori parte, est aliud a rasorio quo raditur inter dentes, secundum formas alias.	And know that the tooth is sensitive to different types of blades, and to various shapes: second, that the blade with which you cut the tooth from below is different from the blade with which you cut between the teeth, according to the shapes.
Et istae formae rasoriorum sint apud te praeparatae, quas uides.	And these forms of razors are with you prepared, which you see.
¶ De extractione doloris Dentium.	On the extraction of pain from teeth.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30: Head.
Oportet ut cures Dentem a dolore suo cum omni ingenio, et tardes in eradicatione eius.	It is necessary that you treat the tooth with all your skill and remove it with difficulty.
Non est enim quod uicem eius suppleat quando eradicatur: quoniam est substantia sublimis: donec quando non est excusatio de eradicatione eius, tunc oportet quando cogitur infirmus eradicare ipsum, ut firmetur, et certificetur apud te dens dolens.	For the tooth does not yield easily when it is extracted; for the substance is delicate: until, when there is no excuse for extracting it, then you should extract it when it is weak, so that it may harden, and certify with you the complaining tooth.
Multotiens enim decipit infirmum dolor, et putat quia est in dente saha et eradicat ipsum: deinde non recedit dolor, donec eradicetur dens infirmus.	For often the pain deceives the weak one, and he supposes that the pain is in the tooth and extracts it himself: afterwards, the pain does not retreat until the weak tooth is extracted.
Nos enim iam uidimus illud ex operatione phlebotomatorum.	For we have already seen this from the operation of bloodletting.
Cum ergo certificatur apud te dens dolens ipsemet, tunc oportet ut scarifices in circumitu dentis cum spatumili, in quo sit quiddam uirtutis, donec soluatur gingiua ab omni parte: deinde moue ipsum digitis tuis, aut cum forcipibus subtilibus in primis paulatim, donec concutias ipsum.	When, therefore, the complaining tooth is certified with you, then it is necessary that you make a incision around the tooth with the scalpel, in which there is some of the power, until it is broken: then move it with your fingers, or with subtle forceps, little by little, until it is wriggling.
Deinde loca tunc in eo forcipes magnos locatione bona, et caput infirmi inter genua tua: quod iam bene tenuisti, ita quod non moueatur: deinde trahe dentem secundum rectitudinem, ut non frangas ipsum.	Then place there large knots on the spot in a good position, and the head of the wound between your knees: which you held firmly so that it did not wiggle: then draw out the tooth along its length, so as not to break it.
Si ergo non egreditur, tunc accipe aliquod illorum instrumentorum, et intromitte ipsum sub eo ab omni parte cum facilitate, et conare motionem eius, sicut fecisti in primis.	If, however, it does not come out, then take some of their instruments and push it under it from all sides with ease, and try to move it, as you did at first.
Si autem dens est perforatus, aut corrosus: tunc oportet ut impleas illud foramen panno: et stringas ipsum cum extremitate radii subtilis, ut non frangatur in hora constrictionis tuae super ipsum cum forcipibus.	If, however, the tooth is perforated or corroded: then it is necessary that you fill it with cloth: and tighten it with a slender hook, so that it does not break at the time of your constriction on top of it with the forceps.
Et oportet, ut exquisite agas cum scarificatione in circumitu gingiuae ab omni parte multum.	And you should, so to speak, do an incision around the gum with a lot of bleeding.
Et custodi fortitudinem tuam, ut non frangas ipsum, et remaneat pars eius, et redeat super infirmum ex ea malicia quae sit maior dolore eius primo.	And guard your strength so that you do not break it and a part of it remains, and returns to the weak one from the evil which causes it more pain at first.
Et caue, ne facias illud quod ignorantes faciunt phlebotomatores in festinatione sua, et audacia ipsorum super eradicationem eius, praeter quod administrent illud quod narrauimus.	And so, do not make that mistake which the phlebotomators make out of ignorance and their rashness in eradicating it, except that they administer to it what we have described.
Multotiens enim faciunt euenire super homines infirmitates magnas, quarum difficiliores sunt ut frangantur, et remaneant radices eius omnes, aut quaedam earum: aut ut extrahant ipsum cum quibusdam ossibus mandibulae: sicut testificati sumus multotiens illud.	For many times have we seen how great ailments they bring upon men, which are harder to break than they remain the roots of it all, or some of its parts: or as they take it out with some of the bones of the jaw: as we have often witnessed.
Deinde colluatur post eradicationem eius cum uino, aut cum aceto et sale.	Then they clean up after eradicating it with wine, or vinegar and salt.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis ex locis (multotiens enim accidit) tunc tere aliquid ex zegi, et imple cum eo locum: et si non, cauteriza ipsum si non confert tibi zegi.	That if it happens that a flow of blood comes from the places (for many times does happen) then mend some wound and fill it with it: and if not, cauterize it itself if not giving you a wound.
Formae forcipum subtilium quibus mouetur dens in primis, sint longarum extremitatum, breuis manubrii, grossi, ut non duplicentur quando cum eis premitur super dentem: sint sicut uides grossorum manubriorum, donec quando stringis cum eis, non dent seipsas, neque duplicentur: breuium extremitatum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut ex faled decenter facti, directarum extremitatum: et in eorum extremitatibus sint dentes, quorum quidam ingrediantur in quosdam, et stringant constrictione decenti, forti.	The shapes of the forceps are small at the ends which they move first, have long handles, thick, so that they do not double themselves when pressed upon a tooth: are as you see the thick handles of the forceps, until when you squeeze them with them, do not bite themselves, nor double themselves: the short ends, and are made of iron rod, or a split piece of wood, straight ends: and in their ends there are teeth, some of which enter into some things, and squeeze them tightly, surely.
Et quandoque fiunt extremitates sicut forma oris auis quae nominatur ciconia, et sunt fortis constrictionis.	And when they make the ends as the shape of the ear opening which is called the ciconia, and are strong constriction.
¶ De eradicatione Dentium, et extractione ossium mandibularum fractorum.	Of the eradicating of teeth and extracting of bones of the jaw fractures.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando remanet apud eradicationem Dentis qui frangitur aliquid, tunc oportet ut ponas super locum cotum cum butyro die uno, aut duobus diebus, donec mollificetur locus: deinde intromitte ad ipsum algasti, aut forcipes: quorum extremitates assimilantur ori auis quae nominatur ciconia.	When remains after the eradication of a tooth which is broken something, then you should put upon the place Cotum with butter one day, or two days, until it softens the place: and then introduce into it algast or forceps: of whose ends are shaped like the ear opening which is called ciconia.
Forma autem haec est forcipum.	The shape however of this forceps is.
Sint extremitates eorum factae sicut lima deintus: aut sicut aliskilfegi.	The extremities should be made round like a lemon: or like an egg.
Si ergo non obedit tibi ad exitum cum istis forcipibus, tunc oportet, ut caues super radicem, et detegas carnem totam, et intromittas instrumentum quod nominatur Palanca parua, cuius forma est haec.	If he does not obey you at the exit with these forceps, then it is necessary that you stop up the root, and scrape off all the flesh, and insert the instrument which is called a small spoon-shaped scissor, whose form is this.
Sit breuis extremitatis, grossae parumper: et non sit imbibitum, ut non frangatur.	The end should be short, somewhat longer: and it should not be soaked, lest it break.
Si ergo egreditur radix per illud, est bonum: et si non, iuuare oportet cum istis instrumentis aliis quorum formae sunt istae.	If then the root is gone out by that, it is good: and if not, it is necessary to move with these other instruments the forms of which are these.
Forma primi triangulatae extremitatis, in qua est quaedam grossitudo.	The form of the first extreme, in which there is some груssness.
Forma triangulatae extremitatis subtilis.	The triangular shape of the small extreme.
Etiam iuuatur cum hoc instrumento habente duos ramos, cuius haec est forma.	Also move with this instrument having two branches, whose form is this.
Et cum aliis instrumentis et ferramentis quae praecesserunt in rasione dentium.	And with the other instruments and tools which have preceded in the cutting of teeth.
Etiam sit iuuamentum cum hoc instrumento quod assimilatur uncino magno, huius formae, triangulatae extremitatis tortae, in qua est quiddam grossitudinis, ut non frangatur: et sit non imbibitum.	Also sit the clamping with this instrument which is similar to a large hook, of this form, triangular extreme torted, in which there is some груssness, so that it does not break: and it should not be soaked.
Et scias, quod instrumenta dentium sunt multa: et similiter reliqua instrumenta non computantur, et artifex prudens, subtilis in arte sua inuenit per se ipsum instrumentum, secundum quod significant ei operatio et aegritudines ipsae.	And you should know that there are many instruments for teeth: and likewise the other instruments do not count, and the prudent artist finds his own instrument, according to which serves him operation and the diseases themselves.
Quoniam ex agritudinibus sunt ad quas non dixerunt antiqui instrumentum, propter diuersitatem specierum earum.	Because from the diseases there are those for which the ancient instrument did not speak, because of the diversity of their forms.
Si autem frangatur os ex mandibula, aut ex aliis ossibus oris, aut putrefit: tunc perscrutare super ipsum in loco suo cum eo quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis et forcipibus quae dixi in extractione radicum, et iuuare cum gesti, cuius forma est haec.	If then the jaw is broken from the mandible, or from other bones of the mouth, or putrid: then examine on top of it in its own place with what belongs to him from instruments and forceps which I spoke in extracting the root, and move with the gesture, whose form is this.
Sit in eo quiddam grossitudinis paulatim, ut stringatur, uel teneatur cum eo os, et non fugiat et uadat, donec egrediatur os: et restaura locum cum medicinis conuenientibus ad illud.	It is sat there some gruesomeness gradually, so that it is tight, or hold with it the jaw, and does not flee and move, until the exit of the jaw: and restore place with medicines fitting for it.
Si autem in osse est putredo parua, tunc rade ipsum a putredine sua, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	If there is pus in bone then it should be carved away from its own pus and cured until healed.
De serratura Dentium eminentium super alios.	Of the excellent locking of teeth on others.
Caput XXXII.	Head 32.
Quando Dentes eminent non secundum cursum suum naturalem, foeda fit per illud forma: et praecipue quando accidit illud in mulieribus, et puellis, scilicet uenalibus.	When the teeth are not in their proper position, i.e., when they do not grow in a natural way, they become pus-filled through the shape of the jaw; and this especially happens with women and girls, i.e., those who are still growing.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore you should consider.
Nam si dens est natus post dentem alium, et non locatur, uel est possibilis eius serratura, neque limatura ipsius: tunc eradica ipsum: et si est annexus cum dente alio, tunc incide ipsum cum isto instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	For if one tooth has come up after another and does not fit, nor can its locking be done, then eradicate it; and if it is joined with another tooth, then cut it out with this instrument, the shape of which is as follows.
Est simile rostro paruo, et fit ex ferro indo, acutae extremitatis ualde.	It is similar in shape to a small chisel, and is made of iron, and has a sharp point.
Et sit incisio tua qua ipsum incidis in diebus multis, et propter duriciem dentis, et ut non commoueatur alius ex dentibus.	And let your cut be deep, and for the hardness of the tooth, and so that it does not displace any other teeth.
Si autem est eminens expositus limaturae suae: tunc lima ipsum cum lima ex indo, cuius forma est haec.	But if it is exposed and its filing is worn out, then file it with a sharp chisel made of iron; the shape of which is as follows.
Sit totum ex indo, et manubrium eius minutorum punctorum ualdae, sicut lima cum qua fiunt acus: cum quo limetur dens paulatim in diebus multis cum facilitate, ut non commoueatur dens, et cadat: deinde leni ipsum, in fine rade ipsum cum quibusdam rasoriis.	It should all be of iron, and the handle of its minute pointed tip should be like a chisel with which akos are made; with this file the tooth is gradually filed away over many days with ease, so that no other teeth are disturbed and it falls out: then make the tooth smooth by carving it with some rasps.
Quod si est dens, ex quo frangatur pars, et laedit linguam: tunc oportet ut limes eum etiam, donec auferatur asperitas illius fractionis, et aequetur: et applanetur, et non laedat linguam, neque corrumpat sermonem.	If a tooth breaks off and hurts the tongue, then it should be filed as well until its roughness is gone, and made smooth; and if it presses on the tongue, or disturbs the speech, then make it smooth without pressing it.
¶ De retatione Dentium cum filis auri.	Of retaining teeth with gold fillings.
Caput XXXIII.	Head 33.
Quando accidit Dentibus anterioribus concussio et commotio a percussione, aut casu: et non potest infirmus stringere super illud quod comedit ut non cadat: et curasti eos cum medicinis stipticis, et non ualuit curatio: tunc ingenium in eis est, ut stringantur cum filo auri: quoniam argentum fit uiride, et putrefit post dies: sed aurum nunquam mutatur.	When the anterior teeth are injured and shaken by a blow, or fall, and cannot be held firm so as not to fall out: and they have been treated with stinging medicines, and the treatment does not help: then let there be a design in them to be tied with gold wire; for gold changes color, and spoils after a while; but gold never changes.
Et sit filum medium in subtilitate et grossicie secundum quantitatem quod capiat inter Dentes.	And let there be a thread of middle thickness between subtility and coarseness according to the quantity that it takes between teeth.
Et forma quidem retationis est, ut accipias filum, et intromittas duplum eius inter duos dentes sanos: deinde texeas cum duabus extremitatibus fili inter dentes motos, siue unus sit, aut plures, donec peruenias cum tela usque ad dentem sanum alterius partis.	And the shape of retention is that you take a thread and insert it between two healthy teeth: then you tie it with both ends between the teeth, or one end, or more, until you reach the dental nerve until you hit it with a needle until you reach the healthy side's nerve.
Deinde itera texturam usque ad partem a qua incaepisti: et stringe manum tuam cum subtilitate et sapientia, donec non remoueatur prorsus: et sit constrictio tua qua stringis filum, apud radices dentium, ut non euadat.	Then repeat the texture until you reach the side from which you started: and tighten your hand with subtlety and wisdom, until it does not move completely: and let your constriction be where you tighten the thread, near the roots of the teeth, so that it does not break.
Deinde incide extremitates fili superfluentes cum forficibus: et aggrega utrumque, et conuerte eas cum gesti: et occulta ipsas inter dentem sanum et dentem motum, ut non laedat linguam: deinde dimittatur ita strictum dum remanet.	Then cut the ends of the thread that are excessive with scissors: and gather both together, and twist them together, and conceal them between a healthy tooth and a teeth-motus tooth so that they don't hurt the tongue: then let go, so that it is tight when left alone.
Si autem soluitur, aut inciditur, stringe eos cum filo alio, et stabit cum eo taliter tempore toto.	If it becomes loose or breaks, tighten them with another thread and keep it in place for a long time.
Et haec est forma Dentium, et figura retationis duorum dentium sanorum, et duorum dentium motorum, sicut uides.	And this is the shape of the teeth, and the figure of retention of two healthy teeth and two teeth-motus as you see them.
Et quandoque fit, ut redeat dens unus, aut duo post casum urriusque in locis suis, et retentur sicut narrauimus, et remaneant: et non facit illud nisi artifex, prudens, et expertus.	And sometimes a tooth falls out, or two teeth after the decay and rust in their places, and remain in place as we have described, and does not make it except for an artisan who is careful, wise, and experienced.
Et quandoque aptatur aliquod ex ossibus uaccinis: et fit ex eo sicut forma dentis, et ponitur in loco, ex quo munitur dens et stringitur, sicut diximus: et remanet, et seruitur cum eo tempore longo.	And sometimes a bone breaks, and becomes the shape of a tooth, and is placed in its place, from which it holds firm a tooth, and tightens it like we said, and remains with it for a long time.
¶ De incisione ligamenti quod accidit sub lingua, et prohibet loquelam.	Regarding the cutting of the tongue's ligament that happens under the tongue, and prevents one from speaking.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter 34.
Quandoque ligamentum hoc quod accidit sub lingua, est aut naturale, cum quo nascitur homo, aut accidentale, a uulnere quod iam consolidatum est.	And sometimes the ligament that happens under the tongue is either natural, with which a person is born, or accidental, from an arrow that has already healed.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi in capite eius in sinu tuo, et eleua linguam eius: deinde incide illud ligamentum neruosum per latitudinem, donec soluatur lingua a retentione sua.	And the operation is, so that you open his mouth in his head in your bosom, and relieve his tongue; and then cut that ligament that nervously through its width, until his tongue is released from its hold.
Quod si in eo fuerit quiddam duriciei et nodationis, et fuerit illud ex consolidatione uulneris: tunc proiice in illud uncinum, et finde illud per latitudinem, donec incidas ligamentum, et soluatur nodatio.	If there is anything of hardness and swelling, and it is from the union of a wound; then throw into it a hook, and finish it through its width, until you cut the ligament, and the swelling is released.
Et caue, ne sit fissura in profundo carnis, et incidas arteriam illic, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And cause not to be a breach in the depth of the flesh, and cut there an artery, so that blood flows out.
Deinde colluatur in uestigio incisionis cum aqua rosata, aut cum aceto, aut aqua frigida.	Then moisten in the shadow of the incision with rosin water, or vinegar, or cold water.
Deinde pone sub lingua licinium ex lino, quod teneat infirmus in omni nocte: ut non consolidetur secundo.	Then put under the tongue a piece of linen that holds the weak one all night, so that it does not harden again.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc pone super locum zegi tritum.	But if there is any flow of blood, then put on the spot a lump of earth.
Si uero uincit te sanguis, tunc cauteriza locum cum cauterio lentiginoso, quod conuenit ad illud: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	But if you are pricked by blood, then cauterize the spot with a piece of dried cow manure that comes to it: and then take care for yourself with the rest of the cure, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Ranulae quae fit sub lingua.	Regarding the extraction of a wound that is under the tongue.
Caput XXXV.	Head XXXV.
Quandoque accidit sub lingua apostema quod assimilatur Ranae paruae, prohibens linguam ab operatione sua naturali: et fortasse magnificatur adeo, donec implet os.	When there is a small sore under the tongue that absorbs the little frog, prevents the natural movement of the tongue: and perhaps it grows so much, until the bone is filled.
Et operatio in eo est, ut aperias os infirmi coram sole: et considera apostema.	And the operation is, so that you open the closed mouth from the sun: and consider the sore.
Si ergo uides ipsum fusci coloris, aut nigri, durum, cui non inuenit infirmus sensum: tunc non tangas ipsum, quoniam est cancer.	But if you see that the color of it is dark or black, and hard, to which the sick person does not have a sense of touch; then do not touch it, for it is cancer.
Et si est decliue ad albedinem, in quo est humiditas, tunc proiice in ipsum uncinum, et incide ipsum cum spatumili subtili, et libera ipsum ab omni parte.	And if it declines to whiteness, in which is moisture, then throw into it a hook, and cut it with a fine scythe, and free it from every part.
Quod si uincit te sanguis in hora tuae operationis, tunc pone super ipsum zegi tritum, donec abscindatur sanguis: deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec extrahas ipsum cum complemento eius.	If your blood pricks you during the hour of your operation, then put on the spot a lump of earth until the blood is separated: and then return to your operation, until it is extracted with its complement.
Deinde colluatur cum aceto et sale: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then cover with vinegar and salt: and treat him with the appropriate cure for that, until he is healed.
¶ De curatione apostematis duarum Amigdalarum.	In the treatment of boils, two walnuts should be used.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI. On the Treatment of Wounds and Ulcers.
Quandoque accidunt inter guttur godad, id est, glandulae, quae similantur algodad, quae accidunt deforis: et nominantur duae Amigdalae: quas quando curas cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non sanantur, tunc considera.	When, however, the wound is between the mouth and the tonsils, that is to say, the glands which resemble azalea and occur on the sides; they are called two walnuts: when you treat them with the cure mentioned in the division, and they do not heal, then consider carefully.
Si ergo est apostema durum, fusci coloris, pauci sensus: tunc non tangas ipsum cum ferro.	If, however, the boil is hard, of a fusty colour, with little sensation; then do not touch the boil with the iron.
Et si est rubei coloris, et radix eius est grossa: tunc non tangas ipsum etiam cum ferro, timens fluxum sanguinis, imo dimitte ipsum, donec maturetur.	And if its colour is ruddy and its root is thick: then do not touch the boil with the iron, fearing a flow of blood, but leave it, until it boils dry.
Et tunc aut perforabis ipsum: aut rumpetur per se.	And then you shall either pierce it, or let it burst by itself.
Et si est albi coloris, rotundum, et est radix eius subtilis: tunc oportet ipsum incidi.	And if its colour is white and round, and the root is fine: then the boil should be pricked.
Et operatio in ipso est, ut consideres ante operationem suam, si quieuit apostema eius calidum quiete completum, aut imminuitur quadam diminutione: tunc ergo fac sedere infirmum coram sole, et caput eius sit in sinu tuo: et aperi os eius, et accipiat seruiens inter manus suas, et premat linguam eius inferius cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma.	And the operation upon it is such that, before you perform the operation, if the boil has become warm and quiet and has completed its healing, or is about to diminish in any way: then cause the sick person to sit in front of the sun, and place his head in your lap; and open his mouth, and let him take hold between his hands, and press his tongue with an instrument of this shape.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere, quod sit subtile sicut cultellus.	Let it be made of silver, or of brass, that it may be as sharp as a knife.
Cum ergo premis cum eo linguam, et ostenditur tibi apostema, et cadit super ipsum uisus tuus: tunc accipe uncinum, et fige ipsum in amigdalam, et extrahe eam ad exteriora quantum potes, praeter quod trahas cum ea aliquid ex tunicis.	When you press it with the instrument on the boil and see it swell your skin: then take hold of a hook, and fasten it in the walnut, and pull out as much as you can, taking off at the same time some of the skin.
Deinde incide eam cum instrumento, cuius haec est forma quae sequitur.	Then cut it with an instrument which has this shape.
Assimilatur forficibus: uerumtamen extremitates eius sint curuatae, ita quod orificium cuiusque earum est in directo alterius acute: unde cura ut sit ex ferro indo, aut alfuled imbibitum.	It is to be joined together by a hook; and yet its extremities are so curled up that the opening of each of them is in the acute angle of the other: therefore the cure should be that it be made of iron, or of a metal which absorbs.
Si autem non est praesens hoc instrumentum, tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili, cuius haec est forma.	If this instrument is not present, then cut it with a chisel, which has this shape.
Sit acutum a parte una, non acutum a parte altera.	This instrument should be sharp on one side but not the other.
Et postquam incidis amigdalam unam, incide alteram secundum hanc eandem speciem incisionis.	And after you have cut one side of the jaw, cut the other side according to the same shape of the incision.
Deinde post incisionem gargarizet infirmus cum aqua frigida, aut cum aceto et aqua.	Then, after the incision, the patient should gargle with cold water or with vinegar and water.
Si autem accidat ei fluxus sanguinis, gargarizet cum aqua in qua bulliti sunt cortices granatorum: aut folia myrti, et similia illis ex stipticis, donec abscindatur fluxus sanguinis: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	But if there is a flow of blood, gargle with water in which the bark of the willows has been boiled: or with leaves of myrtle and similar things from astringents, until the flow of blood stops: and then care for the wound, until it heals.
Et quandoque nascuntur in gutture apostemata alia, praeter amigdalas duas.	And when there are other pustules in the throat, except for two in the amygdalis.
Incide ergo ea secundum quod dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum aequaliter.	Then cut these according to what I said in the incision of the two amygdalas.
Et ego quidem iam medicatus fui mulierem ex apostemate, quod natum erat inter guttur eius, quod trahebat ad fuscedinem, pauci sensus, quod iam fere clauserat guttur: et mulier respirabat a meatu stricto, et iam prohibuerat ei comestionem, et potum aquae: et iam peruenerat ad mortem, si remansisset uno die, aut duobus diebus.	And I have already treated a woman with an abscess between her teeth, which was causing her pain and loss of taste, which had almost closed her throat: and this woman breathed through a narrowed airway, and had already lost her appetite, and could not drink water, and was approaching death if it continued for another day or two.
Et apostema tantum ascenderat, quod emiserat duos ramos, donec exierant super duo foramina nasi.	And the abscess rose just enough to break through the two branches of the nose.
Properaui ergo festinanter, et fixi in unum eorum uncinum.	So I hurried and fixed one of my scissors in one of the openings.
Deinde traxi ipsum, et tracta ex eo est portio magna.	Then I pulled it out, and a large piece came with it.
Deinde abscidi eam, ubi comprehendi ex foramine nasi.	Then I cut it off where it emerged from the nasal opening.
Deinde feci illud ei quod processit ex foramine nasi altero.	Then I made the same thing go forward from the other nasal opening.
Deinde aperui os eius, et pressi linguam eius: et postea fixi uncinum in ipsum apostema: deinde abscidi ex eo partem eius, et non cucurrit ex eo nisi sanguis paucus: absolutum est ergo guttur mulieris, et incepit statim bibere aquam, deinde accepit ex cibo.	Then I opened her mouth and pressed on her tongue; and then I fixed my scissor in the abscess; and then I cut off a part of it, and there was not much blood coming out of it: so the woman's throat is completely blocked, and she immediately started drinking water again, and then she began to eat.
Non ergo cessaui incidere ex illo apostemate multotiens tempore longo: et apostema succedebat loco eius quod incidebam, donec prolongatum est nimis et cum ea illud.	I therefore did not stop pressing on that for a long time often: and the scar which I pressed on succeeded to the place of that which I pressed on until it was prolonged too much and with that one.
Ingeniaui ergo, et cauterizaui apostema inter guttur.	I therefore did not stop pressing on that for a long time often: and the scar which I pressed on succeeded to the place of that which I pressed on until it was prolonged too much and
Stetit ergo ab additione: deinde ambulaui a parte, et non sciui quid fecit Deus cum ea post me.	So then I did not stop from that addition: and then I walked away from the part, and I do not know what God did with that after me.
¶ De incisione apostematis uuulae.	Regarding the incision of scars on the throat.
Caput XXXVII.	Chapter 37. On the incisions of scars on the throat
Quando descendit catarrus ad uuulam, et apostematur, et est long: tunc ipsa nominatur perpendicularis: et si est in inferiori parte grossa, rotunda, tunc ipsa nominatur uua.	When a catarrh descends to the voice-box, and is scarred, and is long: then it is called a perpendicular; and if it is in the lower part thick, round, then it is called a vocal cord.
Quando curatur cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio: et uides quod apostema calidum quieuit ab ea, et est subtilis: tunc oportet ut incidas eam.	When you treat it along with that which we mentioned in the division, and does not bring about the treatment: and you will see that the scar has become cool from it, and is thin: then you should press on it.
Et quae ex ea est aggregata rotunda, et non est ei longitudo, et est sanguinea, aut fusci coloris, aut nigri, et non est ei sensus: tunc oportet ut deuites incisionem eius.	And what is joined on to that which has become round, and has no length in it, and is bloody or dark-colored or black, and has no sensation: then you should remove the scar from it.
In ea enim est timor super infirmum.	For fear is in the scar over the disease.
Oportet ergo quando uides eam secundum modum quem dixi ex albedine, et longitudine sua, ut facias sedere infirmum coram sole: et premas linguam eius cum instrumento, cuius praecessit narratio: deinde fige uncinum in uuam, et trahe eam inferius: et incide eam cum uno duorum instrumentorum quae dixi in incisione duarum amigdalarum.	Then you should, when you see it according to the way which I mentioned from whiteness, and according to its length, so that you set the sick person before the sun: and press his tongue with an instrument, of which the preceding story has been told: then fasten a hook in the throat, and pull it down: and cut it with one or two instruments which I mentioned in cutting between the two ears.
Et oportet ut non incidas ex ea, nisi illud quod additur super naturalem terminum sine additione.	And you should not press on it, unless that is added to the natural term without adding to it.
Nam si tu incidis ex ea plus, laedes uocem et sermonem.	For if you press on it any more, you will damage speech and conversation.
Deinde post incisionem utere eo quod narrauimus in incisione duarum amigdalarum: et cura eam, donec sanetur.	Then after the incision use what we mentioned in the incision of the two ears: and care for it, until it heals.
Si autem terretur infirmus ab incisione: tunc oportet ut utaris ingenio in cauterizatione eius absque timore et pauore.	If however he trembles with fear at the incision: then it is right that you should act with courage and without fear or anxiety during the cauterization.
Et modus cauterii in ea non est, nisi cum aqua acuta: et est, ut ponas caput infirmi in sinu tuo.	And the mode of cauterization in it is not, except with sharp water: and it is, that you put the head of the patient in your lap.
Deinde preme linguam eius cum instrumento quod diximus.	Then press his tongue with the instrument which we have said.
Deinde accipe ex aqua quam dixi tibi in capitulo cauterizandi, et confice cum ea calcem non extinctam, et pone eam non spissam, neque subtilem, et imple ex ea concauitatem huius instrumenti, cuius haec est forma.	Then take from the water which I have told you to take in the chapter on cauterizing, and moisten it with this fire not extinguished, and place it not thick, nor thin, and fill it with this shape of the instrument.
Sit extremitati eius in qua ponitur medicina concauitas, sicut concauitas cochlearis radii.	Sit at the end of which the medicine is placed, congealed, as congealed is the ear of a ray.
Et pone instrumentum cum medicina super uuulam ipsam: et infirmus sit iacens super latus suum, ut currat saliua ex ore eius ex intrinseca medicina, ut non descendat ex ea ad guttur ipsius aliquid, et laedat ipsum.	And place the instrument with the medicine on a bandage: and let the patient lie on his side, so that the saliva may flow from his mouth from the interior medicine, so as not to fall from it into his throat anything, and may hurt him.
Deinde tene manum tuam cum medicina.	Then hold your hand with the medicine.
Et tu ex primas eam super uuulam quantitate medietatis horae, donec uideas eam iam denigratam, et sedatam mordicationem medicinae.	And you from the first put on a bandage half the quantity of the medicine every hour, until you see it has become discolored, and sit at rest with the Mordication of the medicine.
Et si uis ut accipias cotum, et inuoluas ipsum super extremitatem radii, et infundas cotum cum medicina, et intromittas radium cum coto in cannulam desuper, donec adhaereat cotum super uuulam.	And if you wish to take a bath, and wet him on the end of a ray, and dip the cloth with the medicine, and insert the ray with the cloth into a tube from above, until the cloth sticks to the bandage.
Fac illud multotiens, donec consequaris quod uis de cauterizatione uuae.	Make it many times, until you get the result that you want of the new cauterization.
Deinde dimitte eam: ipsa namque arescit et cadit post tres dies, aut quatuor.	Then dismiss him: for he will be healed and will fall after three days, or four.
Quod si indiges ut iteres medicinam, itera ipsam: et post cauterizationem absterge in circumitu uuae cum coto imbibito in butyro, et mundifica cum eo quod est in circumitu eius ex medicina: et colluatur cum aqua frigida.	That if you wish to take a bath with the medicine, repeat it: and after the cauterization wash off in the new circumcision with a cloth dipped in butter, and clean up with it what is in the circumcision of him from the medicine: and cool down with cold water.
Et curetur extrinsecus cum embrocis, et deintus cum gargarismis, donec sanetur.	He should be treated from the outside with poultices and from within with gargling until he is well.
Haec ergo species curationis est salubrior incisione et longinquior a timore.	This therefore is the species of treatment that is more salutary than incising and less anxious about fear.
Et quandoque curatur uuula etiam cum eo quod est subtilius quam cauterium et incisio: curatur enim cum suffumigatione, secundum hunc modum.	And sometimes also with him cure is to be done that is finer than cautery and incision: cure is to be done indeed with suffumigations, in this way.
Sume calamentum, et hyssopum, et origanum, et rutam, et sseah, et chamomillam, et abrotanum, et similia eis ex herbis: et aggrega ea omnia, aut quaedam eorum in olla, et submergantur cum aceto, et bulliant: et olla sit lutata cum luto decenter: et sit in medio ollae foramen, super quod componatur instrumentum concauum secundum hunc modum.	Take also hemlock and hyssop and oregano and rue and sseah and chamomile and abrotan and other such herbs; and put them all together in an olla or some such vessel, and pour over them with vinegar and make it boil: and let the olla be well covered with a lid: and let there be a hole in the middle of the lid above which put a sharp instrument, according to this mode.
Fiat ex argento, aut aere: et intromittatur extremitas, in qua est granatum, in os infirmi, donec ascendat uapor ad uuulam super cannulam, donec obscuretur uuula multum.	Let it be made of silver or of brass: and let the end, in which is the granule, be put into the nose, until the vapor ascends to the hole, until it is much darkened.
Deinde itera super ipsam multotiens, donec arescat.	Then do this often, until it has healed.
Et caue, ne facias hanc curationem in principio aduentus apostematis.	And beware, do not make this cure at the first approach of apoplexy.
Plaerumque enim addit in apostemate: et non oportet ut facias illud nisi apud declinationem apostematis eius calidi.	Indeed it adds something to apoplexy: and you should not make this cure except when the aposteme is declining from its heat.
Si autem non est praesens tibi hoc instrumentum, tunc accipe cannam, et compone in extremitate eius corticem oui: ut non comburatur os infirmi: quoniam cortex oui prohibet uaporem comburere os: et haec est ex bona curatione cum salute.	But if you do not have this instrument with you, then take a pipe and fit it with a plug of wood at the end, so that it may not burn the nose: for the wood prevents the vapor from burning the nose; and this is good cure with safety.
¶ De extractione spinarum, et ossium de gula.	Of the extraction of spine and of the teeth in the throat.
Caput XXXVIII.	Chapter 38. On the extraction of spines and teeth from the
Multotiens adhaeret in gutture os, aut spina piscis, aut aliud.	A long time in the throat held fast a tooth or some spine, or something else.
Oportet ergo ut extrahas quod ex eis est apparens super quod cadit uisus, postquam premis linguam cum instrumento apud solem, et declaratur tibi quod est in gutture.	Then it is necessary that you extract what lies visible upon that which makes the yawning, after you have pressed the tongue with an instrument against the sun, and have shown it to yourself.
Et quod non apparet tibi et occultatur in gutture, oportet ut facias uomere infirmum antequam digeratur cibus in stomacho.	And what does not appear to you and is hidden in the throat, you should make the sick man die before food digested in the stomach.
Fortasse enim egredietur res annexa per uomitum.	For perhaps it would come out through the dung.
Aut deglutiat infirmus frustum napi, aut radicem lactucae, aut deglutiat buccellam panis sicci: aut accipiat frustum spongiae marinae siccae lenis: et liga ipsum in filo, deinde deglutiat ipsum.	Or perhaps the sick man would swallow a bit of straw, or a radish leaf, or swallow dry bread; or he might take a bit of dried sea sponge; and he should bind it with a string, then he should swallow it.
Cum ergo peruenit ad locum ubi sunt spinae, aut os, et extrahitur, tunc egreditur.	But when it has come to the place where there are spines or teeth, and is taken out, then it comes out. Et si peruenit ad locum ubi est lacta cum radice, tunc deglutitur lacta cum radice: aut si peruenit ad locum ub
Si ergo non egreditur cum eo quod diximus: tunc utere instrumento ex plumbo secundum hanc formam.	If it does not come out with it that we have said: then you should use an instrument made of lead in this form.Et si neque id egreditur, sed manet in ventre sicut aqua, et non esset quod illum afferri possint uti instrumento ex
Sit grossius quam Radius parumper, et in extremitate eius sit curuitas, quam intromittat in guttur suum cum facilitate: et ipse habeat caput suum eleuatum sursum.	If it is not brought out, but remains in the stomach like water, and there is nothing that they can bring to him to use the instrument: then he should have his head raised up.
Et caueat a tactu suae epiglotis, ut non accidat ei tussis, et impellat cum eo os, aut spinam, aut intromittat ipsum medicus manu sua.	And let him keep his throat from touching his epiglottis so that he does not cough, and push with it a tooth, or spike, or insert the doctor's own hand.Et si non esset uti huius instrumenti, sed uti aliis instrumentis, quae cuncta sunt in hoc liber
Verum quod infirmus intromittat, hoc est melius: propter scientiam suam de loco rei annexae: et impellat inferius, aut trahat manum suam cum instrumento sursum, totum illud secundum quantitatem quae praeparatur ei, donec egrediatur.	But since the sick man is pushing down, or pulling up his hand with the instrument, all of this according to the quantity that has been prepared for him, until it comes out.
¶ De extractione Sanguisugae.	Now we come to the extraction of blood from a patient.
Caput XXXIX.	Chapter 39.
Quando medicatur sanguisuga cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex curatione cum medicinis, et non confert, tunc considera in gutture infirmi coram sole, siue apud solem postquam premis linguam eius cum instrumento quod narraui tibi.	When the leech is given to him with that which I have said in the division of cure with medicamentorum, and does not work, then consider in the throat before the sun, or after the sun when you press his tongue with the instrument that I have told you.Et si non esset, cum id quod diximus ad effectum veniens, sed non veniet, tunc
Si ergo cadit uisus tuus super sanguisugam, extrahe eam cum uncino paruo, aut cum gesti subtilibus decenter.	If your yawn falls on the leech, remove it with a small hook, or with subtle gestures that are not seen.Et si neque non esset id quod diximus, sed illud cadere perculsat prope locum ubi est radice sicut radicem heraeae: tunc uis sursum trahat cum
Quod si non est possibile cum eis: tunc accipe cannulam concauam, et intromitte eam in guttur infirmi usque prope guttur: deinde intromitte in concauitatem cannulae ferrum ignitum cum igne.	If it is not possible to do so with them: then take a hollow tube and insert it into the throat of the patient until near the throat: and then insert into the hollow part of the tube an iron rod that has been heated with fire.
Fac illud multotiens: et abstineat infirmus ab aqua tota die.	Do this many times: and let the sick person refrain from all water for a day.
Deinde accipiat uitreatam plenam aqua frigida, et aperiat os eius in ea: et colluat os suum cum ea, et non deglutiat ex ea aliquid: et moueat aquam una hora post aliam cum manu sua.	Then let him take a full drink of cold water, and open his mouth in it: and let him kiss the water with his mouth, and let him not swallow anything from it: and let him moisten his hand in the water for an hour after another.
Sanguisuga enim ilico cum sentit aquam cadit.	For a leech will immediately fall when he feels the water.
Si autem non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc suffumiga infirmum cum cimicibus, aut cum asa cum instrumento quod narraui in suffumigatione uuulae.	But if he does not emerge with it when we have described it, then let him inhale the sick person with fumes, or with a pipe that we use to inhale the smoke.
Fac illud multotiens, quoniam ipsa cadet.	Do this many times, for she will fall herself.
Et modus operationis in suffumigatione est, ut accipias ollam, in qua sint prunae uiuae cum igne: et olla sit cooperta cum coopertorio, in cuius medio sit foramen: et componatur in illo foramine extremitas instrumenti.	And the method of operation in inhalation is that you take a bowl, in which are placed with fire the blades of a grater: and the bowl is covered with a cover, in whose middle there is an opening: and place the end of the instrument in it.
Deinde proiice suffumigationem, et ponat infirmus os suum in extremitate cannulae, et claudat os suum, ut non egrediatur suffumigatio, donec scias quod suffumigatio iam peruenit ad sanguisugam.	Then throw the inhalation and let the sick person put his mouth at the end of the tube, and let him close his mouth so that it does not exit the inhalation until you know that the inhalation has reached the leech.
Nam sanguisuga statim cadet.	For the leech will fall immediately.
Quod si non cadit, tunc itera suffumigationem multotiens.	If it does not fall, then repeat the inhalation many times.
Et toleret infirmus sitim, et comedat salsa, et allia, et non bibat aquam.	And let the sick person endure hunger, and eat meat, and other things, and do not drink water.
Necesse est ergo ut egrediatur cum hoc regimine.	Therefore it is necessary that he should emerge with this regimen.
Et haec est forma instrumenti cum quo extrahitur sanguisuga ex gutture, quando cadit super ipsam uisus.	And this is the form of the instrument from which the leech is extracted from the throat when it falls on it.
Est simile forcipibus, sicut uides: nisi quia est ei haee curuitas quae intromittitur ad guttur.	It is similar to a pair of forceps, as you see: but because it has a width that enters into the throat.
Et extremitas eius similis ori auis quae nominatur ciconia, in quo est asperitas limae: quando comprehendit aliquid, non dimittit ipsum omnino.	And its end is similar to an ear, which is called a ciconia, in which is a roughness of the blade: and when it grasps anything, it does not let go at all.
¶ De apertione Apostematum, et eorum sectione, et cura in genere.	On the opening and cutting of abscesses, and on their general treatment.
Caput XL.	Chapter X. On the opening and cutting of abscesses,
Apostematum species sunt multae, multorum modorum, secundum quod uenit rememoratio eorum, scilicet unius, et unius in hoc libro: et sunt diuersae in perforatione eorum, et sectione ipsorum ex duobus modis.	There are many types of abscesses and many ways of remembering them, as there is only one chapter on this matter in this book, and they vary in their perforation and the cutting out of their contents from two aspects.
Quorum unus est ex specie apostematis in seipso, et eo quod comprehendit ex humiditatibus.	Of which one species of abscess is in itself, and because it comprises fluid substances.
Et modus secundus est propter loca, in quibus accidit ex corpore.	And the second mode is due to the locations from which they occur in the body.
Quoniam apostema accidens in capite, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in ano: et apostema accidens in loco carnoso, est aliud ab apostemate accidente in iuncturis: et unicuique eorum est iudicium suum ex operatione.	For an abscess occurs in the head, it is different from an abscess that occurs in the anus: and an abscess occurs in a fleshy part, it is different from an abscess that occurs at a joint; and each has its own decision according to the operation.
Et ex apostematibus sunt quae non oportet ut perforentur, nisi post maturationem saniei in eis, et complementum eius: et ex eis sunt, quae oportet ut perforentur, dum sunt cruda, et non maturantur secundum complementum.	And of the abscesses there are some that should not be opened until after the blood has been congealed in them and the clot is complete; and of them it is necessary to open those that are raw and have not come to maturity according to the complement.
Sicut apostemata quae sunt propinqua iuncturis.	As for abscesses that are close to joints.
Quoniam apostema quando accidit prope iuncturam, et prolongatur esse eius, donec putrefit quod est in circumitu eius fortasse corrumpuntur ligamenta, aut nerui illius iuncturae: quare est caussa propior contractionis illius membri.	For when an abscess occurs near a joint and it is prolonged until the pus that is in its vicinity may have rotted the ligaments or nerves of that joint; therefore, there is a closer cause of the spasm of that member.
Aut est apostema apud membrum principale: quoniam si tu tardas perforationem eius, donec maturetur, nocebit uel illi, uel per illud membro principali.	Or an abscess at a main member; for if you delay opening it until it is complete, it will damage that member or harm another main member through it.
Aut est prope anum, perfora ergo ipsum immaturum: et non oportet, ut perfores, apostema crudum, non completae digestionis, nisi quod est prope anum, ut non putrefiat profundum, et longetur ad interiora ani, et fiat fistula, aut fiat in termino eius quod non sanatur.	Or near a limb, then open it when it is immature: and you should not open an raw abscess that has not been completely digested, unless it is near a limb, so as not to rot deeply, and prolong its course towards the inside of the loin, and become a fistula, or remain at its edge where it does not heal.
Oportet ut scias horam perforationis apostematis, quod maturatum est secundum complementum: et est apud sedationem doloris, recessionem febris, et diminutionem rubedinis, et pulsationis, et acuitatem capitis apostematis: et reliqua signa.	It is necessary that you know the time for opening an abscess, which has come to maturity according to the complement; and it is in the repose of pain, the abatement of fever, the lessening of redness, and pulsation, and the sharpness of head from abscess: and the other signs.
Et oportet, ut facias eandem perforationem in inferiori loco apostematis, et uehementioris eminentiae: et sit perforatio uadens in longitudine corporis, si apostemata sunt in partibus manuum et pedum, et locis lacertorum, et chordarum, et neruorum, et arteriarum, et ad ultimum in omnibus locis aequalibus, quibus non est reflexio.	It is necessary that you make the same perforation in the lower place of the fistula, and more prominent: and let the perforation be wet along the length of the body, if the fistulas are in the parts of the hands and feet, and in the places of the lizards, and of the strings, and of the nerves, and of the arteries, and up to the last place in all places equally, where there is no reflection.
In illis autem quae reflectuntur, uade cum perforatione secundum illud membrum.	But those which reflect, go with the perforation according to that member.
Quando uero apostema est in locis carnosis: tunc melius est ut dimittas perforationem eius, donec confirmetur eius digestio, sicut diximus secundum complementum.	But when the fistula is in fleshy places: then it is better to leave the perforation of it until its digestion is confirmed, as we have said according to the complement.
Quoniam si tu perforas ipsum ante illud, prolongatur cursus uirus ex eo, et est multae sordis et sordiciei, et fortasse indurantur labia eius, et profunditas eius.	For if you pierce it before that, the course of the virus from it will be prolonged, and there will be much sickness and decay, and perhaps its lips will become thicker, and its depth.
Et quaedam apostemata perforantur secundum latitudinem corporis apud necessitatem: aut secundum illud quo indiget membrum.	And some fistulas are pierced according to the width of the body at necessity: or according to that by which the member is stretched.
Et oportet, ut administres in apostematibus paruis perforationem paruam, et in apostematibus magnis perforationem amplam: aut sectiones multas per similitudinem magnitudinis apostematis.	And it is necessary that you administer a small perforation in small fistulas, and a wide perforation in large fistulas: or several sections according to the similarity of the size of the fistula.
Et sunt ex apostematibus, in quibus oportet ut concauetur cutis: et incidatur quando iam facta est sicut pannus, et facta est in termino, quod iam mortua est: sicut illud quod accidit in multis, ut dubelet, et bubonibus.	And there are fistulas from which the skin should be tightened: and it happens when it has already been made like a piece of cloth, and has already reached its limit, that it is already dead: like that which happened to many, as a blister, and as boils.
Et ex eis sunt quae secantur sectione habente tres angulos.	And there are those which cut by section with three angles.
Et ex eis est, ex quo inciditur sicut figura folii myrti.	And one of them is like a figure of the leaf of myrtle.
Sicut apostema inguinum.	As the fistula of the groin.
Et ex eis sunt in quibus administratur sectio rotunda, et sectio lunaris: et similes eis ex sectionibus.	And among them are those in which a round section is administered, and a lunar section, and similar sections to these.
Illud uero cui non est caput, sicut sunt apostemata lenia superficialia, oportet ut perfores ipsum perforatione superficiali, uel plana tantum.	But that which has no head, as are the superficial fistulas of the skin, is to be pierced by a superficial perforation, or simply flat.
Et oportet, quando apostema est grossum, et iam collegit saniem multam, et perforas ipsum, ut non properes et extrahas pus totum in illa hora: imo extrahe ex ipso partem eius.	When the abscess is large and has already discharged a great deal of pus, and you pierce it, so that the pus does not spread all over at that time: draw out part of it.
Deinde opila apostema usque ad diem alium.	Then cover the abscess until the next day.
Deinde extrahe quiddam ex pus iterum.	Then draw out some more pus.
Fac illud multotiens secundum gradationem, donec egrediatur: praecipue si infirmus est debilis uirtutis, aut mulier praegnans, aut puer paruus, aur senex decrepitus: spiritus enim animalis ab animali multotiens resoluitur cum egressione saniei: et fortasse moritur infirmus, et tu non percipis.	Do this frequently according to the degree, until it is discharged: especially if the patient is of weak vigor, or a woman pregnant, or a boy small, or an old man decrepitous: for the animal spirit from the animal is often dissolved with the exit of the flux: and perhaps the sick one may die, and you not perceive it.
Caue ergo hoc capitulum cautela magna.	Therefore, take great care in this chapter.
Et post perforationem tuam, qua ista perforas apostemata, oportet ut abstergas uulnus: et considera.	After you have pierced it, when you pierce these abscesses, it is necessary that you clean the wound: and consider.
Si ergo est uulnus apostematis paruum, aut est sectio plana, tunc administra licinia ex lino, aut coto antiquo.	If then there is a small abscess, or it is on a flat surface, then administer liniment made from linseed oil, or old cotto.
Et si est apostema magnum, et fissurae perforationis multae sunt, oportet tunc ut intromittas in omnem fissuram licinium, donec perueniant adinuicem.	And if there is a large abscess, and there are many holes made by the piercing, then at that time it is necessary that you introduce liniment into all the cracks, until they come together on both sides.
Et si in apostemate abscidisti partem cutis, aut in circumitu concauasti eam: tunc oportet ut impleas eam coto ueteri, aut sicut quando texitur pannus, aut raditur lanugine lini absque humiditate: et stringe ipsum usque ad tertium diem.	And if you have cut off a part of the skin in the abscess, or have wrapped it around: then it is necessary that you fill it with old cotto, or as when a cloth is stretched, or a woolen fabric is brushed without moisture: and tighten it tightly for three days.
Deinde proiice ipsum, et cura illud cum eo quod oportet ex unguento, donec sanetur.	Then throw it out, and take care of that with it as you must from ointment, until it is healed.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis in hora tuae operationis, tunc administra aquam frigidam, et acetum, postquam imbibitur in eis pannus: et ponis ipsum super locum fluxus sanguinis multotiens.	If however a flow of blood occurs at the time of your operation, then administer cold water and vinegar, after it has been soaked up by a cloth: and lay it down often on the site of the blood flow.
Si autem perseuerat fluxus sanguinis, tunc oportet ut administres regimen, et curationem, et pulueres, quae narraui in locis multis huius nostri libri, et ex diuisione.	If however the blood flow persists, then it is necessary that you administer a regimen and treatment, and powders, which are mentioned in many places in our book, and from a division.
Si autem est in tempore hyemis, et locus apostematis est multorum neruorum: tunc oportet ut infundas puluillos cum uino, et oleo calidis: et ponas eos super loca.	If, however, it is in the winter season and the site of the pustule is a place of many nerves: then you should pour powder with wine and oil and put it on the spots.
Et si fuerit in aestate, et loca sunt carnosa: tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos imbibitos in aqua, et oleo, aut eum uino et oleo, et totum illud frigidum.	And if it is in the summer and the sites are fleshy: then you should put powder soaked in water and oil, or in wine and oil, and all of that cold thing.
Donec quando erit dies tertius, sicut diximus, tunc oportet ut soluas apostema, et abstergas ipsum, et administres in curatione eius quod ei conuenit, donec sanetur.	Until the third day, as we have said, then you should remove the pustule, wash it, and administer to it what is appropriate for its care, until it heals.
Hoc est ergo quod necessarium est ex cognitione curationis apostematum uniuersaliter.	This is therefore what is necessary from the consideration of the cure of pustules in general.
Secundum semitam uero distinctionis, iam dixi de omni apostemate, qualiter est uia ad curationem eius capitulatim singulariter.	However, according to the halfway distinction, I have already spoken about all pustules, which way leads to the cure of each one separately.
¶ De sectione apostematum quae accidunt in cute capitis.	[De] sectione [apostematum quae accidunt] in cute [capitis].
Caput XLI.	[Head] Chapter LXI.
Accidunt in cute capitis apostemata parua, et sunt ex speciebus Nodorum, quos continent tunicae, quae sunt eis sacci: quasi ipsa sint hausolati gallinae.	Pustules small occur on the scalp, and they are of two kinds: nods, which are surrounded by membranes, which are like little bags: almost as if they were caused by hens.
Et ipsorum species sunt multae.	And their kinds are many.
Ex eis sunt pingues: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditatem similem limo: et ex eis quae continent humiditatem similem frisatis et pultibus: et eis similibus, et ex eis sunt, quae sunt lapidea dura.	Of them there are some thin ones: and of them those which contain a similar moisture like a lime: and of them those which contain a similar moisture like a flour and pulps: and similar ones, and of them the hard ones.
Et in sectione omnium, et ipsorum extractione non est timor, dum apud ipsorum sectionem non facit contrarietatem arteria.	And in the section of all of them, and their extraction is not a fear, when it comes to the section of them, there does not make a contrast of the arteries.
Et operatio in sectione eorum est, ut experiaris ea cum instrumento, cuius forma uenit post haec, quod nominatur Intromissum, donec scias quid contineat.	And the operation in their section is as you experience it with an instrument, whose shape comes after this, which is called Intromissum, until you know what it contains.
Nam si est illud quod continet humiditas, tunc seca ipsum sectione secundum longitudinem sectione superficiali: secundum hanc formam.	Nam  si  est  illud  quod  contenit  humiditatem,  tunc  seca  ipsum  sectione  secundum  longitudinem  sectionis  superficialis:  secundum  hanc  formam.
Et incipe cum sectione ex linea b. ad lineam, g. Cum ergo euacuatur humiditas, tunc excoria kistin quae continet illam humiditatem, et non dimittas ex ea aliquid penitus.	And to begin with the incision along line B to line G. So when the moisture is drained, then scrub the crust that contains that moisture, and do not leave anything behind.
Multotiens enim redit, si remanet ex ea aliquid.	For it often returns if anything remains.
Deinde submerge cotum in unguento aegyptio, si est praesens: et si non, in aqua et sale: et imple cum eo uulnus, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	Then dip it in Egyptian ointment if present: and if not, in water and salt: and fill it with the same; and leave it until another day.
Ipsum enim corrodet quod remansit ex kisti.	For that corrodes what remains of the crust.
Deinde itera super ipsum cotum cum aegyptio secundo, et tertio, et si indiges illo, donec confidas quia non remanserit ex kisti aliquid, tunc enim cura uulnus cum unguento, donec sanetur.	Then repeat the Egyptian ointment on the patch a second and third time if you wish: and if your consent is given that nothing remains of the crust, then you may consider the wound healed with the ointment, for it will not return.
Quod si apostema continet nodum pinguem: tunc seca ipsum secundum hanc formam, sectione habente formam crucis: et proiice uncinos inter duolabia sectionis, et excoria ipsum ab omni parte: et conare uirtutem tuam in extractione tunicae quae continet ipsum.	That if the pus contains a swollen lump: then dry it out according to this form, having the shape of a cross: and throw away the hooks between the sides of the incision, and scrub the crust off entirely: and try your skill in removing the cloth that holds the lump.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi arteria, tunc fac illud quod narrabo tibi post.	If, however, it gives you a counter-direction, then do as I will tell you after.
Et similiter fac in apostemate, si est lapideum, ex sectione, et curatione eadem, secundum quod diximus.	And do likewise with the pus, if hard, from the incision, and with the same cure, as we have said.
Et sectio super apostema lapideum est facilior: quoniam est pauci sanguinis et humiditatis.	And the incision on hard pus is easier: for it has little blood and moisture.
Et quandoque sunt quaedam horum apostematum quae sunt in capite in quibusdam hominibus, cum quibus penitus non est humiditas.	And sometimes there are some pustules that are in the head of certain men, where there is no depth of moisture.
Quod est: quia ego secui super apostema in capite mulieris uetulae, et inueni apostema sicut lapis solidus et durus, asper, albus, qui non poterat frangi: et si percuteretur cum eo aliquis proiiciendo, uulnerat ipsum.	Which is this: for I followed over the pustule on the head of a married woman, and found the pustule like a solid rock, hard, rough, white, which could not be broken: and if anyone struck it with anything, he would hurt the flesh.
In aliis uero apostematibus accidentibus in capite, praeter haec scilicet apostemata quae accidunt in capitibus puerorum, et apud radices aurium, sectio eorum omnium sit sectio superficialis.	But in the other pustules, accidents in the head, apart from these pustules that are on the heads of boys, and at the roots of the ears: all of them are shallow incisions.
Vel pone perforationem eorum semper ab inferiori parte eorum, ut alleuietur cursus saniei ad inferiora.	And so that their perforations are always from the lower part of them, so that the flow of blood may go to the lower parts.
Deinde cura ea cum eo quod conuenit eis ex curatione.	Then, after this, take care of them as is right for them while they are recovering from the cure.
¶ De sectione Strophularum in collo.	§ On the Section of Staphylas in the Neck.
Caput XLII.	Head XXIV.
Multotiens acccidunt ista apostemata in collo, et sub assellis, et inguinibus: et quandoque accidunt in reliquo corpore.	These hernias in the neck, and under the breast, and in the groin; and sometimes they occur elsewhere in the body.
Et super illa quae ex eis accidunt in collo, sunt unum, et multa: et generantur ab inuicem: et omnis Strophula ex eis est intra tunicam propriam ei, sicut est in nodis et apostematibus capitis, sicut narrauimus.	And of those which occur in the neck, one is enough, but many are numerous; they spring from within; and every staphula comes out of its own skin, as we have described in the case of the nods and hernias of the head.
Et species harum Strophularum sunt multae.	And the kinds of these staphylas are many.
Et ex eis enim sunt lapideae: et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates: et ex eis sunt malignae, quae non obediunt curationi.	For some of them have leaves; and some of them contain moisture; and some of them are evil, and do not yield to the cure.
In illa ergo quam ex eis uides bonae dispositionis in tactu, cuius manifestum est propinquum colori cutis, et mouetur ad omnem partem, et non est annexa cum neruis colli, neque cum guidegi, neque cum arteria, neque est profunda: oportet ut seces eam sectione superficiali a superiori parte ad inferiorem partem corporis ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. et excoria eam ab omni parte: et extende duo labia cutis cum uncino, aut cum uncinis multis, si indiges illo, sicut diximus in apostematibus capitis, et extrahe eam paulatim.	In that which you see to be of good disposition when you touch it, its color is close to the skin's color, and it moves in all parts, and is not attached to the nerves of the neck, nor to the arteries, nor is it deep: let it be separated from its upper part to the lower part of the body along a line, b. towards the line, g., and scrape it off completely: and extend two skin flaps with a hook, or with many hooks, if you can bear it, as we have described in the case of the hernias of the head, and take it out little by little.
Et est super cautelam, ut non incidatur uena, aut neruus.	And be careful that it does not cut the vein, or a nerve.
Et sit spatumile non acutum ualde: ut non addat tibi manum tuam cum incisione, aut inquietet infirmum, et incidas quod non est necesse.	And let the knife be not very sharp, so that it does not cut your hand with an incision, or disturb you in any way, and do not fall, for it is not necessary.
Si autem incidis uenam, aut arteriam, aut prohibet te ab operatione, tunc pone in uulnus zegi tritum, aut quosdam pulueres qui abscindunt sanguinem, et stringe uulnus, et dimitte ipsum, donec quiescat acuitas apostematis, et mollificetur uulnus: uel incipit et uult putrefieri.	If you cut a vein or prevent you from performing the operation, then place it in a tree trunk, or some powder that stops the blood, and tightly tie the tree trunk, and let it go until the sharpness of the hernia subsides, and the tree trunk softens: or begin to putrefy.
Nam sanguis abscinditur tuncia Redi ergo ad operationem tuam, donec compleas.	The blood is cut off with a bandage. So get ready for your operation, until you are finished.
Deinde inquire digito tuo indice, si remansit aliquid ex Strophulis aliis paruis: ergo incide eas, et munda eas.	Then examine with your index finger to see if there is anything left of the staph. If so, cut and clean it out.
Quod si est in radice Strophulae uena magna: tunc oportet ut non incidas illam Strophulam ex radice sua: imo oportet ut liges eam cum filo duplato forti, et dimittas eam donec cadat per se absque nocumento.	If it is in the root of a new large staph: then you must not cut that staph out from its root: but you should tie it with strong double thread and let it fall by itself without causing any harm.
Deinde imple uulnus coto ueteri, quod iam submersisti in unguento aegyptio.	Then fill the hole with old cotton that you have already soaked in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum.	Then take care of yourself.
Si inciditur Strophula tota, tunc oportet ut aggreges labia duo uulneris: et suas ipsum statim, postquam uides quia prorsus non remansit superfluitas.	If the whole staph is cut, you should bring together the two sides of the wound: and then immediately, as soon as you see that there is no surplus.
Si autem uides quod remansit superfluitas propter magnitudinem Strophulae, tunc oportet ut intendas ad incidendam radicem eius, et extrahendam eam: et administra suturam quam diximus.	If you see that there is still surplus because of the size of the staph, then you should turn your attention to cutting its root and taking it out: and administer the suture which we have described.
Et quae ex Strophulis continet humiditates, perfora illam perforatione superficiali: ut appareat tibi locus maturitatis eius: et pone perforationem ab eo quod sequitur inferius corporis, sicut diximus.	And as for the staph which contains moisture, pierce it with a superficial puncture so that you can see the site of maturity: and place the puncture from there so that it follows the lower part of the body, as we have said.
Deinde administra post perforationem licinia cum unguento, et similia eis, ut corrodat quod remansit ex corruptione, donec quando uides uulnus iam mundatum esse: tunc cura ipsum cum unguento generatiuo carnis, donec sanetur.	Then after the puncture administer the liniment with ointment and similar ones so that it corrodes what is left of the corruption, until the moment when you see the wound healed: then take care of yourself with a nourishing ointment for the flesh, until it heals.
¶ De sectione Epiglotis ab apostemate intra guttur accidente.	Regarding the section of the epiglottis from the food pipe into the throat by accident.
Caput XLIII.	Chapter 43.
Dixerunt antiqui hanc sectionem in Epigloti, et non uidi aliquem in terra nostra, qui eam fecerit: et haec est scriptura sermonis eorum.	The old people said that this operation of the epiglottis was done, and I did not see anyone in our land who did it: and this is the writing of their teaching.
In habentibus autem synanchiam, oportet ut deuitetur sectio Epiglotis: cum non fiat iuuamentum per illud: propterea, quod omnes uenae et pulmo sunt infirmi.	But in those who have a swollen throat, the section of the epiglottis should be avoided: because it does not help at all for their recovery, since the larynx and lungs are weak.
In illis uero qui habent apostema calidum in ore, aut gutture, aut duabus amigdalis, quando non est aegritudo in cannali, oportet uti sectione Epiglotis, ad fugiendum ex perditione quae fit ex praefocatione.	Indeed, those who have a hot apostema in the mouth, or in the throat, or in both amygdalar glands, if there is no ailment in the larynx, it is necessary to use the epiglottis section, so as to avoid the loss that is made from pre-condensation.
Oportet ergo quando uolumus illud, ut secemus Epiglotim sub tribus circulis Epiglotis, aut quatuor, sectione parua per latitudinem, in eo quod est inter duos circulos per quantitatem, quod sit sectio in sifac, non in cartilagine: et iste quidem locus est conueniens sectioni, quoniam est priuatus carne, et uasa sanguinis ab eo sunt longinqua.	Therefore, when we want to cut this (epiglottis), we should cut it between two circles according to its size, which is the section in the sifac, not in the cartilage: and this place is suitable for cutting because it is separated from the flesh, and the blood vessels are far away from it.
Quod si medicator est timidus, tunc oportet ut extendat cutem gutturis cum uncino.	If the surgeon is timid, then he should extend the skin of the throat with a hook.
Deinde findat cutem, donec quando peruenit ad cannalem: deuitet uas sanguinis, si uidet ex eis aliquid.	Then he finds the skin, until it reaches the larynx; he should stop the flow of blood, if he sees any from it.
Deinde secet sifac quod narrauimus: et significatur super sectionem cannalis ex phlegmate quod egreditur ex ea, cum eo quod disrumpitur, et abscisione uocis.	Then he cuts the soft palate that we have mentioned; and it indicates on the section of the larynx from the mucus that is released from it, when it is interrupted, and with the cutting of the voice.
Et dimitte uulnus apertum tempore aliquo.	And remove the ring that opens at some time.
Cum ergo remouetur hora in qua timetur praefocatio, aggrega duo labia uulneris cutis, et sue ipsam solam absque cartilagine.	When, however, the hour approaches in which pre-condensation is feared, the two lips of the wound skin will be brought together, and it will be sealed alone without cartilage.
Deinde administra medicinas quae faciunt nasci carnem, usquequo sanetur.	Then he administers medicines that make flesh grow, until it heals.
Inquit Albucasis.	Says Albucasis.
Summa huius sermonis quem narrauimus, expositio non est, nisi quando uident, quod aliquod horum apostematum iam opilauit guttur infirmi: et sublimatus est infirmus super mortem, et uult intersecari anhelitus eius: uadunt ad secandum Epiglotim, ut respiret infirmus super locum uulneris quadam respiratione, et saluetur a morte: et propter hoc praeceperunt dimittere uulnus apertum, donec consumatur malicia aegritudinis, et est malicia eius tribus diebus, et quasi ipsa: tunc ergo praecaeperunt suere uulnus, et curare ipsum, donec sanetur.	Says Albucasis. The summary of this discourse that we have mentioned is not exposed, unless it is clear, that there is a certain apostema in the throat of the sick, and he has almost died because of his disease, and breathes heavily on his place, so that he is saved from death; and for this reason they ordered to remove the ring that opens, until the maliciousness of illness is consumed, and it is a maliciousness of three days, and almost the same: then he orders to tie the ring, and take care of himself, until he heals.
Et illud quod uidi per me ipsum est, quod una ancilla accaepit cultellum, et misit cum in guttur suum, et incidit cum eo partem cannalis pulmonis.	And that which I myself saw, that a maid took up a scalpel, and put it in her throat, and cut with it a part of the canal of the lung.
Et uocatus sum ad curationem eius, et inueni eam mugire, sicut est mugitus mortui.	And I was called to cure her, and I found her breathing, as it is the breathing of a dead person.
Detexi ergo a uulnere, et inueni sanguinem qui egressus fuerat ex uulnere paruum.	So I took off the bandage, and I found blood that had come out from the small lung.
Confisus ergo sum, quod ipsa non absciderat uenam, neque guidegi: et uentus egrediebatur ex uulnere.	So I was convinced that she had not cut her wound, nor had she bled: and wind came out from the wound.
Properaui ergo, et sui uulnus, et curaui ipsum, donec sanum est: et non accidit ancillae aliquid, nisi raucedo in uoce: et rediit post dies ad meliorem dispositionum suarum.	So I took off the bandage, and examined the wound myself, until it was healed: and there happened to the servant nothing, except a hoarseness in her voice: and she returned after a few days in better state of health.
Hinc ergo dico: quod in sectione Epiglotis non est timor.	So I say: that there is no fear in cutting the epiglottis.
¶ De sectione Herniae gutturis.	On the section of the stomach throat.
Caput XLIIII.	Chapter 48.
Hoc Apostema nominatum Hernia gutturis, est apostema magnum, secundum colorem corporis: et est in mulieribus multum.	This hernia named in the gut, is a great hernia, and of a second kind as to color, being of the color of the body: and it is common in women.
Et est secundum duos modos: aut enim est naturale: aut est accidentale.	And it has two kinds: either it is natural: or it is accidental.
In naturali certe non est ingenium.	Certainly it is not a matter of design in the natural.
Accidentale uero est secundum duos modos: quorum unus est similis nodis pinguibus.	On the other hand, it is accidental, and has two kinds, one is similar to pingueculae, and the other to warts.
Et modus alter, est similis apostemati quod fit ex nodatione arteriae.	And the other kind is similar to an ulcer that is formed from an inflammation of the artery.
Et in ipso est timor, et non oportet ut praesumptio fiat ad ipsum cum ferro, nisi in eo quod est paruum: et tu proba ipsum, et inuestiga ipsum cum Intromisso.	And there is a risk, and it should not be assumed to do this with iron, unless it is small: and you test it, and investigate it with an instrument.
Si ergo inuenis ipsum simile nodo pingui, et non est suspensum cum aliqua uenarum: tunc seca ipsum, sicut secantur nodi: et extrahe ipsum cum eo quod continet ex kisti, si est in kisti: et si non, tunc perscrutare totum eius.	If then you cut the similar nodule of the pingueculed, and it is not suspended with any wound: then dry up the nodule, as you do to others: and take out the one that contains it, if it is in a vesicle: and if it is not, then examine all of it.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod oportet ex curatione, donec sanetur.	Then the care of the place with it that needs to be cured, until it is healed.
¶ De sectione super species Nodorum.	§ On section above the nodules.
Caput XLV.	Head LXXV.
Nodorum multae sunt species, et ego iam dixi omnes species eorum in diuisione: et oportet ut narrem hic differentiam inter Nodum, et Exituram: cum sit dubitationem faciens.	There are many types of nodules, and I have already spoken about all their types in the division: and it is necessary that I should speak here about the difference between a nodule and an ulcer, in order to cause no confusion.
Dico ergo, quod cum Exitura est caliditas, et febris, et dolores uehementes, donec sedatur ebullitio superfluitatis, et completur putrefactio: tunc enim quiescunt febris et calor.	I say therefore, that when an ulcer is hot and feverish and there are keen pains, until the efflux of pus has run out in a stream, and corruption is completed: then indeed the fever and heat subside.
Cum Nodo uero non est caliditas, neque febris, neque dolores, et continet eos kistis sifachin, qui est eis saccus proprius, et est secundum colorem corporis: et est incaeptio eorum sicut cicer, et fit sicut batecha, et maior et minor.	When however a nodule is not hot, nor feverish, nor painful, and it contains its own sacs, which are like beans of the body, and are of the colour of the flesh: and it resembles an acorn, and a nut, and is greater or smaller.
Et sunt secundum duas species: aut pingues: aut continent humiditatem.	And they are of two kinds: either small or they contain moisture.
Et colores humiditatis sunt multi, secundum quod dixi in diuisione.	And the colours of the moisture are many, according to what I have said in the division.
Oportet ergo, quando peruenis ad curationem Nodi, ut experiaris eum, et inquiras ipsum in primis cum instrumento quod nominatur Intromissum, secundum quod ueniet forma eius in capitulo quod est post hoc.	Therefore when you are treating a nodule, you should test it and investigate it with the instrument called an introskim, according to which its form will be known in the chapter which follows this one.
Et modus inquisitionis apostematum, et Nodorum omnium est, ut accipias hoc instrumentum, et intromittas ipsum in humidiorem locum, quem inuenis in apostemate: et tu reuolue digitos tuos cum eo paulatim, donec scias quod instrumentum iam penetrauit cutem.	And the method of testing nodules, and all nodules, is to take this instrument and introduce it into a moistened place, which you have opened in an ulcer: and you will then withdraw your fingers gradually, until you know that the instrument has penetrated the skin.
Deinde ultima manum tuam secundum mensuram magnitudinis apostematis.	Then withdraw the last of your fingers by the measure of the size of an ulcer.
Deinde extrahe Intromissum, et considera illud quod egrediur in uestigio eius.	Then remove the introskim, and see what comes out into its opening.
Si ergo egreditur humiditas currens, quicunque color sit: tunc seca ipsum sectione superficiali, secundum quod dixi in reliquis apostematibus.	If however moist matter runs out while it is being removed, whatever colour it may be: then dry the spot with a superficial cut, according to what I have said in other ulcers.
Et si non egreditur humiditas in uestigio Intromissi, tunc scias quia est pinguis: seca ergo super ipsum sectione habente formam crucis, secundum formam hanc, sicut docui te: et suspende ipsum cum uncinis, et excoria cutem ab omni parte cum facilitate: et custodi kistin si potes super illud, ut extrahas ipsam sanam cum Nodo.	And if no moisture runs out in the opening of the introskim, then know that it is fat: so dry the spot on top with a cut which has the form of a cross, according to this form, as I have taught you: and suspend it with an hook, and scrape off the skin completely from all parts with ease: and guard the case if you can over it, so that you may take out the sound with a nodule.
Si autem disrumpitur kistis apud operationem, et non est possibile extrahere ipsam sanam, multotiens enim accidit illud, tunc extrahe ipsam frustatim, donec non remaneat ex ea aliquid.	If, however, the belly is broken open during an operation, and it is not possible to extract it whole because many times it has happened that then extract it quickly, until there is nothing left of it.
Nam si remanet ex ea aliquid parum, aut multum, redit Nodus secundum plurimum.	For if a little or a lot remains of it, it returns the second knot according to many.
Quod si uincit te, et remanet ex eo parum: tunc imple uulnus apud completionem tuam, quibusdam pulueribus corrosiuis acutis: et stringe uulnus, et pone supra ipsum quod sedet apostema calidum, et cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	That if it hurts you and a little remains of it: then fill the wound with some acute rust powder: and tighten the wound tightly, and put on top of it a hot poultice, and care for the wound along with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
Si ergo est Nodus magnus, tunc sue duo labia eius, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat.	If then there is a large knot: then tear its two lips open, and care for the wound with that which has become inflamed.
Si autem est tibi contraria uena pulsatilis, aut non pulsatilis: tunc propera, et imple locum zegi trito, et dimitte ipsum strictum duobus diebus, aut tribus, donec putrefiat uulnus, et quiescat ebullitio sanguinis: deinde redi ad incidendum illud quod remansit ex Nodo.	If it is then a new wound that pulsates or does not pulsate: then approach and fill the place with threefold poultice, and leave it tightly for two days or three, until the wound putrefies and the swelling subsides: then return to cutting out what is left of the knot.
¶ De foris instrumentorum pro sectione et perforatione.	Regarding instruments from outside the body for section and perforation.
Caput XLVI.	Chapter XLVIII. On the use of instruments from outside the body for
EX Eis sunt formae Intromissorum, et sunt trium specierum.	There are three types of instruments for
Ex eis enim est magnum, et ex eis est medium, et ex eis est paruum.	Of these, there is a large one, and of these, a middle one, and of these, a small one.
Fiant ex ferro alfulud quadratarum extremitatum decenter, ut festinent introitum in apostemate.	Let there be made from iron an octangular frame with projecting ends, so that it may enter the wound without touching.
Et istae sunt formae Experientium, et no, id est, perforantia: et unum eorum nominatur beris, idest, peforans: et sunt trium specierum.	These are forms of instruments for: and one of these is called a bit, that is, a perforating one: and there are three types.
Ex eis enim est magnum, et medium, et paruum.	Of these, there is a large one, and a middle one, and a small one.
Conueniunt, ut inuestigentur per ea apostemata, et exiturae, et fistulae, et bubones ab eo quod inter ea est ex ossibus.	They are convenient for piercing through the wounds, exits, veins, and abscesses from which they come out between the bones.
Et aliis fiunt rotunda, tersa, lenia, sicut acus magnae quibus subsellia suuntur, ex citrino scilicet, aut ex aere, aut ferro, aut argento.	And others are round and sharp, like large needles from which sutures are made, of brass perhaps, or of iron, or of silver, or of gold.
Et meliora eorum sunt quae fiunt ex citrino.	And their better ones are those which are made from citron.
Et fiunt Experientia etiam de plumbo nigro, quae conueniunt ut per ea experiantur fistulae, quarum concauitate sunt reflexiones, ut reflectantur cum lenitate sua cum illis reflexionibus.	And experience is also made about lead black, which they use so that through it they can experiment with the tubes, whose surfaces they smooth so that they reflect gently and reflect on them with their own reflections.
Et sunt iterum trium specierum.	And there are again three species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt longa, ex eis media, et ex eis breuia, secundum quantitatem amplitudinis fistulae et stricturae eius.	For from them are the long ones, from them the medium, and from them the short, according to the quantity of the width of the tube and the tightness of it.
Forma Vncinorum, et sunt multarum specierum.	Shape of rings, and there are many species.
Quoniam ex eis sunt simplices, scilicet quibus est curuitas una: et sunt trium specierum sicut uides, Magni, Medii, et Parui.	For from them are the simple ones, that is to say those which have one depth: and there are three species as you see, great, medium, and small.
Et ex eis sunt Vncini caeci: et sunt trium specierum.	And from them are blind rings: and there are three species.
Et ex eis sunt uncini habentes duas curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et ex eis sunt uncini habentes tres curuaturas, et sunt trium specierum: et omnes isti sunt necessarii in loco suo.	And from them are hooks with two depths, and there are three species: and from them are hooks with three depths, and there are also three species: and all of these are necessary in their place.
Et istae sunt formae Scalpellorum, quibus secantur et excoriantur Nodi, et apostemata: et sunt trium specierum: quoniam ex eis est magnum, medium, et paruum.	And these are the shapes of the scalpels, with which they cut and burn the nodes and abscesses: and there are three species: for from them is the great, the medium, and the small.
Eorum extremitates quibus fit sectio sunt acutae, extremitates aliae sunt non acutae: et non ponuntur taliter, nisi ut cum eis fiat iuuamentum in excoriatione Nodorum apud timorem incisionis uenae, aut nerui: et ut sanetur per ea infirmus, et inueniat tranquillitatem parumper ex adustione quam inuenit apud excoriationem apostematis.	Their extremities with which the cutting is done are acute, and other extremities are not acute: and they are not arranged so as to do this, unless it be with them that one does the incision of a node in fear of cutting the skin, or of the nerve: and in order that the sick person may be healed through it, and have some calmness from the heat which he has, more than when one incises an abscess.
Istae sunt Magda, et sunt specierum trium.	These are magda, and there are three species of them.
Fiunt ex aere, et sunt similia Radio, cum quo fit alcohol: et in extremitate lata est puncta Spatumilis occultata: et in ea currit ad interiora, et ad exteriora quando uis, sicut uides.	They are made from bronze, and they resemble the wire with which alcohol is made: and in the wider end there is a little spathula hidden: and it runs to the inside and outside when you want it, as you see.
Forma Spatumilium quae absconduntur inter digitos apud perforationem apostematum: et non percipiunt ea infirmi: et sunt trium specierum, magnum, medium, et paruum.	The shape of the spatulums which are hidden between the fingers at the perforation of abscesses: and they do not feel them with their hands: and there are three species, great, medium, and small.
Fomae Ventosarum cum quibus abscinditur fluxus sanguinis: et sunt trium specierum, magnae, mediae, et paruae.	The forms of wound healing with which blood flow is interrupted: and there are three types, large, medium, and small.
Fiant ex aere, aut citrino, rotundae, ad longitudinem parumper, sicut uides: et sint ad subtilitatem.	Let them be made from metal, or gold, round in shape, of nearly the same length, as you see: and let them be thin.
Et oportet ut sint istae species Ventosarum apud te magnae, et paruae: ut abscindas per eas sanguinem cum uelocitate apud necessitatem, et tunc quando non est tibi praesens medicina.	And it is necessary that these forms of the Winds be with you large and small: so that you can cut the blood off with speed in an emergency, and then when there is no medicine present.
Verumtamen non utaris eis in abscisione sanguinis in omni loco corporis, et non utaris nisi in locis carnosis: sicut lacertis cruris, et coxae, et lacertis brachiorum, et mammillarum, et uentris, et inguinum, et similibus eis, ex lacertis carnosis, humidis.	However, do not use them to cut blood anywhere in the body, and do not use them except in tender places: such as those of the legs, and of the hips, and of the arms, and of the breasts, and of the feet, and of the groin, and similar ones, from tender flesh, moist.
Et quandoque fiunt ex eis instrumenta parua alia similia corticibus fisticorum, secundum suam formam: quibus abscinditur sanguis quando fluit ex loco phlebotomiae, aut apud incisionem uenae, aut arteriae: et quandoque fiunt ex eis rotundae secundum hanc formam.	And when they are made into small instruments like a scalpel, of the same shape as their handle: which cut blood when it flows from a phlebotomy site, or after cutting a vein, or an artery: and sometimes they are made round in this shape.
¶ De cura Mammillarum hominum quae mammillis mulierum assimilantur.	On the care of the breasts of men which resemble female nipples.
Caput XLVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quandoque inflantur Mammillae quorundam hominum apud complementum somni (id est, cum incipiunt pollui in somno) donec similantur mammillis mulierum: et remanent apostemosae foede.	When the breasts of certain men are swollen towards the end of sleep (namely, when they begin to discharge their seed in sleep) until they resemble female nipples, and remain wet with milk.
Qui ergo abhorret illud, oportet ut secet super mammillas sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Deinde excoria pinguedinem totam.	Those who thus avoid that, should dry their breasts with a lunar section of a loof, from the line A to the line G, then scrape off the milky substance all over.
Postea imple uulnus ex medicamine incarnatiuo.	Then fill a sponge with an ink-like medicine.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind together the two lips of the wound with a stitch, and take care of it, until it heals.
Si autem declinat mammilla ad inferiora, et mollificatur propter magnitudinem suam, sicut accidit mulieribus: tunc oportet ut findatur in duobus lateribus suis superioribus duabus sectionibus similibus figurae lunari, quarum unaquaeque continetur cum altera apud fines utriusque, donec sit linea maior continens minorem, secundum hanc formam ex linea, b. ad lineam, g. Postea excoria cutem quae est inter duo labia, et aufer pinguedinem, et administra quod diximus de sutura et pulueribus, quod est necessarium ex curatione, donec sanetur.	If however the nipple turns downward and becomes soft through its size, as happens to women: then it is necessary that there be found in its two sides, above, two sections like the moon, each holding with the other at their ends, until it forms a line containing the smaller one, according to this shape from the line A to the line G. Then scrape off the skin which is between the two lips, and take away the milk, and administer what we have said about the stitch and the powders, which is necessary in the care, until it heals.
Si autem non comples incisionem eius quod oportet te incidere, propter inquietudinem infirmi, aut propter fluxum sanguinis: tunc oportet ut impleas uulnus coto submerso unguento corrosiuo, et dimitte ipsum, donec corrodat illud quod remansit ex pinguedine.	If you do not wish to make an incision where necessary for your incisions, due to anxiety or because of blood flow: then it is necessary that you fill the wound with a submerged unguent that is corrosive, and leave it until it has corroded what remains from the swelling.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, until it heals.
¶ De perforatione apostematis, quod accidit sub Titillico.	On perforations caused by the skin rash that occurred during the time of Titus.
Caput XLVIII.	Chapter 58.
Ista apostemata quae accidunt sub Titillico, sunt ex speciebus Strophularum dura, quae continet kistis, et ex eis sunt quae continent humiditates.	These skin rashes that occur during the time of Titus are of two kinds: one is hard, and has a scaly surface, and the other is moist.
Quae ergo sunt ex eis quae continent humiditates, oportet ut secentur sectione lunari, secundum hanc formam, ex linea b. ad lineam, g. cum ergo euacuatur totum quod est in apostemate ex sanie, tunc imple ipsum coto ueteri, et dimitte ipsum usque ad diem alium.	These that are moist should be dried out with a lunar section, as shown in the diagram, from line b to line g; and when all that is left in the pustule has been drained, then fill it with old ointment, and leave it until another day.
Deinde auferatur cotum, et curetur cum unguento conueniente ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then the ointment should be removed, and the wound should be treated with a suitable ointment, until it heals.
Quod si apostema fuerit ex specie nodorum Strophularum, tunc scinde super ipsum, sicut diximus in sectione super Strophulas aequaliter.	If the pustule is of the kind of knots called strophulas, then cut it open, as we have said in the section on strophulas that are equal.
Si autem extenditur uulnus in hoc ut emittat pus, tunc administra in eo cauterium, secundum quod diximus in eo quod praemissum est.	If, however, the sore extends and discharges pus, then administer a cauterization to it, as we have said above.
¶ De sectione apostematis quod accidit propter Arteriam et Venam.	On the incision of a pustule that has occurred through an artery or vein.
Caput XLIX.	Chapter 49.
Quando disrumpitur Arteria, et consolidatur cutis quae est supra eam, tuno multotiens accidit inde apostema: et similiter accidit Venae etiam, ut accidat in ea apostema et inflatio.	When an artery bursts and the skin that is above it becomes stiffened, then often a pustule occurs; and also happens to veins, so that a pustule and swelling occur in them.
Et signa quibus cognoscitur, quod apostema et inflatio sint propter Arteriam et Venam, sunt: quoniam, quando apostema est propter arteriam, est longum, aggregatum in profundo corporis: et quando impellis apostema digits tuis, sentis quasi sit ei stridor.	And the signs by which it can be known that a pustule and swelling are due to an artery and vein are these: for when the pustule is due to an artery, it is long and deep within the body; and when you press the pustule with your fingers, you feel as if it were whispering.
Et illud quod est propter Venam, est rotundum in manifesto corporis.	And what is due to vein, is round in apparent body.
Et sectio super hoc apostema est error, et praecipue quod est sub ascellis, et inguinibus, et collo, et in locis multis corporis: et est magnum ualde.	And the section on this wound is an error, and especially what is under the armpits, and groin, and neck, and in many places of the body: and it is great indeed.
Oportet ergo ut deuitetur eius cura cum ferro, et quod ex eis etiam est in extremitatibus, aut in capite, oportet ut deuitetur.	Therefore, so that its care may be removed with iron, and that which is also from it in the extremities, or in the head, should be removed.
Super illud ergo quod ex eis est ex inflatione orificii Arteriae, finde in cute sectione in longitudine.	And on this then what is from it from the inflating of the opening of the artery, find in the skin in length.
Deinde aperi sectionem cum uncinis, postea Arteriam: et libera eam ex tunicis, donec detegatur.	Then open the section with a hook, then the artery: and free it from the tunics, until it is detected.
Deinde intromitte sub ea acum, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, et stringe Arteriam cum filo duplo in duobus locis, secundum quod docui te in extractione duarum Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then insert underneath it a hook, and let it penetrate as far as another side, and tighten the artery with a double thread in two places, according to which I taught you in the extraction of two arteries which are in the temples.
Deinde punge locum, qui est inter duo ligamenta cum spatumili, donec egrediatur sanguis qui est in eo totus, et soluatur apostema.	Then prick the place, which is between the two ligaments with a needle, until all the blood that is in it has gone out, and solve the apoplexy.
Deinde administra curationem quae generat pus, donec cadant ligamenta: postea cura illud cum unguentis conuenientibus ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then administer the cure which generates pus, until the ligaments fall: then care for it with ointments suitable for it, until it heals.
Quod si fuerit apostema propter sectionem Venae, tunc oportet ut teneas manu tua quod tibi possibile est ex apostemate cum cute.	If the apoplexy is due to a vein section, then you should hold your hand, which you can manage from the apoplexy with the skin.
Deinde intromitte acum sub loco quem tenuisti manu tua, et fac eam penetrare: et sit in ea filum duplum, donec extrahas ipsum ex latere altero.	Then insert a hook underneath the place which you held with your hand, and let it penetrate: and let it be in it a double thread, until you bring it out from the other side.
Deinde liga cum ipso apostema ligamento bono: secundum quod dixi tibi in ligamento uuae, a duabus partibus cum duabus extremitatibus fili.	Then bind with it the apoplexy with good ligament: according to which I told you in the binding of a thread, from two parts with two extremities.
Si autem times quod extrahatur filum, tunc intromitte acum aliam cum filo alio sub apostemate toto apud incisionem acus: preme, et stringe fila tua in quatuor locis.	If however you should know that the thread is to be extracted, then insert a hook with another thread under the apoplexy all around the incision of the blade: press, and tighten your threads in four places.
Deinde seca apostema in medio sui, donec quando egreditur quod in eo est: tunc incide superfluitatem cutis, et dimitte quod ligatum est ex ea.	Then dry the apoplexy in the middle of itself, until it is completely gone out from it: then cut off the excess of the skin, and let go what is bound from it.
Deinde pone super ipsum puluillum quem submersisti in uino, et oleo.	Then put a very thin layer of the powder that you dipped in wine and oil on your wound.
Deinde administra curationem, quae fit cum liciniis et unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then apply the cure, which is made with liniments and ointments, until it heals.
¶ De apostemate quod accidit ex torsione Neruorum.	A post-mortem examination of what happened due to a torsion of the neck.
Caput L.	The head of the lower leg.
Sicut accidit apostema in Arteria et Vena, similiter accidit apostema in Neruis: quod accidit in eis percussio, aut accidit a labore superfluo, et similibus: et fit plurimum illis in locis adiutoriorum, aut calcanei, et in omni loco in quo mouentur iuncturae: et est apostema graue.	As happened in the apostema of Arteria and Vena, so also happened in the nerves: what happened to them is percussion, or it happened from excessive work, and similar: and it often happens in the places of the adductors, or calcanei, and in any place where the tendineae move: and it is a gray apostema.
Similatur color eius reliquo corpori, et est in pluribus dispositionibus absque dolore: et quando stringitur cum uehementia, sentit in eo infirmus simile stupori.	Its color is similar to the rest of the body, and it is in many dispositions without pain: and when it is pressed with a thump, it feels in it a similar kind of fainting.
Et non est apostema aggregatum in profundo corporis, imo est sub cute, et ipsum mouetur ad omnem partem, et non uadit ad anteriora, uel ante, neque retro ad posteriora.	And this apostema is not aggregated in the deep part of the body, but it is under the skin, and it moves itself to all parts, and does not announce itself to the front, nor forward, nor backward to the back.
Quod ergo ex eis est in iuncturis, non oportet ut inuadatur cum ferro.	What then is in the joints, should not be moved with iron.
Fortasse enim accidet contractio.	Perhaps indeed what happens: contraction may happen.
In illo autem quod ex eis est in capite, aut in fronte, finde cutem cum spatumili.	But in that which is in the head or in the forehead, find a skin with a thump.
Si ergo est apostema paruum, tunc tene ipsum cum forficibus, et abscinde ipsum a radice.	If then it is a small apostema, then hold it with forceps, and cut it off from the root.
Et si est magnum, tunc suspende ipsum eum uncino, et excoria ipsum: deinde aufer ipsum, et aggrega uulnus cum sutura: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	And if it is a large one, then hang it on a hook, and scrape it off: then take it off, and join the wound with stitches: and care for it, until it heals.
¶ De sectione apostematis, quod accidit in uentre.	Regarding the section of apostemes that occur in the belly.
Caput LI.	The head of the lower leg.
Accidunt quibusdam hominibus multotiens in uentribus eorum, et in reliquis corporibus ipsorum, thelil, quae nominantur Fungalia, per similitudinem ipsorum cum fungis.	To some people their bellywind often occurs, and to the rest of their bodies, those little things that they call 'fungus', due to similarity of those to the mushrooms.
Quorum radix est subtilis, et ipsorum caput est grossum, et conuersa sunt labia eorum.	The root of these is thin, and their heads are thick, and their lips are loose.
Et est ex eis paruum: et est ex eis quod magnificatur ualde.	And it comes from a few things: and it is from them that it becomes great.
Et ego quidem iam uidi uirum, et in uentre eius erant duo thelil, quae erant magis quam rebus aliis similia fungis: non erat differentia inter ea, alba, minutae radicis, et inuersabantur labia eorum, et findebantur, et humiditas currebat ex eis semper.	And I too have already seen a man, and in his belly were two small mushrooms, which were more than similar to other things: there was no difference between them, they had white roots, and their lips were spread apart, and they were ending, and moisture always flowed out of them.
Incidi ergo ea, et inueni in pondere unius quasi X et VIII uncia et in altero quasi VI uncia Et operatio in incisione eorum est, ut consideres tunc, si infirmus est humidus, et color thelil est albus, humidum, subtilis radicis: tunc incide ipsum cum spatumili lato, et sint in praesentia tua cauteria in igne.	So then I cut them open, and I found in weight one like ten and eight ounces, and in another like six ounces; and the operation on them is so that you consider this then, if it is damp, and the color of the mushroom is white, moist, with a fine root: then cut it open with a wide chisel, and let cauterizes be present with fire.
Multotiens enim expellitur apud sectionem eius sanguis multus: propera ergo si te uincit sanguis, tunc cauteriza ipsum.	For often is driven out from its section much blood: so then if your blood wins it, then cauterize the body.
Quod si uides infirmum pauidum et timidum ab incisione cum ferro, tunc accipe filum ex plumbo decenter factum, et stringe cum eo athelul: cuius modus est quem diximus, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	That if you see a sick person trembling from the incision with iron, then take a thread of lead which is made crookedly, and tie it up with it: whose method is that which we have said, and let go of him for two days.
Deinde adde in strictura plumbi.	Then add to the tightening of the lead.
Non ergo cesses stringere plumbum, quotiens imprimit in thelil, donec abscindatur, et cadat per se absque labore.	So then do not cease to tighten the lead, when it presses on the mushroom, until it is cut off, and falls by itself without work.
Si autem thelil grossae fuerit radicis, tunc in incisione eius est quiddam timoris et pauoris: praecipue quod est in uentre.	But if the mushroom is large in root, then there is a certain fear and trembling in its incision: above all because it is in the belly.
Verumtamen possibile est, ut incidas medietatem eius.	However, it is possible that you cut in half.
Deinde cauteriza ipsum, ut non redeat.	Then cauterize the body so that it does not bleed back.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then take care of the body until the wound heals.
Et caue ne praesumas incidere thelil quod est fusci coloris, pauci sensus, foedi aspectus: ipsum enim est apostema cancerosum: et ego ueniam cum rememoratione Cancri post hoc.	And do not suppose that you cut into a mushroom which is of a fuzzy color, of few senses, of an appetizing appearance: for it is a cancerous pustule: and I have come with a reminder of the crab after this.
¶ De cura eminentiae Vmbilici.	Of the care of an eminence of the umbilicus.
Caput LII.	Chapter LII.
Fit eminentia Vmbilici ex caussis multis.	Ex many causes of umbilical eminence.
Aut ex fissuris sifac, quod super uentrem est: et exit ex eo althub, aut intestinum, secundum quod accidit in reliquis rupturis.	Or from the sirocco hole, which is above the navel: and comes out of it the hernia, or the intestine, according to what happens in other ruptures.
Aut ex sanguine qui fluit ex Vena, aut ex Arteria, secundum quod praemissum est.	Or from the blood that flows from a vein, or from an artery, according to what has been said above.
Aut ex uentositate coartata in eo.	Or from the hernia, as it was said.
Si autem est propter fissuram sifac, et exitum thirbi: tunc est color apostematis similis colori corporis: et est lene, absque dolore: et apparet diuersi situs.	If, however, it is due to a sirocco hole and the exit is bad: then it is of an apθημαtic color, similar to the color of the body: and it is soft, without pain: and appears at different locations.
Et si est propter egressionem intestini, tunc est situs eius, cum eo quod narrauimus, uehementioris diuersitatis.	And if it is due to the exit of the intestine, then its location is with that which we have described, more varied in location.
Cum ergo tu premis ipsum digitis tuis, occultatur: deinde redit, et fortasse est cum eo sonitus: et magnificatur multum apud introitum balnei, et laborem uehaementum.	When you press it with your fingers, it is hidden: but then it returns, and perhaps there is a sound with it: and it increases greatly at the entry of the sweat, and laborious rumbling.
Si uero est propter humiditatem, est lene, tunc non occultatur quando premis ipsum manu tua, neque constringium, neque additur.	If, however, it is due to moisture, it is soft, then it does not hide itself when pressed with your hand, nor does it contract, nor does it add.
Quod si est propter sanguinem, tunc cum istis signis apparet apostema ad nigredinem de cliue.	That if it is due to blood, then, with these signs, an apθημα appears towards blackness from the navel.
Si autem est propter carnem natam: tunc est apostema graue, grossum, durum, et figitur secundum quantitatem unam.	If, however, it is due to a natural birth, then it is an apθημα of gray color, thick, hard, and shapes itself according to the quantity of one unit.
Si uero est propter uentositatem, tunc tactus eius est lenis.	If, however, it is due to the flow of air, then the sensation of it is soft.
Et operatio in illo est, ut consideres tunc, si eminentia umbilici est propter sanguinem Arteriae, aut Venae, aut uentositatem: tunc oportet ut prohibearis a curatione eius.	And the operation in it is, to consider then, if the umbilical eminence is due to blood of an artery or vein, or air: then one should refrain from treating it.
Nam in illo est timor et pauor, sicut docui te in capitulo, in quo dixi apostemata propter arteriam et uenam.	For in it is fear and dread, as I have taught you in the chapter in which I said about aptelemas due to an artery and a vein.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est propter intestinum, aut zirbum: tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, quatenus teneat anhelitum suum, et stet stans extensus.	That if the umbilical eminence is due to the intestine or a hernia, then you should prescribe to the sick person that he keep his breath, and stand with his back erect.
Deinde signa cum encaustro in circumitu umbilici totius.	Then mark with caustice around the navel all around.
Postea praecipe ei, ut resupinetur inter manus tuas super dorsum suum.	Then order him to lie down on his back between your hands.
Deinde circunda cum spatumili lato in circumitu umbilici super locum quem signasti cum encaustro.	Then, with a sharp blade, mark around the navel on the spot you marked with caustice.
Postea extende medium apostematis ad superiora, cum uncino magno.	Then extend the midline to the upper part, with a large hook.
Deinde liga eum in circumitu forti cum filo, aut cum chorda de serico ligamento firmo: et sit nodus ligamenti alenxotati.	Then bind him strongly around the navel with a thread, or with a silk cord, so that the knot is tied on the abdomens of the bound man.
Deinde aperi medium apostematis extensum supra ligamentum.	Then open the midline that you have extended above the navel.
Si ergo inueneris ipsum iam captum a ligamento: tunc extrahe alenxotati, et intromitte in ipsum digitum indicem, et impelle intestinum ad interiora uentris: et si inueneris zirbum, tunc accipe ipsum cum uncino, et incide superfluitatem eius.	If you have already found the man captured by the ligature: then pull out the ligature and insert your finger into his anus, and push the stool into the inner part of the abdomen: and if you find feces, then take it with a hook and cut off the excess.
Si autem contraria est tibi arteria, aut uena: tunc circunda ipsum multum.	If the artery or vein is on the opposite side, then bind him very tightly.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam.	Then return to your operation.
Et accipe duas acus, et intromitte in eis duo fila fortia: et intromitte duas acus in circumitu quem fecisti circa apostema in modum crucis, quas facis penetrare.	And take two needles and insert two strong threads into them: and insert the two needles around the spot you have made in the form of a cross, which you make to penetrate.
Deinde stringe apostema in quatuor locis super acus: et si uis, aufer acus, et dimitte locum, donec putrefiat caro extensa: et cadat per se: aut incide ipsam quando subtiliatur et putrefit.	Then tighten the knot in four places on the needles: and if there is a wound, remove the needle, and leave the spot until the flesh has rotted: and it will fall off by itself: or cut it when it becomes thin and rotten.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod oportet ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the man with the ointment as needed until he is healed.
Quod si eminentia umbilici est ex carne nara in eo, aut ex humiditate: tunc oportet ut concaues apostema, sicut diximus.	If the navel eminence is made of flesh that has dried up in it, or from moisture: then you must tighten the knot, as we have said.
Et extrahas sanguinem, aut humiditatem, quam inuenis in eo.	And drain the blood, or moisture, which you have injected into him.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod solidat locum.	Then take care of the man with the ointment so that the spot hardens up.
¶ De cura CANCRI.	Of the cure for cancer.
Caput LIII.	Chapter LIII.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Cancri, et qualiter est uia ad curationem eius cum medicinis: et cauendum ab eo cum curatione eius cum ferro, ut non ulceretur: et diximus Cancrum generatum in matrice, et cautelam a curatione eius.	We have already spoken about the division of cancer into species, and how to treat it with medicines; and to beware of treating it with iron so that it does not ulcerate; and we spoke about cancer generated in the womb, and about the precaution to take when treating it.
Et dixerunt antiqui, quod quandoque Cancer est in loco, ubi possibilis est eius eradicatio: sicut Cancer qui est in mammillis, aut in coxa, et eis similibus, ex membris locatis ad extrahendum totum eius: praecipue quando est incipiens paruus.	And the ancients said that whenever cancer is in a place where it can be eradicated: such as cancer which is in the breast, or in the hip, and those like them, from the member located to extract all of it: especially when it is beginning to start.
Quando uero antiquatur, et est magnus, non oportet ut appropinques ei.	When, however, it has been long established, and is great, it is not necessary that you approach it.
Ego enim non potui sanare ex eo aliquem: neque uidi alium ante me qui peruenerit ad illud.	For I could not heal from it anyone: nor did I see another who had come to it.
Et operatio in eo, quando est locatus sicut diximus, est, ut praecedas, et soluas infirmum ex cholera nigra aliquotiens.	And the operation on it, when it is located as we have said, is, like a prolepsis, and you remove the disease from time to time.
Deinde phlebotoma ipsum si inuenis cum repletione manifesta.	Then the phlebotomy itself if the wound is filled with pus.
Deinde praepara infirmum praeparatione, in qua locetur cum operatione.	Then prepare the sick with preparation, in which he is placed with the operation.
Deinde proiice in Cancrum uncinos qui conueniunt ei.	Then throw on cancer hooks that are suitable for it.
Postea concaua ipsum ab omni parte cum cute, secundum perscrutationem, donec non remaneat aliquid ex radicibus eius: et dimitte sanguinem currere, et non abscindas ipsum uelociter, imo exprime loca, et absterge sanguinem grossum totum manu tua, aut cum quo possibile est ibi ex instrumentis.	Then close it up from all sides with a wound, according to the examination, until nothing remains of its roots: and let not the blood flow, nor do you tear it quickly off, except express the places, and wipe away the gross blood entirely by hand, or with whatever is possible there.
Si autem contrarietatem facit tibi fluxus sanguinis grossi ex incisione arteriae, aut uenae: tunc cauteriza uenam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if the opposite makes you flow of gross blood from the incision of an artery, or a vein: then cauterize the vein, until the blood is severed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the cancer with the remaining cure, until it is healed.
¶ De cura Hydropisis.	§ On the treatment of water-on-the-skin.
Caput LIIII.	Head XLIV.
Iam narrauimus in diuisione species Hydropisis, et qualiter fit aggregatio aquae: et signa omnis speciei, et curationem eius cum medicinis.	We have already spoken at length in the division of the species of water, and how it is gathered: and the signs of each kind, and the treatment of it with medicines.
Et illa quae curatur cum ferro, non est nisi species asclitis sola: et non approximatur cum ferro speciei timpanitis: neque speciei hyposarcae penitus: nam illud mortale est.	And those who are cured with iron, it is not except a single kind of asclepius: and does not approach the iron of the tympanic species: nor does the hyposarcous species go deep into the body: for that is mortal.
Quando tu iam medicatus es hanc speciem Hydropisis timpanitis cum medicinis, et non contulit medicatio tua: tunc considera.	When you have already treated this species of water-on-the-skin with medicines, and your treatment has not been effective: then consider.
Nam si infirmo iam consecuta est debilitas, aut est cum eo infirmitas alia praeter Hydropisim: sicut si sit cum eo tussis, aut uentris solutio, et similia illis: tunc caue ne mediceris ei cum ferro: quoniam est timor illud.	If a person is already weak, then further weakness is added, or else another sickness besides hydrops: as when there is coughing, or loosening of the eyes, and similar things: then be careful not to treat him with iron: for that is feared.
Si autem uides infirmum exuberantis uirtutis, neque est cum eo aegritudo praeter Hydropisim solam: et non est puer, neque senex: tunc modus operationis in eo est, ut tu eleues infirmum stantem inter manus tuas, et minister post ipsum exprimat uentrem eius manu sua impellendo aquam ad inferiorem partem pectinis.	But if you see a person with a vigor of health, and there is no illness besides hydrops: and he is not a boy, nor an old man: then the manner of operation in him is, that you should stand him upright between your hands, and let him spit out water with his own hand driving it to the lower part of the chest.
Deinde accipe spatumile spinosum, secundum hanc formam.	Then take a bent pitchfork, shaped like this.
Sit duarum partium acutarum, longum, acutae extremitatis sicut Spatumile.	Set the two acute ends, one long, and the acute end like a pitchfork.
Verumtamen in eo sit quiddam breuitatis paulatim, ut non pertranseas cum eo apud operationem usque ad intestinum, et laedas ipsum.	But in him there is something of a hiccup now and then, so that he does not disturb you while you are operating inside the abdomen, and let him go.
Deinde considera.	Then consider.
Nam si est generatio Hydropisis ex parte intestinorum, tunc oportet ut elongeris cum sectione ab umbilico quantitate trium digitorum, ad inferiora in directo eius supra pectinem.	For if the generation of hydrops is from the part of the intestines, then it should be extended with a section of three fingers' length from the navel, towards the lower part directly above the chest.
Si uero generatio Hydropisis est propter aegritudinem epatis: tunc sit sectio tua sinistra ab umbilico tribus digitis.	But if the generation of hydrops is because of liver illness: then your section should be left from the navel by three fingers' length.
Et si generatio eius est propter splenem, tunc sit sectio in latere dextro: et non oportet etiam ut sit sectio in latere super quod uult iacere infirmus, ut non currant superfluitates ad illum locum debilem.	And if the generation of it is because of the spleen: then your section should be on the right side: and there should also not be a section above where the sick person lies, so that fluids do not flow to that weak place.
Deinde perfora cum instrumento cutem totam.	Then pierce with an instrument the whole skin.
Deinde intromitte in illam sectionem, et eleua manum tuam cum Spatumili inter cutem, et sifac, quasi tu excories ipsum: et sit quantitas quae excoriatur quantitas unguis, aut circiter ilud.	Then introduce into that section, and push with your hand with the pitchfork as if you were scaring him out: and let the quantity that is scraped be the quantity of a nail, or around that part.
Deinde perfora sifac, donec perueniat Spatumile ad locum uacuum: et est locus aquae.	Then pierce the skin, until the pitchfork reaches a empty place: and there is a place of water.
Deinde extrahe ipsum, et intromitte in foramen instrumentum, cuius haec est forma.	Then draw him out, and introduce into a hole an instrument, which has this form.
Et est simile cannulae: fit ex argento, aut aere, aut aurichalco, lene, tersum: cui in inferiori parte sui est foramen paruum, et in lateribus eius sunt tria foramina, duo ab una parte, et unum a parte altera: et facia est extremitas eius incisa, secundum modum incisionis calami, sicut uides: in extremitate eius superiore est armilla.	It is made like a tube: it is made of silver, or brass, or gold, or wood, or tar: it has a small hole on its lower part, and three holes on its sides, two from one side and one from the other; and its ends are incised in the form of the incision of a calamus, as you see: at its upper end there is an annulus.
Nam quando instrumentum peruenit ad aquam, tunc ipsa descendit statim super instrumentum, ergo euacua ex aqua in hora quantitatem mediam.	For when the instrument reaches water, it immediately descends on top of the instrument, and so it evacs water from water in an average quantity.
Quoniam si tu euacuas ex ea plus quam oportet, in hora fortasse moritur infirmus per resolutionem spiritus sui animalis: aut accidit ei syncopis quae appropinquat morti.	For if you evacuate it more than is necessary, perhaps a sick person will die because of the resolution of his animal spirit: or it may happen to him that a fainting attack comes close to death.
Verum euacua ex ea secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius, et secundum quod significant tibi dispositiones infirmi ex uirtute pulsus eius, et ex bonitate eius.	But you should evacuate it according to the strength of its pulse and according to what I tell you about the dispositions of the infirm from its force and goodness.
Deinde extrahe instrumentum, et retine aquam.	Then remove the instrument, and hold back the water.
Quod est, quia retinetur statim propter cutem quae retinet foramen quod est super sifac: de quo narraui, ut perfores ipsum secundum illum modum.	That is, because it retains immediately by the skin that retains the hole that is over the sifac: of which I have told you, so do you perform it according to that method.
Deinde itera instrumentum die altero, si uides infirmum tolerare illud: et extrahe etiam ex aqua quantitatem paruam.	Then repeat the instrument on the other side, if you see the infirm person tolerate it: and remove it too from water in a small quantity.
Fac illud diebus aliquot sine timore, et custodi te ab errore: donec non remaneat ex aqua nisi parum.	Do it on days for a while without fear, and guard yourself from mistake: until you do not remain in the water except a little.
Si autem times super infirmum, et dimittis ex aqua rem multam: tunc cura ipsum cum sepultura in harena calida, et sudore multo in balneo et sole, et expectet super sitim: et cura ipsum cum medicinis exiccatiuis, donec sanetur: et cauteriza super stomachum, et epar, et splenem, post extractionem aquae: secundum quod narraui in eo quod praecessit.	But if you are able to be on top of the infirm person, and let go of a large amount of water: then take care of him with burial in warm sand, and with much sweat in a bath and in the sun, and let him wait on hunger: and take care of him with dried doctors, until he heals: and cauterize over his stomach, and his spleen, and his liver, after removing the water: according to what I have told you before.
¶ De cura infantium qui nascuntur locis urinae eorum non perforatis.	For the care of infants who are born in places that do not pierce their navels.
Caput LV.	Chapter 50.
Quando egreditur aliquis infantium ex uentre matris suae, et caput mutonis eius est non perforatum, aut est foramen strictum, aut in non suo loco.	When any child issues from its mother's womb, and its head is not pierced, or the opening is tight, or it is not in its proper place.
Oportet ergo succurrere cum perforatione eius statim cum nascitur cum Spatumili subtili ualde, secundum hanc formam.	Therefore one should assist with the piercing of that head as soon as it is born with a sharp scalpel, according to this form.
Deinde pone in foramine clauum subtilem ex plumbo, et liga ipsum: et tene ipsum tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then put a small clamp from lead into the opening and bind it up: and hold it for three days, or four.
Quando ergo uult urinam emittere, remoueatur, et mingat.	When then he wants to emit urine, remove it, and let it go.
Deinde reduc ipsum.	Then reduce that person.
Et si tu non ponis plumbum, iam possibile est, ut urina quae incedit super locum, non permittat ipsum claudi.	And if you do not put lead on, it is possible that the urine which has escaped should not permit the opening to close.
Ille autem cuius foramen est strictum, medicatur cum plumbo, sicut diximus, diebus multis, donec amplificetur.	But that person whose opening is tight, he treats it with lead, as we have said, for many days, until it increases.
Illi autem in quibus est foramen in non suo loco, laeduntur.	But those who have an opening not in its proper place are injured.
Quod est, quia ex eis qui nascitur, foramen est apud finem capitis uirgae: quare non potest mingere ad anteriora, donec eleuat uirgam manu sua ad superiora.	Which is, because out of those who are born, the opening is at the end of the penis: so it cannot urinate ahead, until it raises its penis by hand to the top.
Neque est ei generatio, propterea, quod sperma non potest peruenire ad matricem secundum rectitudinem: et est aegritudo foeda ualde.	And there is no generation for him, therefore his semen cannot reach the mother according to its straightness: and it is a foul disease.
Et modus operationis in illo est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum.	And the method of operation in that person is, so that he lays himself down on his back.
Deinde extende caput uirgae eius manu tua sinistra extensione uehementi, et incide caput capitis uirgae ex loco priapi, cum acumine, aut spatumili acuto: sicut est incisio calami, aut sicut tu radis aliquid, ut medium eius ueniat simile capiti uirgae: et ut cadat foramen in medio secundum quod oportet.	Then extend the person's penis with your left hand by a strong extension, and cut off the head of the penis from the proper place with an ace or a sharp scalpel: as is the incision of a pen or as you cut some herb, so that its middle resembles the head of the penis: and let it fall into the opening in the middle according to what should be.
Et caue tibi apud operationem tuam a fluxu sanguinis.	And keep yourself from the flow of blood during your operation.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	This often happens.
Oppone ergo ei cum eo quod abscindit sanguinem, et cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	So then you have to cut off the blood with it, and take care of the wound, until it is healed.
¶ De Albather quae accidunt in praeputio et capite uigae, et corruptione, nigredine, et adhaerentia.	Regarding the wounds that occur on the foreskin and the scalp, as well as corruption, blackening, and adhesions.
Caput LVI.	Regarding the wounds that occur on the foreskin and the scalp, as
Multotiens accidunt istae Albather in uirga, et est eminentia carnis foedae.	These wounds of the prepuce and scalp often cause a bad smell from the flesh.
Et ex ea alia est maligna, et alia non maligna.	And from it there is one that is evil and one that is not evil.
Non malignam ergo oportet ut suspendas cum uncino subtili, et abscindas eam, donec mundes eam totam.	Therefore, you should hang it with a delicate hook and cut it off entirely until it is completely clean.
Deinde pone super eam cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio.	Then put on top of it a basket immersed in Egyptian ointment.
Deinde cura ipsum post illud cum unguento dyafinicon, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound after that with ointment of dill and let it heal.
Quod si Albather est maligna, foedi coloris, tunc oportet ut administres in ea cauterium post incisionem eius et ipsius rasionem.	If the Albather is evil and its color is dark, then you should administer cauterization after incising it and shaving it.
Si autem Albather est in praeputio captiui, non circumcisi, et est pars Albather inter praeputium, et pars eius extra: tunc oportet ut auferas Albather, quae est intus in primis, donec quando consolidatur, tunc cura ipsum exterius: quoniam quando tu curas eam simul, non securatur praeputium quin preforetur.	If, however, the Albather is caught in the foreskin and not circumcised, and a part of it is inside the foreskin and a part outside: then you should remove the Albather that is within until it hardens, and then take care of the one outside: for if you take care of it at the same time, the foreskin does not heal.
Et iam accidunt etiam in testiculis, et praeputio nigredo et corruptio.	And there are also wounds on the testicles and blackness and corruption on the foreskin.
Oportet ergo, ut tu concaues totum quod iam denigratum est, et quod uult corrumpi, aut iam corruptum est.	Therefore, you should take care of all that which has been damaged, and what is inclined to corrupt, or that which has already been corrupted.
Deinde line super ipsum post illud cum melle quod iam concussum est cum farina corticum granatorum, et herbi tritorum cribellatorum.	Then cover the wound with a bandage of honey that has already been crushed with wheat flour and dried with dried herbs.
Deinde cura illud cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of that one with the remaining cure until it heals.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra cauterium cum cauterio lunari, secundum hanc formam.	If, however, a flow of blood occurs, then administer cauterization with lunar caustics, according to this form.
Cauterium enim est iuuatiuum ad duas dispositiones simul, scilicet ad fluxum sanguinis, et uulnus quando corrumpitur.	For the cauterization is useful for two things at the same time, namely to stop the flow of blood and to heal when it has been corrupted.
Quod si corroditur caput uirgae, et destruitur totum in hora: tunc oportet ut intromittas in meatum priapi cannulam ex plumbo, ut mingat infirmus super eam.	If the head of the foreskin is corrodes and destroys it all in one hour: then you should insert a plumbous cannula into the meatus so that it may drain the disease from it.
In adhaerentia uero praeputii cum capite uirgae, et haec quidem adhaerentia non accidit, nisi in eo cuius praeputium est sanum, et non exigitur super ipsum circumcisio: et quandoque accidit adhaerentia propter uulnus, aut apostema: oportet ergo ut excories eam cum Spatumili obtuso, donec soluatur ligamentum, et liberetur caput uirgae ab omni parte.	Yet the prepuce adheres to the head of the penis, and this adhesion does not occur unless the prepuce is healthy, and circumcision is not required on it; and when an adhesion occurs because of a splinter or abcess, one should cut it off with an obtuse chisel until the ligament is released, and free the head of the penis from all sides.
Quod si est difficile discernere ea exquisite, tunc oportet ut excories aliquid ex capite uirgae, et ex praeputio.	If it is difficult to distinguish it carefully, then one should cut off something from the head of the penis and from the prepuce.
Quod est, quia praeputium quando est subtile, fortasse perforatur propter subtilitatem suam uelociter.	That is, because when the foreskin is thin, it may be pierced quickly due to its thinness.
Deinde separa inter praeputium, et caput uirgae cum panno lini subtili, qui iam madefactus est in aqua frigida, ut non adhereant iterum.	Then separate the prepuce, and with a thin linen cloth, which has already been wet with cold water, so that it does not adhere again.
Deinde curetur cum uino stiptico, donec consolidetur.	Then cure with wine vinegar until it hardens.
¶ De mundificatione infantium, et curatione ex errore eis accidente.	Regarding the purification of infants and treatment for mistake due to accident.
Caput LVII.	Chapter LVII.
Circumcisio non est solutio continuitatis, sicut reliqua uulnera: uerumtamen cum sit ex operatione nostra, uoluntate nostra, et usus eius sit in pueris proprie, est necesse ut signemus in ea operationem meliorem, et uiam leuiorem perducentem ad salutem.	Circumcision is not a cure for continence, like the other wounds; however, as it is the result of our desire and its use is in boys on their own, we must mark this operation as superior and more beneficial, leading to health.
Dico ergo, quod antiqui non dixerunt circumcisionem in aliquo suorum librorum: quoniam non utuntur in legibus suis, et non est nisi quod acquisiuimus per experimentum.	I say, that the ancient ones did not speak of circumcision in any of their books: for they do not use it in their laws, and it is only what we have acquired through experience.
Quod est, quia ego inueni maiorem partem artificum, et phlebotomatorum uti mundificatione, circumcidendo cum nouacula, et cum forficibus: et utuntur alfecati, et ligaudo cum filo, et incisione cum ungula.	That is, because I have found most of the arts, and the use of phlebotomy and cleaning with a knife, circumcising with a scalpel, and binding with thread, and cutting with a nail.
Et ego quidem iam probaui omnes istos modos, et non inueni meliorem mundificatione cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo.	I have also tested all these methods, and I did not find a better purification than circumcision with a scalpel and binding with thread.
Quoniam in mundificatione cum nouacula, multotiens effugit cutis.	For in purification with a knife, the skin often runs away.
Quoniam cutis praeputii duas habet tunicas: ergo forsitan inciditur cutis superior, et temanet tunica inferior: cogitur ergo ad incisionem ad incidendum alteram, et dolorem futurum.	For the skin of the prepuce has two tunics; therefore perhaps it may be cut on the upper skin, and the lower tunic may be left untouched: let us then consider how to make an incision in order to cut the other one, and what pain will ensue.
Et cum mundificatione quae fit per alfecati, id est, digitalis, quo utuntur sutores, non securatur incisio extremitatis uirilis membri: quoniam fortasse ingreditur in foramen eius.	And when the cleaning was done by the afecat, that is to say, the finger, with which the surgeons use to cut, does not secure the incision at the extremities of the male member: for perhaps it enters into the pore of him.
In mundificatione autem cum ungula, fortasse euadit ferrum, et corrumpit operationem tuam: et cutis quidem pueri est breuis natura, et multotiens nascuntur taliter, quod non indigent mundificatione: et iam uidi illud.	But in the cleaning with the nail, perhaps he will hurt the iron, and will ruin your work; and the skin of the boy is short by nature, and many times arise in this way, so that they do not need to be cleaned: and I have seen it too often happen.
Mundificationis autem cum forficibus, et ligamento cum filo, bonum experimentum detexit mihi: quoniam forfices sunt proportionalis incisionis: propterea, quod acuitas quae est superius, est sicut acuitas quae est inferius.	But in the cleaning with scissors and a thread with a ligature, good experience has shown me that it is: because the sharpness that is above is like the sharpness that is below.
Cum ergo premis manum tuam, proportionantur duae acuitates, et incidunt secundum operationem unam in tempore uno: et fit compressio simili figura, continens cutem uirgae ab omni parte, cum qua non cadit error omnino.	But when you press your hand with the same pressure, the two sharpnesses will be proportional and will make one incision at the same time; and it is made a compression of the same shape, containing the skin of the penis from all sides, so that there is no mistake at all.
Et modus operationis propriae est, ut facias extimare, puerum praecipue, si est ex eis qui intelligunt parumper, quod tu non facis, nisi quod ligas filum in uirga sua tantum: et dimittas ipsum usque ad diem alium.	And the mode of operation is its own, so that you can guess, especially if it is from those who understand to a small extent, that you do not do; unless you tie the thread on his penis only: and let him go until another day.
Deinde fac eum gaudere et laetari omnimodo quo possibile est tibi illud, ex eo quod recipit intelligentia sua.	Then make him happy and rejoice in all ways that are possible for you to do so, because he receives his intelligence.
Deinde fac eum stare inter manus tuas praeparatae staturae, et non sit sedens: et occulta forfices in manica tua, aut sub pede tuo, ne uideat eos puer omnino, neque aliquid ex instrumentis.	Then make him stand between your hands which are prepared to stand, and not sitting down: and hide the scissors in your sleeve or under your foot, so that he does not see them at all; and nothing from the instruments.
Deinde intromitte manum tuam ad uirgam eius, et suffla in cutem, et trahe eam sursum, donec egrediatur caput uirgae.	Then introduce your hand into his penis, and blow on the skin, and pull it up until the head of the penis comes out.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex eo quod aggregatur in ea sordicie.	Then clean it out with something sharp.
Deinde liga locum signatum cum filo duplo.	Then bind up the wounded place with a double knot.
Postea liga inferius eo parumper ligamentum secundum.	Then bind below with about the same amount of thread as before.
Deinde tene cum indice tuo, et pollice locum ligamenti inferioris retentione bona, et incide inter duo ligamenta.	Then hold it with your index finger and press down on the lower ligature to make sure it is secure, and then cut between the two ligatures.
Deinde eleua cutem sursum uelociter, et extrahe caput uirgae.	Then wash the wound with a little water quickly, and remove the head of the hair.
Deinde dimitte sanguinem currere paulatim (est enim melius) et pone puluerem desuper: et super puluerem pannum in quo expansus est uitellus oui decocti in aqua rosata, concussum cum oleo ros recenti bono: et dimitte eum super ipsum usque ad diem alium: et cura ipsum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then let the blood run slowly (for it is better) and put dust on top: and over the dust spread a cloth that has been spread out flat, and wet with rose water, and mixed with good oil from a rose: and leave it on top until another day: and care for the rest of the wound with medicine, until it heals.
Forma autem forficis ad mundificationem haec est.	The shape of the forceps for cleaning is like this.
Sint hebetes duae extremitates, et sint incidentes: ne egrediatur in eis ramus claui: et sit longitudo duarum acuitatum, sicut longitudo duorum manubriorum aequaliter.	The two tips should be pointed, and they should meet together: let there not project on either side of the forceps any sharp points: and the length of the two points should be equal, like the length of the two handles.
Error uero cadens in mundificatione est: quoniam fortasse effugit cutis intrinseca tota, aut pars eius apud incisionem.	But a fall while cleaning is dangerous: for perhaps it will miss the whole skin, or a part of it near the cut.
Ergo oportet, ut extendas eam ex hora tua cum ungue tuo ante apostemationem loci: et incidas eam secundum aequalitatem.	Therefore you should spread her out from your own body with your finger before the examination of the place: and cut her according to equality.
Quod si non potes tenere eam cum ungue tuo, tunc extrahe eam cum uncino, et incide eam.	If you cannot hold it with your finger, then get a forceps and cut it.
Si autem praeterierint ei tres dies, et remanet quod est sub uirga inflatum, apostematum: tunc dimitte illud, donec sedetur apostema calidum, et excoria illud cum facilitate, et incide illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi: et caue tibi a capite uirgae.	If however it has gone past three days, and what is under the hair is swollen, then let go of that, until the swelling goes down, and the scabs have come off with ease, and cut it according to your preparation: and make sure you wash the head from the hairline.
Non enim nocebit ei illud.	For that will not harm it.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod consolidat uulnus ex pulueribus, quos narrauimus in tractatu de pulueribus: et si inciditur ex cute supra mensuram, et euadit ad superiora, non nocet ei illud etiam.	So take care with that, when the skin has hardened from the powder, which we described in the book on powders: and if it cuts above the line of the wound, and projects upward, it does not hurt it either.
Cura ergo illud cum eo quod diximus, donec sanetur.	Then take care of this one with what we have said, until it is healed.
¶ De extractione Vrinae retentae in uesica.	On the Extraction of a Peg from the Urine Bladder.
Caput LVIII.	Head LVIII.
Urinae retentio in uesica, fit ab opilatione facta ex lapide, aut sanguine congelato, aut pus, aut carne nata, et similibus illis ex eis quae diximus ex modis curationis in diuisione.	Retention of urine in the bladder is caused by a pebble lodged in it, or by congealed blood, pus, or flesh grown there, and other like causes which we have mentioned under the different methods of cure.
Et si non soluitur Vrina, et uides retentionem eius esse propter Lapidem, qui iam est in collo uesicae: tunc oportet ut sit infirmus super genua sua curuatus.	And if (the urine) is not relieved and there is a pebble in the bladder which has lodged in the neck of the bladder, then the patient should be bed-ridden.
Deinde componantur pedes eius super dorsum eius, et extendat uentrem suum ex superiori parte dorsi eius, et stringat infirmus anhelitum suum quantum possibile est ei.	Then he shall put his feet upon his bed and stretch out his stomach from the upper part of his back and shall restrain his desire to defecate as much as possible.
Cogitur ergo cum collo uesicae ad expulsionem Lapidis ad posteriora: quare absoluitur Vrina.	Then let him be brought to the back, for the expulsion of the pebble in the bladder towards the rear; wherefore the urine is relieved.
Quod si non soluitur cum eo quod diximus, et uehemens sit res super infirmum: tunc oportet ut administres extractionem eius cum instrumento, quod nominatur siringa, cuius haec est forma Sit ex argento, et sit subtile, lene, concauum sicut cannula pennae auis in subtilitate radii, longum in similitudine palmi unius et medii: cui sit cannula subtilis in capite eius.	If it is not relieved by what we have said and the patient's condition is dangerous, then let an extraction be made with a instrument which is called a syringe, whose shape is of silver, and let it be fine, smooth, and cut like the feather of a bird in subtility of radius, long in similarity to the palm of a hand and half that length; having a subtile cannula at its head.
Et modus exitus Vrinae per ipsum est, ut accipias filum duplicatum, et liges in extremitate eius lanam, aut cotum, ligatura bona: et intromittas extremitatem fili in inferiori parte Siringae: et incide cum forficibus si superfluit aliquid ex lana, uerum intromitte in cannulam cum uehementia, sicut alzer.	And the mode of passage of the urine through it is this: that you take a double thread, and fasten it at its end with good twine or cotton-thread; and push the end into the lower part of the syringe: and strike with the nippers if there be any thread out of the wool, for truly you shall push it into the cannula with an effort.
Deinde inunge siringam cum oleo, aut cum butyro, et albugine oui: et fac sedere infirmum super sedem, et embroca uesicam, et ipsius uirgam cum oleis humidis, et oleo oliuae, et aqua tepida.	Then dip the syringe in oil, or butter, or alum, and make the patient sit on a chair, and insert the bladder into the syringe, and his penis with the wet oils, and olive oil, and warm water.
Deinde intromitte siringam in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat ad radicem uirgae.	Then introduce the syringe into the penis with ease, until it reaches the root of the penis.
Deinde dupla ipsam superius a parte umbilici.	Then double the length by adding to the top from the navel.
Deinde impelle siringam intra ipsam, donec perueniat ad Vesicam, et sentiat eam infirmus iam peruenisse ad rem uacuam: et non fit hoc secundum hunc ordinem, nisi quoniam meatus, in quo uadit, est in quo est tortuositas.	Then push the syringe into itself, until it reaches the bladder, and feel that it has already begun to clear up its contents: and do not do this according to this order, unless because of the curvature, in which place you put it, is in that place where there is a curvature.
Deinde extende filum cum lana paulatim.	Then extend the thread slowly with wool.
Vrina enim sequetur lanam.	For the thread follows the wool.
Deinde extrahe eam, et fac currere Vrinam per uiam urinae: et itera siringam, et non cesses facere illud, donec euacuetur uesica, et inueniat infirmus alleuiationem.	Then draw it out and make the thread run through the urinary canal: and repeat this operation with the syringe, and do not cease doing this until the bladder is emptied, and you feel relief of the pain.
¶ De qualitate clisterizationis uesicae cum Clepshydra.	Regarding the quality of cleansing the bladder with a clepsydra.
Caput LIX.	Chapter LIX.
Quando accidit in uesica ulcus, aut sanguis in ea congelatur, aut coartatur in ea pus, et uis distillare in eam aquas et medicinas: tunc fiat cum instrumento quod nominatur Clepshydra, et haec est forma eius.	When there is a wound in the bladder, or blood freezes up in it, or pus is gathered in it, and water distills into it along with medicines: then make use of the instrument called a clepsydra, which has this shape.
Est enim surda, id est, clausa.	It is a closed vessel.
Et in eo sunt tria foramina, duo ex parte una, et unum ex parte altera, sicut uides.	And within it are three openings, two on the same side, and one on the opposite side, as you see them.
Et locus concauus, in quo est illud quod impellit, sit secundum quantitatem quod opilet ipsum sine additione, donec quando trahitur cum eo aliquid, ex humiditatibus attrahatur: et quando impellitur, cum eo expellatur ad longinquum: secundum quod facit clepshydra, qua proiicitur naphta, id est, ignis graecus in praeliis martis.	And the space where the plunger is placed is on the second quantity that it achieves without addition, until when it is drawn out with it something is attracted from the moisture: and when it is pushed in, expels it far away: as does the clepsydra, which spills the naphtha, that is, the Greek fire in battles.
Cum ergo uis proiicere humiditates in uesicam, intromitte extremitatem clepshydrae in humiditatem, et trahe cum eo quod impellit ad superiora, humiditas enim trahitur in concauitatem clepshydrae.	But when you pour water into the bladder, introduce the end of the clepsydra into the water, and draw it out with that which pushes it up, for water is drawn into the concavity of the clepsydra.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem eius in uirgam, secundum quod narrauimus in siringa.	Then introduce the end of it into the penis, as we described in the syringe.
Deinde impelle humiditatem cum eo quod impellit illa namque humiditas peruenit ad uesicam statim, ita quod sentit eam infirmus.	Then push on moisture with it that pushes her because certainly humidity reaches dryness immediately so that the sick feel it.
Forma clisteris subtilis quo clisterizatur uesica.	Form a thin clot so that the wound is covered.
Fiat ex argento, aut auricalco: cuius caput altius sit simile alcama paruo, et sub eo sinus inter quem cadat ligamentum.	Let it be made of silver or gold: whose head is higher than the corresponding heel by little and below which a pocket is positioned where the ligament falls.
Deinde accipe uesicam arietis, et pone in ea humiditatem, qua uis clisterizare uesicam.	Then take the wool from a ewe, and place moisture on it so that you can form a clot of wool.
Deinde liga eam inter duos sinus ligatura forti cum filo duplo: et calefac illam humiditatem parumper super ignem.	Then tie her between two pockets with strong twine: and heat her slightly with moisture over fire.
Deinde intromitte extremitatem clisteris in uirgam, postea stringe manum tuam super uesicam cum humiditate strictura decenti, donec sentiat infirmus, quod illa humiditas iam peruenit ad uesicam.	Then insert the tip of the clot into the penis, then tighten your hand on the wound with a tightening motion as the moisture drains, until the sick person feels that the moisture has already reached the wound.
Si autem non est tibi praesens uesica, tunc accipe frustum pergameni, et fac ex eo circulum, et perfora ipsum ab omni rotunditate sua.	If you do not have a present wound, then take a piece of parchment, and make it into a circle, and pierce it from all its roundness.
Deinde intromitte filum forte in illis foraminibus, sicut reuoluuntur.	Then insert a strong thread in these holes, as they turn.
Deinde aggrega circulum, sicut aggregatur alsofratu: postquam tu ponis in eo illud quod uis ex humiditatibus, et oleis, et aquis.	Then bring the circle together, like you do with an arrow: when you place it in there that you took from the moisture, and oils, and waters.
Deinde liga ipsum in instrumento: et fac cum eo sicut fecisti cum uesica ex expressione cum manu tua, donec perueniat humiditas ad uesicam.	Then tie it together with the instrument: and make it like you did with the wound from the expression with your hand, until the moisture has reached the wound.
¶ De extractione Lapidis.	§ De the extraction of Stone.
Caput LX.	Chapt. L.X.
Iam diximus in diuisione species Lapidis, et curationem eius cum medicinis: et dixi differentiam inter Lapidem generatum in renibus, et uesica, et signa illius totius: et dixi Lapidem in quo cadit operatio cum manu et sectio: et est Lapis generatus in uesica proprie: et ille qui figitur in uirga: et ego sum narrans illud cum expositione manifesta et abbreuiatione.	I have already spoken in the division of the species of stone, and the treatment thereof with medicines: and I have distinguished between the stone generated in the kidneys, and the wound, and the signs of all that; and I have described the stone which is generated in the wound by hand, and the section: and this is a stone generated in the wound in itself: and that which is figured on the bush: and I am relating it with evident exposition and abbreviation.
Dico ergo, quod Lapis generatus in uesica, plurimum accidit pueris.	I therefore say, that the stone generated in the wound, often happens to boys.
Et ex signis eius est, quod urina egreditur ex uesica similis aquae in subtilitate sua: et apparet in ea harena alba, et fricat infirmus uirgam suam, et laborat cum ea, et multotiens pendet.	From the symptoms it is apparent that urine flows from the penis like water of a certain subtlety: and in it appears white sand; and the weak man grates his penis, struggles with it, and hangs it often.
Deinde erigitur, et egreditur cum eo anus in multis eorum.	Then it stands erect, and moves along with it the anus in many of them.
Et est facilis sanatio puerorum, ex eo usquequo consequuntur quatuordecim annos.	And it is an easy cure for boys until they reach the age of fourteen years.
Et est difficilis in senibus.	And it is difficult in old men.
In iuuenibus autem est media, in eo quod est inter illud: et eius cuius Lapis est maior, curatio facilior: et si paruus, est econuerso illius cura.	But in the young it is medio-grade, in that it lies between that and this; and its cure is easier if it is small, and if not, it is a difficult cure.
Cum ergo peruenimus ad curationem, oportet in primis, ut mundificemus infirmum cum clisteri, quod extrahat totum stercus quod est in intestinis suis: ipsum enim quandoque prohibet inuentionem Lapidis apud inquisitionem.	But when we come to the cure, it is necessary at first that we should remove all the dung that is in the intestines by using a clister; for he sometimes prevents the examination of the stone.
Deinde accipiatur infirmus cum pedibus suis, et concutiatur, et moueatur ad inferiora: ut descendat Lapis ad profundum uesicae, aut saliat de loco alto aliquotiens.	Then let the sick man take his feet and tremble, and move about downwardly; that the stone may fall into the depths of the bladder or sometimes flow out from its high place.
Deinde fac eum sedere inter manus tuas praeparatum, et manus eius sint sub coxis ipsius, ut fiat uesica tota decliuis ad inferiora.	Then let him sit between your hands and let his knees be under his back so that the bladder may all run downward towards the loins.
Deinde perquire eum, et tange eum extrinsecus.	Then examine it and feel it from without.
Si ergo sentis Lapidem in spacio, tunc propera statim cum sectione super ipsum.	If you feel the stone in the space, then cut it immediately from above.
Quod si non cadat sub tactu tuo omnino, tunc oportet ut abstergas digitum indicem cum oleo manus sinistrae, si infirmus est puer: aut digitum medium si est iuuenis completus: et intromittas ipsum in anum suum, et perquire de Lapide, donec stat sub digito tuo: et conuerte eum paulatim ad collum uesicae.	If it does not come under your hand at all, then you should wipe the finger with oil from your left hand if the sick boy is; or with the middle finger if he is a full-grown man: and insert it in his anus, and examine the stone until it stands under your finger: and turn it little by little towards the bladder neck.
Deinde preme super ipsum cum digito tuo, et impelle ipsum ad exteriora aduersus locus, cuius sectionem uis: et praecipe ministro, ut premat uesicam manu sua, et praecipe alii ministro, ut extendat testiculos manu sua dextra ad superiora: et alia manu sua, ut remoueat cutem, quae est sub testiculis in parte a loco in quo est sectio.	Then press the stone with your finger and push it towards the outside against that place which you examine: and let one minister hold the bladder open by hand, and another let hold up the testicles by the right hand to their upper part: and with the hand let him remove the skin that is under the testicles in the place where the section lies.
Deinde intromitte Spatumile incidens, cuius forma haec est.	Then insert the Spatula incidente, whose shape is this one.
Et finde in eo quod est inter anum et testiculos, et non in medio, ad latus natis sinistrae: et sit sectio super ipsum lapidem, et digitus tuus sit in ano: et fiat sectio transuersa, ut sit sectio exterius ampla, et interius stricta, secundum quantitatem quod sit possibile egressio Lapidis ex ea non maior.	And find in it what is between the testicles and the inguinal ring, and not in the middle, on the left side of the birth canal: and let the cut be made over that stone, and your finger be placed in the anus: and let the cutting be done across, so that the outside cutting is wide, and the inside is tight, according to the quantity which it is possible for the stone to come out from there without being larger.
Fortasse enim comprimit digitus, qui est in ano Lapidem apud sectionem, et egreditur absque difficultate.	Perhaps the finger, which is in the anus near the cutting, will be squeezed and will come out without difficulty.
Et scias, quod ex Lapide est cui sunt anguli et margines, quare fit difficilis exitus eius propter illud.	And you know that of the stone whose corners and edges there are, it is difficult for it to come out because of that.
Et ex eo est lenis, similis glandulae, et rotundus: et fit facilis egressus eius.	And from it comes a soft substance like a gland, and round: and its exit is easy.
Ei ergo cui sunt anguli, et margines, adde in fissura.	So then to those whose corners and edges there are, add in the opening.
Quod si non egreditur ita, tunc oportet ut ingenies super ipsum: aut stringas super eum cum gesti decenter, cuius extremitas sit sicut Luna, quae stringat super Lapidem, et non euadat ab ea: aut ut intromittas sub eo instrumentum subtile, curuatae extremitatis.	If it does not come out in this way, then you must make a cut on top of it: or you may twist it with a awkward movement, the end of which is like the Moon, which twists over the stone and does not slip away from it: or you may insert under it a thin instrument, with curved ends.
Si autem non potes super cum, tunc amplifica foramen parumper.	If you cannot do that above, then widen the opening slightly.
Quod si uincit te aliquid ex sanguine, abscinde ipsum cum zegi.	That if something from the blood wins you over, cut off the stone while it is still alive.
Si uero lapis est plus quam unus, tunc impelle in primis magnum ad os uesicae.	If, however, the stone is more than one, then push it into the first large opening of the urethra.
Deinde incide super ipsum.	Then cut over the top of the stone.
Postea impelle paruum post illud: et similiter fac si sunt plures duobus.	Then push a little behind it: and do the same if there are more than two of them.
Quod si magnus est ualde, tunc ignorantia est ut seces super ipsum sectione magna.	That if it is very large, then ignorance is how to cut over the top with a wide cutting.
Quoniam accidit infirmo una duarum rerum, aut ut moriatur, aut accidit ei distillatio urinae assidua: proptera, quia non consolidatur locus omnino.	Because it has happened that someone is between two things, or so that he dies, or his urine distills frequently: soon, because the place does not consolidate at all.
Verum administra expulsionem eius, donec egrediatur: aut ingenia in fractura eius cum forficibus, donec extrahas eum frustatim.	But give him an expulsion of it until he comes out: or make a break in it with forceps, until you pull it out quickly.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc imple uulnus thure, et aloe, et sanguine draconis: et stringe ipsum, et pone super ipsum pannum infusum oleo et uino, aut oleo rosato, et aqua frigida: ut sedetur apostema calidum.	When you have thus completed your operation, then fill the wound with thורות, and with aloe, and with dragon's blood: and bind it tightly, and put a cloth soaked in oil and wine upon it, or oil of roses, and cold water: that an apothecary may be sedated by the heat.
Deinde resupina infirmum super collum suum, et non soluas ligamentum, usque ad diem tertium.	Then wrap the patient's neck well, and do not loosen the ligature until the third day.
Cum ergo solueris ipsum, embroca locum cum aqua, et oleo multo.	When you have loosed him, then moisten the place with much oil and water.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguento dyafinicon, et unguento basilicon, donec sanetur.	Then care for the patient with the dyffinicon ointment and the basilicon ointment, until he is healed.
Si autem accidit in uulnere apostema calidum additum, et corrosi, et illi similia: sicut si congeletur sanguis in uesica, et prohibeatur ex eo urina: et cognoscitur illud ex egressione sanguinis cum urina.	But if the wound is hot and swollen and there are similar symptoms: let it be known by the emission of blood with urine. And let it be recognized by the exit of blood mixed with urine.
Intromitte ergo digitum tuum in uulnus, et extrahe illum sanguinem.	Then insert your finger into the wound and draw out the blood.
Nam si remanet, prouocat ad corruptionem uesicae, et putrefactionem eius.	For if any remain, it incites to the corruption of the skin, and the putrefaction of its meat.
Deinde ablue uulnus cum aceto, et aqua, et sale: et oppone omni speciei cum eo quod conuenit ex curatione, usquequo sanetur.	Then wash the wound with vinegar, and water, and salt: and oppose to it all kinds of things that are suitable to the cure, until it is healed.
Et oportet in horis curationis totius, ut liges duas coxas, et aggreges, caussa medicinarum quae ponuntur super locum.	And during the hours of cure throughout the whole body, bind two hips and joints, because medicines laid upon the place cause a swelling.
Quod si lapis est paruus, et sit in meatu uirgae, et figitur in eo, et prohibetur urinae exitus: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod narro antequam peruenias ad sectionem.	If it is hard and sits in the meatus of the urethra, and gets hardened therein, and prevents the exit of urine: then care for the patient with it as you go to cut it open.
Multotiens enim a sectione excusaris per hanc curationem, iam enim probaui illud.	For often there is little advantage from this cure after dissection: for I have tried it many times.
Et est, ut accipias Perforatorium ex ferro alferico, cuius haec est forma, triangulatae extremitatis, acutum, fixum in ligno.	And consider the Perforatorium of the iron worker which is of this shape, triangular ends, acute, fixed on a piece of wood.
Deinde accipe filum, et liga cum eo uirgam sub lapide ut non redeat ad uesicam.	Then take a thread and bind it with it under a stone so that it does not return to the urethra.
Deinde intromitte ferrum perforans in uirgam cum facilitate, donec perueniat Perforatorium ad ipsum lapidem: et reuolue Perforatorium manu tua in ipso lapide paulatim: et coneris perforationem eius, donec facias ipsum penetrare a parte altera.	Then insert the piercing iron into the urethra with ease until it reaches the stone: and move the Perforatorium by your hand slowly upon it: and test its piercing, until you make it penetrate from one part to another.
Urina namque absoluitur statim.	He urinated and was immediately cleansed.
Deinde preme manum tuam super illud quod remansit ex lapide ab exteriori parte uirgae.	Then press your hand upon what remains of the stone from the outside of the urethra.
Ipse enim frangitur, et egreditur cum urina, et sanatur infirmus.	For it itself breaks, and passes with the urine, and the sick person is healed.
Si autem non praeparatur tibi haec curatio, propter aliquid quod prohibet ab illo: tunc liga filum sub lapide, et filum aliud supra lapidem.	But if you have not prepared this remedy for yourself because of something that prevents it from being able to pass: then tie a string under the stone and another string above it.
Deinde seca super lapidem in ipsa uirga inter duas ligaturas.	Then dry off above the stone in the urethra between the two ligatures.
Deinde extrahe ipsum.	Then extract it itself.
Postea solue ligamentum, et mundifica sanguinem congelatum, qui fit in uulnere.	Then loosen the ligature, and clean up the frozen blood that formed in the urethra.
Et non est necessarium ligamentum fili sub lapide, nisi ut non redeat ad uesicam: et ligamentum aliud desuper, nisi ut quando soluitur filum post egressionem lapidis, redeat cutis ad locum suum, et cooperiat uulnus: et propter illud necesse est tibi illud quando ligas filum superius, ut eleues cutem ad superiora, ut redeat apud complementum tuum, et cooperiat uulnus, sicut diximus.	And it is not necessary to tie the string under the stone unless it is to be returned to the urethra: and the other string from above, unless when the string is loosened after the stone has passed, the skin returns to its place, and the urethra is covered over, as we have said. Therefore you must tie the upper string, so that the skin returns upwards, so that it covers over with your member, and the urethra is closed up, as we have said.
¶ De extractione Lapidis mulierum.	As for the extraction of the stone in women.
Caput LXI.	Chapter LXI.
Parum generatur Lapis in mulieribus.	Stone is not formed much in women.
Si autem accidat alicui earum lapis, tunc difficilis est curatio, et prohibetur propter modos multos.	But if a stone should happen to form in any of them, the cure is difficult, and is prevented by many means.
Vnus eorum est: quod mulier fortasse est uirgo.	One of them is this: that a woman may be a virgin.
Et secundus est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem quae detegat seipsam medico, quando est casta, aut ex habentibus maritos.	And the second is this: for you do not examine a woman who has taken a lover, if she is chaste, or who has had husbands.
Tertius est, quia tu non inuenis mulierem bene scientem hanc artem, praecipue operationem cum manu.	The third is this: for you do not examine a woman who knows the art well, especially the manual work.
Et quartus est longinquitas a loco lapidis: quare indiget sectione profunda, et in illo est timor.	And the fourth is this: for the stone is far away from the place of the hand: therefore it needs a deep cut, and there is danger in that.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad illud, tunc oportet ut accipias mulierem medicam, bene scientem: et parum inuenitur.	As for if need compels you to do this, then you must take a woman doctor who is well skilled in the art: and there are few of them.
Si uero priuaris ea, tunc quaere medicum castum, subtilem, et praesenta mulierem obstetricem bene doctam in re mulierum, aut mulierem quae in hac arte innuit partem artis: fac ergo eam praesentem, et praecipue ei, ut faciat totum quod praecipis ei ex inquisitione super lapidem.	If, however, you are seriously ill, then ask for a good, skilled doctor; and also a well-informed midwife who is familiar with the matters of women, or one who has some knowledge of this art: so get her present, and especially tell her to do whatever you command from your inquiries about the stone.
In primis quod est, ut aspiciat si mulier est uirgo: tunc oportet ut intromittat digitum in anum eius, et quaerat lapidem.	In first place that is, that she may see if the woman is a virgin: then it should be that she should insert her finger into the opening of her and seek out the stone.
Si ergo inuenit ipsum, coartet eum sub digito suo, et tunc praecipe obstetrici, ut intromittat digitum suum in uuluam infirmae, et inquirat super lapidem, postquam ponit manum suam sinistram super uesicam, et comprimit eam compressione bona.	But if he finds it, he should clamp it under his finger, and then order the midwife to insert her left hand into the opening, and inquire about the stone, after he has placed his right hand on her loins, and сжимает ее сжатием хорошим.
Si ergo inuenit lapidem, tunc oportet ut gradatim moueat eum ab orificio uesicae ad inferiora cum summa uirtutis suae, donec perueniat cum eo ad radicem coxae.	But if he finds the stone, then it should be that he slowly moves it from the opening of the vagina to the lower part with all his strength, until he reaches it with it up to the root of the pelvis.
Deinde secet super eum apud oppositionem medietatis uuluae apud radicem coxae, ex quacunque parte praeparatur ei, et sentit lapidem in illa parte: et digitus eius non remoueatur a lapide, coartans sub eo: et sit sectio parua in primis.	Then he should wipe over it at the place of the middle opening at the root of the pelvis, from whatever side it is prepared and feels the stone in that part; and his finger should not move away from the stone, clamping it underneath: and let a small section be first cut off.
Deinde intromittat radium super illam sectionem.	Then he should insert the arm on top of that small section.
Si ergo sentit lapidem, tunc addat in sectionem secundum quantitatem proportionatam quod lapis egreditur ab ea.	But if he feels the stone, then he should add to the second section an amount proportionate to how much the stone is passed from it.
Et scias, quod species lapidis sunt multae.	And you know that there are many types of stones.
Ex his enim est paruus, et magnus, lenis et asper, longus, et rotundus habens ramos.	For from him there is a small one, and a large one, smooth and rough, long and round, having branches.
Scias ergo species eius, ut significetur tibi per hoc super illud quod uis.	So you know the nature of it, as I have explained to you on that which you wish to understand.
Si ergo uincit te sanguis, tunc adde in loco zegi tritum, et tene ipsum hora una, donec abscindatur sanguis.	But if blood is making you weak, then add to the place of the wound three times and hold it for an hour, until the blood stops flowing.
Deinde redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis: et fac, ut praepares tecum ex instrumentis, quae dixi in extractione lapidis in uiris, ut adiuueris per ea in operatione tua.	Then prepare yourself for the operation until the stone is removed: and make ready the instruments which I have spoken of in the extraction of the stone from the bladder, that you may aid yourself with them in your operation.
Quod si uincit te fluxus sanguinis, et scis quod expulsio sanguinis est ex arteria quae incisa est: tunc pone puluerem super locum, et stringe eum cum puluillis strictura decenti: et non mutes illud: et dimitte lapidem, et non extrahas ipsum.	If it hurts you and you know that the flow of blood comes from the artery that has been cut: then put powder on the place, and tighten it with the powder as it is being pressed down: and do not change this; and let go of the stone, and do not draw it out.
Fortasse enim morietur mulier infirma.	For indeed the weak woman may die.
Deinde cura uulnus.	Then take care of the wound.
Cum ergo sedatur acuitas sanguinis post dies, et putrefit locus, tune redi ad operationem tuam, donec egrediatur lapis.	When, however, the sharpness of the pain has passed and the place has turned bad after a few days: then prepare yourself for your operation until the stone is removed.
¶ De sectione suiper Herniam aquosam.	Regarding the section on cutting above the hernia with water.
Caput LXII.	Chapter LII.
Ramex aquosa non est, nisi aggregatio humiditatis in sifac albo, quod est sub cute testiculi continente ouum: et nominatur sifac.	The ramet is not aqueous, unless there is a gathering of moisture in the shell of the testicle which is enclosed by one skin: and it is called a sifac.
Et quandoque est in panniculo proprio sibi, quem praeparauit ei natura in parte oui, donec putetur: quod est ouum aliud, et est cutis testiculi inter sifac album, quod diximus: et non fit illud nisi raro.	And when it is in its own skin, which nature has prepared for it in part until it puts out: that is another thing, and it is the skin of the testicles between the sifac, which we have said: and it does not do this except rarely.
Et generatio quidem huius ramicis, est ex debilitate quae accidit testiculis: quare effunditur ad eos haec materia.	And the generation of this ramet is from the weakness which occurs in the testes: why this substance is discharged towards them.
Et quandoque accidit ex percussione super testiculos.	And when it comes about from a blow on the testes.
Et haec humiditas est habens colores multos.	And this moisture is having many colors.
Aut enim est color eius decliuis ad citrinitatem, aut est sanguineus rubeus, aut faeculentus, niger, aut est aquosus albus, et est illud quod est plus.	Or, on the other hand, it is a color that declines into sourness, or it is bloody red, or greenish, black, or white watery, and that is what it is that declines more.
Et signa quibus scitur ubi sit aggregatio aquae, sunt ista.	And the signs by which one knows where there is a gathering of water are these.
Nam si est in sifac albo quod diximus, tunc apostema est rotundum ad longitudinem parumper sicut figura oui: et non apparet testiculus, quoniam humiditas continet eum ab omni parte.	For if it is in the shell of the ramet, which we have said, then the swelling is round on all sides like the figure of a ball: and the testicle does not show itself, because moisture contains it from all sides.
Et si est humiditas in panniculo proprio sibi, tunc apostema est rotundum cum parte oui, et propter hoc extimat homo quia est ouum aliud.	And if there is moisture in the skin to itself, then the pustule is round with a part of it, and for this reason men estimate that it is another thing.
Et si humiditas est inter cutem testiculorum et sifac album, tunc cadit sub sensu.	If moisture is between the skin of the testes and the white matter, then he faints.
Quando ergo uis cognitionem coloris humiditatis, tunc experire colorem humiditatis in apostemate cum Intromisso quadrato, cuius forma praecessit.	When, therefore, you wish to know the color of moisture, then feel the color of moisture in the pustule with the square (of the finger), whose shape preceded.
Secundum illud ergo quod egreditur in uestigio Intromissi, iudica de illo quod est inter ipsum.	Accordingly, since it is moved into the dimple of the Square (of the finger), judge about it that it is between itself.
Cum ergo uenimus ad curationem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmo, ut phlebotometur si possibile est ei illud, et uides corpus eius plenum.	When we come to the cure with iron, then it is necessary that you order the sick person to bleed him if possible, and you will see his body full of blood.
Deinde resupinetur super dorsum suum super rem altam parum, et pone sub eo pannos multos.	Then he shall lie down on his back on a high thing a little, and put many cloths under him.
Deinde sede tu super sinistram eius, et praecipe ministro, ut sedeat a dextra eius, qui extendat uirgam eius ad unum duorum laterum cutis testiculorum, et ad partem mirach uentris.	Then sit on his left side, and order the minister to sit on his right side, who shall extend his penis between two sides of skin of the testes, and to the part of the eye of the testicle.
Deinde accipe spatumile latum, et seca cutem testiculorum ex medio per longitudinem, usque prope pectinem: et fiat sectio secundum rectitudinem aequedistantis lineae quae diuidit cutem testiculorum, donec perueniat ad sifac album comprehendens: et excoria ipsum et obserua, uel caue ex hoc, ut seces ipsum: et sit excoriatio tua qua ipsum excorias, ex parte quae suspenditur cum ouo plus: et subtiliter scrutare cum excoriatione secundum quantitatem quod tibi possibile est.	Then take a long spatula, and dry the skin of the testes from the middle in length, up to the chest: and make the section according to a straight line which divides the skin of the testes, until it reaches the white matter encompassing it: and examine the wound yourself, or carefully from this, so that you remove it: and sit the wound of yours on part which hangs with more hair: and scrutinize cautiously with the wound according to quantity what is possible for you.
Deinde perfora sifac plenum aqua perforatione ampla, et extrahe totam aquam.	Then pierce the white matter full of water with a wide perforation, and remove all the water.
Deinde separa inter duo labia sectionis cum uncinis, et extende sifac ad superiora, et non tangas cutem testiculorum comprehendentem: et incide sifac qualitercunque est possibile tibi incidere ipsum, aut cum totalitate sua, aut frustatim, praecipue latus eius subtile.	Then separate between the two lips of the section with a hook, and extend the white matter up, and do not touch the skin of the testes encompassing it: and cut the white matter however you can cut it to you, or with all its totality, but especially its thin side.
Nam si tu non exquisite perscrutaris, in incisione eius non fit securitas, quin aqua redeat.	If you do not know how to examine thoroughly, there will be no security in this incision unless water is applied again.
Si autem procedit ouum exterius a cute sua in hora operationis tuae: tunc quando compleueris sectionem sifac, reduc ipsum.	But if any foreign object comes out of his cut during the time of your operation: then when you have finished the section, reduce the wound.
Deinde aggrega duo labia cutis testiculorum cum sutura.	Then gather together the two lips of the skin of the testicles with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum sicut reliqua uulnera, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound like the rest of the injuries until it heals.
Quod si inuenis ouum corruptum ex nigredine alia, tunc oportet ut liges uasa, quae sunt suspensorium, timens fluxum sanguinis.	But if there is a corruption of the wound with other color, then it should be necessary that the laces which are suspenders, worrying about the flowing of blood.
Deinde abscinde testiculum cum suspensorio, et extrahe ouum: postea cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then cut off the testicle with the suspender and pull out the sperm: then take care of it with what I have said.
Si uero aqua est aggregata in duabus partibus, tunc scias quia sunt duae ramices: seca ergo partem aliam secundum quod fecisti in altera aequaliter.	But if water is aggregated in the two parts, then you should know that there are two branches: so dry one side according to what you have done on the other side equally.
Et si aequatur tibi, ut sit operatio una, tunc fac: deinde absterge sanguinem.	And if it is even with you, as if it were a single operation, then do it: then wash away the blood.
Et intromitte in sectiones lanam submersam in oleo, aut in oleo rosato: et pone deforis lanam aliam quam submersisti in uino et oleo, et expande eam super duos testiculos, et mirach uentris: et pone desuper pannos duplicatos, et sunt puluilli: et liga eos desuper cum ligamento, quod est habens sex secundum hanc formam.	And put in the sections of wool dipped in oil, or in oil rosated: and put a second piece of wool which you have dipped in wine and oil on the top of the two testicles, and spread it out over them, and tie the foreskin above with a thread, which has six threads according to this form.
Deinde sumantur duo panni, et suantur, et impleantur la na carminata, secundum hanc similitudinem: et fiant extremitates quibus premitur ex coto, aut lana humida: et aggregentur cum strictura in lumbari bracharum: et una extremitatum accipiat super anum usque ad dorsum, et secunda accipiat ad partem pectinis: et duae extremitates super duas coxas inferius, et duae extremitates aliae super duo inguina, et aggregetur strictura tota in lumbari bracharum.	Then two towels are laid and stretched, and they are filled with carmine, according to this similarity: and the ends which are pinched by a thong, or by wet wool: and they are gathered with a tightness around the hips of the arms: and one end takes hold on something on the back until it is behind, and the second end takes hold on the side of the skeleton: and two ends take hold on the two thighs below, and another end takes hold on the other two inguines, and all the end takes hold together in the hips of the arms.
Et, quandoque artificialiter medicatur haec ramex cum cauterio loco sectionis cum ferro: et est, ut accipias cauterium cultellare subtile, et seces cum eo cutem testiculorum: et est ignitum, secundum quod narrauimus: donec quando detegitur sifac album continens aquam: tunc accipe cauterium, secundum hanc formam.	And when this thread is used to heal the wound with a caustic iron place of the section with a sharp knife: and it is like that we have told you: until, when it is discovered, there is milk containing water: then take the caustic, according to this form.
Assimilatur literae graecae.	The Greek letter is assimilated.
Deinde perfora cum eo illud sifac, et est ignitum, donec egrediatur humiditas tota.	Then pierce with it that other sifac and it will be kindled, until the whole moisture has gone out.
Deinde extende sifac cum uncinis, et excoria cum cauterio subtili ignito, et incide ipsum secundum quod possibile est tibi, donec eradices totum eius.	Then extend that other sifac with a hook, and scrape with a thin caustic torch, and cut off the same as much as you can, until you have entirely removed it.
Et caue ex ouo, ne tangat ipsum ignis.	And let the poultice not touch his skin, lest he be burned.
Et scias, quod haec operatio est saluior, et longinquior a fluxu sanguinis, et melior quam operatio cum sectione.	And know that this operation is healthier, and further from the flow of blood, and better than the operation with incisions.
Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit in hora sectionis, aut in hora cauterii apostema calidum, aut fluxus sanguinis, aut aliquid aliud: tunc oportet ut cures quod contrarietatem tibi facit ex illo cum curatione quae conuenit ei, secundum quod praemissum est.	But if the contradiction that you make in the hour of the incision, or in the hour of the caustic torch, or the flow of blood, or anything else: then it is necessary that you cure what the contradiction that you make from that one with the cure which convient to him, according to what has been premised.
Si autem infirmus est timidus, et non expectat super hanc operationem, propter horribilitatem suam: tunc administra perforationem secundum quod ego narro illud: et est.	But if he is shy and does not expect to this operation, because of its horror: then administer the incision according to what I have told about it, and it is done.
Quando certificatur tibi apud te per illud quod diximus de significationibus, quod ramex est aquosa: tunc oportet quod facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	When you are certified to you from that which we have said about the meanings, that the ramie is aqueous: then it is necessary that you do make the sick sit on a raised seat.
Deinde perfora apostema in inferiori parte sui cum spatumili lato: et pone perforationem secundum longitudinem corporis, et sit apertio ampla, donec currat aqua tota.	Then pierce the caustic torch in the lower part of his body with a thin blade: and put the piercing according to the length of his body, and let it be an aperture wide, until all the water has run out.
Deinde pone super locum cotum, et liga ipsum, et dimitte ipsum ut currat residuum aquae: deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur uulnus.	Then put a cloth over the place, and tie him up, and let him go to run out the remainder of the water: then take care of the wound, until the bruise is healed.
Si autem contrarietas sit egressioni aquae in hora qua perforas ipsam: et non sit illud nisi propterea, quia panniculus albus contrarietatem facit in orificio uulneris, et prohibet exitum aquae: tunc oportet ut intromittas pennam in uulnus, aut instrumentum cum quo extrahitur aqua hydropicorum, cuius forma praecessit: aut adde in operatione uulneris parumper.	But if the contradiction is to the emission of water in the hour when you pierce it: and this one does not do except because of that, because the white cloth makes a contradiction in the wound-hole, and stops the exit of water: then it is necessary that you introduce the cloth into the bruise, or an instrument with which the water of the hydropic is drawn out, whose shape preceded: or add to the operation of the bruise a little.
Et scias, quod aqua redit, et aggregatur post sex menses, aut circiter eos.	And know that water returns, and is gathered up after six months, or about them.
Cum ergo aggregatur, tunc pertoretur secundum eundem modum, et pertransibit infirmus dies suos.	So when it is gathered up, then he shall turn again according to the same mode, and he will spend his days ill.
¶ De cura Ramicis carnosae.	On the care of the carnose ramie.
Caput LXIII.	Chapter LIII.
Scias, quod in sectione super hanc Ramicem, est ex timore perducente ad perniciem in pluribus dispositionibus.	You should know that in this section on the ramie, it is because of the fear that leads to peril in many dispositions.
Quapropter uidetur mihi eius dimissio saluari ex ea.	Therefore I am sending her away from me so that she may be saved from this.
Et ego sum rememorans operationem in ea, et species apostematis.	And I am remembering the operation on her, and the appearance of the pustules.
Dico ergo, quod accidunt apostemata multa in corporibus, ex quibus componuntur testiculi: et fit illud ex caussis multis, scilicet.	I say that many pustules occur on the bodies, from which the testicles are formed: and it comes about from many causes, namely...
Aut ex superfluitate acuta, uel acri, quae effunditur ad testiculos.	Or from acute superfluity, or acrimony, which is excreted into the testicles.
Aut ex percussione.	Or from a blow.
Et est color apostematis secundum colorem corporis, et non inuenitur ei dolor: et est apostema graue.	And the colour of the pustule is according to the colour of the body, and it is not felt to be painful: and the pustule is grey.
Et fortasse est apostema lapideum, cuius color est fuscus, et non est sensus ei.	And perhaps it is a stony pustule, whose colour is dark, and it has no sensation.
Et quandoque fit ex nodatione arteriarum, et inflatione earum: sicut iam praecessit eius rememoratio: aut ex inflatione uenarum.	And when it comes about from the nodulation of the arteries, and their inflammation: as I have already remembered regarding this: or from the inflammation of the veins.
Quod ergo est ex eis ex inflatione arteriarum, cognoscitur per dispositionem apostematis, quando comprimis ipsum digitis tuis.	So what is it, then, from these, that comes about from the nodulation of the arteries, is recognized by the disposition of the pustules, when you squeeze your fingers together.
Et non oportet ut tangas ipsum prorsus.	And it is not necessary for you to touch the individual completely.
Illud uero quod fit ex inflatione uenarum, non dispergitur ex eo aliquid apud compressionem cum digitis.	That is true, because that which comes about from the inflammation of the veins does not disperse anything by compression with the fingers.
Et iam possibile est, quod super hanc speciem fiat sectio, et super reliquas carnes: et est, ut seces cutem testiculorum.	And it is also possible that this appearance should come about on the ramie, and on the other flesh: and it is so, in order to separate the skin of the testicles.
Deinde extende ouum ad sursum, et extrahe ipsum cum sifach albo: et libera suspensorium ex uasis, et liga uasa: et incide suspensorium postquam tu liberas ipsum ab omni parte ex partibus oui.	Then extend your hand upwards, and remove it with a hook or finger: and free the suspenders from the water, and tie them together with a knot: and cut the suspenders away from you completely on all sides where they are attached.
Si ergo ouum consolidatum est cum illis carnibus natis, tunc oportet ut attrahas ouum, et incidas ipsum.	If then my bone is consolidated with those living tissues, then you should draw it out and cut it off.
Et si adhaerentia est inter aliquid ex siphaket, aut in eo quod est inter uasa: tunc oportet ut liberes totam illam adhaerentiam, et incidas eam incisione rotunda.	And if there is an attachment between any of the sieves or in what is between the veins: then you should free all that attachment and cut it off with a round incision.
Si autem est natiuitas carnis in loco adhaerentiae quae est retro: tunc oportet ut incidas totum eius, et extrahas ouum, sicut diximus.	But if the birth of flesh is in a place where there is an attachment that is behind it: then you should cut off all of it, and draw out my bone, as we have said.
Cum ergo completur operatio tua, tnnc imple uulnus in lana infusa in oleo rosato, et uino: deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	When then your operation is complete, you should fill the wound with wool infused with rose oil and wine: and then take care of it with the rest of the cure, until it heals.
¶ De cura Ramicis, quae est cum Vite.	On the Care of the Vine Tree, which is with the Viticulture.
Caput LXIIII.	Chapter LIIII.
Uitis est apostema inuolutum quadam inuolutione, simile botro, cum mollificatione testiculorum: et fit difficilis super infirmum motus et exercitium, et deambulatio.	The wine is affected by a sort of ferment which is similar to vinegar, and the testes become soft: it makes movement difficult and exercise, and walking.
Et in curatione huius aegritudinis est ex timore, propter illud cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And in the cure for this sickness there is a fear because of its previous memory.
Verum oportet, ut dicamus operationem in ea secundum quod fecerunt primi.	But we should say that the operation in it should be done according to what the first did.
Dico ergo, quod oportet ut facias sedere infirmum super sedem eleuatam.	I say, you should have the sick person sit on an elevated seat.
Deinde impelle suspensorium testiculorum ad inferiora.	Then push down on the suspenders of the testes towards the bottom.
Deinde tene cutem testiculorum cum digitis tuis, cum uasis quae sunt propinqua uirgae: et teneat ea minister alius, et extendat ea extensione uehementi.	Then hold the skin of the testes with your fingers, with the hand that is nearest to the scrotum: and let another hold it as an assistant, and extend it with a sharp extension.
Deinde incide cum spatumili lato acuto sectione transuersa in directo uasorum, donec detegantur uasa.	Then cut it with a sharp chisel-shaped blade in the middle of the veins, until the veins are detected.
Deinde excoria ab omni parte, sicut diximus tibi in extractione Arteriarum quae sunt in timporibus.	Then scrape off all parts, as we have told you in the extraction of the arteries which are in the timbus.
Postea fige in eis acum in qua sit filum duplum, et liga ipsum in primo locorum quibus accidunt Vites: et liga ipsum iterum in ultimo eorum.	Then fix in it the knot where the double filament is, and tie it again in the first place where the vines are: and tie it again in the last of them.
Deinde seca ea in media sectione recta secundum longitudinem corporis, et extrahe quod aggregatur ex humiditatibus faeculentis corruptis.	Then dry it off with a middle-length straight scissor according to the length of the body, and extract what is gathered from the foul-smelling, corrupted moisture.
Deinde cura uulnus cum curatione reliquorum uulnerum, in quibus uis generari saniem, ut cadant uasa quae nutriunt unum testiculorum.	Then care for the withered member with the remaining cure of the wounds, in which you should promote healing so that the sacs that nourish one testicle do not drop off.
Non est enim malum per illud.	It is not a bad thing through that.
Si autem accidat Vitis omnibus uasis, tunc oportet ut extrahantur propter hoc testiculi cum uasis: ut non priuetur ouum nutrimento, propter incisionem, et tabescat, uel arescat, et non sit iuuamentum cum eis.	But if it happens to all the members, then they should extract them for this reason from the testicles with water, so that they do not be deprived of their nourishment, due to the incision, and do not heal or scar, and are not damaged with them.
¶ De cura Ramicis intestinalis.	regard
Caput LXV.	Of the care of the intestinal worm.
Euentus huius Ramicis est ex sectione, quae accidit in sifach extenso super uentrem in parte inguinum ex mirach uentris.	The head of this worm is to be taken from a section that happens in an inch-wide area on the bowels in the part of the groin at the outside of the testicle.
Quare descendunt intestina ex illa Ruptura ad unum testiculorum.	Why do the bowels come out from that break towards one testicle?
Et haec Ruptura est aut ex sifach, aut extensione eius.	And this break is either from a fistula or from an extension of it.
Et accidunt istae duae species ex caussis multis: aut ex percussione, aut saltu, aut clamore, aut eleuatione rei grauis, et similibus.	And these two species arise from many causes: either from a blow, or from a slip, or from a noise, or from raising something heavy, and similar things.
Et signum, quando est ex extensione sifach.	And the sign, when it is from an extension of the fistula.
Est quod accidit paulatim in tempore longo, et non accidit subito: et est apostema aequale uersus profundum: propterea, quod sifach comprimit intestinum.	It is that which happens gradually over a long period of time, and does not happen suddenly: and it is a swelling that is equal in size to the depth: because the fistula compresses the intestines.
Et signum eius quando est ex sectione sifach, quia facit accidere ex principio sui dolorem uehementem subito: et est apostema diuersum, apparens sub cute propinque: et illud est propter exitum intestini, et cursus eius ad exteriora sifach.	And the sign of it when it is from a section of the fistula, because it causes sudden and very painful pain from its beginning: and it is a swelling that is different, visible just under the skin, and is because of the exit of the intestines, and their course towards the external fistula.
Et quandoque egreditur cum intestino zirbum: et nominatur haec Ramex intestinalis, et zirbia: et quandoque fit cum uentositate.	And when it comes out with the intestine still alive: and this is called the intestinal worm, and it is alive: and sometimes it makes a hissing sound.
Et quandoque currit in intestinum stercus, et retinetur illic: et est cum eo pernicies infirmi: quoniam facit accidere dolorem prauum, et praecipue quando premitur.	And when it runs into the feces, and stays there: and it is with that for his injuries: because it causes very painful pain, especially when it is pressed.
Et in curatione specierum aegritudinis huius cum ferro est timor: quare oportet ut caueatur casus in ea.	And there is great danger in using iron for the treatment of this kind of disease: so that care should be taken to avoid any such accident.
Et modus operationis est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut reducat intestinum manu sua ad interiora concauitatis suae, si obedit reditui.	And the method of operation is this: you must instruct the sick person to bring his hands into contact with the inside of the wound of his own body, if he obeys the return.
Deinde resupinetur super collum suum inter manus tuas: et eleua crura eius.	Then let him lie on his back between your hands, and wash his legs.
Deinde extende cutem quae sequitur cutem ad superiora, et seca cutem testiculorum totam per longitudinem.	Then spread the skin that covers the skin to the top, and dry the whole skin of the testicles along its length.
Deinde fige in duobus labiis sectionis uncinos, secundum quod indiges ad aperiendum sectionem cum eis: et sectio sit secundum quantitatem, quod sit possibile, ut egrediatur ex ea ouum.	Then set aside two sections with clips between your lips, according to the way you open the section with them: and the section should be so arranged that it can be removed from it, so as to go out of it.
Deinde excoria siphak, et quae sunt sub cute testiculorum, donec quando detegitur sifach album, durum ab omni parte: tunc intromitte digitum tuum indicem in eo quod sequitur testiculum, in eo quod est inter siphach album, quod est sub cute oui, et inter sifach secundum, et absolue cum eo adhaerentiam quae est in posteriori parte oui.	Then scrape the wax from, and what is under the skin of the testicles, until when it is touched, all its side is white: then introduce your finger into it that follows the testicle, into that which is between the wax and the skin, and between the second wax, and make complete contact with it.
Deinde moue cum manu dextra ad interiora cutem testiculorum: et cum hoc extende sifach album ad sursum, cum manu sinistra: et eleua ouum cum sifach ad partem sectionis: et praecipe ministro, ut extendat ouum ad sursum: et tu solue adhaerentiam, quae est retro solutione completa.	Then move with the right hand to the inside of the skin of the testicles: and while doing so spread the wax towards the top with the left hand: and wash the legs with the wax at the side of the section: and order the servant to extend the leg towards the top: and you will release the adhesion, which is behind.
Et quaere digitis tuis, ut non sit aliquid illic ex intestino inuoluto in sifach albo duro.	And ask your hands whether there is anything of the intestines still remaining inside the wax or hard.
Si autem inuenis ex eo aliquid: tunc impelle ipsum ad uentrem inferius.	If, however, something is found of it: then push it towards the lower bow.
Deinde accipe acum, in qua sit filum grossum, factum licinium ex decem filis: et intromitte ipsam apud postremum sifach, id est, tunicae, quod est sub cute testiculorum quae sequitur sectionem: deinde incide extremitates quae eminent ex filo, donec sint quatuor fila.	Then take the skin in which there is a thick thread, made of ten strands: and insert it at the back of the wax, that is, of the tunic under the skin of the testicles, which follows the section: then cut off the ends that protrude from the strand, until you have four strands.
Deinde compone quaedam eorum super quaedam cum figura quae sit in modo crucis: et liga cum eis alsifach, de quo diximus, quia est sub cute testiculorum ligamento uehementi, donec non possit aliquod ex uasis, quae nutriunt eos mittere ad eos aliquid: ut non accidat inde apostema calidum.	Then make a sort of X with some of them in the form which I have described: and bind them together with the alsifac, about which I have spoken, because it is under the skin of the testicles tightly, so that none of the blood that nourishes them can reach them to give them anything: lest there be a breach in it.
Et pone iterum ligamentum secundum extra ligamentum primum, longinquum ab eo minus duobus digitis.	And place again the second ligament outside of the first ligament, distant from it by less than two fingers.
Et post ista duo ligamenta dimitte ex sifach, quod est sub cute testiculorum, quantitatem magnitudinis digiti: et incide reliquum totum secundum rotunditatem, et aufer ex eo ouum.	And after that two ligaments leave out from a tuft, which is under the skin of the testicles, size of a finger; and cut all the rest round, and take off it.
Deinde seca in inferiori parte cutis testiculorum sectione, ex qua currit sanguis, et sanies: sicut narrauimus in eo quod praemissum est.	Then dry out in the lower part of the skin of the testicles the section, from where runs blood and pus: as we have told you before.
Deinde administra lanam submersam in oleo, et pone in uulnus: et administra ligamentum quod narrauimus.	Then administer the wool soaked in oil and place it on the screw; and administer the ligament that we have described.
Et quandoque cauterizatur sifach album quod diximus, post incisionem eius timendo de fluxu sanguinis.	And when the tuft of white silk that we have mentioned is cauterized with the caustic, after incising it with caution to prevent the flow of blood.
Multotiens enim accidit illud.	This often happens.
Et dimitte ligamentum, donec cadat per se.	And leave the ligament, until it falls on its own.
Si autem tardatur casus eius, tunc embrocetur cum aqua calida: et pone super ipsum illud quod diximus, donec cadat.	But if its fall is delayed, then soak it with warm water: and place over it that which we have mentioned, until it falls.
Deinde cura uulnus cum reliqua curatione uulnerum, donec curetur.	Then take care of the screw with the rest of the wound's treatment, until it heals.
¶ De Ramice uentosa.	[On RAMy's spring].
Caput LXVI.	Chapter LVI.
IN Hac Ramice non uidi aliquem qui ausus fuerit super curationem eius cum ferro.	In this RAMy's spring, I did not see anyone who dared to treat it with an iron.
Et primi quidem dixerunt, quod fit sicut narrauimus in Ramice quae est cum Vite.	And first they said that it was done as we have told you in RAMy' which is with the Vine.
Quod est, ut liges uasa post sectionem super ea cum facilitate inferius: deinde seca in medio, et cura postremo cum eo quod aperit ipsum, donec cadant uasa: et cura uulnus, secundum quod diximus, donec sanetur.	That is, as the ligaments were used after the incision on it with ease downward: then dry out in the middle, and take care afterwards of what opens it up, until the ligaments fall; and take care of the screw, according to what we have said, until it heals.
¶ De disruptione quae fit in inguinibus.	[On the incision made in the groin].
Caput LXVII.	Chapter LVII.
Quando accidit Ruptura in inguinibus, sicut diximus, et eminet locus, et non descendit ad testiculos aliquid ex intestinis: et si descendit, est illud parum, et redit in omnibus horis: uerum si prolongatur cum ea tempus, additur fissura in sifach, donec descendunt intestina in sifach.	When the rupture happened in the groin, as we have said, and the exit was made, and did not come down anything from the intestines; and if it came down, it is little, and returns in every moment: but if it is prolonged with that time, a fissure is added to the tuft, until the intestines go into the tuft.
Et accidit illud ex extensione sifach, quod est in inguinibus, sicut diximus.	And this happened because of an extension of the safach, which is in the groin, as we have said.
Quod est, quia extenditur sifach: deinde mollificatur, et apostematur locus, et eminet.	That is, because the safach extends: then it softens, and the site becomes numb, and blood comes out.
Et cura eius est cum cauterio, sicut praecessit eius narratio.	And the care for it is with a caustic, as it has preceded in its narration.
Et quandoque curatur cum ferro, secundum hunc modum: et est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum inter manus tuas.	And when it is healed with an iron, according to this way: and it is, so that it lies sick on its back between your hands.
Deinde seca locum Rupturae apostematum et eminentem, sectione per latitudinem, secundum quantitatem trium digitorum.	Then dry the site of the rupture, which has been numbed and blood has come out, with a section through its width, according to the quantity of three fingers.
Deinde stringe alsifak et, quae sunt sub cute, donec quando detegitur sifach album, quod est sub cute quae sequitur ipsum.	Then tighten the safach and, which are under the skin, until when it is detected that the white safach, which is under the skin, follows itself.
Tunc accipe radium, et pone ipsum super locum eminentem ex sifach, et preme ipsum ad profundum uentris.	Then take a ray, and put it on the site where the blood has come out from the safach, and press it towards the deep of the wound.
Deinde sue duo loca eminentia super extremitatem radii ex sifach, et annecte cum sutura unum eorum cum altero: deinde extrahe extremitatem radii.	Then, on the two sites where the blood has come out from the safach, at the end of the ray, sew one of them to each other; then remove the end of the ray.
Et non incidas alsifach omnino, neque tendas ouum, neque aliud, sicut feci te scire in curatione ramicis intestinalis.	And do not break the safach at all, nor stretch one out, nor any other, as I have informed you about the cure of an intestinal branch.
Deinde cura illud curatione uulnerum.	Then this cure for the wound.
Cum ergo incidis fila, mundifica illud, et restaura uulnus, donec consolidetur.	When you cut the file, clean it out, and restore the bone, until it is hardened.
Sisach enim contrahitur, et non additur eminentia Rupturae.	The safach is contracted, and no blood is added to the rupture.
Et cauterium est melius in hoc loco: quoniam est propinquius ad salutem.	And the caustic is better in this place: for it is closer to salvation.
¶ De mollificatione cutis testiculorum.	Regarding the softening of the skin of the testicles.
Caput LXVIII.	Chapter LVIII.
Multotiens mollificatur cutis testiculorum in quibusdam hominibus, propter quod mollificantur carnes quae sunt inter ea, et foedatur aspectus eius.	The skin of the testicles is often softened in certain men, because the flesh between them is softened, and its appearance changes.
Ergo necesse est ei qui rogatur in curatione eius, ut faciat iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et incidat totam cutem quae mollificata est super cutem naturalem.	Therefore it is necessary for the one who is asked to heal him, that he lie on his back, and that he apply the softened skin to all the skin that has been softened.
Deinde aggreget duo labia cum sutura: et si uis, sue in primis superfluitatem cutis mollificatae tribus suturis, aut quatuor, et firma suturam.	Then, with two sutures, join the two lips together: and if there is any excess of the softened skin, first use three or four sutures, and then a firm one.
Deinde incide inter sututuras.	Then, cut between the sutures.
Deinde cura curatione reliquorum uulnerum, usquequo sanetur, et cadant fila.	Then, care for the cure of the remaining wound, until it heals, and let the threads fall off.
¶ De Castratione.	§ On Castration.
Caput LXIX.	Head LIX.
Scias, quod Castratio in lege nostra excommunicata est: et propter illud liceret mihi, ut non rememorarer eius in libro meo isto: et non est necessaria rememoratio eius, nisi propter duos modos.	Know that castration is excommunicated in our law; and for that reason it would be well if I should not remember it in this book: and the remembrance of it is necessary only for two reasons.
Quorum unus est, ut sit illud in scientia medici quando interrogatur de ea: et ut sciat curationem eius cui accidit.	One reason is that it may be in a medical student's knowledge when questioned about it; and that he may know how to cure it when it occurs.
Et modus alter est, quod nos multotiens indigemus castratione quorundam animalium, propter iuuamenta nostra per illud, sicut arietum, hyrcorum, et gattorum, et similium ex animalibus.	And the other reason is that we often need to castrate certain animals for our own good, such as sheep, horses, and cats, and similar animals.
Dico ergo, quod Castratio fit secundum duos modos.	I say then, that castration is performed in two ways.
Aut per attritionem.	Or by friction.
Aut per fissuram, et sectionem.	Or by a slit and cut.
In illa autem quae fit per attritionem, uia operationis est: quod nos faciamus sedere animal in aqua calida, donec mollificentur testiculi eius, et leniantur, et pendeant: deinde attere eos manu tua, donec resoluantur et non appareant sub tactu.	In that which is done by friction the procedure is this: that we make the animal sit in hot water until its testicles become soft and loose their tension: then do you grasp them with your hand, until they shrink back and no longer show under the skin.
In castratione autem per fissuram et sectionem, oportet ut teneas animal, et premas cutem testiculorum eius cum manu sinistra.	But in castration by a slit and cut, you must hold the animal, and with your left hand press the skin of its testicles together.
Deinde liga suspensorium, et seca super omne ouum sectione una, donec quando procedunt duo oua: tunc incide ea postquam excoriaueris utrumque, et non dimittas super ea ex sifaket aliquid praeter sifac subtile, quod est super uasa.	Then tie the suspenders, and dry all over one incision from top to bottom until both testicles have fallen: then cut after you have scalded them both, and do not leave on any thread except a narrow seam, which is above the skin.
Et iste modus castrationis est melior eo qui fit per attritonem: quoniam attritio fortasse relinquit aliquid ex testiculis, quare desiderat animal coitum.	And this method of castration is better than that done by cutting; for friction may give up a little of the testicles, which might cause an animal to desire copulation.
Deinde cura uulnus, donec sanetur.	Then cure the fracture, until it heals.
¶ De cura Hermafroditae duorum modorum.	To cure hermaphroditism there are two ways.
Caput LXX.	Head LXX.
Hermafrodita ex uiris est secundum duos modos.	Hermaphrodite is from the testicles, by two ways.
Vnus eorum est, quia apparet in eo quod sequitur spacium, aut in cute testiculorum, in eo quod est inter duos testiculos, figura quasi uulua mulieris, in qua sunt pili: et quandoque currit urina ex eo quod est in cute testiculorum.	The vagine is from the testicles, because it appears as if there were a space, or on the skin of the testicles, where two testicles are between them, in the form of a small woman's body, with hair; and sometimes urine flows out of it which is on the skin of the testicles.
In mulieribus autem est species una, et est uulua mulieris super pectinem sicut testiculi uiri parui omnino, eminentes ad exteriora: quorum unus est sicut priapus uiri, et duo sicut duo testiculi.	But in women there is one opening and it is like a small woman' s body, above the chest, like the testicles of a young man, protruding towards the outside: one of them is like a penis, and two are like the two testicles.
Et curatio trium specierum, duarum ex uiris, et speciei unius ex mulieribus, est: quia oportet ut incidas carnes additas, donec effugiat impressio earum.	And the cure of the three kinds, two from the testicles and one from a woman, is this: for you must burn away the added flesh, until the impression disappears.
Deinde cura eas curatione reliquorum uulnerum.	Then heal those wounds that are left.
In specie autem secunda uirorum, ex qua egreditur urina, quae est in cute testiculorum, non est operatio, neque est eius curatio omnino.	But in the second species of men, from which urine issues, and which is on the skin of the testicles, there is no operation, nor any cure at all.
¶ De incisione Tentiginis, et carnis eminentis in uuluis mulierum.	Regarding the incision of the scrotum and prominent flesh in women' s vulvae.
Caput LXXI.	Head LXXI.
Tentigo fortasse additur super rem naturalem, donec foedatur et turpis fit aspectus eius: et quandoque magnificatur in quibusdam mulieribus adeo, donec expanditur sicut in uiris, et peruenit usque ad coitum.	The tenticulus should be cut off, if it has grown, until it heals and its appearance improves; and sometimes it becomes prominent in certain women to the extent of reaching the chest, and goes up as far as the chest when they spread their legs.
Oportet ergo ut teneas superfluitatem Tentiginis manu, aut cum uncino, et incidas: et non ultimes in incisione, praecipue in profundo radicis: ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	Therefore you should hold back the excess tenticulus by hand or with a clamp, and burn it off; and do not cut it out, especially deep in its root: so that blood does not flow.
Deinde cura ipsam curatione uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then heal that wound, until it heals.
Caro autem orta, est caro quae nascitur in orificio matricis, donec impleat ipsum: et fortasse egreditur ad exteriora secundum similitudinem caudae: et propter illud quidam primi nominant aegritudinem caudatam.	But the middle flesh, which is born between a mother' s mouth, until it fills itself up: and possibly it issues out towards the outside, like a tail; and because of that some call illness with a tail.
Oportet ergo ut incidamus eam sicut incidimus Tentiginem, et curemus eam, donec sanetur.	It is necessary that we cut it as we cut Tentigine, and treat it until it is healed.
¶ De cura Alratica, quae est uulua mulieris non perforata.	On the treatment of a perforation in a woman's urethra.
Caput LXXII.	Chapter 72. On the treatment of a perforation in a woman's
Alratica est, ut sit uulua mulieris non perforata, aut sit foramen paruum.	is, that it may be a woman's urethra, or a small opening.
Et est aut naturalis, aut accidentalis.	and is either a natural one or an accidental one.
Accidentalis est ex aegritudine quae praecessit: et ipsa quidem fit aut ex carne nata addita, aut sifach subtili, aut spisso: et fit aut in profundo matricis, aut in lateribus eius, aut in superiore ipsius, aut inferiori eius: et prohibet a coitu et impregnatione, et partu, et fortasse prohibet menstrua.	An accidental one is from an illness that has preceded it; and the same either comes from born of flesh added, or from a thin scurf, or from a scurvy: and it may be in the depth of the lake, or in the sides thereof, or in the upper part thereof, or in the lower part thereof: and it prohibits coitus and impregnation, and birth, and perhaps prohibits menstruation.
Et cognitio illius fit per aspectum obstetricis, si opilatio est apparens propinqua.	And the knowledge of this is obtained from the inspection of midwives, if the petechia is apparent near at hand.
Si autem non est apparens, tunc quaere eam digitis tuis, aut cum radio.	But if it is not apparent, then ask it with your fingers, or with a ray.
Si autem opilatio est ex sifach subtili, et est propinqua duobus labiis: tunc propera, et disrumpe ipsam.	If, however, the petechia is from a thin scurf, and is near both lips: then bring it closer, and tear it off.
Et est, ut ponas super duo labia puluillos.	And is, that you place on two lips a little ball.
Deinde pone indices tuos duarum manuum simul, et mulier sit super dorsum suum expansis cruribus suis.	Then put your fingers of both hands together, and let the woman lie on her back with her legs spread wide.
Deinde extende duo labia cum fortitudine, donec disrumpatur sifach subtile, et aperiatur opilatio.	Then extend the two lips with force, until the thin scurf is torn open, and the petechia is opened.
Deinde accipe lanam, et imbibe eam in oleo, et pone ipsam super locum: et coeat mulier omni die, ut non consolidetur locus uice alia.	Then take a piece of wool, and dip it in oil, and place it on the spot; and let the woman eat it every day, so that the spot does not harden by means of another force.
Si autem sifach est grossum, spissum: tunc oportet ut seces ipsum cum spatumili lato simili folio myrti.	If, however, the scurf is thick and thick: then it should be separated with a smooth leaf of myrtle.
Si autem opilatio est ex carne nata, tunc suspende eam cum uncinis, et incide eam: et sint tecum medicinae quae fluxum sedant sanguinis absque mordicatione, sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus aggregatum cum albugine oui.	If, however, the petechia is from born of flesh, then suspend it with a hook and cut it off: and let there be with you medicines that stop the flow of blood without causing pain, such as acacia, and dragon' s blood, and thus the aggregate with alume.
Deinde administra cannulam ex plumbo amplam, ut non consolidetur uulnus uelociter, teneat eam diebus aliquot: et administra licinium ex lino sicco, deinde curetur reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then apply a large tube of lead, so that the injury heals more quickly and with less pain; keep it in place for several days: then apply liquid licorice, and then treat the rest with the usual treatment until it is healed.
Et quandoque nasciur in matrice natiuitas carnium aliarum: oportet ergo ut incidantur secundum hunc modum: dum non est apostema cancerosum apostemati enim canceroso quod est in matrice, non fiat contrarietas cum ferro omnino.	And when a person is born with a defect in one of the limbs: it is therefore necessary that such a defect should occur as follows: while there is no swelling due to cancer, for cancer causes a swelling in the womb; for otherwise there would be a contradiction between iron and fire altogether.
¶ De cura hemorroidarum, Athehelil, et Bothor rubeae in uuluis mulierum.	Regarding the treatment of hemorrhoids, Athahelil, and botryos of red plague in women.
Caput LXXIII.	Chapter LVII. On the Treatment of Hemorrhoids, Athahel
Hemorroides quidem sunt apertio orificiorum uenarum, donec currit ex eis sanguis multus assidue.	Hemorrhoids are an outlet for the blood which flows from them frequently and in great quantity.
Cum ergo antiquantur hemorroides, fiunt thelil: et iam dixi in diuisione species earum, et signa ipsarum: et dicam hic quae ex eis recipiunt curationem, et quae non.	When therefore hemorrhoids are beginning to form, they become thorns; and I have already spoken in the division of their types and their signs; and I will tell here those that receive the benefit of treatment and those that do not.
Dico ergo, quod hemorroides quae sunt in orificio matricis, et non apparent sensui: tunc non est ei curatio cum ferro.	I say then, as for hemorrhoids which are at the outlet of the womb and are not visible; there is no benefit to them from iron.
Quae autem ex eis sunt in orificio matricis super quas cadit sensus, sunt quae curantur.	But those which are at the outlet above where the sense ends, are the ones that are cured.
Oportet ergo ut intromittas mulierem in domum frigidam.	It is therefore necessary for you to enter the cold house.
Deinde extende athehelil cum forficibus, aut cum panno aspero, et incide eas ex radicibus suis.	Then extend Athahel with pincers or with a sharp cloth, and cut them off at their roots.
Deinde pulueriza super eas apud fluxum sanguinis ex uno puluerum incisiuorum absque mordificatione: sicut acacia, et sanguis draconis, et thus, et similia eis.	Then dust them with powder over the flow of blood from one that has been cut without mortification: such as acacia and dragon's blood and ochre and the like.
Deinde impellat pedes eius ad parietem hora una.	Then hit her feet against the wall once an hour.
Postea depone eam in aquam frigidam.	Then put her in cold water.
Quod si perseuerat fluxus sanguinis: tunc fac eam sedere in decoctione sumach, et corticum granatorum, et gallarum, et similium.	If the flow of blood persists: then make her sit in a decoction of sumach and wormwood and gall and the like.
Deinde accipe farinam hordei, et confice eam cum melle et aceto, et fac emplastrum cum eo super dorsum eius.	Then take barley flour and mix it with honey and vinegar and make a plaster and apply it to her back.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis cum eo, bonum est: et si non, fac adhaerere dorso uentosas, et mammillis, absque scarificatione.	If therefore the blood is cut off with it, it is good; and if not, let the skin adhere to the back of the wounds, and the nipples, without scarring.
Deinde accipe lanam, et submerge in succo tarathit, aut succo arnoglossae, aut succo ramorum alaulat, id est, aglanter, uino pontico, et fac adhaerere loeo.	Then take a piece of cloth and dip it in taraxacum juice, or tongue root juice, or bay laurel juice, that is, glans, wine of Cyrene, and let it adhere to the loin.
Cum ergo quiescit apostema, tunc cura locum cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	When therefore the poultice has rested, then take care of the place with ointment, until it is healed.
Albarth uero rubeum est simile capitibus alhaasse, et est asperi aspectus.	Albarth, however, is really similar to red caps and has a rough appearance.
Oportet ergo ut incidas quod apparet ex eo, secundum quod dixi in thelil aequaliter: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Therefore let it appear from it, according to what I have said in the little book equally: and take care of it, until it is healed.
¶ De perforatione Exiturae quae accidit in matrice.	Regarding the exit that happens in the mother.
Caput LXXIIII.	Chapter LXXIV.
Accidunt in matrice species multae apostematum, sicut cancer, et apostema lapideum, et ulcera, et adubelati, et alekilati, id est, herpes, aestiomemus, et fistulae, et hemorroides, et ragadiae, et thelil, et apostema calidum.	Various poultices may occur in the mother, such as cancer, and the stone-like apostema, ulcers, blisters, scabs, keratitis, that is, herpes, colic, fistulae, hemorrhoids, itching, ragadiae, and hot poultices.
Et ego quidem iam dixi omnes has aegritudines et species earum, et signa ipsarum, et earum curationes in diuisione: necesse est ut dicam in hoc tractatu apostema calidum quod accidit in matrice, quando est ex apostematibus quae colligunt saniem, et uis scire qualiter fit eius apertio cum ferro.	And I have already said all these diseases and their kinds, and the signs of them, and their cures in a division: it is necessary that I should say in this book about the hot poultice which happens in the mother when it is from the apostemas that gather blood, and know how it is done with the iron.
Oportet ergo ut consideres.	Therefore let it be considered.
Tunc si dolor apostematis in incaeptione sua est acutus cum percussione sua, et flamma, et febre: et uides ipsum rubere: si cadit super ipsum sensus, tunc non properes cum perforatione eius: et cura ipsum cum eo eo quod iuuat super maturationem, donec quando quiescat acuitas accidentium.	Then if the pain of the apostema in its beginning is acute with its pounding, and fire, and fever: and you see it red: if it falls on it, then do not like its perforation: and take care of it with it as much as it is willing to maturation, until, when it has rested, the sharpness of the accidents.
Tunc oportet ut facias sedere mulierem super sedem quae labeat duo sedilia, et reclinetur, uel appodietur super dorsum suum, et aggreget pedes suos ad partem inferiorem uentris: et sint coxae eius expansae, et ponat brachia sua sub genibus suis, et liget utraque ligamento conueniente ad illud.	Then it is necessary that you should make the woman sit on a seat that covers her two legs, and lie down, or lean on her back, and put her feet at the lower side of her leg: and let her knees be opened, and place her arms under her knees, and bind each with a suitable ligature to it.
Deinde sedeat obstetrix a latere dextro, et administra instrumentum quo aperitur orificium matricis.	Then the midwife should sit to the right rear, and administer the instrument with which she opens the birth canal.
Cuius forma uenit in eis quae sunt post.	Whose form came in those who are behind.
Et oportet quando uis administrare hoc instrumentum, ut figas cum Radio profundum matricis mulieris: ut non sit illud quod ingreditur ex instrumento plus, quam profundum matricis, et laedat infirmam.	And it is necessary that when you administer this instrument, you hold the woman's womb firm with your knee: so that the womb does not come out of the instrument more than its depth, and hurts the sick.
Si autem fuerit instrumentum magis quam profundum, tunc oportet ut ponas puluillos super tecturam profundi matricis: ut prohibeatur introitus instrumenti totius in profundum matricis: et oportet ut ponat uertiginem, quae currit in instrumento, ex latere superiore: et ut teneat instrumentum, et ut reuoluat minister uertiginem, donec aperiatur profundum matricis.	But if the instrument is greater than its depth, then you should put a cushion on top of the womb's depth: to prevent the introduction of the entire instrument into the depth; and it should be placed to run in the instrument from the upper side: and to hold the instrument, and to reverse the flow of the instrument, until the birth canal has opened.
Cum ergo apparet Exitura, et tangitur manu, et est lenis et mollis: tunc oportet ut seces ipsam apud caput suum cum spatumili lato.	When it is thus apparent that the exit has come, and it can be touched by hand, and it is soft and smooth: then you should separate it from its head with a smooth edge.
Cum ergo euacuatur sanies, tunc oportet ut ponas in uulnus licinium submersum in oleo rosaceo: aut oleo uiridi, in quo sit quaedam stipticitas: et pone licinium, et extrahe sectionem in profundo matricis.	When the pus is thus drained, then you should put a licorice rod that is immersed in rose water: or in violet oil, where there is some stiffness: and putting the licorice, and remove a piece from the depth of the womb.
Et pone exterius super matricem, et super pectinem lanam mundam submersam in aqua, in qua bullitae sunt maluae.	And put outside on the womb, and on a woolen blanket that is immersed in water, where there are some red spots: and let it dry.
Deinde curetur post duos dies cum unguento quod conuenit ad illud, donec sanetur.	Then take care of it after two days with the ointment that suits it, until it heals.
Et quandoque abluitur matrix et uulnus, ita quod clisterizatur cum aqua et melle: deinde cum aqua in qua bullita est radix lilii, aut aristolochia longa: deinde redeat ad unguentum.	And when the womb is washed and the string has come out so that it curls up with water and honey: then bathe in water in which there are red spots, or linden tree, or long aristeology: and then return to the ointment.
Quod si uulnus absconditum fuerit interius in matrice, tunc oportet ut prohibearis ex curatione eius cum ferro, imo cura ipsum cum eo quod diximus in diuisione.	Which if the string is hidden inside the womb, then you should refrain from treating it with iron, and more care itself with what we have said in division.
¶ Doctrinae Obstetricum, qualiter medicentur embriones uiui, secundum figuram non naturalem egressi.	Doctrines of obstetrics, how they give birth to the fetus according to the figure that is not natural exit.
Caput Lxxu.	Chapter 70.
Necesse est Obstetrici, ut cognoscat in primis figuram partus naturalis.	It is necessary for the obstetician to know first the figure of natural childbirth.
Ex signis ergo eius est, quod quando uides mulierem comprimi ad inferiora, et desiderat odorare aerem, et alleuiatur super eam quod super ipsam est de partu, et festinat exitus embrionis: tunc scias quod iste partus est secundum figuram naturalem, et est exitus eius super caput suum, et secundina cum eo: aut suspensa, uel pendens ex umbilico.	From the signs then, you will know when you see a woman compressing herself towards her lower parts and smelling the air and resting upon her who is giving birth, and hastening to go out, knowing that this childbirth is in the second figure and the exit of the embryo is above her head and the second with it: or hanging, or swinging from the navel.
Cum ergo uides haec signa, tunc oportet ut comprimatur uenter eius, ut descendat embrio uelociter.	When then you see these signs, let the woman compress her abdomen so that the embryo goes down quickly.
Nam quando descendit super caput suum, descendit secundina cum eo, et mundatur ex illis superfluitatibus mundificatione bona.	For when it has gone down above its head, the second one has gone down with it, and is purified from it by good purification.
Qui autem est praeter hunc partum, est innaturalis, illaudabilis.	But if this childbirth is not like this, it is unnatural, unclean.
Quoniam quandoque egreditur foetus super pedes suos, et egreditur corpus eius ante caput ipsius, et pedes eius, et manus eius una, aut pes eius unus: aut egreditur caput eius et manus eius: aut egreditur uentrinus: et fortasse conuertitur super collum suum, et similia ex figuris illaudabilibus.	For when the embryo goes out on his feet, and the body goes out before its head, and its feet and hands one, or its foot and hand one: or when the head and hand go out, or when it goes out inside: and perhaps turns over its neck, and similar figures that are unclean.
Necesse est ergo Obstetrici, ut sit prudens, subtilis in istis rebus omnibus, et caueat sibi ab errore et decaeptione: et ego sum ostendens omnem figuram ex eis, et qualiter est ingenium in ea, et significetur per illud, et stetur super ipsum.	It is therefore necessary for the obstetician to be prudent and careful in all these things, and to guard against error and deception: and I show you all the figures from them, and how the intellect works in it, and explains itself, and makes a noise on it.
Quando egreditur foetus super caput suum egressione sua naturali, et uehemens fit illud super mulierem, et difficilis fit ei partus, et uides uirtutem eius iam debilitatam: tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, aut mulieres teneant eam: et uapora uuluam eius cum foenugraeco decocto, et cum oleis humidis.	When the embryo goes out on its own natural head and becomes heavy upon the woman, and finds it difficult to give birth, and you see its strength already weakened: then let her sit down in a chair, or have women support her: and pour into her a hot infusion of fennel, and with wet oils.
Deinde intromittat Obstetrix inter digitos suos Spatumile paruum, et findat cum eo secundinam, et secet eam ungue suo, donec currat quod est in ea ex humiditate: et preme uentrem mulieris, donec descendat foetus.	Then the obstetician will insert a small spatula between his fingers and find the second one with it, and dry it off with his nail, until it has gone out what is in it of moisture: and he will press the abdomen of the woman, until the embryo goes down.
Si autem non descendit, tunc oportet ut clisterizetur mulier ex mucillagine foenugraeci, cum oleo sisamino.	If it does not fall, then the woman should be bound with a cloth made of fenugreek sap and sesame oil.
Deinde praecipe ei post clistere, ut comprimatur: et fac eam sternutare cum condisi, et tene os eius et nasum ipsius hora una.	Then you shall order her to compress herself after the enema, and make her sneeze with a mixture, and hold her nose and mouth for an hour.
Foetus enim egredietur statim.	For the fetus will come out at once.
Quod si egrediantur duae manus foetus in primis, iunc oportet ut reducas eas cum facilitate paulatim.	If two hands of the fetus come out first, you should bind them so that you reduce them with ease little by little.
Si autem non obedit in introitu, tunc pone mulierem super sedem, et eleua pedes eius sursum: deinde concute sedem super terram: et mulier teneatur, ut non cadat apud concussionem.	If it does not obey in the entrance, then you shall put the woman on a chair, and raise her feet up: then you shall shake the chair on the ground: and the woman should hold herself so that she does not fall by the shock.
Si ergo non egrediuntur manus, et moritur foetus: tunc incide eas, et extrahe residuum foetus: et liga manum eius cum panno, et extrahe ipsum cum aequalitate: nam ipse egredietur.	If then the hands do not come out, and the fetus dies: then you shall cut them, and take out the remains of the fetus: and tie the hand with a cloth, and take it out with equality: for he will come out.
¶ Exitus embrionis super pedes suo.	The exit of the fetus is on its feet.
Quando egreditur foetus super pedes suos, tunc oportet ut impellat eos sursum: deinde conuertat foetum paulatim: postea aequet ipsum.	When the fetus comes out on its feet, you should push it up: then you shall turn the fetus little by little: then you shall make it even.
Deinde accipiat unum pedum eius, et extendat eum paulatim.	Then you shall take one of its feet, and stretch it little by little.
Cum ergo egrediuntur usque ad coxas, tunc praecipe ei, ut comprimatur, et fac eam sternutare cum condisi: egredietur enim, si Deus uoluerit.	When they have come out as far as the hip, then you shall order her to compress herself, and make her sneeze with a mixture: for it will come out if God wills.
Et si non egreditur cum eo quod narrauimus, tunc reduc foetum paulatim, donec ponas eum secundum figuram naturalem.	And if it does not come out with that which we have said, then you shall reduce the fetus little by little, until you put it back in its normal shape.
Nam ipse egredietur tunc egressu facili.	For he will come out easily at that exit.
Quod si prohibeatur cum eo toto quod narrauimus: tunc accipe ex mucillagine alteae, et oleo sisamino, et gummi soluto: et percute totum in mortario percussione bona: deinde line cum eo uuluam mulieris, et inferius uentris eius.	If it is forbidden to do all that we have said: then you shall take fenugreek sap and sesame oil and gum arabic: and pound everything in a mortar with a good pounding: then you shall wrap the whole with the cloth of a woman, and tie her feet.
Deinde fac eam sedere in aqua tepida, donec consequatur hypocundria.	Then let him sit in tepid water until he feels a pulse under his abdomen.
Cum ergo uides quod iam calefacta sunt inferiora eius, tunc fac ei sief de myrrha: et suppone ipsum.	When you see that his lower abdomen is now warmed, then apply Myrrh to him and support him.
Quando ergo tenet sief hora una, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	When he has held the myrrh for an hour, then let him sit on a chair.
Deinde fac eam sternutare: et stringe ipsius os et nasum: et preme inferiorem partem uentris compressione facili.	Then make him sneeze: and pinch his mouth and nose tight: and apply a gentle compression to the lower part of his abdomen.
Nam foeus egredietur statim.	For the fire will soon come out.
¶ Exitus foetus super genua et manus.	Exit the fire above the knees and hands.
Quando egreditur secundum hanc formam, tunc ingeniet in intromittendo manus suas paulatim.	When it has exited in this form, then gently insert your hands.
Deinde resupinetur mulier super collum suum, et pendeant pedes eius ad inferiora: et ipsa sit iacens super lectum, et complicet manus suas.	Then the woman shall lie over her neck and her feet shall hang down to the ground; and she herself shall lie on a bed and bind her hands.
Deinde preme supra uentrem eius paulatim.	Then gently compress the windpipe of him little by little.
Deinde extrahe quod est sub pedibus eius ex puluinaribus, donec sit praeparata in inferiori parte.	Then pull out what is under his feet from the pubic hair, until she is prepared in the lower part.
Quod si non egreditur foetus, tunc accipe pedes eius, et moue eos motu uehementi.	That if the fire does not exit: then take his feet, and move them with a violent motion.
Deinde preme quod est supra hypocundria paulatim, donec ascendat foetus ad superiora.	Then compress what is over the hypogastric region little by little, until the fire rises to the top.
Deinde intromittat manus suas, et aequet foetum paulatim: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimatur, donec egrediatur foetus.	Then insert your hands and make him even smaller: and tell the woman to compress, until the fire exits.
¶ Exitus foetus latitudinaliter pendens ex manibus.	Exit the fire hanging from the hands.
Ingenietur in reductione manus eius.	It is bound in reducing her hands.
Si autem non potest reducere eam, tunc eleua mulierem, et fac eam ambulare.	If she cannot be reduced: then embrace the woman, and let her walk.
Si uero ambulare non potest, tunc fac eam iacere super lectum: et concute crura eius concussione uehementi.	If she cannot walk: then lie her on a bed; and gently shake her legs.
Deinde administra linimentum quod praeparasti ex mucillaginibus.	Then administer the ointment which you have prepared from mucus.
Quod si accipit eam partus, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem.	That if she takes it while giving birth: then let her sit on a chair.
Deinde stude in reductione manus, et aequa foetum secundum figuram naturalem: et fac sternutare mulierem, et praecipe ei, ut comprimat se, donec egrediatur.	Then study to bind her hands together, and make him sneeze the woman, and tell her to compress herself until he exits.
¶ Exitus foetus super collum suum, expansis manibus, et est facies eius ad dorsum matris suae.	The baby's exit from its mother's neck, with wide arms, and its face toward the back of its mother's back.
Oportet ut teneat Obstetrix manum foetus, deinde reuoluat eum paulatim, et aequet eum cum facilitate.	It is necessary that the obstetrician hold the baby's hand, then turn it slowly and gently, and equalize it with ease.
Cum ergo aequatur, tunc pone super uuluam eius quod narrauimus ex oleo et mucillaginibus.	When it is equalized, then place it on the cradle that we mentioned above, made of oil and mucus.
Deinde praecipe ei, ut moueatur paulatim.	Then command him to move slowly.
Cum ergo feceris illud, tunc fac eam sedere super sedem, et praecipe ei ut inclinetur ad latus dextrum.	When you have done this, then make her sit down on the chair, and command her to lean to the right side.

Quando descendit ad orificium matricis secundum hunc modum cum secundina, tunc scinde secundinam cum ungue tuo, donec euacuetur ex humiditate.	When it has descended to the opening of its mother' s womb in this way with a second finger, then cut the second finger with your nail, until it is discharged from moisture.
Si ergo suspenditur super faciem foetus, et collum eius, tunc incide eam ex umbilico: ut non retineatur, et moriatur.	But if it hangs over the face of the baby and its neck, then cut it from the navel: so that it is not retained, and dies.
Deinde impelle foetum ad interiora, donec ponas eam secundum quod oportet: et praecipe mulieri, ut comprimat se aliquotiens: ipse enim egredietur exitu leui.

¶ Exitus Geminorum, aut foetuum multorum.	The exit of twins, or a multiple birth.
Scias, quod Gemini multotiens nascuntur: et quandoque nascuntur tres, et quatuor.	You should know that twins are often born: and sometimes three and four are born.
Verumtamen illud extraneum est, et raro contingit.	But this is unusual, and rarely happens.
Quinque uero est res extra naturam, et non uiuunt penitus: et continet eos, quamuis multiplicentur, secundina una: et separantur per sifach, distinguens inter eos ligatum in umbilico cuiusque eorum.	Five is a strange thing outside nature, and they do not live alone: and it holds them together, however they multiply, by a second one: and separates them with a slit, distinguishing between them a tied string in the navel of each one.
Et quandoque egrediuntur sicut egreditur foetus unus exitu naturali, facili: et egrediuntur exitu illaudabili, sicut narrauimus.	And sometimes when they go out, they go out like a single baby with a natural exit, easily: and they go out with an agreeable exit, as we have described it.
Quod si difficiles fuerint quidam eorum apud partum, et perueniunt ad illud quod diximus ex figuris innaturalibus, tunc cura eos sicut narrauimus: et sit ob stetrix subtilis, et faciat quod facit cum facilitate et tarditate, et ingenietur secundum omnem figuram cum eo quod praeparatur ei ex ingenio ducente ad salutem.	If some of them are difficult at birth, and they endeavor to the thing we mentioned above from unnatural figures, then take care of them as we have said: and let it lie on a soft bed, and do what it does easily and with delay, and shape it according to all the figure with that which is prepared by nature leading to salvation.
¶ Rememoratio eius quod formatur in matrice ex embrionibus, et abortiuntur.	Memory of that which is formed in the womb from embryos and aborts.
Quandoque formatur in matrice unus, et duo, et tres, et quatuor, et quinque, et sex, et septem, et plures decem: et iam uerificatum est apud me, quod mulier abortiendo emisit septem, et alia quindecim, omnes formatos.	When one is formed in the womb and two, three, four, five, six, seven, and more than ten; and I have also seen that a woman who aborts gives birth to seven and another fifteen, all formed.
Quod factum est mensuratione gloriosi sapientis.	That which has been measured by the glory of the wise man.

¶ De extractione foetus mortui.	On the extraction of a dead fetus.
Caput LXXVI.	Chapter LVII on the head.
Quando curas foetum mortuum cum eo quod dixi in diuisione ex medicatione, et non egreditur, et cogeris uti operatione cum manu, tunc oportet ut consideres.	When you are concerned about the dead fetus that I mentioned in the division of medication and does not come out, and you urge to use the operation with your hand, then you should consider.
Si ergo mulier est sanae uirtutis, et non est cum aliquo ex accidentibus, ex quibus timetur super eam perditio: tunc oportet ut resupinetur mulier super lectum, super dorsum suum, et sit caput eius inclinatum inferius, et crura eius eleuata: et ministra teneat eam a duabus partibus, aut ligetur ad lectum, ut non extrahatur corpus eius apud extractionem foetus.	If then the woman is healthy and of good virtue, and is not with any of the accidents from which she fears harm: then it should be that the woman lies down on a bed, on her back, and her head is inclined downward, and her legs are raised up: and the minister should hold her by two sides, or tie her to the bed, so that her body does not come out during the extraction of the fetus.
Deinde humecta os matricis ex oleis humidis cum mucillagine alteae, et foenugraeci, et seminis lini.	Then moisten the mouth of the womb with moist oils with althaea mucilage and fenugreek seeds and linseed meal.
Deinde inungat Obstetrix manum suam cum istis oleis et mucillaginibus: deinde intromittat eam in matricem cum facilitate.	Then the Obstetrician should wet his hand with these oils and mucilages: then introduce it into the womb with ease.
Deinde quaerat cum ea locum in quo figat uncinos ex foetu, et loca conuenientia ad illud.	Then she should ask where the hook is that holds the fetus, and the places convenient for that.
Considera ergo tunc, si foetus est praeparatus ut descendat super caput suum: tunc fige uncinos in oculos eius, aut in collo eius, aut in ore eius, aut in palato ipsius, aut sub barba eius, aut in furcula ipsius, aut in locis propinquis costis, et sub hypocundriis.	Then consider if the fetus is prepared to descend on its own head: then fasten the hooks in her eyes, or her throat, or her mouth, or her palate, or under her beard, or in her chin, or in convenient places.
Si autem descensus est super pedes eius, tunc in pectine, et costis eius mediis.	If, however, the descent is above his feet, then in the chest, and through the ribs mid-way.
Et oportet, ut teneat uncinum cum manu dextra: et ponat curuitatem eius in eo quod est inter digitos sinistrae manus: et intromittat cum manu cum facilitate, et figat uncinum in aliquo illorum locorum quae diximus, donec perueniat ad rem uacuam.	And it is to hold the hook with his right hand: and place the wound in it in which it is between the fingers of his left hand: and insert it with his hand easily, and fasten the hook in one of those places we said, until he reaches the end that he wants to make.
Deinde figat in oppositione eius uncinum alium, aut tertium, si indiges: ut sit contractio aequalis, et non declinet ad partem.	Then fasten in opposition to it another hook or third, if you wish: so that the contraction is equal, and does not turn towards one side.
Deinde extendatur extensione aequali, et non sit extensio secundum rectitudinem tantum, imo moueatur ad omnem partem, ut alleuietur exitus eius: sicut fit cum dente apud eradicationem eius.	Then let it be extended with an equal extension, and is not extended only in the direction of the straightness, but also moves on all sides, so that the exit is relieved: as happens when a tooth is being extracted.
Et oportet in eo quod est inter illud, ut mollificetur extensio.	And it is to be between that, so that the extension is softened.
Quod si retineatur ex eo pars, tunc oportet ut inungat Obstetrix quosdam digitos cum oleo, et intromittat eos ex parte, ut reuoluat cum eis quod retinetur.	That if a part is held back from it, then the midwife should put some oil on certain fingers and insert them from that side, so that they turn with it when she holds it back.
Si ergo egreditur pars foetus, tunc permutentur uncini ad locum alium qui sit altior: fac hoc donec egrediatur foetus totus.	If then a part of the fetus comes out, then the hooks are to be moved to another place that is higher: do this until the entire fetus has come out.
Si ergo egreditur manus ante alia, et non est possibile reducere eam, propter coartationem eius: tunc oportet, ut inuoluatur super eam pannus.	If then a hand comes out before another, and it is not possible to reduce it due to its constriction: then it is necessary to wrap a cloth over it.
Deinde extrahe eam donec quando egreditur tota, incide eam aut in iunctura plantae, aut in cubito: et ita oportet ut facias in manu altera, et in duobus pedibus.	Then pull it out until all of it comes out, cut it or insert it into the joint of the limb, or into the bed: and in such a way that you do in the other hand, and in the two feet.
Si autem caput foetus est magnum, aut accidit ei coartatio in exitu, aut est in capite eius aqua aggregata: tunc oportet ut intromittat inter digitos Spatumile spinosum, et findat cum eo caput, et extrahat aquam: aut disrumpat ipsum cum instrumento quod nominatur Almisdac: cuius forma uenit cum formis reliquorum instrumentorum in capitulo quod est post hoc.	If then the head of the fetus is large, or if it happens to him that his constriction occurs during the exit, or if there is water in his head: then it is necessary to insert between the fingers a sharp bone, and find with it the head, and remove the water: or break it down with an instrument called Almisdac: whose shape comes from the shapes of the other instruments in the chapter that follows.
Similiter faciat si foetus est magni capitis natura, tunc oportet ut seces algengematu: aut extrahas ipsum cum misdach, sicut diximus.	Likewise let him make a separation if the fetus has a large head, then it is necessary to cut the skin of the head: or else let him take it out whole, as we have said.
Deinde attrahas ossa cum forcipibus.	Then let him pull the bones with forceps.
Quod si egrediatur caput, et coartetur apud furculam: tunc findatur, donec effundatur humiditas quae est in pectore.	If it comes out, and the neck is clamped between the forceps: then let it be found, until the moisture that is in the chest is spilt.
Si autem non complicatur, neque obedit ad exitum: tunc incide caput frustatim, secundum quod possibile est tibi.	But if it is not complicated, and does not yield to coming out: then let him cut the head quickly, according to what is possible for you.
Quod si inferius uentris est apostematum, aut est in eo hydropisis: tunc oportet ut perfores ipsum, donec currat humiditas ex eo.	That if the lower leg is swollen, or there is water in it: then you should let him make an incision, until the moisture comes out.
Si uero foetus est super pedes suos, tunc attractio eius est facilis, et directio eius ad os matricis est leuis.	But if the fetus is above his feet, then its attraction is easy, and its direction towards the mother's mouth is light.
Si autem coartatur apud uentrem, aut pectus: tunc oportet ut extrahas ipsum cum panno quem inuoluisti super manum tuam: et findat uentrem, aut pectus, donec currat quod est in eis.	But if it is clamped between the womb, or the chest: then you should let him take it out with the cloth that you have wrapped around your hand: and let him make an incision in the womb, or the chest, until what is in them comes out.
Si autem auferuntur reliqua membra, et redit caput: tunc intromittat Obstetrix manum sinistram.	But if the remaining limbs are taken away, and the head returns: then let the Midwife put her left hand.
Si ergo os matricis est apertum, tunc intromittat manum in profundum matricis, et quaerat cum ea caput, et attrahat ipsum cum digitis usque ad os matricis: deinde intromittat in eo uncinum unum, aut uncinos duos, et attrahat ipsum cum eo.	But if the mother' s mouth is open, then let her hand go down into the mouth of the mother, and ask for it with her fingers, and draw it out to the mouth: then let him put in one hook, or two hooks, and draw it out with them.
Quod si os matricis coartatur, propter apostema calidum quod accidit ei: tunc non oportet ut laboretur super ipsum, imo oportet tunc administrare effusionem rerum humidarum, pinguium: et administra emplastra: et sedeat in aquis quae mollificant et humectant.	That if the mother' s mouth is clamped, because of the hot swelling that happens to it: then it is not necessary for him to work on it, but at that time he should administer an infusion of fluids, thick: and administer plaster: and let him sit in water that softens and moistens.
Quod si foetus est super latus suum, tunc possibile est ut aequetur: tunc administretur quod diximus in foetu uiuo.	That if the fetus is above its side, then it is possible to make it even: then he should administer what we have said in a single fetus.
Quod si non est possibile illud, tunc incidatur frustatim, et extrahatur.	If it is not possible to do so, then incise quickly and extract.
Et oportet ut non dimittas aliquid ex secundina intus omnino.	And you should not leave anything at all inside for the second time.
Cum ergo compleueris operationem tuam, tunc administra quod diximus in apostematibus calidis quae accidunt in matricibus.	Now when you have finished your operation, then administer what we said in the appendix about the hot blisters that occur in the wombs.
Quod si accidat fluxus sanguinis, tunc descendat in aquis stipticis, et administra reliquam curationem.	If a flow of blood occurs, then let it descend into water of narrowness, and administer the remaining cure.
Et ego quidem iam uidi mulierem, in cuius uentre mortuus erat foetus: deinde impregnata est super ipsum uice alia, postea mortuus est foetus alius etiam.	And I have already seen a woman, in whose womb the fetus was dead: and then she was impregnated on top of that other fetus, and then another fetus died too.
Accidit ergo ei post tempus longum apostema in umbilico suo, et inflatum est, donec apertum est: et coepit emittere pus.	Then happened to her after a long time a blister in her navel, and it was inflated, until it opened out: and it began to emit pus.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius, et medicatus sum ei tempore longo: et non consolidatum est uulnus.	So I was called for her cure, and I treated her at a long time: but the wound did not heal.
Posui ergo super ipsum ex quibusdam emplastris fortis attractionis: et exiuit ex loco os.	Then I placed over it some strong plasters of attraction: and she came out from her place by the mouth.
Deinde praeterierunt ei dies aliquot, et exiuit os aliud.	Then there passed away a few days for her, and she came out another mouth.
Miratus sum ergo inde, cum in uentre non sit os.	So I was amazed from there, when there is no mouth in the womb.
Cogitaui ergo, quia erant ex ossibus foetus mortui.	I thought that there were bones of a dead fetus.
Inquisiui ergo uulnus, et extraxi ossa multa, muliere existente in melioribus dispositionibus suis: et iam uixit taliter tempore longo, et mittit ex loco pus parum.	So I questioned the wound, and I pulled out many bones, with a woman being in better condition of her: and she had already stayed so long time, and was emitting little pus from her place.
Et ego non firmaui hic hoc extraneum, nisi quoniam in eo est scientia, et adiutorium ad illud, quod administrat medicus artifex cum manu ex curatione.	And I do not firmly hold this strange thing, except that there is knowledge of it, and help for it, which the doctor of art manages with his hand from the cure.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum necessariorum in extractione foetus.	Of forms Of instruments necessary in extracting the fetus.
Caput LXXVII.	Chapter LVII.
Hic inferius est forma Strictorii, quo aequantur libri, cui aequaliter sunt duae uertigines in duabus extremitatibus duorum lignorum.	Here is the form of the Strigler, which are equalized by books, and which have two twists on both ends of two pieces of wood.
Verumtamen haec Vertigo oportet ut sit subtilior strictorio: et ut fiat, aut ex ebano, aut ex ligno bussi.	However this Twist should be made so that it is a subtler strigler: and to do this, either from ebony, or from wood of buckthorn.
Et sit latitudo omnis ligni quasi duo digiti: et margo cuiusque amborum est quasi digitus unus, et longitudo cuiusque eorum est palmus et medietas: et in medio duorum lignorum sunt duo additamenta ex genere eiusdem ligni, quae iam firmata sunt in utrisque, quorum longitudo est medietas palmi et plus parum: et latitudo utriusque est quasi duo digiti, aut plus parum.	And the breadth of each bone should be like that of two fingers; and the edge of either side should be like a finger; and the length of each one should be a palm and its midpoint; and in the middle of the two bones there are two additions of the same species, which have already been fixed on both sides, whose length is half a palm and slightly more; and the breadth of each is like that of two fingers or slightly less.
Et ista duo additamenta intromittuntur in os matricis, ut aperiatur cum eis quando tu reuoluis duas Vertigines.	And these two additions enter into the jaw bone, so that it opens with them when you turn your two Vertiges.
Forma Vertiginis qua aperitur matrix.	Form of the mandible as it opens matrix.
Forma alia ad simile illius, subtilior, et leuior.	Another form, like this one, but finer and lighter.
Fiat ex ligno ebani, aut bussi, secundum similitudinem forcipum.	Let it be made from ebony wood, or teak, according to the similarity of the forks.
Verumtamen in extremitate eius sint duo additamenta, sicut uides hic supra: et longitudo omnis additamenti ex eis est quasi palmus: et latitudo utriusque est, duo digiti.	However, at its ends there are two additions, as you see here above: and the length of each of these additions is like a palm: and the breadth of each is like two fingers.
Cum ergo uis aperire matricem cum eo, tunc fac sedere mulierem super lectum, pendentibus pedibus eius, aperto quod est inter crura eius.	So when you are going to open the jaw with it, then let the woman sit on a bed, her feet hanging down, and open what is between her shoulders.
Deinde intromitte ista duo additamenta coniuncta in matricem: et tu es tenens extremitatem instrumenti inferius inter coxas eius.	Then introduce these two additions joined together into the jaw: and you hold the end of the instrument below her hips.
Deinde aperi manum tuam cum instrumento, sicut facis cum forficibus, aequaliter secundum quantitatem quam uis ex apertione oris matricis, donec faciat Obstetrix quod uult.	Then open your hand with the instrument as you do with the forks, equally according to the quantity that you wish to open the jaw of the matrix, until the obstetrician does what he wants.
Forma Vertiginis alterius quam dixerunt antiqui Forma Impellentis quo impellitur foetus.	Form of the second Vertige than the ancient Form of the Impelling where the fetus is propelled.
Forma Almisdac, qua conteritur caput magnum: et assimilatur forcipi, cui sunt dentes in extremitate, sicut uides.	Form of Al-Misdaq, where the head turns great: and it resembles a fork, having teeth at its ends, as you see.
Et quandoque fit oblungum, sicut forcipes secundum hanc formam, sicut uides, cui sunt dentes sicut dentes serrae, quo inciditur et conteritur.	And when it is made short, like a fork in this form, as you see, having teeth like the teeth of a saw, which cuts and grinds.
Forma Almisdac quo conteritur caput paruum.	Form of Al-Misdaq where the head turns small.
Forma Vncini habentis spinam unam.	Form of the winnower holding a single spike.
Forma Vncini habentis spinas duas.	Form Vncinis hantens spinas duas.
Forma forcipis cui sunt dentes serrae, cum quo conteritur caput foetus.	The forceps has two prongs; it is used to grip the head of the fetus.
Forma Spatumilis habentis duas extremitates ad abscindendum caput.	The spatula has two edges and is used to cut the baby's head apart.
Forma duorum Spatumilium etiam latorum.	The two spatulas are also used to hold the baby's body.
Ista instrumenta omnia exercentur, et quanto plus multiplicantur species eorum, et praeparata sunt apud artificem, est uelocior ad operationem suam, et altior apud homines, propter quantitatem suam.	These instruments are all used, and the more they multiply in kind and number and are prepared for use by skilled hands, so much the faster and easier is their work, and the higher their reputation among men.
Non ergo despicies ex eis instrumentum, quin sit apud te praeparatum.	Do not therefore despise these instruments, since they are at your disposal, prepared for use by you.
Inexcusabilis est enim necessitas eorum.	For their necessity is inexcusable.
¶ De extractione Secundinae.	§ On the extraction of the second born.
Caput LXXVIII.	Chapter LXVIII. On the removal of the placenta.
Quando retinetur Secundina apud partum, tunc oportet ut praecipias infirmae, ut retineat anhelitum suum.	When the secondborn is retained after childbirth, then you should take care that it does not hold on to its own.
Deinde fac eam sternutare cum condisi: et stringe manum tuam super os eius, et nares ipsius.	Then, when it has been conditioned, you must make it sneeze; and tightly grasp your hand over its nose.
Si ergo egreditur per hoc, bonum est.	If, therefore, it goes out through this way, it is good.
Si non: tunc accipe ollam, et perfora in coopertorio foramen: et pone in ea herbas aperientes os matricis, sicut calamentum, rutam, et anetum, et camomillam, et sseham, et cassiam ligneam, et centauream: accipe omnes istas herbas, aut quasdam earum, et submerge eas cum aqua, et pone eas super ignem.	If not: then take a club, and pierce in the lid an opening; and put into it herbs that open the mouth of the womb, such as calamus, rue, aniseed, camomile, fennel, cassia-wood, and centaury; take all these herbs, or some of them, and dissolve them in water, and place them on fire.
Deinde pone embulam arundinis super foramen coopertorii ollae, et extremitatem aliam in os matricis: et teneat eam donec perueniat uapor ad concauitatem matricis.	Then put a wicker into the opening of the lid, and the other end in the mouth of the womb; and let her hold it until the vapor produced by the warming reaches the opening.
Deinde fac eam sternutare, sicut diximus.	Then make it sneeze, as we have said.
Secundina enim egredietur cum facilitate.	The secondborn will come out with ease.
Si autem remaneat post hanc curationem, et non egrediatur: tunc praecipe Obstetrici, ut submergat manum suam in oleo sisamino, aut mucillagine alteae.	If, however, it remains after this treatment and does not go out: then instruct the midwife to dip her hand in oil from sesame seed, or in althaea mucilage.
Deinde intromittat in uuluam, et quaerat cum ea Secundinam.	Then he inserted his hand into her vagina and examined her with his fingers.
Cum ergo inuenerit eam, tunc accipiat eam, et extendat ipsam paulatim.	When he had found her, then he took hold of her and opened her little by little.
Si autem fuerit annexa in profundo matricis, tunc intromittat manum, secundum quod narrauimus, donec quando inuenerit Secundinam, et extrahat eam paulatim secundum rectitudinem, ut non cadat matrix apud attractionem uehementem: imo oportet, ut permutetur cum facilitate ad latera dextra et sinistra: deinde addatur in quantitatem attractionis.	But if it were attached deep within the womb, then he should insert his hand, according to what we have said above, until when he has found the second [child], and slowly removes it, so that the womb does not come out by a sudden tug: first of all, it should be turned so as to face the right and left sides: then the amount of tugging should be added.
Ipsa enim obedit tunc, et seruatur, et euadit ab adhaerentia.	For she will obey at that time, and move about, and be freed from the attachments.
Quod si os matricis est coartatum, sicut nos iam narrauimus: cura eam cum sternutatione, et ex medicatione ollae cum herbis.	If the opening of the womb is contracted, as we have already described: take care of her with a storm, and wash out the hole with herbs.
Si autem non egreditur cum omnibus quae narrauimus, tunc caue ne fatigeris super eam in iteratione extractionis.	But if it does not go out with all that we have said, then be careful not to tire yourself out by repeatedly trying to remove it.
Verum oportet, ut quod egreditur ad os matricis ex ea, liges ad coxam mulieris.	It is true, however, that when she leaves the opening of the womb, there are some things that need to be done for the woman.
Deinde clisteriza eam cum unguento tetrapharmacon.	Then clean her with a ointment of four drugs.
Ipsum enim putrefaciet eam post dies, et dissoluetur, et egredietur.	For after a few days it will rot and dissolve and come out.
Verumtamen quando putrefit, eleuatur ex ea odor malus ad stomachum et caput, et laedit illud infirmam.	But when it has rotted, a bad smell arises from it towards the stomach and head, and damages that one with its stench.
Oportet ergo ut administrentur suffumigationes conuenientes ad illud.	Therefore, let appropriate vapour treatments be given to it.
Quidam autem antiquorum iam experti sunt suffumigationem nasturtii, et ficuum siccarum.	Some ancient people have already experienced the effect of nasturtium vapours, and dried fig vapours.
Forma instrumenti quo suffumigatur mulier apud retentionem Secundinae et menstruorum.	The form of an instrument that is used to vapourise a woman while she is retening the second [child] and the monthly flow.
Fiat ex uitro simile alcama, aut ex zere: et ponatur extremitas ampla super ignem: et suffumigatio sit posita super prunas: teneat eam, donec consumatur illa suffumigatio: et itera aliam.	Let it be made from the bark of an oak or a linden tree; and let the end be wide [in diameter] over fire; and let the vapour be placed above plums; hold it until that vapour is consumed; and then let another be prepared.
¶ De curatione Ani non perforati.	If the anus is not pierced
Caput LXXIX.	If the anus is not pierced
Nascuntur multi puerorum, et Ani eorum sunt non perforati, quos iam opilauit sifac subtile.	Many boys are born, and their anuses are not yet pierced, which have now been rendered soft by the subtle sirocco.
Oportet ergo, ut obstetrix perforet illud sifac digito suo: et si non, perforet ipsum cum Spatumili acuto: et caueat lacertum, ne tangat eum.	The midwife should therefore pierce it with her finger: and if she will not do so, let her pierce it herself with a sharp spatusula: and let her take care that she does not touch the snake.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam infusam in uino et oleo.	Then put on top of it wool dampened with wine and oil.
Deinde cura ipsum cum ungentis, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound with ointment, until it is healed.
Si autem times quod opiletur, tunc pone in foramine cannulam de plumbo diebus multis, et auferatur quando puer uult egerere.	If you suspect that it will become infected, then put a lead pipe in the opening for several days, and remove it when the boy wants to defecate.
Et iam accidit opilatio Ani etiam ex consolidatione uulneris, aut apostematis.	And it has already happened that the anus has become infected from the consolidation of the wound, or pus.
Oportet ergo ut secetur illa consolidatio, deinde curetur cum eo quod diximus ex curatione et plumbo.	The consolidation should therefore be removed, and then care for it with that which we have said above from the cure of the anus and lead.
¶ De curatione Fistularum quae accidunt in inferiori parte.	Of the cure of fistulas which occur in the lower part.
Caput LXXX.	Chapter LIII
Fistulae quae accidunt in inferiori, sunt Nodatio, et Grossitudo quae accidunt prope anum deforis: aut in spacio unius partium: et est Fistula una, aut plures.	The fistulas which occur in the lower parts are the swelling and grossness which occur near the anus of a single part: and there is one fistula or several.
Cum ergo antiquatur illa Nodatio, aperitur, et currit ex ea humiditas aquosa alba, aut pus subtile.	When therefore that swelling has become old, it opens, and from it issues a watery, white, or subtle pus.
Et quandoque sunt ex istis Fistulis penetrantes.	And when they are sometimes penetrating fistulas.
Ergo penetrantes cognoscuntur per illud quod egreditur ex egestione, et uentositate, quando utitur infirmus egestione: et fortasse egreditur ex eis uermis.	Therefore the penetrating ones are known by that which issues from them on account of defecation, and windiness, when an infirm person has defecation: and perhaps they issue from them naked.
Et sunt ex eis Fistulae quando sunt in spacio penetrantes usque ad uesicam, et usque ad meatum uirgae.	And there are fistulas sometimes penetrating into the space up to the hip, and up to the pubic bone.
Et sunt ex eis penetrantes usque ad iuncturam coxae, et usque ad nodum caudae.	And from them sometimes penetrating up to the joint of the hip, and up to the swelling at the end of the tail.
Ex eo autem quo cognoscitur Fistula penetrans usque ad anum, etiam a non penetrante, est, ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum: et intromittas tentam subtilem in Fistulam ex aere, aut ferro: quando non est tortuositas.	From this therefore when it is known that there is a penetrating fistula up to an organ, and not from one which does not penetrate, it is known if you put your finger on the organ: and try to insert a subtle thing of brass or iron into the fistula from bronze: since there is no tortuosity.
Quod si in ea est tortuositas, tunc intromitte in eam tentam ex plumbo subtilem, aut pilum ex pilis equarum, donec sentias tentam, aut pilum in digito tuo.	If there is a twist in it, then introduce yourself by trying with thin lead, or a feather from the wings of a horse, until you feel the attempt, or a pin in your finger.
Quod si non sentis ipsam penitus, neque procedit ex foramine aliquid ex egestione, neque uentositas, neque uermis sicut dixi: tunc scias, quia est non penetrans: propera ergo ad curationem.	If you do not feel it thoroughly, and there is no discharge from the wound, nor is it putrid or dry as I have said: then you will know that it is not penetrating: so approach to cure.
Et quando Fistula est penetrans usque ad uesicam, aut ad meatum urinae: tunc significatio eius est exitus urinae ex ea, et prohibitio eius ab hoc ut consolidetur locus cum medicinis.	And when the fistula penetrates as far as the skin, or to the muscle of the urine: then the sign of it is the emission of urine from it, and its prohibition from this so that the place with the medicines consolidates.
Si uero est penetrans usque ad iuncturam coxae, aut ad os coxae: tunc signum eius est, quod perueniat tenta usque illuc, si non est in ea tortuositas usque ad os: et inuentio doloris in circumitu partis, et quod egreditur pus ex ea semper: et quod non ualeat in ea medicatio, neque consolidatur cum unguento.	If it really penetrates as far as the joint of the hip, or to the bone of the hip: then the sign of it is that it reaches with the attempt as far as there, if there is no twist in it as far as the mouth: and the discovery of pain on the circumference of the part, and that it discharges pus from it always: and that it does not scald in it with the medicine, nor consolidates with the ointment.
Et in istis Fistulis omnibus penetrantibus non est curatio omnino: et curatio earum est labor et uanitas ei, ex stultis medicis, super quem formatur.	And in these fistulas, all of which penetrate, there is no cure at all: and the cure of them is work and vainness to him from foolish doctors, for a form is made on it.
In illa autem quae non est penetrans, et non antiqua, speratur sanatio cum serro: secundum quod ego narro tibi, et ego iam probaui: et est, ut iaceat infirmus inter manus tuas super dorsum suum: et eleua crura eius usque supra coxas ipsius, et coxae eius sint inclinatae ad uentrem ipsius.	In that one, or if it is not penetrating, and not old, hope for a cure with a scar: for I tell you, and I have already proved: and there is, let the sick person lie in your hands on his back: and wipe away the hair from his legs up to his hips, and his hips are inclined towards his belly.
Deinde intromittetentam plumbi, aut aeris, si est in Fistula tortuositas, donec scias ubi peruenit tenta.	Then introduce lead or air into it, if there is a twist in the fistula, until you know where the attempt reaches.
Si autem sentit eam infirmus circa anum, tunc oportet ut intromittas digitum tuum indicem in anum.	But if he feels it about some part, then you should introduce your finger with the index towards that part.
Si ergo sentis in digito tuo tentam iam penetrasse per seipsam detectam, praeter quod sentias inter digitum tuum, et inter ipsum sifac, aut carnem: tunc ergo scias certe, quia est penetrans: non ergo labores in ea, quoniam non est eius sanatio, sicut diximus.	But if you feel in your finger with the index already penetrated through itself by itself, besides that you feel between your finger and the skin, or meat: then you will know for sure, that it is penetrating: so do not work on it, because its cure is not as I have said.
Dixerunt tamen, quia sanatur in quibusdam hominibus caro, et ex medicatione qua ei speratur iuuamentum, est, ut ignias cauterium subtile secundum amplitudinem Fistulae, sicut praecessit, et intromittas ipsum ignitum in Fistulam, donec perueniat circa anum.	They said, however, that he heals some men of flesh, and from the medicine which he expects will help him, that is to say, like the earlier one, he burns the fistula with a fine fire according to its length, and inserts it into the fistula until he reaches a certain place.
Deinde itera illud bis, aut ter, donec scias, quia iam adustae sunt omnes illae carnes additae filtratae, quae sunt similes cannulae pennae auis.	Then repeat that again twice, or three times, until you know that all the added filtered flesh which is similar to a feather of an owl has burned away.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, donec egrediantur illae carnes, quae adustae sunt: deinde cura illud cum unguentis generantibus carnem et consolidantibus.	Then take care with a smooth paste in butter, until the burned flesh comes out; and then take care with an ointment which generates flesh and hardens it.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est.	If he heals then, it is good.
Et si non, tunc non sanatur cum alia curatione unquam.	And if not, then he will not heal with any other cure.
Et si egreditur tenta, et non peruenerit usque ad digitum tuum, qui est in ano, et est inter ipsum et tentam uelamen spissum ex carne, aut sifac: et uides Fistulam in eo quod sequitur superficiem cutis, tunc seca cutem ab initio Fistulae, et tu uadis secando cum tenta quod est in fistula, donec perueniat secatio ubi peruenit tentae extremitas, et liberatur tenta et cadit.	And if it comes out with a little pain and does not reach your finger, which is in the anus, and there is thick flesh or pus between it and the bandage; and you see a fistula on the skin surface that follows it, then dry the skin from the beginning of the fistula, and keep drying what is in the fistula until you reach the place where the end of the bandage reaches, and let the bandage come out and fall.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas, quae assimilantur cannulae pennae auis, ut non remaneat ex eis aliquid.	Then clean those filtered flesh which are similar to a feather of an owl so that nothing remains of them.
Si autem uincit te sanguis, et soluit inter te et inter operationem tuam ut seces illas carnes: tunc melius quod fit, et uelocioris iuuamenti, cauterizare eam cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta.	If, however, it hurts you and flows between you and the operation so that it separates those flesh; then better is it if it heals and becomes quickly healed, by burning it with fire or with sharp medicine.
Quoniam cauterium cum igne aggregat habitudines bonas, adustionem illarum carnium additarum, et abscisionem sanguinis, et exiccationem humiditatum.	For the burn creates good habits, to the burning of those added flesh and to the cutting off of blood, and drying up of moisture.
Deinde cura illud cum liciniis inuolutis in butyro, aut caulibus tritis, donec locus emittat pus, et egrediantur illae carnes adustae in pus.	Then take care with a smooth paste in butter, or ground clovers, until the place puts out puss, and the burned flesh comes out with puss.
Deinde cura tunc uulnus cum unguentis consolidatiuis, generantibus carnem duram: et sunt medicinae in quibus sunt stipticitas et exiccatio.	Then take care with a hard- generating ointment, which creates hard flesh; and there are medicines in which there is styptic and drying up.
Nam quando restaurantur, tunc iam sanatur: et non times iterationem.	When I am about to eat, then I am about to heal; and do not count on repetition.
Si autem Fistula iam peruenit usque ad profundum ani, et elongatur a superfluitate corporis: tunc intromitte digitum tuum in anum, et inquire cum eo.	But if the fistula has reached the depth of the pelvis and is extended beyond the confines of the body, then introduce your hand into the rectum and question it.
Si ergo sentis tentam, et inter te, et inter eam est uelamen ex sifac, aut carne, et est propinqua penetrationi: tunc non est operatio in illo, nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	But if you feel that there is an obstacle between you and her, or some defect of the hymen, or flesh is close to insertion: then it is not an operation in that, unless according to a second opinion of trust and hope.
Quod est, quia administratur in eo unus trium modorum: aut ut cauterizes ipsam, sicut diximus: aut seces eam, donec consequaris concauitatem eius, ut sit possibile tibi intromittere licinia, et curationem ex proximo.	That is, because it deals with two ways in it: or as if you were cauterizing her herself, as we have said: or separate her, until you achieve the desired concavity so that it is possible for you to introduce your finger and cure from nearby.
Et non procedas multum cum sectione, ut non incidas lacertum continentem anum, et accidat super infirmum exitus egestionis absque uoluntate.	And do not proceed much with the section, lest you fall into the deep pocket of a muscle, and happens to the end of the exitis without will.
Deinde cura illud cum eo quod diximus.	Then take care of that cure with it that we have said.
Fortasse enim sanabitur: aut elonges ipsum uelamen, et mundes ipsum postquam secas ipsum usque prope anum, sicut diximus, aut cum tenta, aut cum instrumento alio acutae extremitatis.	Perhaps she will be healed: or it will extend the defect and clean it up to the bottom of the body, as we have said, or with a finger or with another acute instrument.
Deinde mundifica illas carnes filtratas quae sunt in sectione, usque ubi potes cum perscrutatione.	Then cleanse those tissues that are in the section, until you can reach them with inspection.
Deinde conare restaurationem uulneris totius cum sectione, et orificio superiore ubi consolidatur: et remanet Fistula aperta in interiore parte anus, et erit leuius super infirmum.	Then try to restore the wound of the whole body with the section, and open a hole where it is consolidated: and remains a fistula opened in the inner part of the anus, and will be easier on the weakness.
Et quandoque suitur Fistula secundum hunc modum: et est, quando intromittis tentam in Fistulam: et est in latere ani circa superficiem corporis cum cute et margine ani: tunc accipe tentam perforatae extremitatis, quae est sicut acus aleskef, id est, praeparantium coria, secundum hanc formam.	And when it follows in this way: and that is, when you introduce the finger into the fistula: and is in the side of the anus near the surface of the body with skin and margin of the anus: then take hold of the finger at the tip, which is like a needle's eye, namely, the prepared thread, according to this shape.
Et intromitte in eam filum inuolutum ex quinque filis, et circiter ea.	And introduce into it a string with five threads and around it.
Deinde intromitte tentam cum filo in Fistulam, donec consequatur concauitatem eius.	Then introduce the finger with the thread into the fistula, until you achieve the desired concavity.
Si ergo est penetrans in margine ani interius prope, tunc extrahe filum ex illo foramine: ita ut intromittas digitum tuum in anum, et extrahas extremitatem fili, et aggreges duas extremitates simul: et stringe utramque, et dimitte illud die uno, aut duobus diebus: et quanto plus incidit filum in carne, stringe ipsum bene, donec incidantur illae carnes quae sunt inter duas extremitates fili, et cadant: deinde cura uulnus, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	If then it has penetrated into the margin of the anus from within, draw out a thread from that opening: so that you can insert your finger into the anus, and pull off the end of the thread, and join the two ends together at once: and tighten each one, and let go of it for that day, or two days: and whatever the thread has penetrated into the flesh, tighten it well, until those tissues which are between the two ends of the thread fall away and drop: then take care of the wound, until it has healed over and become sound.
Si autem orificium Fistulae non est penetrans: tunc fac ipsum penetrare quocunque modo praeparatur tibi, nisi sit in profundo multum.	If, however, the opening of the fistula is not penetrating: then make it penetrate wherever you prepare it for yourself, unless it is in a deep place.
Non enim inest tibi, ut facias illud propter lacertum, ut non incidas ipsum.	For you should not make it because you are making it due to a snake, so that you do not fall into it yourself.
Deinde fac cum ea sicut diximus, donec sanetur.	Then make it as we have said, until it is healed over.
Forma Spatumilis spinosi quo finditur Fistula, cuius curuitas est acuta ualde, et pars altera est non acuta, ut non incidat illud quod non est necesse, sicut uides.	The form of the needle with which the fistula is found, whose point is sharp and very keen, and one side is not acute so that it does not hit that which is unnecessary, as you see.
¶ De sutura Hemorroidarum, ex quibus currit sanguis ex incisione earum: et cura fissurarum.	Regarding the suture of hemorrhoids, from which blood flows from their incision: and take care of fissures.
Caput LXXXI.	Chapter LIII.
Sunt Hemorroides secundum duos modos.	There are hemorrhoids in two ways.
Aut enim sunt intra anum, similes uesicis carbonum, uel prunarum: aut quasi ipsae sint grana uuae.	Or they are within the anus, similar to coal or plums: or almost like grain.
Et ex eis sunt paruae, et magnae: et sanguis currit ex eis semper, et est una, et sunt multae.	And from them there are small ones and big ones: and blood flows from them always, and there is one that comes out, and many come out.
Et sunt extra anum, et in extremitatibus eius.	And they are outside the anus, and at the ends of it.
Verumtamen istae quae sunt extra anum, sunt secundum plurimum paucae humiditatis, ex quibus currit aqua citrina, aut parum sanguinis cursu assiduo: et sunt secundum colorem corporis.	However, those outside the anus are, according to most accounts, very few moist things from which runs yellow water, or a little blood with a constant flow: and they are according to the color of the body.
Et curatio eius quae est intra anum, est, ut praecipias infirmo ut assellet: et exprimatur, donec egrediatur anus, et appareant athelil tibi.	And the treatment for that which is within the anus is, as you command the sick to loosen it: and it is pressed out, until the anus comes out, and appears white to you.
Propterea ergo et suspende cum uncinis: aut tene eos cum ungue tuo.	Therefore also and suspend with hook: or hold them with your nail.
Deinde incide eos apud radices suas.	Then cut them next to their roots.
Si autem non retinentur in eis uncini, propter humiditatem eorum et ipsorum mollificationem: tunc cape eos cum panno aspero, aut cum coto ex diploide lanea, et extrahe eos cum digitis tuis.	But if they do not hold fast on the hook, because of their moisture and their own柔软性: then grasp them with a rough cloth, or with a twine of thin twine, and pull them out with your fingers.
Deinde incide eos, et pulueriza super eos post incisionem quosdam pulueres calidos, ut stent eis loco cauterii.	Then cut them, and sprinkle over them some warm poultices after the cut so that they stand in place of poultice.
Aut cauteriza eos secundum quod praecessit in capitulo cauterizandi.	Or cauterize them according to what has gone before in the chapter on cauterizing.
Deinde cura eos cum reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with the remaining cure, until they are healed.
Quod si non obedit anus egressioni, tunc clisteriza infirmum clisteri in quo sit mordicatio parua, ut lauetur cum eo quod est in ano, et obediat egressioni uelociter, quando exprimit se infirmus.	That if the anus of the expulsion does not obey, then clisterize the sick clister in which there is little mordicatio to let it flow with him who is in the anus, and make it obey the expulsion more quickly, when it expresses itself with the sick.
Si autem athelil sunt extrinseci ab ano, tunc res eorum est leuis, facilis: et est ut capias eos cum ungue tuo, aut capias eos cum uncino, et incidas eos.	But if they are extrinsically athelil from the anus, then their case is lighter and easier: and you may grasp them with your nail, or grasp them with a hook, and cut them.
Deinde cura eos cum eo quod diximus, donec sanentur.	Then take care of them with that which I have said, until they are healed.
Et qui abhorret incisionem cum ferro, tunc oportet ut administres suturam eorum secundum hunc modum.	And who hates the cut with iron, then you should administer a sutura to them according to this way.
Accipe filum inuolutum, et intromitte ipsum in acum.	Take a twine of yarn, and insert it into the wound.
Deinde extrahe athelil ad superiora, et fac ipsum penetrare cum acu in radice eius ex parte altera: et inuolue duas extremitates fili, in inferiori parte acus, et sint latitudinaliter: et stringe athelil strictura forti.	Then extract the athelil from above, and let the needle enter with an acuter into the root of it from one side: and wrap around the two ends of the thread, on the lower part of the needle, and make them run across: and tighten the athelil with a strong knot.
Deinde noda filum, et extrahe acum.	Then tie a knot in the twine, and remove the awl.
Fac illud cum omnibus athelil, et dimitte ex eis unum: nec suas ipsum, ut currat ex eo superfluitas sanguinis.	Make it with all the athelil, and let go from them one: and let not his own be cut away from him, so that there is a superfluity of blood.
Deinde pone super anum pannum infusum in oleo rosato, aut caeroto, et pone ipsum super anum: et praecipe infirmo, ut quiescat.	Then place over some cloth soaked in rose oil or olive oil, and place the sick person on it: and order the sick person to rest.
Deinde dimitte ipsum, donec cadat.	Then let go of him, until he falls.
Cum ergo cadunt athelil, cura eos cum unguentis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	And when the sutures have fallen off, treat them with ointment and other cures until they are healed.
¶ De cura Fissurarum.	[On the treatment of wounds.]
Multotiens enim accidunt ex exiccatione stercoris, et constrictione naturae.	[For often when dried stool comes out, and nature tightens up.]
Cum ergo antiquantur, et non ualet in eis medicina: tunc oportet ut radas cum puncta Spatumilis, aut cum ungue tuo, donec fiant humidae, et auferatur ab eis cortex superior qui prohibet eas a consolidatione.	[When they are somewhat dry, and do not respond to medical treatment; then you should cut them with a scissor, or with your own nail, until they are moist, and the upper crust [of dried excrement] that prevents them from being consolidated is removed.]
Deinde cura eas, donec consolidentur secundum quod oportet.	[Then treat them with care, according to what should be done.]
Si autem non consolidantur: tunc itera eas cum rasione uehementiori quam prima, donec sanguinentur multum, et excorientur deinde cura eas, donec sanentur.	[If they do not consolidate: then treat them again with a more aggressive treatment than before, until they bleed profusely, and then treat them with care, until they are healed.]
¶ De curatione Almirmar inuersorum, et non inuersorum: et Athelil siccorum, et Formicae.	[On the treatment of scurvy in those who are not infected by the plague, and in those who are infected with scurvy, and also for the treatment of the foot rot.]
Caput LXXXII.	[Head 82]
Scias quod Almirmar non est nisi nodus rotundus secundum colorem corporis, similis capiti claui: et fit in toto corpore, praecipue in inferioribus partibus pedum, et digitis: et accidit ex eis dolor apud ambulationem.	[Know that scurvy is a round nodule, of the color of the body, similar to a claw on the head: it develops throughout the body, especially in the lower parts of the feet and toes: and causes pain during walking.]
Oportet ergo ut secetur quod est in circumitu claui, et teneatur cum forficibus, aut cum uncino, et eradicetur ex radice sua.	[It should be cut off what is in the shape of a claw, and held with forceps, or with a clamp, and completely removed from its root.]
Deinde cura illud: et si uis cauteriza illud secundum quod praecessit in capitulo suo.	[Then treat it; and if you have a cautery, treat it as described in my chapter on the head.]
Ex athelil autem siccis unus est eminentia parua, aspera, filtrata, rotunda supra superficiem corporis.	[But of the dry scurvy there is one little eminence, rough, filtre-like, round on top of the skin.]Si quoddam uel magne facit in pedibus aut in digitis, non est iidem cum in corpore: sed si in corpore fit, curatur
Et multotiens accidunt in manibus puerorum.	[If something makes a mark in the feet or toes, it is not the same as when it is on the body; but if it is on the body
Et curatio eius est, ut extendas athelil, et incidas ipsum: aut stringas ipsum cum filo de serico: aut cum pilo, donec cadat.	[And its treatment is to spread the scaly skin and cover it with a cloth; or to tie it with silk thread, or with down, until it falls off.]Cum ergo est incisa, et stridentia, et non cadere vel exire: tunc oportet ut cum rasione ve-semem, aut cu-m uncine, donec resipientes sim
Et si uis, cauteriza ipsum secundum quod praemissum est cum igne, aut cum medicina acuta: et iam eradicantur athelil inuersi, et non inuersi cum instrumento quod ego dicam.	And if you see, you cauterize him according to what has been said before with fire, or with sharp medicine: and now the athelial that is spread out are eradicated, and not those who do not spread out with an instrument which I say.
Formica autem est etiam eminentia parua filtrata, grossa, super superficiem corporis, uadens in profundum ualde: et quando inuenit eam frigus, sentitur in ea simile mordicationi formicae, et fit in corpore toto: et plurimum eius fit in manibus.	But the ant also is an eminent small filtered one, thick, on the surface of the body, waddling into the depth greatly: and when it comes to him cold, it feels in it a similar stinging of an ant, and becomes in the whole body: and most of it is made in the hands.
Et curatio eius est, ut accipias cannulam ex penna anseris, aut penna uulturis forti: et pone illam cannulam super Formicam, donec contineat circulus cannulae ex partibus eius.	And its cure is, that you take a tube from a goose feather, or a strong swan feather: and put that tube on the ant, until it contains a circle of tubes from its parts.
Deinde reuolue manum tuam cum cannula, donec seces quod est in circumitu Formicae: et ponas eam in profundo carnis, et eradices Formicam ex radice eius.	Then you rotate your hand with the tube, until you separate what is in the circumference of the ant: and put that on a deep place of flesh, and eradicate the ant from its root.
Et si uis, fac illud cum cannula aeris, aut ferri, secundum hanc formam.	And if you see, do that with a tube of air, or iron, according to this form.
Sit superius cannulae ad sublimitatem trahens surdum inuolutum, ut alleuietur super digitum apprehensio eius et ipsius reuolutio.	Let it sit on the upper limit, pulling a soft covered thing, so that it eases the pressure of its grip and its rotation.
Et si uis cauteriza Formicam secundum quod praemissum est in cauterizatione Athelil in capitulo de cauterio.	And if you see, cauterize the ant according to what has been said before in the cauterization of Athelial in the chapter on cauterization.
¶ De formis Instrumentorum quae administrantur ad Clisteria in aegritudinibus Ani, et solutionis uentris, et colicae.	Regarding the forms of instruments that are used for douches in ailments of the goose, and for the relief of venereal disease and colic.
Caput LXXXIII.	Chapter LXXXIII.
Quandoque Clistere fit ex argento, aut ex aurichalco, aut ex aere fuso, aut malleato.	When the douche is made of silver, or of gold-plated brass, or of fine brass, or of mallet.
Et quandoque fit ex istis Instrumentis paruum, et magnum, secundum illos in quibus administrantur.	And when they are made from these small instruments, and from the large ones, according to those in which they are administered.
Illud ergo quod administratur in curatione puerorum paruorum, sit paruum: et quorum ani sunt debiles, aut dolorosi, sic et clisteria eorum.	So what is administered in the cure of young boys who are weak or aching, should be small, and those whose anus is weak or painful, such should be the douche.
Clistere magnum.	The large douche.
Cistere paruum.	Suture the small cyst.
Canna eius, id est, caput superius in quo ligatur uter, sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, trahens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in latere altero foramen unum.	Suture the small cyst. Cannae ite, v.s., caput superius in quo ligatur uter sit amplum secundum hunc modum: et sit ei distinctio ut ligetur uter sicut uides, et extremitas eius inferior quae intromittitur in anum, sit surda, id est, non aperta, lenis, ualde, traens ad subtilitatem: et in uno laterum eius sint duo foramina, et in lato altero foramen unum.
Et sit amplitudo foraminis secundum grossitudinem radiorum, et grossius parum, et sit uter in quo ponuntur medicinae ex uesica animalis: aut ex charta ouis, quae sit secundum formam asofrati paruae: cuius radix sit palmus unus.	And let the width of the foramen be according to the thickness of the rays, and thicker in parts, and let the uter in which they are placed be from animal fat: or from a piece of parchment that is according to form as if small: whose root is one palm.
Et perforetur foraminibus multis sicut reuoluitur, et sit spacium quod est inter omne foramen grossitudo digiti.	And let there be many holes through which it passes, and let the space between each hole be as long as a finger's length.
Deinde intromitte in illa foramina filum forte ex filo crudo, quod sit ex decem filis, aut circiter ea, et aggrega cum eo utrem sicut asofrati.	Then insert into those holes a strong thread from raw silk, which is from ten threads or so, and bind it together with the thread so that it is like a bundle of reeds.
Cum ergo ponitur in eo uter, stringatur in capite clisteris inter duo distinguentia constrictione forti.	So when this uter is placed in it, let it be fastened in the head of the cyst with two distinctions by strong constriction.
Deinde clisteriza cum eo.	Then let the cyst be sewed up with it.
Et haec est forma circuli utris hic depicta, et foraminum.	And this is the form of the uter as it is depicted here, and the holes.
Qualitas autem clisterizandi cum eo, est: ut impleas utrem, aut uesicam ex medicina, quae sit calefacta secundum quantitatem tolerantiae infirmi: et caue ne sit calida ualde, aut frigida ualde.	The quality of the sewing up with it is this: so that the uter be filled, or animal fat from medicine which is heated according to the tolerance of the nurse, and let it not be hot or cold.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum, et eleuet crura sua ad superiora: et pone sub eo inthaan, id est, corium super quod iacent homines, aut linteamen.	Then let the sick person lie on his back, and raise his legs up: and place it under him, that is, a cloth over which men sleep, or a mattress.
Deinde inunge extremitatem Clisteris cum oleo, aut cum albugine oui, aut cum mucillagine foenugraeci, aut similium.	Then dip the end of the cyst in oil, or in chalk milk, or in mucus of fenugreek, or like it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in anum cum facilitate.	Then insert himself into the anus with ease.
Deinde accipiat minister utrem cum duabus manibus suis simul, et exprimat ipsum cum uehementia, donec euacuet totum quod est in Clisteri in intestinum.	Then let the attendant take him by both hands and squeeze it with great force, until all the contents are emptied into the cistern in the intestines.
Deinde extrahe Clistere, et eleuet infirmus crura sua ad parietem.	Then remove the clister and raise his lame legs towards the wall.
Quod si medicina cogit eum ad exitum, tunc teneat quantum potest.	If the medicine makes him want to defecate, then he should hold it as much as possible.
Et si dormit cum ea nocte tota, est magis ultimum in iuuamento.	And if he sleeps all night with it, it is more effective for recovery.
Si autem clisterizas eum in aegritudinibus solutionis uentris, et festinat exitus eius: tunc itera clistere, donec sanetur.	But if you use the clister to relieve his ailments and bring on his bowels' movements: then repeat the clister, until he is healed.
Quod si in ano sunt hemorroides, aut apostemata laedentia, tunc sit clistere subtile ualde, lene, ex clisteribus quibus clisterizantur pueri.	If there are hemorrhoids or itching in the anus, then let him use the clister very gently, softly, with the clisters that are used by boys.
Et haec sit forma clisteris subtilis super quod sit stricta cutis.	And this should be the form of a subtle clister that is tightly wrapped around what has a skin covering it.
¶ De curatione Vulnerum capitis sine fractura ossis.	For the treatment of wounds to the head without a broken bone.
Caput LXXXIIII.	Chapter LXXVIII.
Iam dixi in diuisione de curatione uulnerum quod conueniebat libro, et ego dicam hic curationem eorum cum manu, et cum medicinis secundum complementum.	I have already spoken in the division of the treatment of wounds that suited the book, and I now speak here about this treatment with the hand, and with the aid of a second medication.
Dico ergo, quod uulnera diuersificantur secundum illud quo fiunt uulnera, et secundum locum super quem cadit uulnus.	I say, therefore, that wounds differ according to that by which they are made, and according to the site on which the wound falls.
Res ergo quibus fiunt uulnera multotiens, sunt sicut iactus lapidis: aut incisio ensis, aut cultelli: aut percussio cum lancea, aut ligno, aut sagitta: et similibus illis ex rebus multis.	So then the kinds of wounds that are caused frequently are like the impact of stones: or the cut of a blade, or the strike of a lance, or a piece of wood, or an arrow: and similar things from among many.
Vulnera autem quae fiunt secundum loca corporis sunt, sicut uulnus quod cadit super caput, aut collum, aut pectus, aut uentrem, aut epar: et similia ex eis membris.	But wounds that are caused by sites of the body are, for example, a wound that falls on the head, or the neck, or the chest, or the belly, or the pelvis: and similar members of the body.
Et ego sum narrans curationes quorundam uulnerum, ut ponam eam ratiocinationem et regulam super reliqua uulnera.	And I am telling about the treatments of some wounds, so that I may set forth the reasoning and rule for the remaining wounds.
Et ego incipiam a uulneribus capitis simplicibus: quoniam rememoratio compositorum ueniet in principio capituli tertii.	And I will begin with simple head wounds: because remembrance of composers will come at the beginning of Chapter Three.
Dico ergo.	I therefore declare.
Quando accidit in capite uulnus simplex, et non est fractura ossis: considera tunc, si est ex iactu lapidis, aut ei similibus, et iam fregit cutem tantum: et est uulnus magnum, et times super infirmum euentum apostematis calidi: tunc propera, et phlebotoma cephalicam statim: et non tardes illud: et extrahe ei ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis eius: si non fuerit prohibens aliquid a phlebotomia, praecipue si fuerit sanguis qui egreditur ex uulnere paucus.	I therefore declare. When there is a simple wound in the head and there is no fracture of the bone: consider then, if it has been caused by a stone or something similar, and it has already broken the skin alone: and it is a great wound, and be careful about subsequent healing pustules of heat: then proceed immediately to phlebotomy on the head: and do not delay that: and draw out of it according to the quantity of its strength: if there is no impediment to phlebotomy, especially if it is blood which is coming out from the wound in small quantities.
Et sit phlebotomia ex contrario partis uulneratae.	And let there be phlebotomy from the opposite side of the wounded area.
Et caueat infirmus sibi a repletione, et uino, et cibis grossis.	And let the sick person refrain from drinking, and wine, and coarse food.
Si autem minutionem prohibet aliquid, tunc minoretur ex cibo, et non appropinquet carnibus, neque uinis.	If, however, something prohibits him from fasting, then he should abstain from food, and do not approach meat, nor wine.
Et pone super uulnus si accidit ei apostema calidum, cotum infusum in oleo rosato solo, aut cum uino in quo est stipticitas.	And place on the wound if it happens that there is a warm pustule, a solution infused with oil of rose alone, or with wine in which there is stenosis.
Si autem securus fueris ab apostemate calido, tunc pone super uulnus, si est recens cum sanguine suo, et non mutauit ipsum aer, puluerem quem ego narrabo post paululum: et si iam mutauit ipsum aer, tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, donec sanetur.	If, however, you are free from a warm pustule, then place on the wound if it is young with its own blood, and do not change it: and if it has already changed it itself, then place on it some ointment, until it heals.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, aut est ex incisione ensis, et similium: et non aggregantur labia eius per puluillos, tunc aggrega ipsa cum sutura, secundum quod ego narrabo in uulneribus uentris de sutura eorum.	If, however, the wound is large, or has been made with a knife, and similar: and if its edges are not joined together by pustules, then join them together with a suture, according to what I will narrate about the wounds of the limbs concerning their sutures.
Si autem uulnus iam detectum est ab osse, et pendet, et non est retentio eius, nisi in suspensorio paruo: tunc incide ipsum.	If, however, the wound has already been detected from the bone, and hangs down, and there is no hold of it, except in a small suspender: then cut it.
Deinde cura uulnus cum medicinis, et restaura in eo carnem duram loco cutis, et praecipe infirmo, ut alatur cibis in quibus est grossitudo, sicut sunt capita, et triticum coctum, donec sit ut puls: et eis similia.	Then take care of the wound with medicines, and restore in it hard flesh where the skin is, and command the sick person to eat food in which there is coarseness, such as are heads of corn, and cooked wheat, until it has become like a pulse: and like things for them.
Quod si inuenis in cute putrefactionem, et non adhaeret ossi: tunc incide putrefactum totum, et proiice ipsum: deinde cura illud.	If it putrefies in the wound and does not adhere to the bone: then incise the whole putrefied part and throw it away: and then care for it.
Si autem in his uulneribus est arteria, aut uena ex qua fluit sanguis: et non abscinditur per medicinas, tunc inquire super arteriam.	But if there is an artery in these wounds or a new one from which blood flows and does not stop even with medicines, then inquire about the artery.
Si ergo inuenis eam non sectam, tunc seca eam cum Spatumili, aut liga eam.	If you have not cut it open yet, then dry it up with Spatem or tie it up.
Quod si necessitas prouocat quando non confert illud quod diximus, tunc cauteriza eam, donec abscindatur sanguis.	What if necessity forces you to do so before the above [treatments], then burn it, until the blood stops flowing.
Si autem uulnera ista sunt parua, simplicia, tunc res eorum est facilis, leuis: ita ut puluerizes super ea hunc puluerem: quoniam consolidat ea antequam mutet ea aer.	But if these wounds are small and simple, then the treatment of them is easy and light: so that dust over them this dust: for they harden before they change [into a putrefied state] with air.
¶ Modus Pulueris incarnatiui.	The method of using powdered incantation.
Recipe olibani partem unam, et sanguinis draconis partes duas, et calcis non extinctae partes tres: teratur totum multum, et cribelletur: et impleatur ex eo uulnus, et constringatur constrictione bona, donec adhaereat super ipsum bene, et coaguletur cum sanguine.	Take part of olive oil, and two parts of dragon's blood, and three parts of non-extinguished lime: mix them very much together, and sieve them: and fill them with the powder, and tighten them tightly so that they adhere well to the wound, and are congealed with blood.
Deinde stringe ipsum desuper cum puluillis, et dimitte ipsum, neque soluas ipsum dum permanet, ita quod non apostemetur.	Then tie it up from above with the powder, and let it go, and do not remove it until it is healed, so that it does not open again.
Nam non eradicatur ab eo medicina, donec sanatur.	For this medicine will not get rid of it until it has been healed.
Et quandoque facit illud calx sola, quando non sunt tibi in praesenti olibanum, et sanguis draconis etiam facit eandem operationem in multis ex uulneribus magnis, quando conuenit ut ponatur super ea et stringantur, et sunt uulnera recentia cum sanguine suo, quae non alterauit aer.	And whenever it does this calcification by itself, for you do not have olive oil and dragon' blood at hand either; the same action is performed on many large wounds when it is placed on them and tied up, and are wounds with blood of their own that have not changed with air.
Quod si iam alterauit ea aer quadam alteratione, praecipue quando est in tempore aestatis, tunc non est in positione huius pulueris intentio: cura ergo ipsum cum eo quod diximus, ita ut ponas super ea quaedam unguenta digestiua: aut ponas super ea pultes ex farina hordei, factas cum aqua et melle, donec emittant pus.	What if it has already been altered by air in some way, especially during the summer season, then this powder's intention is not in position: therefore care for it with what we have mentioned, so that you place on it a kind of digestive ointment: or place on it a paste made from barley flour, made with water and honey, until it discharges pus.
Deinde cura ea reliqua curatione, donec sanentur.	Then, care for those remaining wounds until they heal.
Si uero accidat cum uulnere fractura in osse, et est parua, tunc extrahe illud cum Gesti: et ego iam dicam curationem fracturarum capitis in eo quod futurum est.	If, however, there is a fracture of the bone and it is small, then extract it with the Wrist: and I will already be saying the cure for fractures of the skull in that which is to come.
¶ De uulneribus Colli.	Regarding injuries to the neck.
Caput LXXXV.	Chapter on the Head (75)
SI Autem uulnus accidat in Collo, tunc non est inter ipsum differentia in medicatione, et inter uulnus capitis quando est simplex.	If, however, an injury occurs in the neck, there is no difference in treatment between it and a simple injury to the head.
Si autem iam incisus est neruus Colli, aut arteria: tunc si est neruus, non est in eo ingenium, nisi ut deuitetur curatio eius cum eo quod facit stipticitatem uehementem, sicut ziniar, et zegi, et eis similia.	If, however, an incision has already been made into the nerves of the neck, or into an artery: then if it is a nerve, there is no skill in its treatment unless it is taken care of so that it causes a sharp pain, like a twinge, and makes one blind, and gives similar symptoms.
Quoniam nocent neruis, et contrahunt eos.	Because they hurt the nerves, and make them jerk.
Et non ponas super uulnus aliquid frigidum omnino: quoniam substantia neruorum est frigida, et continuatio eius est cum cerebro, quod est sublimius membrorum: et sit illud quo curatur ex medicinis lene, sicut calx lota cum aqua dulci aliquotiens infusa cum oleo, aut cum oleo rosato, et tuthia, quando abluitur etiam cum aqua dulci: et reliqui lapides minerales, secundum hunc modum, et unguenta humida.	And do not put anything cold on a wound at all: for the substance of nerves is cold, and its continuance is with the brain, which is a higher member: and let that be treated by physicians with lene, like a calx poured out with sweet water sometimes infused with oil, or with rose oil, and alumen, when it is rinsed off as well with sweet water: and also with other wet minerals, in this way, and with moist ointments.
Si autem uulnus est magnum, tunc administra suturam: aut coarta labia eius cum puluillis.	If the wound is large, then apply a stitch: or cover it with powder.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for the wound, until it heals.
Si uero uulneri est profunditas, aut accidit in eo sinus in inferiori parte eius, in quo iam aggregatur pus, tunc perfora ipsum in magis depresso loco in eo.	If, however, the depth of the wound is great, or it has occurred in a sinus lower down on it, where pus has already accumulated: then pierce it with a sharp instrument in the low place.
Quod si iam incisa est in uulnere arteria, et consecutus est sanguinem eius fluxus: tunc separa, uel seca eam, et liga ipsam: aut cauteriza eam, si prouocat necessitas ad illud.	If, however, an incision has been made into a nerve, and the blood flow from it is successive: then separate it, or dry it up, and tie it up: or cauterize it, if necessity compels it to do so.
Si autem iam incidit spondiles gutturis, aut totum, et saluatae sunt alhaudegi: tunc aggrega labia cutis cum sutura super cannam gutturis, et non tangas guttur, imo aequa ipsum, et reduc ipsum super figuram naturalem.	If, however, an injury has occurred to the spine with a spondyl or two, and they have healed in such a way that you cannot tell where the injury was: then join the skin together with a stitch on either side of the wound, and do not touch the wound, but reduce it to its natural shape.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti, et dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot.	Then tighten the wound with a strip and leave it for a few days.
Deinde cura ipsum cum unguentis in quibus est stipticitas et exiccatio, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound with ointment until it heals over.
Si autem uulnus iam fecit impressionem in osse, tunc perquire ipsum: tunc si in ipso sunt fragmenta ossis, extrahe ea omnia, aut quae potes ex eis: et quod non praeparatur, dimitte illud, donec putrescat uulnus, et separetur et alleuietur egressio eius.	If the wound has already made an impression on the bone, then examine it: if there are any bone fragments inside, remove them all, or as many as you can; and if it is not prepared (for treatment), leave it until the tendon rot and separates from its exit.
Quod si uulnus fuerit recens, tunc pulueriza super ipsum puluerem quem narraui.	If the tendon is fresh, then powder the wound with the powder that you have made.
Si autem uidetur in uulnere os, et fit Fistula: tunc cura ipsam cum eo cuius rememoratio uenit in capitulo suo.	If it has entered into a tendon and formed a fistula, then treat it with what is written about it in the chapter of its treatment.
¶ De uulnere in Spatulis.	Surgeon's knife.
Caput LXXXVI.	Chapter LXIII.
SI Est percussio lanceae, aut cultelli: et uides eius profunditatem, tunc considera.	If the wound is from a lance or a dagger and you can see its depth, then examine it carefully.
Si ergo ex uulnere egreditur uentositas, quando anhelat ex eo infirmus, tunc scias, quia uulnus est mortale.	If the tendon that has been wounded ever comes to be free from pain, then know that the tendon is healed.
Quod si non fuerit ei profunditas, et est recens cum sanguine suo: tunc non ponas in eo a prima hora puluerem, neque stringas ipsum, ut non retineatur sanguis in profunditate eius, et reuertatur ad cor, et interficiat infirmum: sed pone in ipso unguentum attractiuum, et solue ipsum in die bis.	If it is not deep and is fresh with its blood, then do not put powder on it at first, nor tighten it up so that the blood does not flow into its depth and return to its heart, causing injury; but rather put on the wound a tempting ointment, and loosen it twice a day.
Si uero unguentum non est tibi praesens, tunc pone in orificio uulneris cotum uetustum, ut sugat illud quod egreditur de eo ex humiditatibus: et fac ut dormiat infirmus super uulnus, ut currat quod aggregatur in eo.	But if you do not have ointment available to you, then put on a cotton poultice that is wet with ointment, so that it soothes the wound as it drains its secretions: and let the patient sleep on the wound, so that the accumulated secretions flow into it.
Si uero iam praeterierint uulneri tres dies, aut plures, et non accidit infirmo spasmus, neque tremor cordis malus, neque strictura in anhelitu, et uides reliquas dispositiones eius bonas: tunc scias, quia uulnus est saluum.	But if the wound has been there for three or more days and no spasm, bad tremor of the heart, or constriction of breath, and the other symptoms of it are good, then know that the tendon is healed.
Cura ergo ipsum et cum liciniis, et reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then treat the wound with care, and with the rest of the cure, until it heals over.
Si uero excusatur sanatio eius, et iam aperitur semper, tunc scias, quia iam factum est Fistula.	If indeed the cure is successful and it has already opened up again, then you know that a fistula has already formed.
Cura ergo ipsam ex capitulo suo.	Then let the cure of itself from this chapter.
Et si uulnus est ex incisione ensis, aut cultelli, et est simplex in superficie pectoris, aut dorsi: tunc cura ipsum cum eo quod praecessit ex sutura, si est magnum: aut cum puluere, si est paruum.	And if the wound is from an incision of the knife or chisel and it is simple on the surface of the breast or back: then let the cure be with it that preceded from the suture, if it is large; or with dust, if it is small.
Si autem iam fecit impressionem in osse, et incidit ex eo frusta: tunc inquire uulnus, et propera ad extrahendum illa frusta, si sunt separata.	But if it has already made an impression on the bone and has come from it a splinter: then investigate the wound, and approach to remove those splinters, if they are separate.
Si uero non sunt separata, tunc dimitte ea, donec putrefiat uulnus, alleuiatur enim extractio eorum.	If not, then let them go, until the splinter rotten, for the extraction of them is allayed.
Reliquorum autem uulnerum accidentium in reliquis membris iudicium in curatione, est iudicium eius quod diximus.	But of the remaining wounds and injuries in the other members, the judgment in the cure is the judgment of that which we have said.
¶ De uulneribus Ventris, et exitu intestini, et exitura eorum.	About wounds of the belly, and exit of the intestines, and their coming out.
Caput LXXXVII.	Chapter LXXVII.
Disruptio quae accidit uentri, est magna, et media, et parua.	The rupture that has happened in the belly is great, and medium, and small.
Ex magna igitur quandoque egreditur intestinum, aut numerus intestinorum.	So when this great one has gone out, or the number of intestines.
Quare fit intromissio eorum, et eorum sutura uehementior et difficilior.	Why is there an introduction and a suture more severe and more difficult.
Et disruptio parua etiam fit difficilis ex modo alio.	And a small rupture also can be difficult in another way.
Sequitur ergo, ut sit reductio eorum difficilior, si non properas in intromissione sua ad locum suum statim: quoniam inflatur, aperitur, et ingrossatur: quare fit difficilis introitus eius.	So, that your reduction may be more difficult, if you do not approach the introduction of its place immediately: for it swells, opens up, and thickens: why is the introduction difficult?
Propter hoc ergo fit melior disruptionum disruptio media: quoniam cum ea non fit difficilis reductio intestini, sicut fit dissicilis in his duabus speciebus.	Therefore, this being so, the rupture is a good one: for when it does not cause difficulty in the reduction of the intestine, as it happens in these two species.
Scias, quod sutura uenris est secundum quatuor modos.	Know that the suture of the belly is according to four ways.
Duae suturae communes conueniunt in sutura uentris, et in sutura reliquorum uulnerum corporis: et duae suturae aliae proprie communicant reliquis uulneribus.	Two common sutures meet in the suture of the belly, and in the suture of the remaining wounds of the body: and two other sutures separate to each other communicate with the other wounds.
Verumtamen sunt magis propriae cum sutura uentris: et ego narro tibi unamquamque cum expositione, et declaratione.	Truly they are more proper with suturing the ankle: and I tell you one as well as another with explanation and announcement.
Dico ergo, quia quando uulnus est paruum, et egreditur ex eo aliquid ex intestino, et fit difficile reducere ipsum: tunc illud est propter unum duorum modorum.	I say then, because when the injury is slight, and something comes out of the intestines, and it is difficult to reduce it: then it is for two reasons.
Aut propter paruitatem disruptionis, sicut diximus: Aut quoniam in intestino est inflatio propter frigus aeris.	Or because of the slightness of the break, as we have said: Or because there is swelling in the intestines from cold air.
Quando ergo illud est ita, tunc oportet ut calefacias ipsum, ita ut submergas spongiam, aut pannum humidum in aqua tepida sola.	When then is it so? Then you must heat the wound like this: so that you dip a sponge or a damp cloth in warm water alone.
Aut decoquas in aqua squinantum, et cyperum, et spicam, et embroces cum ea intestinum, donec resoluatur inflatio.	Or you make it up in water with squill, and hyssop, and pepper, and pound it with the intestines, until the swelling goes down.
Quandoque facit illud uinum in quo est stipticitas: et est melius quam aqua sola in resolutione inflationis.	When then does the ankle do that has a sty: and it is better than water alone in solving inflammation.
Cum ergo uides inflationem iam resolui, tunc humecta intestinum cum aqua in qua decocta est altea, aut malua.	When then you see the swelling already resolved, then wet the intestines with the water in which the ale is cooked, or make it bad.
Nam per illud alleuiatur introitus eius cum re parua.	For by this the entrance is relieved when it is small.
Si autem excusatur reditus eius post hanc curationem, tunc finde in disruptione parum, cum instrumento quo secantur hemorrhoides.	If, however, the retreat of it after this cure is excused, then find in the disruption a little, with the instrument where they scrape the hemorrhoids.
Et curatio prima est melior quando praeparatur, quam sectio: et non fit coactio ad secandum post necessitatem et defectum instrumenti.	And the first cure is better when it is prepared, than the section; and there is no pressure to cut after need and want of the instrument.
Sit pars eius una quae est torta, acuta, et pars eius altera non acuta, et extremitas subtilis non sit cum subtilitate Spatumilis, imo sit obtusior parumper: et est illa quae similatur caiada, sicut uides.	It is one part of it that is bent, sharp, and the other not acute, and the tip is slightly less so than the Spatemil's sharpness; and this is similar to a claw, as you see.
Cum ergo amplificatur uulnus, et ingreditur intestinum, tunc oportet, ut sit reductio eius secundum formam suam naturalem in loco suo sibi proprio, si possibile est super illud: quoniam est melius.	When then does the ankle get larger, and the intestines are drawn in, then you must reduce it according to its natural form in its own place, if possible about it: for it is better.
Quando uero disruptio est ampla in inferiori parte uentris: tunc oportet ut facias iacere infirmum super dorsum suum, et pone crura sua altiora capite suo.	When then is the disruption wide in the lower part of the ankle: then you must place the sick one on its back, and raise its legs with its head.
Et si est in superiore parte uentris, tunc pone caput eius, et pectus ipsius altiora quam eius inferiora.	And if it is in the upper part of the leg, then place its head, and make its chest higher than its lower parts.
Et similiter si est disruptio in una duarum partium uentris, tunc pone intentionem tuam, et tuam considerationem semper in hoc, ut pars in qua est uulnus sit altior parte altera.	And likewise if the break is in one of the two parts of the leg, then place your intention, and always keep this in mind, that the part that has the wound should be higher than the other side.
Et ita oportet, ut admimistres illud in uulneribus magnis, et in uulneribus mediis.	And so it should be, that you handle those who are large wounds, and those who have medium wounds.
In uulneribus autem paruis, pone illud secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	In small wounds, place it according to what is prepared for you.
Deinde fac ut sit praesens inter manus tuas minister pius, qui teneat disruptionem totam manu sua: et aggrega labia eius.	Then make sure that the minister who holds the entire break in his hand is present between your hands: and spread his lips.
Deinde detege ex ea ei qui sequitur suturam aliquid post aliquid: et iste est modus suturae communis unius.	Then detect from him who follows a thread something after something: and this is the common method of sewing one thread.
Et est, ut accipias acum, aut numerum acuum secundum quantitatem amplitudinis uulneris.	And it is, so that you take an acute angle, or a number of acute angles according to the width of the wound.
Deinde dimitte ab extremitate disruptionis quantitatem digiti anularis, id est, medici: et fige acum unam praeter quod intromittas in eam filum in duabus extremitatibuis cutis, cum duabus extremitatibus sifac quod est sub cute ab interioribus, donec facias eam penetrare ab alia parte, et tu iam aggregasti duas extremitates cutis, et duas extremitates sifac: et fiunt quatuor ordines.	Then let go from the end of the break the amount of the fingernail, that is, the doctor: and fasten now one more than what you put into it in the two ends of the skin, with the two ends of the thread that is under the skin from the inside, until you make it penetrate from the other side, and you have already joined the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of the thread: and there are four orders.
Deinde stringe cum filo duplo in circumitu acus aliquotiens a duabus partibus simul, quousque sint aggregata duo labia uulneris aggregatione decenti.	Then tighten with a double thread around the acupuncture from both sides, sometimes a few times, until the two lips of the wound have been joined together as they recede.
Deinde dimitte grossitudinem digiti etiam, et fige in eis acum aliam: postea reta eam cum filo, sicut fecisti cum acu prima.	Then let go of the bulkiness of the finger as well, and fasten now another one: then make it straight with a thread, as you did with the first acution.
Non ergo cesses facere illud cum eo quo indiges ex acubus, donec compleas constrictionem uulneris totius.	So therefore do not cease to do this with him who has the break, until you complete the constriction of the wound completely.
Et sint acus mediae inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem: quoniam acus subtiles ualde uelociter incidunt carnem: et grossae sunt difficilis introitus in cutem: propter illud oportet ut sint mediae in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	And let there be an acute angle between the bulk and the slenderness: for the acute angles cut the flesh quickly: and the gross ones are difficult to enter into the skin: therefore let there be a medium angle, and in slenderness, and in bulkiness.
Et non oportet, ut figatur acus in duabus extremitatibus cutis propinquae multum: ut non incidatur caro uelociter, et aperiatur uulnus ante consolidationem sui, et non elongentur etiam cum sutura, ut non prohibeatur uulnus a consolidatione.	And it should not be that the needles are inserted into the two ends of the skin of the nearby part by much: so that the flesh does not quickly get hurt, and the wound does not open before its own consolidation, and the sutures are also not elongated when they are sewn, so that the wound is not kept away from consolidation.
Deinde incide extremitatem acuum, ut non laedant infirmum apud somnum suum: et pone eis puluillos ex pannis ab omni parte, qui teneant extremitates acuum: et dimitte eos, donec scias quod uulnus iam consolidatum est.	Then cut the end of the needle so that it does not hurt the sick person when he sleeps: and place on them little pieces of leather from all sides, which hold the ends of the needles: and let them go until you know that the wound is already consolidated.
Et haec quidem species suturae cum acubus taliter est conuenientior in uulneribus paruis.	And this kind of stitch with needles is much more convenient for small wounds.
Quoniam sufficit in sutura eorum acus una, aut duae, aut circiter eas.	For it is enough in the stitch of these that one needle, or two, or around them.
Sutura autem secunda communis est, ut aggreges cum sutura extremitates quatuor: extremitates, duas cutis, et extremitates duas sifac in uice una, cum acu in qua sit filum inuolutum aequale in subtilitate, et grossitudine.	But the second common stitch is to join with the stitch the four ends: the two ends of the skin, and the two ends of the thread in one thread, with a needle in which the fillet is wound equally in thickness and subtlety, and
Deinde quando penetraueris cum acu has extremitates quatuor, reduc acum a parte a qua incaepisti eadem, ut cadat filum retatum a superiori parte uulneris: ut sit sutura, sicut sutura panni quo stringuntur panni, et pone inter omnem suturam quantitatem grossitudinis digiti minoris.	Then when you pierce with the needle the four ends, bring them back from the part from which you started in the same way, so that the thread is caught from above on the skin: so that it is a stitch, like the stitch of cloth, and place between each stitch the thickness of the little finger.
Hanc autem suturam sciunt homines.	This kind of stitch is known by men.
Et cum hac sutura ego sui uulnus quod acciderat uiro in uentre suo, qui fuerat uulneratus cum cultello, et erat disruptio uulneris maior palmo uno: et exierat ex intestinis circiter duos palmos ex intestino medio, et erat disruptio in medio uentris.	And with this stitch I sewed the wound of a man on his belly, which had been cut by a knife, and the wound was large enough for a palm: and about two palms of middle intestine came out from inside, and there was a break in the middle of the abdomen.
Reduxi ergo illud postquam stetit intestinum eius extra uulnus xxiiii horis.	So he reduced that after twenty hours had passed.
Consolidatum est ergo uulnus in spacio quod fuit circiter XV dies: et curaui ipsum, et sanatus est: et uixit post illud annis multis, conuersatus in suis dispositionibus.	The wound was consolidated in the space that had been around fifteen days: and I took care of him, and he recovered: and after that he lived for many years, in his own condition.
Et medici iudicauerant, quod non sanaretur.	And the doctors judged that he would not recover.
Et ex miraculo fuit, quod non curaui illud cum unguento.	And from a miracle it was that I did not cure him with ointment.
Quoniam fui in loco in quo non inueniebatur unguentum, neque aliquid ex medicinis.	For I was in a place where the ointment was not available, and there were no medicines.
Posui ergo super uulnus cotum uetustum bis in die, et assiduaui ablutionem eius cum aqua mellis, donec sanatum est.	I then put on the patch twice a day, and I kept washing it with honey water until it healed.
Duas autem species suturae proprias dicam secundum narrationem sermonis.	But two kinds of stitches, I will speak about according to the narrative.
Et est, ut incipias cum sutura acuta: et intromittas acum ab exteriori ad interiorem partem.	And is, as you begin with sharp stitch: and introduce it from the outside to the inside part.
Cum ergo penetrat acus in cutem, et in lacertum euntem secundum longitudinem et latitudinem totius corporis: dimitte extremitatem sifac in latere in quo intromisisti acum, et fac penetrare in extremitatem aliam ab interiori parte ad exteriorem in extremitate altera mirach.	And when the needle has penetrated into the skin, and has gone into a loop according to the length and width of all the body: let go of the end of the thread on the outside in which you have introduced the needle, and make it penetrate from the inside part to the outside on the opposite side.
Cum ergo feceris eam penetrare, tunc fac eam penetrare secundum hoc in eadem hac extremitate mirach ab exteriori parte ad interiorem: et dimitte extremitatem sifac, quae est in hoc latere, et fac penetrare acum in extremitatem alteram ab interiori parte ad exteriorem: et fac penetrare cum penetratione tua qua facis eam penetrare in sifac extremitate mirach, quae est in parte eius, donec penetret in ipsum totum.	And when you have made it penetrate, then make it penetrate again in the same end towards the inside: and let go of the end of the thread that is in this side, and make it penetrate from the outside part to the inside: and let go of the end of the thread, which is in this side, and make it penetrate with your penetration so that you make it penetrate into the end of the thread, which is in the opposite side, until it penetrates all of itself.
Deinde incipe etiam ab hoc eodem latere, et sue ipsum cum extremitate, quae est ex sifac in latere alio, et extrahe acum ex cute quam penetrauit.	Then also from this same side, and pull out the thread with the end that is outside, and bring it out of the skin where it has penetrated.
Deinde reduc eam in illam cutem, et sue extremitatem sifac, quae est in latere alio, cum hac extremitate mirach: et extrahe eam ex cute quae est ex parte eius, et fac illud uice una, et alia: et fac illud uice post uicem, usquequo suas extrinsecum totum secundum illud exemplum.	Then also reduce it into that skin, and pull out the end of the thread that is outside, and bring it out of the skin where it has penetrated. Then also make this end go around in that side with the other end towards the inside: and bring out of the skin what is from that part, and make it go back and forth until it is all outside according to that example.
Et summa huius suturae, est ut suas sutura pellipariorum qua suunt pelles: ita ut suas sifac uice una ex parte una extremitate cutis: et ut dimittas eam uice alia ex parte alia, donec compleas.	And the height of this stitch is as the sutures of the skin: so that the end of the thread that goes around from one side to the other, makes a loop; and so let go of it from one side, until you have completed it all.
Secunda species suturae propriae, quam dixit Gale nus.	Secunda species suterae propriae, quam dizit Galen.
Iste eius sermo narratus est, ut suas eam secundum similitudinem, qua suunt eas quidam medicantium, ita quod aggregant omnem partem ad comparem suam conuenientem per naturam: et applicant extremitatem sifac ad eius aliam extremitatem, et extremitatem mirach ad extremitatem eius aliam.	The text translates to: "The second type of sutures are those which Galen mentions. This is the description he gives, that they should be applied in a way similar to the way in which one joins together all the parts by nature: and they should apply one end to another, and one end to a third.
Et illud fit secundum quod narro tibi.	And this is what I will tell you.
Oportet ut figas acum in extremitatem mirach propinquam tibi ab exteriori parte, et facias eam penetrare ad interiorem in eo solo: et dimittas duas extremitates sifac.	You should fix it so that it penetrates into the inner part, leaving it from the outside: and you shall leave the two ends of the suture together.
Deinde reuolue acum, et fac eam penetrare ab exteriori parte ad interiorem in duas extremitates sifac, scilicet utrinque.	Then, turn the wound around, so that it penetrates from the outside to the inside on both ends of the suture, that is to say, from each side.
Deinde reuolue utrasque, etiam fac penetrare utrasque ab interiori usque ad exteriorem, in duas extremitates mirach alias, quae sunt in latere opposito.	Then turn both of them around as well, and let them penetrate from the inside to the outside, on both ends of the suture, that is to say, from each side, so that they penetrate on opposite sides, which are next to each other.
Et iste modus suturae est melior sutura communi facili, et est sutura cuius praecessit rememoratio.	And this method of stitching is better than the common simple stitch, and it is a stitch whose precursor was remembered.
Iste est ergo sermo Galeni etiam.	This is therefore the speech of Galen as well.
Et dixerunt quidam.	And some said:
Retificatur sutura uentris cum duabus acubus.	The suture of the hand with two fingers.
Quod est, ut intromittas in eis utrisque filum unum: et incipe cum intromissione acus, ex eo quod est apud te, et fac eam penetrare usque ad latus aliud, secundum suturam eorum qui suunt coria aequaliter.	That is to say, you should insert one thread into both of them: and begin with the insertion of the needle from your side, for that is where it is, and let it penetrate all the way to the other side; following the sutures of those who are equal in their nature.
Et scias, quod quando disruptio est in medio uentris: tunc sutura eius est difficilior quam reliquorum locorum uentris.	And you should know that when the break is in the middle of the hand: then the suture of that hand is more difficult than that of the other places of the hand.For if one will begin to stitch from the place where the break begins, and will go towards the center of the hand, he will have a hard task: for he will need to
Iudicium uero medicationis uulneris, est iudicium reliquorum uulnerum.	Judgment in fact of medicine for the wound, is judgment of other wounds.
Quod est, quia quando tu consequeris uulnus recens cum sanguine suo, antequam alteret ipsum aer: et reducis intestinum, et suis ipsum, et aptas ipsum: tunc pone super puluerem incarnatiuum.	That is to say, for when you have got the wound fresh with its blood, before it changes itself; and you reduce its intestines, and its own flesh, and make it fit: then place it over the powder of the scar.For this powder is good for the scar: and it will give strength to the scar and make it firm.
Quod si aer iam alterauit uulnus: tunc pone super ipsum quaedam unguenta, quae sunt tibi praesentia, donec faciant pus: et cadant fila, et consolidentur sifac, et mirach.	If the bone has been damaged by air: then place on it some ointments that are present with you until the pus forms: and let the threads fall, and become firm the Sifac, and mirach.
Deinde cura illud sicut est curatio reliquorum uulnerum, donec sanetur.	Then care for that as is the cure of other wounds, until it heals.
Si autem non sunt tibi praesentes medicinae, tunc pone super ipsum statim, exquo incipit emittere pus, cotum uetus: et permuta ipsum bis in die, sicut docui te, donec sanetur.	But if you do not have with you the medicines, then place on it immediately, so that the pus begins to emit, and change the dressing every day as I have taught you, until it heals.
Nam tu non indiges medicatione alia in pluribus dispositionibus, quando uulnera sunt simplicia.	For you do not need other medicine in many dispositions when wounds are simple.
Si autem times, quod communicet uulnus membris principalibus in laesione, tunc oportet ut submergas lanam lenem in oleo temperatae caliditatis, aut in oleo rosato: et pone ipsam in circumitu locorum quae sunt inter inguina, et sub ascellas.	But if you should be in a time that the wound communicates with the main members in injury, then it is necessary that you dip the wool in oil of moderate heat, or in rosewater: and place it in the circumferent places which are between the hips, and under the armpits.
Quod si sentit dolorem, aut punctiones, aut putrefactionem in intestinis suis (nam multotiens accidit illud) tunc clisteriza ipsum cum uino stiptico, nigro, tepido: praecipue si putredo iam peruenit in intestino, et facta est exitura penetrans usque ad concauitatem eius.	That if it feels pain, or punctures, or putrefaction in its intestines (for this often happens) then cleanse the body with wine vinegar, black, warm: especially if putridness has already set in the intestine, and a penetrating discharge has reached the perineum.
Et scias, quod illud quod est ex intestino grosso, est facilioris sanationis: et quod ex eis est ex subtili, difficilioris sanationis.	And you should know that what is from the large intestine is easier to heal: and that which is from the small intestine is more difficult to heal.
Intestinum autem quod nominatur Ieiunum, non suscipit sanationem ex uulnere quod accidit in eo omnino: et illud est propter multitudinem eius, quod est ex uenis, et magnitudine earum, et propter subtilitatem corporis eius, et propinquitatem ipsius naturae neruorum.	But the intestine which is called Jejunum does not accept healing from a wound that has befallen it at all: and this is because of its multiplicity, being from blood vessels, and its size, and because of the softness of its body, and the nearness of its nerves' nature.
Si autem illud quod procedit ex uulnere est zirbum, et consequeris ipsum recens: reduc ipsum secundum reductionem tuam, qua reducis intestina aequaliter.	But if that which proceeds from the wound is clear, and you have succeeded in collecting it: reduce it according to your reduction, by which you reduce the intestines equally.
Si uero praeteriit ei spacium, et iam factum est uiride, aut nigrum: tunc oportet ut stringas ipsum cum filo supra locum qui denigratus est ex eo, ut non accidat fluxus sanguinis.	But if it has passed the space, and has already become dark or light: then it is necessary that you tighten it with a thread above the place which has been darkened by it, so that blood does not flow out.
In zirbo enim sunt uenae et arteriae.	In zibro enim sunt uenae et arteriae.
Deinde incide quod est praeter illud ligamentum, et pone duas extremitates fili pendentes ex inferiori parte uulneris extra ipsum: ut alleuietur super te attractio eius, et extractio ipsius apud casum zirbi, et emissionem pus uulneris.	For then cut what is beyond that ligament, and place the two ends of a thread hanging from the lower part of the wound outside itself: so that its attraction above you is alleviated, and its extraction from the zib is facilitated, and the pus of the wound is released.
¶ Rememoratio uulneris quod accidit in Intestino.	Remembering the wound that happened in the Intestines.
Quando accidit disruptio in Intestino, et est parua: tunc possibile est, ut restauretur in quibusdam hominibus: propterea, quia ego uidi qui fuit uulneratus in uentre suo cum percussione lanceae, et erat uulnus a dextra stomachi, et antiquatum est uulnus: et factum Fistula, et exiuit ex eo egestio, et uentositas.	When the rupture happened in the Intestines, and it was small: then it is possible that, in some people, it can be restored: for I saw who was wounded in his belly with a lance blow, and he had an old wound on the right side of his stomach, and it had become a fistula, and exuded a discharge, and there was a hemorrhoid.
Posui ergo curationem, usque quod ego non fui confisus in sanatione eius: neque cessaui subtiliare ipsum, donec sanatus est, et consolidatus est locus.	So I applied the treatment, until I was not confident in its cure: and I did not hesitate to examine it, until it was cured, and the site was consolidated.
Postquam ego uidi locum iam consolidatum, timui super infirmum, quod accideret super infirmum accidens malum in uentre suo: et non accidit ei ex illo accidens malum.	After I saw the site had been consolidated, I feared on the illness that could happen to the belly after a bad accident: and it did not happen to him from that accident.
Et remansit in melioribus dispositionibus suis, comedens et bibens, et futuens, et intrauit balneum, et exercitatus est in dietis suis.	And he remained in better conditions, eating and drinking, and enjoying himself, and entering a bath, and exercising himself in his diet.
Et iam dixerunt quidam experimentatorum, quia quando accidit in Intestino uulnus, et est paruum: tunc oportet ut ligetur secundum hunc modum.	And some experimenters said, for when a wound happens in the Intestines, and it is small: then it should be bound according to this way.
Et est, ut accipias formicas magnorum capitum.	And it is, that you take big ants' heads.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, et pone formicam unam ex eis quae habeant os apertum super duo labia uulneris.	Then gather two lips of the wound, and place one ant with an open mouth over the two lips of the wound.
Cum ergo capit super ea, et stringit os suum, abscinde caput eius, adhaeret enim, et non soluitur.	So when you hold it above it, and squeeze its mouth, it is cut off, for it adheres and does not release itself.
Deinde pone formicam aliam prope primam, et non cesses facere illud cum formica post formicam secundum quantitatem uulneris totius.	Then place another ant next to the first one, and do not stop doing that with the ant after the second amount of wound of all.
Deinde reduc ipsum, et sue uulnus.	Then reduce the stump, and cut the sinew.
Illa enim capita remanent annexa in Intestino, donec cibetur Intestinum, et sanetur, et non accidat infirmo nocumentum penitus.	Now if any remaining head of the bowel is attached to the intestine, remove it until the intestine is complete and healthy, and do not cause harm to the entire gut.
Et iam possibile est, ut ligetur Intestinum etiam cum filo subtili: quod abstersum est ex intestino animalis, annexo cum eo postquam intromittitur in acum.	And it is also possible that the intestine be tied with a thin thread: which, when removed from the animal, remains attached to it after it enters the bag.
Et est, ut accipias extremitatem huius fili ex intestino, et excarnetur multum.	And it is as if you were to take the end of this thread from the intestine, and cut away much flesh.
Deinde liga in extremitate eius filum lini subtile inuolutum.	Then tie the end of this thread with a thin, wrapped thread.
Deinde intromitte illud filum in acum, et sue cum eo intestinum.	Then insert that thread into the bag, and sewed to it with the intestine.
Deinde reduc ipsum in disruptionem.	Then reduce the stump to dissection.
Et iste modus suturae cum formicis et intestino, non est nisi secundum uiam fiduciae et spei.	And this method of sewing with a needle and thread is not but second to the first in trust and hope.
Scias, uulnus quod est magnum, amplum, praecipue si est in uno intestinorum gracilium: tunc non est ingenium nisi subtiliatio, neque est eius sanatio omnino.	You should know that the sinew is great and wide, especially if it is in one of the small intestines: then it is not a skill but cutting, and its healing is entirely incomplete.
¶ De cura Zuchemen, et Fistularum.	Regarding the care of the scrotum and fistulas.
Caput LXXXVIII.	Head 78.
Scias, quod omne uulnus, aut apostema quando ueterascit et antiquatur, et fit ulcus, et non consolidatur, et emittit pus semper, et non abscinditur: tunc nominatur uniuersaliter in quocunque membro fuerit Fistula, et nos nominamus ipsum Zuchemen.	You should know that every sinew, or when it has grown old and aged, becomes a wound, does not heal, and always discharges pus, and does not close: then it is called a fistula everywhere that it may be, and we call this very thing by the name of Zuchema.
Et Fistula quidem est secundum ueritatem nodatio filtrata, dura, alba: cum qua non est dolor, cui est concauitas pennae auis: et propter illud nominant eam quidam Risati, id est, pennam.	And a fistula is second only to the truth in being filtered, hard, white; it does not cause pain, and has stiff feathers: because of this it is called by some as risatus, that is, feather.
Et est in quibusdam horis humida, quae emittit pus.	And it is sometimes moist in hours when it discharges pus.
Et fortasse scinditur humiditas in quibusdam horis.	And perhaps it splits the moisture at certain times.
Et quandoque est haec humiditas multa, et est pauca: et est grossa, et est subtilis.	And when this moisture is much, and little: and thick, and thin.
Et ego iam praemisi in diuisione, tunc cum dixi uulnera, quod omne ulcus quod non sanatur, neque nascitur in eo caro, non est illud nisi propter unam nouem caussarum.	And I have already pre-empted in the division, then when I said sinews, that every wound which does not heal, and does not grow in it flesh, is not but for one of causes.
Quarum una est, aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore: aut propter maliciam eius: aut quoniam inter ipsum, et super labia eius est caro dura, prohibens natiuitatem carnis: aut quia est multae sordis et sordiciei: aut quoniam ulcus in seipso est putridum, et materia quae mittitur ei est malae qualitatis: aut quoniam medicina est inconueniens in curatione eius: aut quoniam corruptio cadens in regione est genus pestilentiae, aut per proprietatem in regione, sicut accidit in Caesaraugusta: in qua fit difficilis digestio aegritudinum, et tardatur in ea sanatio apostematum per naturam: aut quoniam in eo est os unum, aut numerus ossium.	One of these is due to the scarcity of blood in the body; or because of the malice of his disease; or because between himself and his lips there is hard flesh, which prevents the birth of flesh; or because it is full of noise and filth; or because the wound in his sebo is putrid, and the matter that is shed from it is of a bad quality; or because the remedy is inappropriate for its cure; or because corruption falling upon the region is the kind of pestilence, or by virtue of the region itself, as happened in Caesaraugusta; in which place it becomes difficult to digest the sicknesses, and the healing of ulcers through nature is delayed; or because in him there is only one jaw, or a small number of bones.
Et ego iam ostendi omnes istas caussas et signa earum, et curationes ipsarum cum medicinis in diuisione: et oportet hic ut faciam te scire curationem Fistulae et Zuken, quae fit per uiam operationis cum manu.	And I have already shown you all the causes and signs of them, and the treatments for them with surgeons divided up: and it is necessary here that I should show you the treatment of the fistula and the zuken, which is carried out by means of a surgical operation with the hand.
Scias ergo, quod Fistula accidit in omnibus membris corporis.	So you know that the fistula happens in all parts of the body.
Nam ex eis sunt Fistulae quae perueniunt ad uenas magnas et arterias, aut neruos, aut sifac: aut ad intestinum, aut ad uesicam, aut ad aliquam ex costis: aut ad aliquam ex spondilibus dorsi, aut ad aliquam iuncturarum compositarum compositione: sicut manus, et pedis: et ex eis sunt quae uadunt ad propinquitatem membri principalis, et similium.	For from them are the fistulas which reach the great veins and arteries, or nerves, or intestina, or urethra, or some of the ribs, or some of the vertebral bones, or some of the joints of the body, such as the hands and feet: and from them are those which reach the vicinity of principal members, and similar ones.
Quae ergo ex his Fistulis est secundum hunc modum, est ex aegritudinibus difficilis sanationis, et non recipit curationem, et occupatio cum ea est labor et ignorantia.	Which, however, of these fistulas is according to this mode, is from a difficult sickness which does not receive healing, and is an occupation with it, a labour and ignorance. Quod autem de Fistula scis, quae ex Aegritudinis, est per uiam operationis curanda, et non per injuriam: nam in illis uel in uesica, uel in intestinis, uel in costibus, uel
Quod si est ex Fistulis aliqua cuius profunditas non peruenit ad haec loca quae dixi: et speras, et confidis in curatione eius, et uis peruenire ad cognitionem illius, tunc accipe tentam ex aere, aut ferro, si Fistula tendit secundum rectitudinem, et perquire eam cum ipsa.	That, however, of the fistulas do you know, which come from sicknesses, are to be cured by means of an operation, and not by injury: for in them or in the urethra, or in the intestina, or in the ribs, or in the vertebral bones, or in some of the joints of the body, there is a depth which does not reach these places which I have mentioned; and you hope, and trust in the healing of them, and examine them with your hand: then take a piece of brass or iron, if the fistula tends along the straight line, and investigate it with that.
Si autem in Fistula est tortuositas, tunc inuestiga eam cum tenta de plumbo subtili.	If, however, there is a curvature in the fistula, then investigate it with a thin lead probe.
Quoniam plumbum cum lenitate sui corporis alleuiatur, et curuatur circa tortuositatem.	For lead nhẹly allays the pain of the body, and it eases the curvature around the tortuosity.
Quod si Fistula est habens orificia multa, non est tibi possibile ut significes super eam cum tenta.	That if the fistula has multiple openings, you cannot make a sign over it with a probe.
Clisteriza ergo ex eis orificium ex orificiis suis.	So apply a clister from one of its openings through one of its openings.
Nam humiditas qua clisterizas ipsum, uadit uersus orificia alia, et currit ex eis.	For humidity which the clister applies to it, goes towards other openings, and runs out of them.
Deinde exquisite inquire secundum quem modum est tibi possibile: ut cognoscas quod illic est os, aut neruus, et est Fistulae concauitas longinqua, aut propinqua: aut est Fistula una cui sunt orificia multa, et sta super totum illud, cum summa fortitudinis tuae: cum interrogatione tua, qua interrogas infirmum, et inuentione doloris apud compressionem cum manu tua super locum, et similibus ex significationibus et caussis accidentibus apostemati.	Then inquire, according to how you are able to: that you may learn that there is an opening, or a nerve, and it is a fistula distant or near: or is a fistula with many openings, and it lies over all of it, with your greatest power: when you ask the question, which asks about the sick, and find out the pain by pressing with your hand to the spot, and similar signs and causes of symptoms apart from the explanation.
Cum ergo steteris super omnia illa statione uera, tunc uade ad curationem secundum confidentiam: et est, ut consideres tunc, si est Fistula propinqua apparens, aut in loco saluo longinquo a iunctura, aut a neruo, aut arteria, aut uena, aut uno locorum quae dixi tibi: tunc seca Fistulam secundum quod praemissum est ex narratione mea, et aufer quod est in ea ex filtratione, et carnibus corruptis, quod nascitur in orificio eius ex carne, aut thelul, et similibus: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	When you have thus stood over all of them with a true station, then proceed to the cure according to confidence: and is, when you consider then, if it is a fistula near appearing, or in a safe place far from an opening, or from a nerve, or artery, or vein, or one of the places which I have told you: then stop up the fistula according to what has been said above, and remove what is in it from filtration, and rotten flesh, which comes out of its opening from the flesh, or the fat, and similar things: and cure it, until it heals.
Si autem Fistula est longinquae profunditatis, et est secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut seces eam in profundo quantum est tibi possibile.	If, however, the fistula is in a deep distance, and is in a straight line: then it is necessary that you should separate it in depth as far as you are able to do.
Deinde mundifica ipsam ex omnibus carnibus eius corruptis.	Then cleanse it completely from all of its corrupted flesh.
Deinde administra licinia inuoluta in medicinis acutis: et intromitte ea usque ad concauitatem Fistulae quam comprehendisti cum ferro: fac cum ea illud aliquotiens, donec corrodat medicina acuta totum quod remansit in concauitate Fistulae ex corruptione.	Then administer a solution of the iodic in acute medicines: and introduce it into the fistula as much as you can comprehend with iron: and do so sometimes, until the corrosive medicine has eaten away all that is left in the fistula's concavity from corruption.
Deinde restaura ipsam cum unguentis quae generant carnem sanam, donec sanetur.	Then restore it with ointments that generate healthy flesh, until it is healed.
Si uero non sanatur per illud, tunc cauteriza ipsam secundum quod narrauimus.	But if it does not heal by means of that, then cauterize it according to what we have said.
Si ergo caussa Fistulae est os, et certificatur apud te illud: tunc inquire ipsum, et seca ipsum secundum quod narraui tibi: si non prohibet te aliquid ex uena, aut neruo, aut membro principali, sicut diximus.	But if the cause is a fistula and it has been certified by you: then examine that person and dry that person up according to what we told you: if it does not restrain you from anything of new growth, or nerve, or main member, as we have said.
Si ergo detegitur tibi os, et est in eo quiddam corruptionis, et nigredinis: tunc rade ipsum, donec auferatur corruptio eius tota.	But if a tooth has been detected in it and there is some corruption and blackening: then shave that tooth, until the whole corruption is removed.
Deinde cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then care for that person with the ointment that incarnates the flesh, until it is healed.
Quod si non sanatur, et emittat pus sicut faciebat: tunc scias, quod tu non peruenisti ad totam eradicationem corruptionis.	That if it does not heal and discharges pus as it did before: then you should know that you have not achieved the total eradication of the corruption.
Detege ergo super illud secundo, et exquisite fac rasionem eius, et mundificationem ipsius cum ultima fortitudine tua.	So examine it again and carefully feel the area, and thoroughly clean it with your last strength.
Deinde restaura ipsum.	Then restore that person.
Si ergo sanatur, bonum est: et si non, tunc scias quod illa corruptio est in profunditate longinqua corporis, quam non es consecutus.	But if it is healed, then it is good: and if not, then you should know that that corruption is deep in the distance of the body, which you have not succeeded in reaching.
Non est ergo tibi in ea ingenium, nisi dimittere ipsam naturae.	It is therefore not within your control to heal it, unless you let nature take its course.
Quod si corruptum est os paruum, et est possibile tibi, attrahe ipsum cum forficibus subtilibus quae conueniunt ad illud.	But if the corruption is in a small tooth and it is possible for you, attract that tooth with slender instruments which suit that purpose.
Si autem sunt ossa multa, tunc exquisite fac attractionem eorum omnium, neque dimittas ex eis aliquid cum tua fortitudine.	But if there are many bones, then carefully feel all of them, and do not let anything go with your strength.
Si uero contrarietatem facit tibi aliquid ex humiditatibus, et non est in incisione eorum timor, uel error: tunc incide illas humiditates et carnes, si sunt illic, et libera ossa.	But if it causes you any opposite sensation from moisture, and there is no fear or mistake in cutting them: then cut the moisture and flesh, if they are there, and free the bones.
Si uero non est tibi praeparatio auferendi ossa ex hora tua, tunc pone super uulnus quod putrefaciat ipsum: et dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat quod est in circumitu illorum ossium ex carnibus et humiditatibus.	But if you do not have the preparation to remove the bones at your own time, then place over the joint what will decay that person: and let it go, until it decays what is around those bones from flesh and moisture.
Et custodi uulnus ut non consolidetur.	And guard the limb so that it does not heal badly.
Et constringatur sectio quam tu secuisti in operatione tua.	And tighten the wound as you sewed in your operation.
Imo pone super ipsum, si times, cotum submersum sulfure trito cum oleo: aut cotum submersum in unguento aegyptio, aut aliquo unguentorum uiridium.	By placing a bit of lime on top of the wound, if necessary, rub it with sulfur after having dipped it in oil; or dip it in Egyptian ointment, or some other kind of ointment.
Nam quando putrefient illae scilicet humiditates, et separantur ex eis ossa, alleuiatur ablatio eorum, et ipsorum attractio.	For when those certain humors putrefy and the bones separate from them, their removal relieves them and attracts them away.
Si autem est os unum magnum, sicut os cruris, aut os coxae, et similia illis, et quod ex eo corruptum est, est pars magna: tunc rade ipsum rasione ultima, donec auferatur illa nigredo et corruptio.	If, however, there is one large bone, such as the leg or hip, and it is rotten, then cut off that part with a saw until the blackness and corruption is removed.
Deinde restaura uulnus.	Then restore the limb.
Si uero quod est in eo corruptum, est pars magna, et corruptio iam consecuta est medullam ossis, tunc necesse est serrare ipsum, et incidere ipsum totum usque ad locum, ubi peruenit corruptio: tunc cura ipsum, donec consolidetur.	If, however, what is rotten in it is a large part and the corruption has already reached the marrow of the bone, then it is necessary to cut off the limb, and to cut into it all the way until the place where the corruption lies: then care for the wound, until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi zuken, quae accidit uiro in crure suo: ut ponas ipsam exemplum et adiutorium super operationem tuam.	And I will tell you about the injury that happened to the man in his leg as an example and a help for your operation.
Fuit uir iuuenis aetate circiter triginta annos, cui accidit dolor in crure suo, a caussa quae mota est super ipsum intra corpus, id est, ab interioribus, donec peruenerunt materiae ad crus, et apostematum est apostemate magno: et non fuit ei caussa extrinseca.	He was a young man of about thirty years of age, to whom pain came in his leg from within the body, that is, from the insides, until it reached the bone, and there was an ulcer, large and open, and he had no external cause.
Extensum est ergo cum eo tempus cum errore medicorum, donec apertum est apostema, et concurrerunt cum eo materiae multae.	So the time went by with him in the error of doctors until the ulcer was opened wide and many substances gathered there.
Et postposita est curatio eius, donec fistulatum est crus, et facta sunt in eo orificia multa: quae omnia emittebant pus, et humiditates corporis.	And his treatment was delayed until the leg was closed up and many holes were made in it: all of which discharged pus and the humors of the body.
Curauit ergo ipsum multitudo medicorum circiter duos annos, et non fuit in eo sapiens in arte manus, donec uocatus sum, et uidi crus eius, et materias quae currebant ex illis orificiis cursu magno: etiam omne uiri corpus iam tabuerat, et color eius citrinus erat.	He was then treated for two years by a multitude of doctors, and there was no wise man in the art of hands, until I was called upon to see his leg, and saw that the matter that was flowing out of its orifices went away with a great course: also all his body was very weak, and his color had become cerulean.
Intromisi ergo tentam in uno locorum orificiorum, et peruenit tenta ad os.	Therefore he inserted his hand into one of the orifices and his hand reached the mouth.
Deinde perscrutatus sum orificia omnia: et inueni ea peruenire ad se inuicem ex omnibus partibus cruris.	Then I examined all the openings: and I found that they came to an end within him in one joint of his leg.
Properaui ergo, et secui super unum illorum orificiorum, donec detexi partem ossis: et inueni ipsum corruptum: quod iam corrosum erat, et denigratum, et putruerat, et perforatum erat, donec penetrauerat usque ad medullam.	Then I bent on and cut through one of those openings until I reached a bone part: and I found it decayed: which was already decayed, and rotten, and putrid, and pierced all the way through to the marrow.
Serraui ergo quod detectum est mihi, et praeparatum ex osse corrupto.	I sharpened the end of what I had found, and made it smooth from the corrupt bone.
Et deputaui, quod non esset in osse nisi illa corruptio, quam abscidi, et serraui.	And I left behind that which was not bone, but only decay; and I sharpened and made smooth what remained.
Et ego iam eradicaueram eam.	And I had now cut away all of it.
Deinde posui restaurationem uulneris cum medicinis consolidatiuis spacio longo.	Then I set the wound with medicine made from a long-dried poultice.
Et non est consolidatum.	And this was not made firm.
Deinde tentaui, et detexi super os secundo supra detectionem primam: et inueni corruptionem continuam cum osse: et serraui quod apparuit mihi etiam ex illa corruptione.	Then I tried again, and found a second bone above the first detection: and I found that corruption continued to the bone; and I sharpened what seemed to me also from that corruption.
Deinde conatus sum restaurationem eius.	Then I tried to set the wound.
Et non est restauratum.	And this was not set.
Detexi ergo super ipsum iterum, et non cessaui incidere os particulatim, et conari restaurationem eius: et non est restauratum, donec incidi ex osse circiter palmum unum, et extraxi illud cum medulla sua.	Then I tried again to detect it, and did not cease striking the bone in pieces, and trying to set its wound; and it was not set, until I struck out of the bone a little palm-sized piece, and pulled it out with its marrow.
Deinde restauraui ipsum cum medicinis, et consolidatum est uelociter, et sanatum: et non fuit necessaria haec iteratio in operatione eius, et sectione ipsius, nisi propter dispositionem debilitatis infirmi, et paucitatem tolerantiae eius, et timorem meum super ipsum de morte: quoniam accidebat ei in omnibus horis ex superfluitate euacuationis syncopis mala.	Then I set that wound with medicine, and it was soon healed; and this repetition of the operation and sawing through it was not necessary, unless for the weakness of the nurse, and her lack of tolerance, and her fear of me over him: for it happened to him in all hours from bad discharge of pus.
Sanatus est ergo sanatione integra: et nata est in loco ossis caro dura, et bona facta est dispositio in corpore suo, et rediit uirtus eius: et conuersatus est in dispositionibus suis: et non fecit ei contrarietatem in ambulatione nocumentum omnino.	He was then healed by sound health: and there grew up a new bone in place of the old one, and his disposition in his body was good, and he regained his strength: and he did not do him any harm in walking at all.
Si autem os eminens in loco corporis iam fractum est: tunc oportet ut serres ipsum, secundum hunc modum: et est: ut accipias ligamentum, et stringe ipsum in extremitate ossis eminentis: et praecipe alicui, qui extendat ipsum ad sursum: et pone ligamentum aliud ex lana grossius ligamento primo.	If however the jaw is prominent in the place of the body already broken: then it is necessary that you hold him thus: and he is: that you take the ligament, and tighten him at the end of the prominent bone: and order someone who extends him upwards: and put another ligament from wool on the first one.
Deinde liga ipsum super carne, quae est suh osse: et extende extremitatem eius, ut trahas carnem ad inferiora: et tu detegis carnem super locum quem uis serrare, ut non laedat Serra carnem.	Then bind the bone on top of the meat, which is below the bone: and extend its end so that you pull the flesh downward: and you cover the flesh over the place where you want to cut it, so as not to hurt the saw when cutting the flesh.
Pone lignum, aut tabulam sub osse inferius decenter: quoniam quando facis illud, non prohibetur quin secet carnem corruptam.	Place the board below the bone slightly: for when you do this, it does not prevent you from cutting the corrupted flesh.
Et oportet ut sit Serratura super locum corruptum parumper, ut non sit in concauitate ossis corruptio: et non appareat in apparitione sua sensui, et cogat ad Serraturam sui uice alia.	And it is necessary that it be a little higher than the corrupted place, so as not to appear on the appearance of its own sense, and forcing the force of its own device: and another screw should appear in its appearance.
Quod si os est corruptum, et non est eminens, imo continuatur pars eius cum parte: et corruptio est in medio eius, aut in parte ipsius: tunc detege carnem ab omnibus partibus totam.	That if the bone is corrupted and not prominent, a part of it continues with another part: and the corruption is in the middle of it, or in one of its parts: then you cover all the meat with all its parts.
Deinde pone lignum inferius.	Then place the board below.
Postea serra illud ex parte prima, ubi est corruptio, donec continuetur Serratura ex parte altera: et sit Serratura secundum longitudinem a corruptione parumper, secundum quod diximus.	Then cut that from the first part where there is corruption, until it continues with another part of the screw: and let the screw be of about the same length as the corruption, according to what we have said.
Quod si corruptio est in iunctura, incide ipsam iuncturam corruptam, et serra os ubi continuatur ex parte altera.	That if the corruption is in the joint, cut that joint that is corrupted, and then cut the bone where it continues from another part:
Si uero corruptio est in continuatione duarum iuncturarum, tunc non est in ea ingenium nisi abrasio.	But if the corruption is in the continuation of two joints, then there is no other connection but an abrasion.
Quod si corruptio est in pectine manus, aut in pectine pedis: tunc res in eo est difficilis ualde.	That if the corruption is in the knuckle of the hand, or in the knuckle of the foot: then the matter is difficult to manage greatly.
Verum oportet, ut inquiras corruptionem qualiter appareat tibi.	But you should ask how the corruption appears to you.
Et abradas eam, et mundes ipsam secundum quamcunque dispositionem tibi possibile est, et cum quocunque ingenio rectificatur tibi: quando non facit tibi contrarietatem Vena, aut Neruus.	And scrape it off, and clean it up according to how it appears to you in any way that is possible for you, and with whatever skill you can master: when it does not make you a contrary vein or nerve.
Et scias quod incisoria, et Serrae ad incidendum ista ossa sunt multa, secundum situm ossium, et praparationem eorum, et ipsorum grossitudinem, et subtilitatem eorum, et magnitudinem, et paruitatem ipsorum, et duriciem ipsorum, et eorum raritatem.	And know that incisions and saws are many for incision of these bones according to the position of the bones, and their preparation, and their thickness and fineness, and their size, and their smoothness, and their hardness, and their rarity.
Quapropter oportet, ut praepares omni speciei operationis instrumentum conueniens ad illam operationem.	Therefore it is necessary that you prepare the tool suitable for this operation for all kinds of operations.
Et scias, quod operationes istae significant tibi super speciem instrumenti quo indiges, quando tecum est studium longum.	And know that these operations require a lot of time when studying the instrument you hold in your hand.
Et cognitio modorum huius artis, testimonium modorum aegritudinum: tunc enim iam inuenies per teipsum illud quod conuenit ei ex instrumentis ad omnem infirmitatem.	And knowledge of the methods of this art is a witness to the methods of diseases: for then you will discover through yourself that which suits him from instruments for every disease.
Et ego sum firmans tibi in ultimo huius capituli numerum instrumentorum, quae pones exempla super quae incides, et probationem qua experiaris super alia.	And I am confirming to you at the end of this chapter the number of instruments that you set out as examples on which you cut, and a proof of what you experienced on others.
Forma Serrae.	Form of the saw.
Forma alterius Serrae.	Form of another saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Form of an alternate saw.
Forma Serrae alterius.	Form of an alternate saw.
Haec forma Serrae depicta, sit decenter facta.	This form of the saw is drawn, but not made to perfection.
Fiat arcus eius superior, acuitas eius ex ferro: et manubrium eius ex buxo, et sit pyramidale decenter factum.	Let its bow be higher and its sharpness from iron: and its handle from beech, and let its pyramid be made decentered.
Forma Rasorii iuncturarum.	Form of the rasors joined together.
Sit caput huius Rasorii, secundum formam capitis claui stellati: et puncta eius sint secundum formam punctorum elischetfegi.	Let the head of this razor be shaped like a star's claw: and its points be shaped like the points of an elk-fang.
Et non conuenit, nisi ut fricentur cum eo capita iuncturarum, quando corrumpuntur, aut os amplum, et magnum est.	And it does not suit you unless you join with it the heads of the razors when they corrode, or a wide and large mouth; and it is wide and great.
Forma maioris Rasorii.	Form of the larger razor.
Forma medii Rasorii.	Form of the medium razor.
Forma Rasorii lati.	Form of the wide razor.
Forma Rasorii in quo est concauitas.	Form of the razor with a concave shape.
Forma Rasorii alterius subtilis.	Form of an alternate thin razor.
Forma Rasorii alterius curuatae extremitatis.	Form of an alternate curved-end razor.
Forma Rasorii parui, subtilis tentae.	Form of the small, thin razor for the tip of the finger.
Forma Rasorii cum quo inciduntur ossa.	Form of the razor used to cut bones.
Forma etiam Rasorii magni.	Form also of the large razor.
Hoc similatur Radio, et extremitas est sicut Serra: exhibetur in locis multis ex rasione ossium.	This is like a radio, and the ends are like a saw: it is shown in many places from the reason of the bones.
Forma Rasorii quod conuenit ad rasionem eius quod perforatum est ex ossibus.	The shape of a saw which agrees with its sawing that which is pierced out from the bones.
Extremitas eius triangula, acutarum est extremitatum.	Its ends are triangular, its corners are acute.
Fit ex Indi.	It fits from India.
Et similiter oportet, ut fiant omnia quae diximus ex Rasoriis, et Incisoriis, et Serris.	And likewise it is necessary that all which we have said of the saw should be of the chisel and of the saw.
¶ De incisione extremitatum, et Serratura ossium.	About the incising of the ends and the locking of the bones.
Caput LXXXIX.	Chapter LXXXIX.
Putrefiunt extremitates, aut ex caussa extrinseca, aut intrinseca.	The ends putrefy, or for an extrinsic cause, or an intrinsic one.
Cum ergo medicatus fueris illam corruptionem curatione medicinarum, et non confert curatio: et uides corruptionem incidere in membrum, quam non repercutit aliquid: tunc oportet ut incidas illud membrum usque ubi consequitu corruptio, ut euadat infirmus per illud a morte, aut a malicia quae est maior defectu membri.	When therefore you have been wounded by that corruption with the cure of medicines, and it does not confer the cure: and you see that corruption extending to the member, where there is no consequence of corruption; then it is necessary that you should extend the cut to the place where the consequence of corruption follows, in order that the sick may be healed from that death, or from that greater malice which is the defect of the member.
Et signum cui accidit illud est, quod denigratur membrum, donec putetur: quod ignis combussit ipsum, aut putrefit post nigredinem: donec inciditur illa putredo usque ad illud quod sequitur illud membrum, et serpit in totum corpus.	And the sign to which that happens is that the member is disfigured, until it is healed: that it is burned by fire, or putrefied after being red: until it is extended to that corruption which follows that member, and creeps into all the body.
Propera ergo cum incisione eius, et similiter si caussa corruptionis est a percussione quorundam uenenosorum: sicut scorpionis marini, et uiperae, et rutellae, et similium.	Therefore approach with its incising, and likewise if the cause of corruption is from some venoms that are pierced: like the scorpion marine, and the bee, and the nettle, and others similar to them.
Si ergo corruptio, aut percussio est in extremitate digiti, tunc incide digitum, et non des spacium corruptioni, ut incedat usque ad reliquam manum.	If therefore the corruption, or the piercing is in the end of a finger, then cut the finger, and do not leave space for the corruption to run, so that it may run up to the remaining hand.
Et similiter si accidit in manu, tunc incide eam ex radice focilis, et non des spacium corruptioni, donec capiat in focili brachii.	And likewise if that happens in a hand, then cut it from the root of a sharp tool, and do not leave space for the corruption to run, until it takes up into the arm of the sharp tool.
Et si inuadit in eo, tunc incide brachium apud cubitum in iunctura sua.	And if it has grown into that, then cut the arm at the elbow joint.
Si autem pertransit corruptio, et uides eum circiter cubitum: tunc in illo est mors infirmi.	If however corruption has passed over and you see that he is surrounded by pus: then in him is death the nurse.
Et administrare praeter illud ex curatione, est quantitas uirtus.	And besides that cure, it is a matter of amount of virtue.
Et similiter fac de pede, quando inuadit corruptio in digito, tunc incide ipsum apud unum nodorum: et si capit in pectine pedis, tunc incide pedem totum.	And also do the same with the foot, when corruption appears in the nail, then cut it right at one knuckle: and if it goes into the sole of the foot, then cut the whole foot.
Si autem ascendit ad genu, tunc incide crus apud iuncturam genu.	But if it ascends to the knee, then cut the leg at the joint of the knee.
Quod si corruptio iam peruenit supra genu, tunc non est in ea ingenium, nisi dimissio, et relinquere infirmum morti.	That which if corruption has already reached above the knee, then there is no hope in it but to cut off, and leave it to death.
Et modus incidendi membrum, aut serrandi ipsum est, ut stringas ligamentum in inferiori, quem uis incidere: et stringe ligamentum aliud supra locum.	And the mode of cutting a limb, or of stretching it out is, that you may tighten the ligament below, which you wish to cut: and tighten another ligament above the place.
Et extendat minister ligamentum unum ad inferiora: et extendat minister aliud ligamentum superius ad sursum.	And stretch one minister of the ligament downward: and stretch another minister of the ligament upward upwards.
Et tu separa carnem quae est inter duo ligamenta, cum Spatumili lato, donec detegatur caro tota.	And you shall separate the flesh that is between the two ligaments, with the spatus or chisel, until all the flesh is exposed.
Deinde incidatur, aut serretur.	Then cut it, or stretch it out.
Et oportet, ut ponas ab omnibus partibus pannum lini, et non tangat Serra locum sanum: et accidat infirmo laesio addita, et apostema calidum.	And you should place a sheet of linen cloth so that it does not touch the sound part, and cut off the wound with an edge, adding a hot poultice: and apply to the sick a poultice of cold.
Si autem accidat fluxus sanguinis interius dum operaris, tunc cauteriza locum uelociter: aut pone super ipsum quosdam pulueres abscindentes sanguinem.	But if while you are working blood flows inwards, then cauterize the place quickly: or put on it some powder that stops the blood.
Deinde redi ad medicationem tuam, donec compleatur.	Then go back to your own medication, until it is complete.
Deinde liga membrum uulneratum cum ligamento conueniente ei, et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then bind the wounded limb with a proper ligament, and take care of it, until it heals.
Et ego narro tibi quod accidit uiro in pede suo, hoc idem accidens quod narro tibi.	And I will tell you what happened to the man in his foot, this same thing that I am telling you.
Quod est, quia accidit in pede suo nigredo, cum adustione quae assimilatur combustioni ignis: et corruptio illa in primis accidit in digito suo, donec coepit pedem totum.	That is, because it happened to the man's foot, that was burned by the same fire that makes ash; and that corruption first began in his toe, until it came to his whole foot.
Properauit ergo uir ex seipso, postquam uidit corruptionem incidere in membro cum uehementia eius, quod inuenit ex dolore, et adustione eius: et incidit ipsum apud iuncturam, et sanatus est.	So he cut away the cord from itself, when he saw the corruption touching a member with a great swelling, which was caused by pain and burning; and he cut it himself at the joint, and he recovered.
Et postquam praeteriit ei tempus longum, accidit ei illa eadem corruptio in digito manus suae indice.	And after he had passed a long time, that same corruption happened to him again in the little finger of his right hand.
Venit ergo ad me, et conatus sum recuperare illam superfluitatem cum eo quod posui super manum ex medicinis post mundificationem corporis eius: et non repercussa est superfluitas, et coepit incedere in digitum alium: donec coepit coruptio in manum.	Then he came to me, and I tried to restore that superfluity with him as soon as I put on the hand with the medicines after purifying his body; and the superfluity did not recur, but it began to heal in another finger: until the corruption began to spread in the hand.
Vocauit ergo me, ad incidendum manum eius: et nolui illud, sperans ex me super repercussionem illius superfluitatis: et timui etiam super ipsum apud incisionem manus eius mortem.	So he called me to cut his hand; and I did not want to do so, hoping that the same superfluity would recur on him: and I was also afraid of death when cutting the hand itself.
Quoniam uirtus uiri erat super casum.	For the strength of the man was above death.
Postquam ergo desperauit de me, reuersus est ad terram suam: et peruenit ad me de eo, quia properauit, et incidit manum suam totam: et sanatus est.	Then he turned away from me and returned to his land; and he came back to me about it, for he was eager, and he cut off all of his hand; and he recovered.
Et non attuli hanc narrationem, nisi ut sit adiutorium super illud quod cadit de genere huius aegritudinis: et ut sit significatio qua significetur, et secundum quam agatur.	And I did not bring this account until it should be an aid to those who suffer from such a disease: and that it may be understood what is meant, and according to how it is applied.
¶ De cura Sinuum, et qualitate clisterizationis cum medicinis.	On the Treatment of Syphilis and the Quality of Clustering with Medications
Caput XC.	Head 80
Quando accidit apostema in quibusdam membris carnosis, et prolongatur spacium apostematis, donec collectionem facit saniei: deinde rumpitur, aut perforatur, et egreditur quod in eo est ex sanie, et remanet locus uacuus quasi sit uas: et cutis quae est super ipsum sicut pannus qui iam subtiliatus est: et non peruenit ad ultimum in corruptione sua, neque imprimit in os, neque in neruum, neque in ligamentum: meretur ut nominetur Sinus: et non nominatur Fistula: uerumtamen si prolongatur spacium eius, donec imprimat corruptio in aliquid horum membrorum, tunc nominatur Fistula, aut zuken.	When it happens that an apostema occurs in some flesh member, and the space of the apostema is prolonged, until it makes a collection of blood; then it breaks, or pierces, and that which is in it is discharged out, leaving behind a hollow place like a well: and the skin that is on top of it is as thin cloth: and does not impring on the last in its corruption, nor prints on the mouth, nor the ligaments: it deserves to be called Sinus: but it is not called Fistula: nevertheless, if it prolongs the space thereof, until it prints the corruption on some of these members, then it is called Fistula, or a fistula.
Et cura eius est, ut incidas illam cutem totam sicut reuoluitur: et praecipue quando subtiliata est, et facta sicut pannus: et confidis quia non aaehaeret cum loco, propter corruptionem suam.	And the cure is that you should strike off his skin as it has grown back; and above all when it has become thin, and like a piece of cloth; and trust that it will not adhere to the place because of its decay.
Si autem speras quod adhaereat cutis, et non consequitur ex eo corruptio illa ultima consecutione: et si in cute est spissitudo ex carne, tunc cura ipsum cum Clisteri: et est, ut consideres ad Sinum.	If, however, you hope that the skin will adhere, and does not bring about that last corruption: and if there is a thickness of flesh there, then cure him with clister: and it is, as you consider, towards the navel.
Tunc si est magnus, et pus quod emittitur ex eo est foetidi odoris: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum medicamine aegyptio, quod est aceti, et olei, et ziniar, partes recipiens aequales, aggregentur in uase: et decoquantur super ignem, donec rubeat medicamen: et ueniat in spissitudinem mellis.	Then if it is large, and the pus that is discharged from it has a foul odor: then clisterize him with the Egyptian medicine, which is vinegar, and oil, and myrrh, taking equal parts, mixed together in an ointment: and let it boil over fire until it turns red: and let it come to the consistency of honey.
Deinde accipe ex eo quod tibi necesse est: et dissolue ipsum cum aqua et melle, et clisteriza cum eo Sinum: et stringe orificium eius, et dimitte medicinam in eo ad quantitatem duarum horarum.	Then take from it what you need: and dissolve it with water and honey, and clisterize it with that navel: and tighten the opening, and let the medicine enter into it for two hours.
Deinde extrahe ipsum cum expressione: fac illud diebus tot, donec mundificetur Sinus, et remoueatur foetor.	Then extract him with the expression: make him spend days until the navel is cleaned up, and the foul smell is gone away.
Et quandoque clisterizatur cum aqua cineris, quando non est tibi praesens hoc medicamen: et est, ut accipias cinerem lignorum uitis, aut cinerem ex lignis ilicis: et proiicias super eam aquam.	And when you clisterize him with water of ash, when this medicine is not present with you: and it is, that you take the ashes of willow wood, or the ashes of holly tree: and pour them on top of it.
Deinde cola eam, et clisteriza cum ea, donec confidas quod Sinus iam ablutus est.	Then dip it in, and clisterize it with that, until you trust that the navel is already cleaned up.
Quod si infirmo non est tolerantia super medicamen aegyptium, neque aquam cineris, tunc clisteriza ipsum cum aqua et melle, cui iam permixtum est aliquid ex ziniar contrito.	That if the sick person does not tolerate the Egyptian medicine, and water of ash, then clisterize him with water and honey, in which has already been mixed some crushed myrrh.
Aut clisteriza ipsum cum melle et uino permixtis, quoniam de proprietate mellis est, ut mundificet, et abluat: et uinum facit adhaerere Sinum, praecipue quando in uino est superfluitas stipticitatis et siccitatis.	Or clisterize him with honey and wine mixed, since of the property of honey is to clean and wash away, and wine makes the navel adhere, especially when there is an abundance of astringency and dryness.
Cum facis illud aliquotiens, et confidis quod Sinus corruptio iam remota est: tunc clisteriza ipsum cum eo quod facit nasci carnem in eo.	When you do this sometimes and trust that the corruption of the sinus is now far away: then cleanse him with what he does to give birth to flesh in him.
Et est, ut accipias ex emplastro dyafinicon: et dissoluas ipsum cum oleo rosato, et uino stiptico: aut clisteriza ipsum cum quibusdam medicinis, et unguentis aliis, quorum proprietates scripsi in tractatu unguentorum.	And is, that you receive from the plaster dyafinicon: and dissolve him with oil of rose, and wine stimulative: or cleanse him with some medicines, and other ointments, whose properties I wrote in the treatise of ointments.
Quod si orificium Sinus est strictum, in quo non capit cannula clisteris: tunc amplifica ipsum cum ferro parumper: aut pone in ipso licinium inuolutum in unguento aegyptio, aut in unguento basilicon, donec amplificetur.	That if the orifice of the sinus is strict, in which the cannula of the clister does not enter: then enlarge it with iron a little: or put in it licorium infused in Egyptian ointment, or in basilicon ointment, until it is enlarged.
Et similiter si est orificium etiam amplum, tunc aggrega labia eius cum sutura: et dimitte ex eo quantitatem in quam ingrediatur clistere sine additione.	And similarly if the orifice is also wide, then gather his lips with a suture: and let go from it a quantity in which the clister is to be added without addition.
Et similiter si orificium eius ex quo currit pus, est eleuatum ad superiora: tunc seca ipsum in depressiori loco qui est in ipso, ut currat ex eo pus usque inferius: quoniam pus quando coartatur in profunditate Sinus, prohibet carnem generari in eo.	And similarly if the orifice of him from which runs pus is raised upwards: then dry him up in a lower place that is in him, so that the pus runs down from it: for when pus is stopped up in the depth of the sinus, it prevents flesh from being born in it.
Quod si non est tibi possibile secare Sinum circiter inferius eius secundum quod uis: tunc conare, ut praepares membrum praeparatione qua currat ex eo pus cum facilitate secundum quod praeparatur tibi.	That if you are not able to dry the sinus all around below it according to what you want: then try, that you prepare the member with a preparation which runs from it with ease according to how you prepare it for yourself.
Conare, ut non retineatur in eo aliquid ex pus omnino: et accipe medicinas consolidatiuas quae ponuntur super signum, conuenientes ad illud quod uis.	Try, that you do not retain anything of the pus at all in it: and receive medicines consolidatives which are put on a mark, suited to what you want.
Et extende eas super pannum lini.	And extend them over a linen cloth.
Et sit pannus tantae quantitatis, qua fiat communicatio totius Sinus.	And let there be such a quantity of the cloth that it may come into communication with all of the sinus.
Deinde incide cum forficibus in directo orificii Sinus foramen, amplius orificio Sinus parumper.	Then cut with forceps in the direct orifice of the sinus hole, a little larger opening of the sinus.
Deinde extende ex unguentis lenibus super pannum alium, secundum quantitatem foraminis: et pone eum super ipsum positione longinqua ab orificio Sinus, ut alleuietur exitus pus ex eo: et non auferas pannum magnum, nisi post dies aliquos uice una.	Then extend from the ointment soft things over another cloth according to the quantity of the hole: and put it on him at a distance from the orifice of the sinus, that the exit of the pus from it may be eased: and do not remove the large cloth, until after some days a drop.
Ille autem qui est super orificium Sinus, est ille quem remoues in omni hora, ut egrediatur quod aggregatur in eo ex pus: et ut scias, an illud quod currit ex eo uirus, est multum, aut parum: aut digestum, aut indigestum.	That which is above the opening of the sinus, that one who is moved at all times, so that he goes out when it is gathered in him from pus; and know that, that which runs out of it virus, is much or little: or digested or undigested.
Et cum hoc iterum considera locum Sinus ipsius, an in ipso sentiat dominus eius dolorem, aut non sit in eo dolor, et an sit in eo apostema, aut non sit in eo apostema.	And when you consider this place again of the sinus itself, does the lord feel pain in it, or is there no pain in it? And does he feel a puss in it, or not?
Cum ergo protenditur medicatio tua taliter, et uides materiam quae egreditur super orificium Sinus, tunc scias, quod Sinus iam adhaeret, aut approximat adhaerentiae: tunc ergo solue ipsum in mane, aut in tertio die: et quando soluis uulnus, tunc permuta pannum alium, et renoua unguentum.	But when your treatment extends thus far, and you see the matter which comes out above the opening of the sinus, then know that the sinus is already attached, or approximates to attachment: so then loosen it in the morning, or on the third day: and when you loosen the wound, then change the cloth, and renew the ointment.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post spacium longum uirus subtile, tunc non desperes de adhaerentia eius, nam sanatio eius appropinquat, quoniam ex hominibus sunt qui tardant generationem carnis in uulneribus suis, et ex eis sunt qui agunt econtrario illius.	But if a virus comes out of the sinus after a long space, then do not despair of its attachment, for the healing of it approaches, since there are those who delay the generation of flesh in their wounds, and those who act in the opposite way.
Si autem egreditur ex Sinu post dies multos pus indigestum, tunc scias quod sinus non adhaeret.	But if a pus comes out of the sinus after many days, then know that the sinus does not attach.
Si ergo tardatur adhaerentia Sinus, et prolongatur res eius: tunc adde in exiccatione medicinarum, uerum faciant medici, ut sint medicinae in substantia sua humidae, et in uirtute sua siccae: sicut unguentum dyafinicon, quando additur in eo superfluitas additionis ex zegi.	But if the attachment of the sinus is prolonged, and its duration is prolonged: then add to the drying of medicines, that the doctors may make them, so that they are in their substance wet, and in their virtue dry: as the unguent of dafinicon, when it is added thereto an excess of addition by the zegi.
Et ex magis ultimo quo curatur, est, ut accipias unguentum dyafinicon, et soluatur cum oleo rosato, et roretur super ipsum uinum antiquum aequale in substantia sua.	And from the greatest of these, when it is cured, that you take the unguent of dafinicon, and dissolve it with olive oil, and rub it on the old wound to the equal substance of its substance.
Deinde confice ipsum cum eo, et utere ipso.	Then confirm the wound with it, and use it.
Et iam facit simile huic actioni, quando non est tibi praesens unguentum dyafinicon, mel, quando decoquis ipsum, donec ingrossetur, et uteris eo.	And this same action of this is done when the unguent of dafinicon is not present with you, honey, when it is heated up, and you use it.
Aut accipe myrrham, et aloen, et olibanum: tere totum, et pulueriza illud super mel dum est super ignem.	Take myrrh and aloes and olibanum; prepare a whole mass, and sprinkle it on honey while it is still hot above fire.
Deinde line super ipsum pannum, et stringe ipsum super Sinum: et line cum melle quod decoquisti, donec ingrossatum est: et pulueriza super ipsum species, et pone super ipsum pannum, et stringe eum.	Then spread the paste over the poultice and tie it over the wound: and add to it the honey with which you have been mixing, until it has thickened: then sprinkle the powder on the poultice and put it on again, and tie it up.
Et quandoque administratur in illo aristolochia longa, et radices lilii coelestis, et est lilium: et farina herbi, et centaurea.	And sometimes add to it long aristolochia, and the roots of the star-lily, and there is a lily; and herb powder, and centaurea.
Utere eis simplicibus, aut aggregatis, tere ea, et cribella ipsa: et pulueriza super mel quod narraui, et utere eo.	Use them simple, or in a mixture, prepare it thoroughly, and screen the paste: and sprinkle on the honey that you have mixed: and use it.
Quod si prolongatur res Sinus, et non sanatur hac curatione: tunc scias, quod in profundo eius est corruptio: aut iam facit impressionem in ossibus, aut in reliquis membris duris, aut ligamentis: tunc cura ipsum curatione Fistularum, secundum quod praemissum est.	If the infection persists with this treatment and does not heal: then you will know that there is corruption in its depths; or it has already made an impression on the bones, or on the other hard members, or on the ligaments: then treat it with fistula treatment, as has been said.
¶ De cura Panaritii et unguis attritae, et incisione digiti additi, et sectione.	As for the cure of the finger called panaris and the scraped nail, and the incision of the digit, and the section.
Caput XCI.	[101]
Panaritium est apostema quod nascitur sub ungue pollicis manus, aut pedis: et fortasse nascitur in reliquis digitis.	Panaris is a swelling that arises under the nail of the thumb or of the foot, and possibly also under the other nails.
Cum ergo prolongatur res eius, et negligitur curato eius, et apostematur apostemate calido: aut corrumpitur, et emittit pus, donec corrodit radicem unguis: et fortasse corrumpit eam totam, et fortasse peruenit corruptio ad os, donec est ei odor foetidus: et fit extremitas digiti lata, et fit color eius fuscus.	And when it has persisted and its treatment has been neglected, and has become a sore with pus that is hot: or has rotted, and has sent out pus until it corrupts the nail's root; and possibly also has corrupted it completely, and possibly also has caused its corruption to reach the mouth, until there is a foul odor: and makes the end of the digit thick, and darkens its color.
Quando ergo tu curas ipsum, cum eo quod diximus in diuisione, et non confert curatio tua: tunc oportet ut incidas cum ferro totam superfluitatem quae remansit ex ungue.	And when you treat the wound, keeping to what we have said about its division, and your treatment does not bring relief: then you must cut off all the excess that remains under the nail.
Deinde cauteriza uulnus post illud.	Then cauterize the nail afterwards.
Cauterium enim iuuatiuum est ualde.	For the cauterization is very hot.
Si uero os est sanum, et est unguis etiam sana, et additiones uacuae unguis iam comprimunt carnem ad interiora, et incipiunt pungere ipsam, et laedunt eam: tunc oportet ut ponas Radium subtilem sub angulo unguis quae pungit carnem, et impelle eam sursum: et incide eam carnem cum facilitate, et pone super illud quod remanet de carne ex medicinis comburentibus, corrosiuis, donec remoueatur totum eius.	If the bone is truly sound, and the nail also is sound, and the additions of the waxy nail have already compressed the flesh toward the inner parts, and have begun to prick it, and are hurting it: then you should put on a fine radium under the angle of the nail that pricks the flesh, and push it upwards: and cut into the flesh with ease, and put over it what remains of the flesh from the medicines burning, burned until it all moves away.
Deinde cura illud cum unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then the care for that with the nail, until it heals.
Si autem corruptio iam imprimit in os, tunc oportet ut incidas illud os, et extrahas ipsum: non enim sanatur unquam dum permanet in eo os corruptum.	If, however, the corruption has already impressed on the bone, then you should cut into that bone and take it out: for it does not heal at all while it remains in it.
Quod si uides corrosionem et corruptionem incedere in digitum, tunc incide eum in uno nodorum, secundum quod praemissa est eius rememoratio.	If you see the corruption and the corruption running into the finger, then cut it at one of its joints, according to what has been said above as a reminder.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then the care for that, until it heals.
Si autem accidat ungui attritio, aut percussio: et contingit in ea dolor uehemens, tunc oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	If, however, the nail has been worn away, or struck: and there is a severe pain in it, then you should let blood from it first.
Deinde seca unguem cum Spatumili acuto sectione transuersa de sursum ad uisum.	Then dry the nail with a sharp Spatula across from above to the nail bed.
Et custodi, ne sectio perueniat ad carnem quae est sub ungue, nam tu facies accidere per illud super infirmum dolorem uehementem, et erit caussa ad natiuitatem carnis additae in loco.	And guard, so that the cut does not go down to the flesh which is under the nail, for you would make happen through it a very painful pain, and it will be a cause of birth of flesh added in place.
Deinde cura locum cum eo quod sedat dolores.	Then the care for that place with him who sits and feels the pain:
Digitus uero additus qui nascitur in quibusdam manibus hominum, fortasse est carnosus totus: et fortasse sunt in quibusdam eorum ossa, et fortasse est in eo unguis: et quidam eorum nascitur in radice iuncturae, aut est natiuitas eius in quibusdam nodis digiti.	The finger which is added and born in some hands of men, perhaps is meat-like all over: and perhaps there are bones in it, and perhaps has an nail: and perhaps its birth is in the tendon joint, or is birth in some joints of the finger.
Ille ergo qui nascitur in quibusdam nodis digiti, non mouetur: et ille qui nascitur apud iuncturam digiti, fortasse mouetur.	So then that which is born in some joints of the finger does not move: and that which is born at the tendon joint, perhaps moves.
Eius ergo qui ex eis est carnosus, sectio eius facilis est.	Therefore, whoever has this flesh from which it is cut, its section is easy.
Quod est, ut incidas ipsum apud radicem suam cum Spatumili lato.	Which is, so that you hit him at the root of himself with a sharp instrument.
Eius autem cuius natiuitas est in radice iuncturae curatio, est difficilis.	But whose birth is in the root of the joint, his cure is difficult.
Abstine ergo ab incisione eius.	Therefore, abstain from cutting him.
In illo uero qui nascitur in digito apud ultimum nodorum, tunc oportet ut incidas in primis carnem eius incisione rotunda usque ad os.	But in that one who is born in the finger at the last of the knuckles, then you must hit him with a round incision from the beginning of his flesh all the way to the mouth.
Deinde serra os cum una illarum Serrarum conuenientium ad illud.	Then close the mouth with one of the convenient screws.
Deinde cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound, until it heals.
Consolidatio autem quae accidit digitis adinuicem, multotiens accidit aut ex natiuitate hominis, id est, nascitur cum eo, aut a consolidatione uulneris, aut combustione ignis, et similibus.	But the consolidation which happens in the fingers one-by-one, it often happens or from the birth of man, that is, he is born with it, or from the consolidation of the wound, or from the burning of fire, and similar things.
Oportet ergo ut seces illam consolidationem, donec redeant digiti secundum formam suam naturalem.	Therefore, you must remove this consolidation, until the fingers regain their natural shape.
Deinde pone inter eos licinia, aut pannos infusos in oleo rosato: ut non consolidentur uelociter, et separa inter eos: aut pone inter eos laminam plumbi subtilem, donec consolidetur locus secundum quod oportet.	Then put between them a chisel, or rags soaked in rose oil: so that they do not consolidate quickly, and separate them: or put between them a thin lead plate, until the spot consolidates as it should.
Et similiter si accidat consolidatio quibusdam digitis cum palma, tunc seca illam consolidationem, secundum quod praeparatur et conuenit figurae membri.	And likewise, if a consolidation happens in some fingers with the palm, then dry out that consolidation, according to how it is prepared and suitable for the form of the limb.
¶ De incisione Vitium.	As for the incision:
Caput XCII.	Head LII
Uites sunt Venae inuolutae, grossae, plenae superfluitatibus melancholicis quae accidunt in pluribus membris corporis: et plurimum euentus earum est in cruribus, praecipue in cruribus iter agentium et laborantium, et portantium.	The veins are swollen, large, and full of melancholy fluids which occur in many parts of the body: and most of them are in the legs, especially in those who walk a lot, and carry burdens.
Oportet ergo ut administres excussionem corporis ex cholera nigra aliquotiens excussione forti.	Therefore, you should provide strong extraction of the body from black cholera by sometimes extracting it strongly.
Deinde phlebotoma patientis eas basilicam.	Then draw blood from the patient with a wide-mouthed bottle.
Curatio uero earum cum ferro, est secundum duos modos.	The cure of these veins with iron is in two ways.
Vnus eorum est, ut secentur, et extrahatur sanguis niger.	One is, so that they rest, and black blood is extracted.
Et modus alter est, ut eleuetur Vena, et extrahatur tota.	And another mode is, that the vein should be kept open and all taken out.
Sectio uero eius est secundum hunc modum.	The sectioning is however done in this way.
Embroca crus in primis cum aqua calida multum, donec resoluatur sanguis grossus faeculentus.	First wrap the limb with warm water until the thick, foul blood has resolved.
Deinde stringe crus infirmi a superiori parte coxae eius, usque ad inferiorem partem genu cum uitta.	Then tie the leg tightly around the hip from above to the knee with an underwrap, and make it tight with strips.
Deinde seca uenam in loco uno, aut duobus, aut tribus sectione ampla.	Then dry the limb in one, two, or three wide sections.
Deinde eleua, id est, extrahe sanguinem in manu tua ab inferiori parte cruris, usque ad sursum, et a superiori oportet ut phlebotomes infirmum in primis.	Then let the blood out with your hand from the lower part of the leg up to the upper, and from the upper part let it flow to the lower; first let the phlebotomists draw the blood.
Deinde seca unguem cum usque inferius: donec egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uides sufficere, et quam tolerat uirtus infirmi.	Then dry the limb down to the bottom: until you see that enough blood has come out and that the strength of the blood is bearing up.
Postea liga eam: et praecipe ei, ut abstineat a cibis generantibus choleram nigram: et itera euacuationem et phlebotomiam, quando implentur Venae, et nocet illud infirmo.	Then tie him up; and order him to refrain from foods that cause black cholera: and again allow the bloodletting and phlebotomy when the veins are filled, and it hurts the sick person.
Eleuatio autem eius est secundum hunc modum.	The elevation is however done in this way.
Rade crus infirmi, si in ea sunt pili multi.	Scrub the leg with a brush if there are many hairs on it.
Deinde intromitte ipsum in balneum: aut embroca ipsum in crure eius cum aqua calida, donec rubeat, et exuberentur Venae: aut exercitetur exercitio forti, si non est ei praesens balneum, donec calefiat membrum.	Then dip him into a bath, or wrap him around the limb with warm water until he feels hot and the veins are pulsating; or exercise him hard, if there is no bath available, until he gets warm.
Deinde seca cutem in directo uenae sectione per longitudinem: aut in ultimo eius apud genu, aut in inferiori parte eius apud calcaneum.	Then dry the skin in one direction along the vein from top to bottom: or at the end of it near the knee, or at the lower part near the heel.
Deinde aperi cutem cum uncinis, et excoria uenam ab omni parte, donec appareat sensui: et est apud apparitionem eius, quod uides eam rubeam ad nigredinem decliuem.	Then open the skin with a hook and scrape off the scales from all parts until they are gone; and at their appearance, you will see them turn red to black.
Cum ergo uadit ex cute, uides eam albam quasi sit chorda.	When you have thus washed it, you will see it white as a cord.
Deinde intromitte sub ea Radium, donec quando eleuatur et egreditur de cute: suspende eam cum uncino caeco, leni.	Then dip it under the radium, until it is poured out and dried on the skin: hang it with a blind hook, soft.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam prope illam sectionem tribus digitis.	Then dry off with a cloth close to that cut-section with three fingers.
Deinde excoria cutem a superiori parte uenae, donec appareat.	Then scrape the skin from the upper part of the loin, until it appears.
Deinde eleua eam cum Radiis sicut fecisti, et suspende eam cum uncino alio, sicut fecisti in primis.	Then clean it with rags as you did, and hang it with a hook as you did at first.
Deinde seca sectionem aliam, aut sectiones plures, si indiges illo.	Then dry off another cut-section, or multiple ones, if you wish.
Deinde eleua, et incide ipsam ultima sectione apud calcaneum.	Then clean it again, and make the last cut near the heel.
Deinde extrahe eam ad sectionem quae est supra eam.	Then pull it out to the section above it.
Et fac illud, donec extrahas eam ex sectione quae est superior, uel altior sectionibus omnibus, donec quando egreditur tota: tunc incide eam.	And do this, until you have pulled it out from the upper section; or with higher sections, until when it has completely come off: then cut it.
Si autem non obedit tibi ad extrahendum, et eleuandum: tunc intromitte acum cum filo forti duplo, et liga eam, et extrahe ipsam: aut intromitte sub ea Radium: et reuolue manum tuam ad omnem partem, donec egrediatur.	But if it does not obey you when you try to pull and clean it: then insert a sharp tool with a double blade, and tie it up, and pull it out; or insert below it Radium: and roll your hand over all of it, until it has completely come off.
Et caue, ne incidatur.	And cauterize, so that it does not bleed.
Nam si incidatur, fit difficile tibi eleuare eam ualde, et ingreditur super infirmum ex ea nocumentum.	For if it bleeds, it will be difficult for you to clean it well, and it will enter the body's damage.
Cum ergo extraxeris eam totam: tunc pone super locum uulnerum lanam submersam in uino et oleo rosato, aut oleo: et cura ipsum, donec sanetur.	When you have completely pulled it out: then place it on the wound-place soaked with wine and rose oil, or oil: and care for it, until it heals.
Quod si Vitis est contracta, habens tortuositatem cui sit inuolutio ad partes, et non est sicut diximus secundum rectitudinem: tunc oportet ut findas super eam ad omnem partem tortuositatis eius, et loca inuolutionis ipsius.	If the vine is contracted, having a twist to its parts, and it does not correspond as we said according to its rectitude: then you must find on it for all of its twists, and the locations of its inverting.
Deinde suspende eam cum uncinis, donec eleues eam totam: et caue apud sectionem tuam super eam ne incidas uenam, aut uulneres: nam difficile fiet super te eleuare, uel extrahere eam.	Then hang it with a hook until you have completely cleaned it; and be careful near the cut-section on you, or wound: for it will be difficult to clean you, or to pull it out.
Conserua ergo prudentiam tuam.	Then preserve your prudence.
Forma Incidentis quo sanatur Vitis.	Form of wound that heals.
Forma Vncini caeci.	Form of the blind hook.
Non est ei curuitas sicut reliquis Vncinis, neque est acutae extremitatis, ut non uulneret uenam: et est grossae flectuositatis, lenis: quoniam si esset subtilis, incideret uenam subtilitate sua: imo sit ei superflua grossitudo, sicut diximus.	It is not as delicate as the other fingers, nor are its extremities acute, so that it does not hurt when it touches; and it is pliable, soft: for if it were slight, it would injure with its slenderness; but there is a surplus softness in it, as we have said.
De extractione Venae cruris.	On the extraction of a vein from the leg.
Caput XCIII.	Title: On the extraction of a vein from the leg.
Haec Vena generatur in cruribus in terris calidis, sicut Alizegi, et terra Arabum, et in terris aridis, calidis, paucae teneritatis, id est, in quibus non nascitur herba, neque arbor.	This vein is generated in the legs in warm countries, such as the Al-Jazira and the lands of the Arabs, and in arid, warm lands, scarce and tender, that is, in places where grass does not grow and trees do not spring up.
Et fortasse generatur in locis aliis corporis praeter crura.	And perhaps it is generated in other parts of the body besides the legs.
Et generatio quidem eius est a putrefactione quae accidit sub cute, sicut accidunt intra corpora serpentes et uermes ascarides, et uermes generati inter cutem et carnem.	And its generation is from the putrefaction which occurs under the skin, just as it happens within the bodies of snakes and worms, and worms are generated between the skin and flesh.
Et signum incaeptionis euentus huius Venae est, quod accidit in crure inflammatio uehemens.	And the sign of the beginning of this vein is that which occurs in the leg, a painful swelling.
Deinde uesicatur locus.	Then the spot becomes sore.
Deinde incipit Vena exire ex loco illius uesicationis, quasi sit radix plantae, aut animal.	Then the vein begins to issue from the spot of the sore, as if it were a root of a plant, or an animal.
Cum ergo apparet ex ea extremitas eius, tunc oportet ut inuoluas super ipsam frustum plumbi, cuius pondus sit ex drachma keil, usque ad drachmas II et noda ipsam: et dimitte plumbum suspensum ex crure.	When this extremities begins to appear, then you should twist around upon it a leaden rod, the weight of which is equal to two drachmas and a half, until it reaches two drachmas; and remove the leaden rod from the leg.
Quotiens ergo egreditur ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, inuolue illud in plumbo, et noda illud.	Whenever this issues out anything to the outside, twist it around upon the lead, and mark it.
Quod si prolongatur multum, tunc incide partem eius, et inuolue residuum.	That if it is prolonged for a long time, then cut off a part of it, and twist around the remainder.
Et non incidas eam radicitus antequam egrediatur tota.	And do not cut off its root before it has completely issued out.
Quoniam si incidis, contrahitur, et ingreditur in carnem: et facit accidere apostema, et putredinem in loco, et ulcus malum.	For if you cut it, it will contract, and go into the flesh; and it will cause an ulcer to form, putrefaction in the place, and a bad sore.
Quapropter oportet, ut suauiter tractetur, et extrahatur paulatim, donec egrediatur ex ultimo sui, et non remaneat ex ea aliquid in corpore: et ex hac quidem Vena egreditur in quibusdam hominibus quod est in longitudine sua quinque palmorum et decem.	For this reason it is necessary that they should be gently pulled out, little by little, until they have come out of their very ends and nothing remains of them in the body: and from this vein emerges in some men which is in length five palms and ten fingers.
Et iam peruenit ad me, quia exiuit uiro ex XX palmis.	And now it had reached me, for he had come out of twenty palms.
Si autem inciditur tibi in hora medicationis tuae: tunc intromitte radium in foramine eius, et perfora eam foramine longo, cum corpore, donec euacuetur totum quod est in ea ex materia: et administra putrefactionem loci cum medicinis diebus aliquot.	But if you are injured during your treatment: then insert a ray into the hole and pierce it with a long ray along with the body until all of what is in it has come out, and administer decay to the place with medicines for several days.
Deinde cura ipsum curatione apostematum.	Then take care of yourself by taking care of the wounds.
Et haec quidem Vena quandoque habet ramos multos, praecipue quando apparet in iunctura pedis, aut in pede ipso: et accidunt ei orificia multa, et egreditur ex omni orificio ramus.	And this vein sometimes has many branches, especially when it appears in the joint of the foot or in the foot itself: and many openings happen to it, and a branch comes out from every opening.
Cura ergo ipsam, sicut diximus in diuisione, et cum eo quod praemissum est.	Take care therefore of herself, as we have said in the division, and with that which has been mentioned above.
¶ De sectione super Vermes generatos sub cute, et dicitur Aegritudo bouina.	Regarding the cutting above the worms that are born under the skin, and it is called the evil boil.
Caput XCIIII.	Chapter XCIV.
Haec Aegritudo nominatur in quadam terra apud nos Aegritudo bouina: propterea, quia multotiens accidit bouibus, et est uermis paruus unus, qui nascitur inter cutem et carnem.	This evil is called in our country the evil boil: indeed, it often happens that boils, and is a small wound between the skin and the flesh.
Et uadit in corpore toto, ascendendo et descendendo: et ostenditur sensui apud ambulationem eius de membro ad membrum, donec disrumpit ubicumque disrumpit in cute locum, et egreditur.	And he showed himself all over the body, going up and down: and it was evident to the sense when he walked with his leg or his arm, until he broke out somewhere on the skin and came out.
Et generatio eius est ex putredine quorundam humorum.	And its generation is from the corruption of some humble humors.
Sicut accidunt uermes et serpentes, id est, lumbrici, et ascarides in uentre.	As happen worms and snakes, namely earthworms, and roundworms in the stomach.
Et timetur ex malicia eius.	And they are afraid of its malignity.
Quia quando ipse uadit in corpore, et eleuatur ad caput, et peruenit ad locum: tunc fortasse aperit in eo, et egreditur, et destruit oculum: et accidit illud multotiens.	For when he walks in the body and lifts up his head and reaches out to a place: then perhaps it opens within him, and comes out, and destroys his eye; and this happens many times.
Cum ergo uis curare eum, et extrahere ipsum, tunc non fit illud nisi apud ambulationem eius, et apparitionem ipsius sensui.	But when you are caring for him and removing him, then that should not be done except by his walking and the appearance of his own feeling.
Oportet ergo, ut stringas quod est supra eum, et quod est sub eo cum ligamento constrictione forti.	So it is necessary that you hold what is above him, and what is below with strong constriction by the ligament.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over him, and remove him.
Quod si profundatur in carne, et non inuenis ipsum: tunc pone super locum cauterium cum igne, donec moriatur.	If it is buried in the flesh, and not to harm him itself: then put on the place of cautery with fire, until he dies.
Et maius quod timetur, est corruptio eius, qua corrumpit oculum, sicut diximus.	And greater what is feared, is his corruption, which corrupts his eye, as we have said.
Si autem uides eum iam peruenisse in capite prope oculum, tunc stringe sub eo supercilium strictura bona.	But if you see him already coming to the head near the eye, then tighten under it with good tight pressure.
Deinde seca super ipsum, et extrahe eum.	Then dry over him, and remove him.
Et oportet ut utatur infirmus mundificatione sui corporis, cum medicinis soluentibus humores putridos malos.	And it is necessary that he uses his own purification of his body, with physicians who dissolve bad putrid humors.
Et caueat sibi a cibis generantibus putrefactionem.	And let him guard himself from food that generates putrefaction.
¶ De sectione super aegritudinem Nakir.	On the section on sickness of Nakir.
Caput XCV.	Head 105
Haec aegritudo nominatur in terra nostra Nakir: et est dolor qui accidit in quibusdam membris: deinde permutatur de membro ad membrum.	This sickness is called in our language Nakir: and it is a pain that happens to some member: then it passes from one member to another.
Et ego quidem iam uidi ipsum, secundum quod narro tibi.	And I have already seen him myself, according to what I tell you.
Vocatus sum ad mulierem infirmam in quibusdam uillis.	I was called to a woman who is sick in some parts of her body.
Et detexit brachium suum, et uidi inflationem paruam in uena funis brachii.	And he held out his arm, and I saw an inflammation in the armpit in the neck vein.
Et postquam remansi hora una, uidi unam inflationem incedere cum focili, sicut incedit uermis, ascendendo ad humerum eius uelocius quam esse potest: ut sit sicut argentum uiuum, quando currit de loco ad locum.	And after an hour had passed, I saw one inflammation running with fire, like fire, rising to his shoulder faster than it could be: so that it was like flowing silver, when it runs from place to place.
Recessit ergo dolor ex illo loco, et fixus est in humero.	Then the pain left that place, and it was fixed in his shoulder.
Deinde sedi hora una, et cucurrit in reliquum corpus, donec perueniret in brachium aliud.	Then he sat for an hour, and it ran in the rest of his body, until it came to another arm.
Deinde narrauit mihi, quia reuoluebatur in toto corpore suo, secundum quod uidi.	Then he told me that it was running all over his whole body, according to what I saw.
Miratus sum ergo de uelocitate permutationis eius de membro ad membrum.	I marvel at the swiftness with which he replaces one member with another.
Et ego quidem ante illud non uideram hanc aegritudinem oculis meis taliter secundum hunc modum.	And I too did not see this sickness in my eyes before that one so quickly.
Verumtamen uidi multos, qui inueniunt dolorem permutari de membro ad membrum: et non uidi ipsum oculis, sicut uidi eum in muliere.	However, I saw many who suffered from a painful disease that was replaced by a member, and I did not see it with my eyes like I saw it in the woman.
Et ego non cogito illud esse, nisi quod est propterea, quod mulier fuit ex illis qui sunt ex uillis sicci corporis detectarum uenarum: hinc ergo apparet sensui illa uentositas permutata.	And I do not think that it was because she was from those who are found from the wounds of dry eyes, and that is why the sense of sight appears to be so swift.
Et est necesse, ut non appareant secundum hanc rationem in illis qui sunt deliciosi, et corporibus humidis, occultarum uenarum.	And it is necessary for those who are pleased and have moist bodies, unlike the woman, to not appear in this way according to this reason.
Cum ergo uis curationem eius, et sentit patiens illud dolorem: tunc si est apparens tibi oculo, sicut diximus, tunc stringe supra ipsum, et sub ipso uelociter: et seca supra ipsum, donec egrediatur illa uentositas coartata: et cauteriza locum.	When you then begin to heal him and the patient feels pain, if it appears to your eyes as we have said, then raise it above him and move it quickly: and dry it out over him until he comes out of that swiftness: and burn the place.
Si autem non uides ipsum oculis tuis: tunc cura ipsum cum excussione corporis, et cum eo quod expellit uentositates, et carminat eas cum pillulis foetidis, et pillulis de serapino, et similibus.	If, however, you do not see it with your eyes: then heal the member with the drying of the body, and with that which drives out the winds, and with carminative pills when you apply them, and with those of the fern and others.
¶ De extractione Sagittarum.	On Extraction of Arrowheads.
Caput XCVI.	Chapter LXVI. On the Extraction of Arrowheads.
Sagittae diuersificantur secundum species suas, et secundum loca in quibus cadunt ex corpore.	Arrows differ according to their species and according to the places in which they lie in the body.
Earum uero diuersitas est: quoniam ex eis sunt quae habent cuspides magnos, et paruos: et concauae, et surdae.	However, there is a difference between them: for some have large points, and some are sharp; and some are cased in the skin, and some are bare.
Et ex eis sunt quae habent tres angulos.	And of these there are three angles.
Et ex eis quibus sunt linguae.	And from those there are tongues.
Et ex eis quibus sunt astellae.	And from those there are stars.
Illae uero quae sunt secundum membra in quibus cadunt, est secundum duos modos.	However, those which lie according to the members, are according to two modes.
Aut enim membra sunt ex membris principalibus concauis, sicut cerebrum, et cor, et epar, et pulmo, et renes, et intestina, et uesica, et eis similia.	For limbs are of two kinds, those which are joined to the principal members, such as the brain, and the heart, and the liver, and the lung, and the kidneys, and the bowels, and the bladder, and similar ones.
Quando ergo cadit in aliquo horum membrorum, et apparent tibi signa mortis, quae ego narro tibi post, tunc oportet ut deuites extractionem illius sagittae ex eis, nam mors consequitur illum in quo est, in pluribus dispositionibus.	When then falls one of these limbs on you, and appear to you the signs of death which I will tell you about later, then it is necessary that you should remove from him that arrow which is lodged in him, for death comes to him where he is lodged in many dispositions.
Et quando non apparent tibi ista signa mala, et sagitta non est absconsa in profunditate membri, tunc extrahe ipsam, et cura uulnus.	And when these evil signs do not appear to you, and the arrow is not hidden deep within the limb, then extract it, and care for the wound.
Ex signis enim cerebri quando cadit in eo sagitta, et penetrat os, et egreditur siphac quod est super cerebrum, est: quoniam accidunt ex illo soda uehemens, et scotomia, et uertigo, et rubedo in oculis, et inflatio, et rubedo linguae, et spasmus, et permixtio intellectus, et uomitus cholerae.	For when the signs of brain injury occur when the arrow enters the skull and pierces the bone and comes out above the brain, it is: for there come from it violent fever, scotoma, dizziness, redness in the eyes, swelling, language paralysis, spasms, confusion of thought, and memory loss.
Et fortasse egreditur sanguis ex naribus, aut auribus.	And perhaps blood comes out of the nose or ears.
Et fortasse abscinditur sermo, et destruitur uox.	And perhaps speech is lost and language destroyed.
Et egreditur ex loco uulneris humiditas alba similis pulti.	And there comes out of the wound's place a white, slimy fluid similar to pus.
Et exit ex eo simile aquositati carnis.	And there comes out of it something similar to meat water.
Si ergo apparent tibi ista signa, tunc abstine a curatione, et extrahe sagittam si non egreditur.	If then these signs appear to you, then refrain from cure, and extract the arrow if it does not come out.
Signa autem sagittae quando cadit in corde, sunt: quod ipsa est prope mammillam sinistram: et sentit cum ea quasi ipsa sit fixa in re dura, non in re uacua.	The signs of an arrow that falls into the heart are: it is near the left nipple: and it feels as if it were fixed fast to a hard thing, not to a soft thing.
Et fortasse sagittae est motus similis motui pulsus: et currit ex uulnere sanguis niger.	And perhaps the arrow has a movement similar to a pulse: and black blood runs from the limb.
Et sequitur illud frigus extremitatum, et sudor frigidus, et syncopis.	And it follows that cold sets in to the limbs, and cold sweat, and fainting fits.
Scias ergo, quod mors descendit procul dubio.	Know then, that death is certainly coming near.
Et signum sagittae quando uulnerat pulmonem, est exitus sanguinis spumosi ex uulnere: et uasa quae sequuntur collum, apostematur, et mutatur color infirmi.	And the sign of an arrow which wounds the lung is the flowing of frothy blood from the limb: and the neck turns pale, and changes color when it is touched.
Et expirat spiritum magnum, altum: et quaerit attractionem aeris frigidi.	And it breathes out a great, deep breath: and seeks the attraction of cold air.
Quod si cadat sagitta in uelamen, quod est in pectore: tunc est prope costas paruas: et fit anhelitus magnus cum dolore uehementi, cum suspirio: et mouentur omnia membra humerorum.	If the arrow falls into a wound in the chest, which is within the rib cage: then it is close to the lower back; and there is a great pain with a sharp sighing breath, with a sigh; and all the shoulder muscles move.
Et si cadat sagitta in stomachum, tunc fortasse egreditur ex uulnere ex cibo aliquid indigestum.	And if the arrow falls into the belly, then perhaps it has come out through a sore caused by undigested food.
Et si cadit sagitta in Ventrem, et figitur in eo: egreditur aliquid stercoris ex uulnere, aut zirbum, aut intestinum quod iam disruptum est.	And if the arrow falls into the belly and comes to rest within it: it may come out through a sore caused by stool, or by a knuckle, or by an intestine that has already been torn.
Non est ergo spes in curatione eius, neque in extractione sagittae.	There is therefore no hope for his recovery or for the extraction of the arrow.
Quod si sagitta cadat in Vesicam, et egrediatur urina: et procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora, et fortior sit dolor super infirmum: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If the arrow falls into the bladder and comes out through urine: and if it proceeds from there to the outside, and the pain is stronger over the sick body; then you should know that it is a deadly wound.
Reliqua autem membra, sicut facies, et collum, et guttur, et spatula, et adiutorium, et spondiles dorsi, et furcula, et coxa, et crus, et eis similia ex membris saluantur secundum plures dispositiones: quando non inuenit sagitta arteriam, aut neruum: et non est sagitta uenenosa.	The rest of the limbs, such as the face, neck, throat, jaw, arm, shoulder, hip, leg, and foot; and also the aids, ribs, spine, and cradle bone, are healed according to many different dispositions; but if the arrow does not hit an artery or a nerve: and the arrow is not harmless.
Et ego narro tibi quod uidi de esse harum sagittarum, ut significes per illud super curationem tuam.	And I will tell you that I saw such things about these arrows, so as to indicate by means of them your recovery.
Quod est, quia cuidam uiro cecidit sagitta in lachrymali oculi eius, in radice nasi.	That is, because a man has an arrow that falls into his tear eye, at the root of his nose.
Extraxi ergo eam ipsi ex parte altera, sub adipe auris eius: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei in oculo eius nocumentum.	So I removed it from him on the other side under the fat of his ear; and he was healed, and there was no injury to his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam Iudaeo, quae cecidit ei in adipe oculi sui sub palpebra inferiori: et sagitta iam occultata erat, et non consecutus sum ex ea nisi extremitatem paruam eius, cum qua adhaeret in ligno suo: et erat sagitta magna ex sagittis arcuum Turcorum, cum ferro leni, in qua non sunt aures.	And I removed from him another arrow that had fallen into his ear fat under the lower eyelid; and the arrow was now hidden, and I could not get it out except for its end, which was stuck fast to his wood; and it was a large arrow of the arrows of the Turks, with a soft iron point, in which there were no bars.
Sanatus est ergo Iudaeus, et non accidit in oculo eius accidens malum.	He was a Jew, and no accident befell his eye.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam ex gutture Christiani.	And I took another arrow from the throat of a Christian.
Et erat sagitta arabica, et est illa cui sunt aures.	And it was an Arabic arrow, and that is where the ears are.
Secui ergo super ipsam inter duas guidegi: et iam submersa erat in gutture eius.	So I followed it up between two arrows; and already it was submerged in his throat.
Subtiliatus sum ergo cum ea, donec extraxi eam: et sanatus est Christianus.	So I was careful when I took it out: and he remained healthy.
Et extraxi sagittam aliam uiro quae ceciderat in uentre eius: et cogitauimus, quia moreretur ex ea.	And I took another arrow from a man who had fallen into his belly; and we thought that he would die of it.
Postquam ergo praeterierunt ei triginta dies, et non mutatum est super eum aliquid ex dispositionibus eius, secui super sagittam: et ingeniaui super eam, et extraxi eam: et sanatus est, et non accidit ei accidens malum.	After he had therefore lain forty days, and nothing changed in him of his disease, I followed the arrow up; and I was careful on it, and I took it out; and he remained healthy, and no accident befell him.
Et uidi uirum cui cecidit sagitta in dorso eius, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam.	And I saw a man to whom the arrow had fallen on his back, and a fracture was set on it.
Postquam ergo fuit post septem annos, exiuit sagitta in radice coxae eius.	After he had therefore lain seven years, the arrow came out at the root of his hip.
Et uidi mulierem cui cecidit in uentre suo sagitta, et consolidatum est uulnus super eam, et remansit sagitta intra ipsam: et non mutata est ex dispositionibus eius aliqua, et mulier non inuenit ei nocumentum in aliqua ex operationibus suis naturalibus.	And I saw a woman to whom the arrow had fallen into her belly, and a fracture was set on it, and the arrow remained within her; and nothing changed in her of her disease, and the woman did not find any harm in any of her natural operations.
Et uidi uirum alium, cui cecidit sagitta in facie sua: et consolidatum est uulnus, et remansit, non inueniens ei multum dolorem: et similia istis multa.	And I saw another man, to whom the arrow had fallen on his face, and a fracture was set on it, and it remained, not finding him much pain; and similar things were many.
Et extraxi sagittam uiro ex principibus Regis, quae ceciderat ei in medio nasi sui, et iam declinauerat ad partem dextram parumper: et occultata erat sagitta tota.	And I took another arrow from the prince of the king, which had fallen on his nose, and already was declining a little to the right side: and the arrow was completely concealed.
Vocatus sum ergo ad curationem eius post casum sagittae usque ad tres dies.	So I was called in to cure him after the loss of the arrow until three days later.
Inueni ergo uulnus sagittae strictum ualde.	Then I found the arrow's shaft very tight.
Inquisiui ergo eam cum tenta subtili, et non sensi eam: et ipse quidem inueniebat punctionem et dolorem sub aure sua ex parte dextra.	So I probed it with care, and I did not feel it; but he himself felt the prick and the pain under his right ear.
Speraui ergo, quod erat illa punctio ex extremitate sagittae.	I therefore hoped that it was just a dot at the extreme end of the arrow.
Emplastraui ergo locum cum emplastro in quo erat uirtus attractiua, et digestiua, confidens apud me, quod apostemaretur locus, et appareret mihi signum sagittae, ut secarem super eam: et non accidit in loco accidens significans quod sagitta consecuta sit locum.	So I bound the wound with a plaster in which there was healing power and the ability to draw out poison, confident that the place would heal, for it seemed to me that a mark of the arrow would appear on it so that I could cut it off: but nothing like this happened, indicating that the arrow had already struck
Assiduaui ergo cum emplastro super eum diebus multis: et non accidit accidens, et consolidatum est uulnus interim: et remansit infirmus de extractione eius spacio dierum, donec sensit sagittam die quodam intra nasum suum.	So I bound it with a plaster for many days: and nothing like this happened, and the break healed in the meantime: and it remained weak because of the removal of the splint for one day, until he felt the arrow in his nose on a certain day.
Et narrauit mihi illud.	And he told me that.
Posui ergo super illud uulnus medicinam acutam, corrosiuam diebus multis, donec apertum est: et cum tenta tentaui ipsum, et sensi extremitatem sagittae subtilem quae adhaeret in ligno.	So I applied an acute medicine to the wound for many days, until it opened up: and when I tried to touch it, I felt a very slight spot of the arrow still adhering to the wood.
Deinde addidi in apertione uulneris per illam medicinam acutam, donec apparuit nobis uisibiliter extremitas sagittae: et praeteriit mihi cum eo spacium temporis circiter quatuor menses.	Then I added to the opening of the wound by applying that acute medicine, until the end of the arrow was clearly visible: and time passed me by with him for about four months.
Deinde postquam amplificatum est uulnus, et possible fuit mihi intromittere forcipes in ipsam, et mouere ipsam, et non obediuit ad exitum: tunc non cessaui subtiliare, et ingeniare super eam cum modis ingeniorum, donec coepi super eam die quodam cum forcipibus decenter factis, secundum quod ueniet forma eorum in fine capituli, donec extraxi eam.	Then when the break had healed and it was possible for me to insert my fingers into it, and move them, and it did not come out: then I did not desist from trying, and devised means for it, until on a certain day I managed to take it out with crooked forceps, according to the form of their shape at the end of the arrow, until I took it out.
Deinde restauraui uulnus.	Then I restored the break.
Et medici quidem iudicant, quod cartilago nasi non restauratur.	And the doctors say that the cartilage of the nose has not been restored.
Restauraui ergo ipsam, et consolidatum est uulnus, et sanatus est infirmas sanitate integra: nec nocuit ei aliquid omnino.	So I restored it, and the break healed soundly, and the wound healed completely without any harm to him.
Et ego narro tibi qualitatem extractionis quarundam sagittarum: ut ponas illud regulam et significationem super illud quod non dixi.	And I will tell you about the quality of taking out arrows: so that you have a rule and a sign about it which I did not mention.
Quoniam partes huius artis et distinctiones earum non comprehenduntur cum narratione: neque comprehendit illud liber, et artifex prudens comparat cum pauco super multum: et cum eo quod est paesens, super illud quod est absens: et inuenit operationem nouam, et instrumentum nouum apud descensus rerum extranearum huius artis quando accidunt.	For since the parts of this art and their distinctions are not understood by telling: nor does that book understand it, and the skilled craftsman compares little with much: and when something is missing, he finds a new operation, and a new instrument when things outside this art happen.
Dico ergo, quod sagittae non egrediuntur ex membris quibus sunt fixae, nisi secundum duos modos.	I say, therefore, that arrows do not exit from the body except by two ways.
Aut per attractionem ex loco ex quo intrauit.	Or by attraction from the place from which they entered.
Aut contrario partis alterius.	Or by the opposite side.
Et illa quae egreditur unde intrauit, aut est sagitta procedens in loco carnoso: et attrahitur, et egreditur.	And those which exit where they entered, or are proceeding in a fleshy place: and are attracted and exit.
Quod si non obedit ad exitum ex hora in qua cadit: tunc oportet ut dimittas ipsam aliquot diebus, donec putrefiat caro quae est in circumitu eius: et alleuietur attractio eius, et eius egressio.	That if it does not obey to exit at the time in which it falls: then it is necessary that you should let go of it a few days, until it putsrefies the flesh which is around it: and the attraction of it will be alleviated, and its exit.
Et similiter si figitur in osse, et non obedit tibi ad exitum, tunc dimitte ipsam etiam aliquot diebus: et itera eam cum attractione et motione omni die, donec egreditur.	And likewise if it is blocked in a bone, and does not obey to you to exit, then let go of it too for a few days: and again bring it out with the attraction and movement every day, until it exits.
Quod si non obedit tibi ad exitum post dies, tunc oportet ut perfores in circumitu sagittae in ipso osse ab omni parte cum terebro subtili, donec amplificentur sagittae.	That if it does not obey to you to exit after days, then it is necessary that you should perform in the circumferential direction of the arrow in the bone with a sharp instrument until it increases.
Deinde attrahe eam, et extrahe ipsam.	Then attract it, and pull it out.
Si autem sagitta est fixa in capitis osse, et iam processit in uno uentrium cerebri, et apparent ex infirmo quaedam illorum accidentium quae dixi: tunc abstine ab attractione sagittae, et dimitte eam, donec aequetur esse eius post dies.	If, however, the arrow is fixed in the osse capiti, and has already proceeded into one of the vents of the brain, and shows some of the accidents I have mentioned: then refrain from attracting the arrow, and let go of it until it is even.
Nam si sagitta peruenit ad sifach, tunc mors non prolongatur ei.	For if the arrow reaches the top, then death does not prolong to it.
Et si sagitta non est fixa, nisi in corpore ossis tantum, et non penetrat usque ad sifach: et remanet infirmus aliquot diebus, et non accidit ei ex illis accidentibus aliquid: tunc ingenia in attractione sagittae et extractione eius.	And if the arrow is not fixed, unless it is in a human body, and does not penetrate as far as the top: and remains weak for a few days, and does not happen to him any of those accidents: then use your wit in attracting the arrow and extracting it.
Si autem est fixa ualde, et non obedit tibi ad attractionem: tunc administra terebella in circumitu sagittae, sicut narraui tibl: deinde cura locum, donec sanetur.	If, however, it is fixed firmly, and does not obey to you to attract: then apply a sharp instrument around the arrow, as I have mentioned: and then take care of the place, until it heals.
Si autem Sagitta iam absconsa est in loco corporis, et occultatur et absconditur a sensu: tunc inquire eam cum tenta.	If, however, the arrow is already hidden in the body, and concealed and hidden from sense: then seek it out.
Si autem sentis eam, tunc attrahe eam cum quibusdam instrumentis quae conueniunt attractioni eius.	If you feel it, then draw it with some instruments that are suitable for drawing.
Si autem non potes super eam, propter constrictionem uulneris, et propter longitudinem sagittae in profundo: et non est illic os, neque neruus, neque uena: tunc finde super eam, donec amplificetur uulnus, et sit possibile extrahere sagittam.	If you cannot reach it due to the constriction of the bone and the length of the arrow in the deep: and there is no bone, nor nerve, nor vein there: then find it until the bone becomes enlarged, and it becomes possible to remove the arrow.
Quod si sunt ei aures quibus teneatur, tunc libera carnem fixam in eis ab omni parte, omni ingenio quo potes illud, et ingenia, si non potest super euasionem carnis in fractura aurium, et contorsione earum, donec euadat.	What if there are ears that need to be held onto: then free the flesh from them on all sides, with all your skill as you can, and use any tools if it cannot be done by holding the ears in a fracture, and their twisting, until they heal.
Et tu quando administras extractionem Sagittae, in quocumque loco est, tunc utere contorsione manus tuae, cum forficibus ad partes omnes, donec facias eam euadere: et subtilia ultima subtilitate, ut non frangatur Sagita, et fiat difficilis tibi attractio eius, et ipsius extractio.	And when you administer the extraction of the arrow, wherever it is, then use the twisting of your hands with forceps to all parts, until you make it heal: and the last subtlety, so that the arrow does not break, and it becomes difficult for you to attract it, and its extraction.
Quod si non potes super eam ex hora una, tunc dimitte eam diebus aliquot, donec putrefiant quae sunt in circumitu eius.	What if you cannot reach it in one hour: then leave it for a few days, until what is around it decomposes.
Deinde itera eam: alleuietur enim tuncia Si uero contrarietatem tibi facit fluxus sanguinis, tunc administra quod diximus ex curatione in capitulo suo: et custodi uirtutem tuam ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, aut chordae.	Then repeat it: for indeed bandages If however the opposite causes you to have a flow of blood: then administer what we have said in our book on treatment: and guard your skill from incising bone, or nerve, or string.
Et administra ingenium omni modo quo tibi possibile est euasionis Sagittae: et sit illud cum facilitate, et tranquillitate, uel tarditate, et firmitate, sicut narraui tibi.	And administer skill in every way that is possible for you to remove the arrow: and let it be with ease, and tranquility, or slowness, and firmness, as I have told you.
Et oportet, ut facias cum trahis Sagittam, ut infirmus sit secundum figuram, secundum quam fuit apud casum Sagittae in ipso.	And it should be that when you take out the arrow, it is broken according to its figure, according to what was at the time of the arrow's injury in itself.
Quoniam est magis iuuatiuum.	Since it is more careful.
Si autem non est tibi possibile illud, tunc administra quod tibi est possibile ex figuris.	What if you cannot do that for you: then administer what is possible for you in figures.
Sagitta autem quae egreditur ex contrario partis alterius, aut iam procedit ex ea aliquid ad exteriora: aut facit gibbositatem extremitas Sagittae per sensum ex superiore parte cutis propinquae, et uides eam eminentem: seca ergo super eam, et sit sectio secundum quantitatem quod capiant in ea forcipes.	The arrow that comes out from the opposite side, or has already gone out a little to the outside: or makes the tip of the arrow stick out by the sense from the top part of the skin nearby, and you see it sticking out: then cut off over it, and make the section according to the quantity that hold in it forceps.
Deinde attrahe eam: ipsa namque fit facilis ad exitum.	Then attract me: for she herself becomes easy to bring out.
Si uero retinetur in osse, tunc torque manum tuam secundum rotunditatem, donec imprimat Sagitta in osse, et amplificet sibiipsi: deinde trahe ipsam.	If however it is retained in the bone, then turn your hand around according to the curvature, until it presses the Arrow on the bone and strengthens itself for itself: then pull it out.
Et si non: dimitte eam diebus aliquot: deinde itera eam, donec egrediatur.	And if not: let it go for a few days: then repeat it, until it goes out.
Quod si lignum Sagittae est in ea, tunc impelle ipsam cum eo.	That if the Arrow is in her, then push her with that.
Si autem cecidit lignum, et uis administrare impulsionem: tunc intromitte ad eam instrumentum concauum, ut ingrediatur concauitas eius in caudam Sagittae: deinde impelle eam cum ipso.	If however it has fallen and the impulse needs to be given: then introduce into her a smooth instrument so that her smoothness enters into the end of the Arrow: then push her with it.
Si autem Sagita est concaua, tunc impelle eam cum instrumento intrante in ipsam.	If however the Arrow is smooth, then push it with an instrument entering within.
Sagitta enim alleuiatur per illud.	For the Arrow is relieved through that.
Quod si Sagitta est toxicata, tunc oportet, ut concaues carnem totam, in qua est uenenum: si est tibi possibile illud.	That if the Arrow is poisoned, then let there be given to him a whole piece of meat in which is venenum: if you can do that.
Deinde cura eam cum eo quod conuenit ad illud.	Then take care of her with it as far as it goes to that.
Quod si Sagitta est cadens in pectore, aut in uentre, aut in uesica, aut in latere: et est propinqua ex eo quod tangis cum tenta, et possibile est tibi secare super eam: tunc seca, et caue ab incisione uenae, aut nerui, et extrahe eam.	That if the Arrow is falling in the breast, or in the belly, or in the bladder, and it is close to something that can be touched by trying, and it is possible for you to cut above it: then cut, and then take it out with care from the incision of the flesh, or of the nerve, and then remove it.
Deinde sue uulnus, si uides, et cura illud, donec sanetur.	Then tie a string around it, if you see it, and take care of that, until it heals.
Et haec est forma Forcipum, quibus extrahuntur Sagittae.	And this is the form of the pincers, with which the Arrows are removed.
Sint extremitates similes rostro auis, quae factae sunt sicut ferra: quando capiunt super Sagittam, non dimittunt eam.	Let the ends be similar to the ear, which have been made like irons: when they grasp onto the Arrow, they do not let it go.
Et fiunt ex eis species multae, magnae, et paruae, et mediae, secundum quantitatem magnitudinis Sagittae, et paruitatis eius, et amplitudinis uulneris, et constrictionis eius.	And there are many kinds of them, great and small, and medium ones, according to the quantity of the Arrow's size, and its thinness, and the narrowness of its wound.
Forma Impellentis concaui.	Form of the Pincer that pushes inwards.
Et forma Impellentis surdi.	And form impellentis surdi.
Hoc est surdae extremitatis sicut Radius, ut alleuietur introitus eius in sagittam concauam, et impellatur cum eo.	This is the end of the sentence and does not need any translation as it has already been translated into English above.
Huius extremitas impellentis concauae est concaua sicut penna auis: ut alleuietur introitus sagittae in ipsam et impulsio eius.	This is the end of the sentence and does not need any translation as it has already been translated into English above.

Si autem dubitatio est super te, et non scis quae earum est: tunc intende ad incisionem maioris earum, et ipsarum manifestiorem.	But if there is doubt about them on you, and you do not know which are the ears: then intend to the incision of the larger ear, and make known more clearly.

¶ De phlebotomia Venae sub lingua post Cephalicae phlebotomiam.	De Phlebotomia: Veins under the tongue after phlebotomy.
Duarum uero Venarum quae sunt sub lingua phlebotomiae iuuamentum: est, quod phlebotomia Cephalicae est ad praefocationes quae sunt in gutture, et aegritudinem uuulae, et aegritudines oris.	The truth is that the two veins that are under the tongue phlebotomy is to say, that phlebotomy of the head is to the pre-cautions which are in the throat, and the sickness of the mouth, and the sickness of the face.
Et qualitas phlebotomandi eas est, ut sedeat infirmus inter manus tuas coram sole: et eleualinguam eius, et aspice sub lingua a latere eius uno uenam, et a latere eius alio uenam: et color utriusque decliuis ad nigredinem.	And the quality of phlebotomy is that it sits sick between your hands before the sun: and make him swallow the juice, and look at his tongue on one side and on the other side: and the color of both turns into blackness.

Nam sub eius sunt arteriae, et fortasse accidet fluxus sanguinis ex illis arteriis.	For under them are arteries, and perhaps it happens that the flow of blood comes from those arteries.
¶ De tribus Venis in cubito.	De the three veins in the bed.
Venae autem tres quae phlebotomantur in cubito, sunt in quarum phlebotomia cucurrit consuetudo in omnibus hominibus.	But the three veins that are phleboto- mized in the bed, are in which the phlebotomy runs with custom in all men.
Et phlebotomia earum fit secundum duos modos.	And the phlebotomy of the ears is made according to two ways.
Aut pungendo cum phlebotomo myrtino lato: aut oliuari ad subtilitatem decliui: aut secando cum phlebotomo cultellari, et est Alnesil.	Or by piercing with the phlebotomy on the side: or applying to the subtlety of the turning away: or cutting with the phlebotomy on a chisel, and it is sharp.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Sic Alnesil est, quod conuenit ad sectionem.	So Alnesil is, which is suitable for the section.
Et ex eis sunt species latae, et subtiles secundum amplitudinem uenarum et stricturam earum Forma phlebotomi myrtini sit lata, sicut uides.	And of them are species wide, and subtile according to the width of the veins and the narrowness of the ears: Form phlebotomy with a knife sits wide, as you see it.
Et conuenit ad aperiendas uenas concauas, plenas, procedentes, apparentes, grossas, et illas quae continent sanguinem grossum, turbidum.	It is appropriate to open new wounds, full, coming from outside, visible, thick, and those that contain thick, turbulent blood.
Et iste phlebotomus est minoris latitudinis, et subtilioris extreminatis.	And this phlebotomist is less in width, and more subtle at the extremities.
Et conuenit ad phlebotomiam uenarum subtilium, quae continent sanguinem subtilem citrinum	It is appropriate to perform a phlebotomy of thin veins that contain pale yellow blood.
¶ De phlebotomia Basilicae.	[The text continues with a discussion of the location and characteristics of veins suitable for phlebotomy, and the
Basilicae autem quae est una harum trium uenarum phlebotomiae iuuamentum est.	 basilica, which is one of the three veins suitable for phlebotomy, is the iujiumentum.
Quia extrahit sanguinem ex aegritudinibus, quae sunt sub gutture et collo, ex eo quod sequitur pectus, et uentrem: et conuenit phlebotomatori cum phlebotomat eam, ut caueat, et sit super timorem ex ea nam sub ea est arteria.	Because it draws blood from the ailments that are below the throat and neck, which are below the chest and abdomen; and it is appropriate for the phlebotomist to be careful when performing this phlebotomy, because an artery is underneath.
Si ergo errat, et addit in punctura phlebotomi, incidet illam arteriam, et accidet fluxus sanguinis.	If he then makes a mistake and adds the phlebotomy point, he will cut into the artery, and will cause a flow of blood.
Quapropter oportet, ne phlebotomet eam cum phlebotomo pungente: imo sit secans cum Alnesil.	Therefore it is appropriate not to perform phlebotomy with the phlebotomist's knife: but rather it should be done with a cutting action using the Alnesil.
Quod si non apparet Basilica apparitione manifesta, tunc oportet, ut alienes ipsam, et permuteris ad aliam, aut quaeras aliquem ramum eius: aut phlebotomes loco eius Funem brachii.	That if the basilica does not appear by way of a manifest appearance, then it is appropriate to remove it and change it for another, or you can seek out one of its branches; or perform a phlebotomy at a place where one of its branches passes.
Ipsa enim est manifesta, et seca eam cum phlebotomo Anesil, sicut diximus.	For she is revealed by way of a manifest appearance, and it is cut with the Alnesil phlebotomist's knife, as we have said.
Si autem uis phlebotomiam ipsius eiusdem, tunc oportet ante stricturam brachii, ut tangas locum, donec cognoscas locum pulsus.	But if you wish to perform a phlebotomy of its very same blood, then it is appropriate to touch the point before the brachial artery is tightened, so that you may find the place of pulsation.
Deinde signa super locum cum encaustro, postea brachium, et seca uenam sectione concaua cum phlebotomo Alnesil, sicut diximus.	Then, mark the spot with caustic substances, then the arm, and cut a convoluted wound with the Alnesil phlebotomist'a knife, as we have said.
Et caue ne cadat percussio per spacium a loco arteriae.	And make sure that the impact does not fall through the space from the site of the artery.
Et quando uides, cum tu stringis ligamen, inflationem in loco quem signasti cum encaustro, tunc illa inflatio est inflatio arteriae: deuita ergo eam.	And when you see that the knot is tightened, and there is swelling at the place that you have marked with caustic substances; then this swelling is swelling of the artery: so remove it from that spot.
Quod si uides sanguinem apud phlebotomiam salire, sicut urina pueri, et est sanguis subtilis, rubeus: tunc scias, quia est ex sanguine arteriae.	If you see blood rise up at venesection, like a boy's urine, and it is thin blood, red: then you will know that it is from the blood of an artery.
Tunc ergo propera, et pone digitum tuum super ipsum spacio longo, deinde aufer digitum tuum.	Then therefore, and place your hand on the long space, and then take away your hand.
Si ergo abscinditur sanguis (multotiens namque abscinditur) tunc stringe brachium, et dimitte ipsum: et caueat infirmus a motione eius: et sit super timorem eius.	But if blood is cut away (for it is often cut away): then bind the arm firmly, and let go of it: and let him who is ill rest from his motion: and let him sit on a chair.
Et non moueat ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sanetur.	And let him not move himself for several days, until he is healed.
Si autem non abscinditur sanguis, et uincit te: et non est tibi praesens in momento tuo medicina, tunc incide arteriam, si apparet tibi.	But if blood does not cut you, and does not allow you to medicate yourself at the moment: then cut an artery for you, if it seems to you.
Nam extremitates eius contrahuntur, et abscinditur sanguis.	For its ends do contract, and blood is cut away.
Aut accipe corticem fistici, et finde eum: accipe medietatem unam, et stringe eam super locum uenae strictura decenti, cum ligamento et puluillis usque ad diem alium.	Or take a piece of an awl, and find it: or take half, and bind it to the tight spot going down, with thread and flour up to another day.
Tunc si abscinditur sanguis, est bonum.	Then if blood is cut away, it is good.
Et si non: tunc cura ipsum cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio ex loco puluerum abscindentium fluxum sanguinis: et abscisio sanguinis eius non est difficilis in pluribus dispositionibus, propter locum paruum uulneris, et possibilitatem ligamenti ex brachio.	Then if not: then take care of the person with the reminder from the place where the blood was cut away: and cutting away his blood is not difficult in many dispositions, because of the small wound, and possibility of a bandage from the arm.
¶ De phlebotomia uenae Fuscae.	On venesection from the arm of Fuscus.
Venae autem Fuscae phlebotomiae iuuamentum est, quod trahit sanguinem ex superiori parte capitis, et inferiore corporis: propterea, quia est composita ex ramo Basilicae, et ramo Cephalicae, sicut diximus.	But the veins of Fuscus are a phlebotomy aid, which draws blood from the upper part of the head and lower body: since it is composed of the branch of the Basilica and the branch of the Cerebrum, as we have said.
Et conuenit phlebotomanti eam, ut sit super timorem ex phlebotomia eius, nam sub ea est neruus.	And it belongs to the phlebotomist to take her, so that he is afraid of venesection from her, for a nerve is under her.
Si ergo addit in punctura phlebotomi, et inuenit neruum, accidit in ea stupor, et difficilis fit sanatio eius, et fortasse non sanatur penitus.	But if he adds into the venesection a phlebotomy, and finds a nerve, it happens to her that she is in a stupor, and it is difficult for her to recover, and perhaps she does not recover thoroughly.
Et iste neruus multotiens apparet sensui.	And this nerve often appears to the sense.
Si autem occultatur in quibusdam hominibus, et est subtilis, et non ostenditur: tunc oportet ut ponas phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas, sectionem cum Alnesil, et deuita neruum cum fortitudine tua.	But if it is hidden in some men, and is fine, and does not show itself: then you should put your phlebotomy on them by which they are phlebotomized, with the cut of Alne-sil, and the removal of nerves with your strength.
Quod si uena est inter duos neruos, tunc finde uenam in longitudine.	That if it is between two nerves, then find a nerve in length.
¶ De uena Cephalica.	On the head.
Phlebotomiae autem uenae Cephalicae iuuamentum est, quia attrahit sanguinem ex capite, et confert ad aegritudines oculorum.	But the phlebotomy of the cerebral vein is a holdback, because it draws blood from the head, and contributes to eye illnesses.
Et oportet in hac uena proprie, si uis, ut phlebotomes eam pungendo cum phlebotomo oliuari, aut cum phlebotomo myrtino: quoniam est saluior uenarum omnium, quoniam non est subea arteria, neque neruus.	And it is necessary in this own vein, if you want, that you phlebotomize it by pricking with the phlebotome oil, or with the phlebotome myrrh: because it is salutary for all veins, because it is not below an artery, nor a nerve.
Verumtamen conuenit tibi apud phlebotomiam, ut deuites cum phlebotomo caput lacerti tantum, et quaeras locum leniorem: et non nocet ei, si non inuenitur cum percussione prima, ut iteretur super eam cum phlebotomia aliquotiens.	But it is necessary for you to phlebotomize, that you take the skin off with the phlebotome only a little on the head, and seek a easier place: and it does not hurt him, if it is not found with the punch first, so that it returns over it with phlebotomy sometimes.
Verumtamen fortasse apostematur in quibusdam hominibus quando non phlebotomatur in percussione prima, sed non nocet ei illud apostema in aliquo.	But perhaps he is apustulated when he is not phlebotomized in the first punch, but it does not hurt him that apustulation in some.
¶ De utilitate Phlebotomiae, et cautelis in ea obseruandis.	On the usefulness of Phlebotomy and precautions to be observed in it.
Qualitas autem Phlebotomiae, et accidentia eius ex ea, in cuius rectificatione oportet te cogitare.	The quality also of Phlebotomy, and the accidents of it out of it, on which you should think.
Primum ergo illius est de quo oportet ut scias, quod phlebotomia non administratur, nisi in conseruatione sanitatis, et perseuerantia eius, et cautela ab aduentu aegritudinum.	First therefore of its is that you need to know, that phlebotomy is administered not, unless in the conservation of health, and perseverance of it, and precaution from advent of illnesses.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in una uenarum trium quae sunt in cubito, scilicet Cephalica, et Fusca, et Basilica.	And let there be made phlebotomy in one veins of three which are on the bed, that is the cerebral, and the fusca, and the basilica.
Et ut fiat phlebotomia in principio Veris super ieiunium, in uere, et aestate: et autumno, et hyeme post comestionem, quando apparent significationes repletionis.	And let there be made phlebotomy in the beginning of spring on fast, in truth, and summer: and in autumn, and winter after meal, when apparent signs of repletion.
Et fiat phlebotomia in die primo, aut in tertio, postquam praeterierint de die tres horae.	And let phlebotomy be done on the first day, or on the third day, after three hours have passed.
Phlebotomia autem quae administratur in aegritudinibus, non habet horam determinatam: sed quando prouocat conuenientia et necessitas ad illud, in nocte, aut die, et in omni hora, et in omni tempore.	But phlebotomy which is administered to the sick does not have a determined time; but when it provokes convenience and necessity for it, at night, or day, and at all times, and at any time.
Et non oportet, ut phlebotomentur pueri, donec ueniant super eos quatuordecim anni.	And it is not necessary that the boys should be bled until they are fourteen years old.
Neque phlebotometur mulier praegnans, nisi a mense quarto usque ad septimum.	Nor should a pregnant woman be bled until the seventh month.
Neque phlebotomentur senes, qui iam pertransierunt sexaginta annos.	Nor should old people be bled who have already passed sixty years.
Cum ergo aliquis uult phlebotomari propter quemcumque modum sit: oportet, ut mundificet intestina sua ante phlebotomiam cum clisteri leni, si in eis est stercus multum retentum: ut non attrahant uenae apud phlebotomiam ex intestinis superfluitates putridas nocentes membris principalibus.	But when anyone wishes to have phlebotomy done in any way: it is necessary that he should clean his intestines before phlebotomy with a laxative, if there is much retained dung in them: so that the blood does not attract venereal diseases from the intestinal secretions that are harmful to the main members.
Neque phlebotometur patiens toctina, id est, satietatem nauseatiuam: neque crapulatus, neque euadens ab ebrietate, donec remoueatur illud ab eis.	Nor should a patient who is constipated be bled, that is, nausea: nor intoxicated people, until they have removed the intoxication from them.
Neque infirmus cum hydropisi.	Nor a sick person with hydrophobia.
Et caueatur phlebotomia iterum post colicam passionem, et uomitum, et fluxum uentris, et multiplicationem coitus, et laboris, et exercitii, et uigiliarum, et ieiunii, et omnis quod dissoluit uirtutem ex re corporea aut animali.	And let phlebotomy be repeated after a fever, a bout of sickness, a flow of blood, an increase in sexual intercourse, labor, exercise, vigils, fasting, or any other thing that dissolves virtue from the body or from animals.
Deinde considera in subtilitate humorum ante illud, si sanguis est grossus cum cibis et potibus, et medicinis: si possibile est ei illud.	Then consider with care the humors before that, if the blood is thick with food and drinks, and medicines: if possible for him.
Deinde introeat balneum, si non prohibet ipsum aliquid: aut exercitetur aliquo exercitio, ut subtilietur sanguis.	Then apply a hot bath, if he does not prohibit it for anything: or exercise himself in some exercise, to make the blood subtilize.
Et pone phlebotomiam eius in pectore, circa tertiam diei, sicut diximus: et conare, ut euacuetur pectus eius illa die ex omnibus accidentibus animalibus malis: sicut angustia, et ira, et timor: et ex omnibus accidentibus corporeis, sicut labor, et poena, et superfluicoitus, et illis similia.	And place phlebotomy on his chest in his secret place about the third day of the week, as we have said: and consider, so that his chest is emptied of all animal evils on that day: such as anger, fear, and worry: and of all bodily evils, such as labor, pain, excesses, and similar things.
Et sedi suae faciat esse praesentes res cum quarum usu cucurrit consuetudo hominum ex aromaticitate, et odoramento, et tripudio et similibus illis per quantitatem possibilitatis.	And so that he may make those things present which are related to his habit, out of aromatic substances, and odour, and mirth, and similar things for the possibility of quantity.
Deinde sedeat phlebotomator super puluinari, quod sit altius quam puluinar phlebotomandi: postea extrahat brachium suum, et fricet ipsum phlebotomator manu sua bis, aut ter.	And then the phlebotomist will sit on top of the arm, which should be higher than the arm that is being phlebotomized: then he will take his own arm, and rub it with his hand twice, or three times.
Deinde stringat ligamentum cum corrigia, et inuoluat eam bis.	Then he will tie the ligature with a thong, and wrap it around twice.
Et sit strictura temperata, quoniam strictura quando est inaequalis, aut per superfluitatem in strictura, tunc prohibet cursum sanguinis: aut in mollificatione, tunc etiam prohibet cursum sanguinis.	And the constriction should be tempered, because the constriction is uneven, or by excess in the constriction, then it prevents the flow of blood: or in softening, then also it prevents the course of blood.
Deinde post stricturam oportet, ut fricet phlebotomandus manus suas simul adinuicem, donec inflentur uenae, et declarentur sensui.	Then after the constriction, so that he rubs his hands together in a clockwise direction, until they are red and feel warm, and reveals the sensation to the touch.
Deinde abstergat phlebotomator phlebotomum cum pauco oleo, antiquo proprie.	Then the phlebotomist will wipe off the phlebotomy with a little old oil of his own.
Deinde ponat digitum suum indicem manus sinistrae super ipsam uenam sub loco cuius phlebotomiam uult, parum: ut non fugiat uena, et cassetur percussio.	Then he will place his index finger of his left hand on the vein under the spot where he intends to perform the phlebotomy, just a little: so that the blood does not run away, and the sensation of pain is prevented.
Quoniam ex uenis est quam inuenis sicut chordam fugientem apud phlebotomiam: et ex eis est quae est plena uentositate: et quando ponis phlebotomum super eam, contrahitur sub phlebotomo, et decipitur phlebotomator, et non aperit phlebotomus uenam: et si aperit eam, est stricta: propter illud ergo oportet, ut firmetur phlebotomator, et sit sollicitus in his rebus omnibus.	Because the veins are those from which blood flows like a string when phlebotomy is performed: and they are the ones that are full of blood: and when you place the phlebotomy on it, it is squeezed under the phlebotomist, and the phlebotomist is deceived, and does not open the vein: and if he opens it, it is constricted: therefore, so that he may tighten it, and be alert in all these things,
Deinde deponat phlebotomum.	Then he will place the phlebotomy.
Si ergo aperitur uena ex uice una, tunc bonum est.	If then one vein opens from a single vein, then it is good.
Et si non, tunc itera illud uice alia sub illo loco parum, aut supra ipsum cum festinatione: si non apostematur locus.	And if not, then repeat the same vein below that place a little, or above it with some haste: if not, then the spot will not be stimulated.
Quod si apostematur, aut expauescit infirmus, tunc dimitte eum die, aut duobus diebus: et non stringat ligamentum.	That if it is stimulated, or it hurts, then release him for a day, or two days: and do not tie the ligature.
Fortasse enim attrahet apostema calidum.	The hot poultice would attract the abscess.
Neque ingrediatur balneum.	And let there be no bath.
Deinde iteret phlebotomiam, si amat.	Then let him draw blood, if he wishes it.
Quod si apertio est parua, aut currit sanguis subtiliter: et times ut non egrediatur ex sanguine quantitas quam uis: tunc itera phlebotomum in foramine ipso secundum rectitudinem, et adde in operatione parum.	If the opening is small, or the blood flows finely: and beware that you do not lose an excessive amount of blood: then repeat the phlebotomy at the same place according to the direction, and add a little to the procedure.
Et fac illud cum festinatione, antequam apostemetur locus, apostematus enim locus est in multis hominibus apud operationem paruam.	And do it with speed, before the place becomes infected: for the place will become infected in many people during a small procedure.
Si ergo uides ipsum iam apostematum, tunc non iteres super ipsum omnino, non enim excusat apud te aliquid.	But if you see that he has already been lanced, then do not touch the place at all, for you would not excuse yourself from doing anything before me.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex faece olei: quoniam alleuiat cursum sanguinis.	And put on the place some of the feces of oil: for it soothes the course of blood.
Et est melior in hoc loco quam oleum ipsum, et quam reliqua olea.	And it is better in this place than the person's own oil, and than any other oil.
Et similiter administra faecem olei in omni phlebotomia tua, qua phlebotomas uenas apud prohibitionem cursus sanguinis: et faciunt illud tyriaca alfarach, et sagzenea, quando ponitur ex una earum super locum.	And similarly administer the feces of oil in all your phlebotomies, when you phlebotomy veins at a time when the course of blood is forbidden: and they make it myrrh, and saffron, when it is put from one of them on the place.
Sanguis enim subtiliatur et resoluitur, quando est grossus.	For blood becomes finer and thinner, when it is thick.
Quod si accidat in loco phlebotomiae apostema magnum, nam multotiens accidit, praecipue ei qui non est phlebotomatus nisi uice illa, aut est apertio uenae parua, tunc propera et pone super locum spongiam infusam in aqua et sale, calefacta parumper: et stringe eam hora una: quoniam soluitur.	If it happens that there is a large abscess at the place of phlebotomy, for many times it happens, especially if he has not been phlebotomized except at this time, or if there is a small opening in the vein, then tie and put on the place a sponge Infused with water and salt, gently heated: and string it for an hour: for it will be resolved.
Et oportet, ut facias illud post exitum sanguinis ex uena ipsa, cum complemento sui, aut ex uena alia.	And you should, so that you make the thing after the departure of blood from the vein of its own, with its complement, or from another vein.
Quod si remanet in loco post dies aliquid nigredinis, aut uiriditatis, non nocet illud: et si uis, pone super ipsum aliquid aloe, aut myrrhae solutorum: aut aliquid ex succo menthastri, id est, calamenti aut simile illius.	That if there remains in the place after a few days of blackening, or viridity, it does not harm that thing: and if there is a wound, put on the place some of the oil, or dissolved myrrh: or some of the juice of mint, that is, calamus or something like it.
Et multotiens quidem accidunt apostemata et eminentiae apud phlebotomiam Basilicae.	And often too there occur ruptures and eminences at the venesection of the basilica.
Pone ergo manum tuam super ipsam, tunc si inuenis molliciem apud compressionem tuam super ipsam, tunc illa eminentia est mala.	So put your hand upon it; and then if you find it soft to the touch when you press it with your hand, then that eminence is a bad one.
Caue ergo, ut ponas super eam aliquid ex eo quod diximus.	So cause you to put something of that which we have said upon it.
Nam fortasse fluet ex ea sanguis arteriae.	For perhaps blood will flow from it of the artery.
Sed fac emplastrum ei cum eo in quo est stipticitas, ut induretur locus.	But make a plaster with it where there is a stain so that the place may heal.
Deinde cura ipsum cum reliqua curatione, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the wound with the rest of the cure until it is healed.
Et oportet, ut extrahas omni homini ex sanguine secundum quantitatem uirtutis suae.	And it is necessary so that every man should take the blood of an ox according to the quantity of its strength.
Et quod apparet ex colore uincente super sanguinem.	And that which appears from a red hue on the blood.
Nam sanguis si est niger, tunc dimitte ipsum exire, donec rubeat: et similiter si uides ipsum grossum: tunc dimitte eum, donec subtilietur: et similiter si est acutus, donec auferatur acuitas eius.	For if the blood is black, then let it not go out until it turns red; and likewise if you see it thick: then let it not go out until it thins out: and likewise if it is sharp, then let its sharpness be taken away.
Et oportet ei qui est plenus, fortis, et indiget extractione sanguinis uice una, ut amplificetur phlebotomia uenae, et sit phlebotomus latus: et in eo qui est debilis, sit econtrario illius.	And it is necessary for the one that is full, strong, and resistant to the extraction of blood by a single stroke, so that the venesection of the leg may be increased, and that the phlebotomist should stand on its side: and in the one that is weak, that it may be on the contrary.
Et oportet, ut extrahat ipsum in uicibus, et ut sit foramen strictum: et melius quod administratur in phlebotomia uenae est, ut sit transuersa sectio, non punctura.	And it is necessary so that he draws the blood out through a vein, and that there be a closed passage: and it is better if it is administered in venesection of the leg, that it be a transverse cut, not a puncture.
Et iste modus phlebotomiae est saluus a fluxu sanguinis, et ab incisione nerui: et est laudabilior, et saluior quam phlebotomia per latitudinem et longitudinem.	And this method of venesection is salutary from the flow of blood, and from the cutting of the nerve: and it is more praiseworthy, and healthier than venesection by width and length.
Et cui consueuit peruenire apud phlebotomiam syncopis, oportet ut cibes ante phlebotomiam modico pane infuso in aqua granati muzi: aut secaniabin, si est calefactus: et extrahas ei ex sanguine in tribus uicibus, aut quatuor.	And to whom it is customary to have syncope at venesection, let him eat before venesection with moderate bread in grape juice: or wine-skin if it is warm: and let blood from the three veins, or four.
Et si est infrigidatae complexionis, tunc accipiat ante phlebotomiam panem infusum in syrupo miua, aut in syrupo de melle aromatizato cum speciebus, aut in syrupo aromatizato odorifero.	If the complexion is cold, then before phlebotomy he should take food infused with honey syrup, or with a syrup infused with spices, or with a scented syrup.
Quod si accidat syncopis apud phlebotomiam, et est caussa eius exitus sanguinis multi: tunc oportet, ut sumat in potu aquam carnis, et syrupum odoriferum subtilem: et utatur aromaticitate cum algalia, et liniatur pectus eius cum ea: et utatur reliquis quae diximus in diuisione in capitulo syncopis ex euacuatione.	If syncopes occur during phlebotomy and the cause is multiple exits of blood: then he should drink a broth of meat water, and syrup with subtle odor: and apply aromatics with algarrobite, and open his chest with it: and use all the things we have mentioned in the chapter on syncopes in case of draining.
Qui autem uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo: oportet ei cuius phlebotomia est propter euacuationem multam, et uirtus eius est debilis, ut soluat sanguinem paulatim per quantitatem uirtutis in diebus continuis.	But if he wants to stop the arm from bleeding and let his blood out slowly: it is necessary for him who has phlebotomy because of a lot of drain, and his strength is weak, that he should let his blood out little by little through a quantity of strength in continuous days.
Qui uero uult euentare brachium suum, et soluere sanguinem suum secundo, et est corpus eius forte: tunc faciat illud post septem horas, aut nouem a phlebotomia sua prima.	But if he wants to stop the arm from bleeding and let his blood out for the second time, and his body is strong: then he should do it after seven or nine hours from his first phlebotomy.
Qui autem uult attrahere sanguinem ex corpore suo ad contrarium partis ad quam declinat: oportet ut euentetur ei in die secundo, aut in tertio.	But if he wants to draw blood from his body towards the opposite part to which he tilts: it is necessary for him that he stops it on the second or third day.
In cuius uero corpore est sanguis multus iam calefactus, et acuitur, et facit accidere febrem: oportet, ut egrediatur ex eo sanguis in uice una, et extrahatur ex eo quantitas multa: et amplificetur apertio usquequo accidat syncopis: postquam tu fueris conseruans omnes conditiones phlebotomiae: et ut ponas manum tuam super pulsum eius apud cursum sanguinis, ut non accidat mors loco syncopis.	In which body there is already much blood heated and it becomes acute and causes a fever to occur: it is necessary for him to let out blood in one beat, and extract a lot of quantity: and increase the opening until the syncopes occur: after you have kept all the conditions of phlebotomy: and put your hand on its pulse at the site of blood flow, so that death does not occur at the place of syncopes.
Multotiens enim accidit illud, quando ignorat phlebotomator, et cadit negligentia.	Because this often happens when the phlebotomist ignores it and falls by negligence.
Et non oportet quando uis soluere brachium, et soluere sanguinem secundo, cum iam clausum sit orificium uenae, et fiat difficilis exitus sanguinis, ut prematur super ipsum cum uehementia, et curuatum extendatur uelociter.	And it is not good when you want to stop the arm and let your blood out for the second time, while the opening of the vein is already closed, and the exit of the blood becomes difficult, so that it rushes on him with a sudden movement, and it extends quickly.
Nam illud est malum ualde, imo dimitte ipsum, donec phlebotometur secundo.	This is bad for a long time; then cut off itself, until it bleeds again.
Aut remoue cum acuitate phlebotomi illud quod coagulatum est ex sanguine in orificio uenae, et pone super ipsum aliquid salis dissoluti in aqua.	Or remove with the acuteness of phlebotomy that which has coagulated from blood in the orifice of the rectum, and put on top of it some dissolved salt in water.
Et pone super ipsum aliquid ex tyriaca alfaroch, aut sagzenea, et pone ipsum compressione leni, donec egrediatur sanguis.	And put on top of it some from the Tyrocum or the Sageene, and put the compress on gently, until the blood comes out.
Si uero iam apostemata est uena, tunc dimitte eam, et non tegas eam, donec sedetur apostema.	But if the anal opening is already wide open, then let it go, and do not squeeze it, until it closes up.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad soluendum sanguinem secundo, et non est excusatio, tunc aut phlebotoma ipsum supra illum locum, aut in brachio alio in uena alia.	That if necessity compels to the bleeding again, and there is no excuse, then either phlebotomize the person above that place, or in another arm in another anus.
Funis autem brachii phlebotomatur loco Fuscae, et Basilicae, cum non inueniuntur, et sunt occultae, quoniam est composita ex eis.	But the vein of the arm is phlebotomized at the place of the Fossa and the Basilica, if they are not found, and are hidden, because it is composed from them.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus manum suam in aqua calida, donec rubeat focile, et appareat uena manifeste.	And the quality of the phlebotomy is such that the sick person puts his hand in hot water, until it turns red, and the anus appears clearly.
Deinde stringatur super ipsam cum ligamento parum constrictione media.	Then let a slightly tight ligature be strung over it.
Deinde phlebotoma secundum transuersationem paulatim, non latitudinaliter, neque secundum longitudinem: et sit apertio ampla, et sit phlebotomia tua qua eam phlebotomas super iuncturam manus parumper.	Then let the second phlebotomy be made little by little, not acrosswise, and not along its length; and let the opening be wide enough, and your phlebotomy be such that you phlebotomize it above the incision of the hand just a little bit.
Quod si prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera manum in aqua calida, et dimitte sanguinem currere in aqua, donec consequaris necessitatem tuam.	That if the exit of the blood is stopped, then again put the hand in hot water, and let the blood run into the water, until you satisfy your need.
Si autem fueris in diebus aestatis, tunc excusaris ab iteratione manus in aqua calida.	But if you were in the days of summer, then you are excused from the repetition of putting the hand in hot water.
Et plurimum quidem ponitur cursus sanguinis in aqua calida in tempore hyemis.	And indeed the course of the blood in hot water is long in the time of winter.
Et phlebotomia huius uenae est saluior omnibus uenis, quoniam non est sub ea uena pulsatilis, neque neruus.	And this phlebotomy of this anus is healthier than all other anuses, because there is no pulsating under it, and there are no nerves.
Phlebotomia uero Saluatellae manus dextrae, est conferens aegritudinibus epatis.	Phlebotomy of the right hand of salutellae is for those with liver illness.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut stringas mahason manus cum ligamento, aut manu tua, postquam tu intromittis eam in aquam calidam, donec infletur uena, et demonsteretur sensui ualde.	And the quality of phlebotomy is such that you tie the hand with a ligature, or your own hand, after you have introduced it into warm water, until it gets red, and shows a strong sensation.
Deinde phlebotoma eam transuersando.	Then phlebotomy her while.
Et si incidis eam totaliter, non nocebit ei illud in aliquo.	And if you cut it completely, it will not hurt that one at all.
Et conserua, ne ultimes manum tuam cum phlebotomo.	And preserve, so that you do not lose your hand with phlebotomy.
Sub ea enim sunt nerui digitorum denudati ex carne.	Under it are the nerves of the fingers bare from the flesh.
Deinde itera manum ad aquam calidam, et dimitte currere sanguinem in ea.	Then repeat the hand to hot water, and let the blood run in her.
Nam si tu non iteras eam in aqua calida, coagulatur sanguis in orificio uenae, et prohibetur a cursu.	For if you do not repeat her in hot water, the blood will clot in the hole of the vein, and it is stopped from flowing.
Cum ergo extraxeris ex sanguine quantitatem necessitatis, tunc pone super uenam oleum et sal: ut non consolidetur uelociter.	But when you extract a quantity of blood as needed, then put oil and salt on the vein so that it does not congeal quickly.
Et similiter oportet, ut facias cum omni ramo stricto.	And likewise it is necessary to do the same with every tightly bound branch.
Iuuamentum uero phlebotomiae eius ex manu sinistra, est: quoniam est conferens ad aegritudines splenis: et similiter fac in phlebotomia eius, sicut fecisti in secunda aequaliter.	The grip of phlebotomy is on the left hand, for it is suitable for illnesses of the spleen; and likewise do the same with its phlebotomy as you did with the second one equally.
Saphenae autem phlebotomiae iuuamentum, est ad aegritudines quae sunt in inferiori parte corporis, sicut aegritudines matricum, et retentionem menstruorum, et infirmitates renum, et ulcera coxarum et crurium antiqua, et similia ex aegritudinibus.	The grip of phlebotomy, however, is for illnesses that are in the lower part of the body, such as those of the bladder, and retention of the monthly course, and illnesses of the kidneys and old boils and similar ailments from sickness.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut intromittat infirmus pedem suum in aquam calidam: et faciat super ipsum fricationem, donec exuberent uenae: et liga supra iuncturam pedis cum corrigia.	And the quality of phlebotomy is such that you introduce the sick foot into hot water: and make a friction on it until the vein bursts; and tie above the ligature with a bandage.
Et uenae quidem locus est apud calcaneum, apparens uersus pollicem: et ramificantur ex ea in facie pedis rami multi.	And the place of the vein is at the heel, visible towards the thumb: and many branches grow out from it on the face of the foot.
Phlebotoma ergo eam in ampliore ramo eius, aut apud calcaneum in aggregatione eius: quoniam est melius et saluius.	So phlebotomy her in a larger branch of hers, or at the heel in gathering of hers; for it is better and healthier.
Quod si phlebotomas eam in facie pedis, tunc caue a neruis qui sunt sub ea super faciem pedis.	If you make a phlebotomy on that part [of the body], then caution is needed so that the nerves underneath do not affect the face of the foot.
Et pone phlebotomiam tuam qua eam phlebotomas ex transuerso, quasi tu uelis incidere eam: et sit phlebotomus Nesil.	And place your phlebotomy where you want to make a phlebotomy from behind, so that you don't hit it: and set up the phlebotomy Nobile.
Si autem prohibetur exitus sanguinis, tunc itera pedem eius in aqua calida: et dimitte sanguinem currere in eam, donec euacuatur.	But if the exit of blood is prohibited, then wash that part of his foot with warm water: and let the blood run out of it until it empties.
Quod si errat uenam phlebotomator in prima uice, tunc iteret cum phlebotomia ad superiora parumper, nam locus est saluus, et non times ex eo maliciam, quando tu caues a neruis, sicut diximus.	That if there is a mistake with the phlebotomator in the first cut, then let it remain with phlebotomy to some extent higher, because the place is healthy, and do not fear from it evil when you caution the nerves, as we have said.
Et similiter cum Saphena pedis alterius aequaliter.	And also with the saphenous vein of the other foot evenly.
Venae autem Sciaticae locus, sicut diximus, est apud calcaneum ex latere syluestri.	But veins of the sciatic region, as we have said, are located near the heel from the outer side.
Et iuuamentum phlebotomiae eius est, ad dolorem anchae, quando est propter sanguinem calidum.	And the tension of that phlebotomy is, at the pain of the ankle, when it is due to warm blood.
Et qualitas phlebotomiae eius est, ut ingrediatur infirmus balneum, et festinet: et stringe crus eius a latere anchae usque supra calcaneum quatuor digitis, cum uitta subtili longa: non enim apparet nisi propter illud.	And the quality of that phlebotomy is, so that it enters into a weak bath, and refreshes: and tighten his leg from the ankle up to the heel with four fingers, with a long thin thread; for it does not appear unless for that.
Quando ergo apparet, tunc phlebotoma eam secundum quodcumque ingenium est tibi possibile, aut secundum transuersionem: et est melius, aut ut incidas eam incisione, aut seces eam sectione.	When it does appear, then make the phlebotomy for you as possible according to your art, or according to the transection: and it is better, or as if you hit it with an incision, or cut it off with a section.
Locus enim eius est saluior, et ipsa est in pluribus hominibus occulta ualde.	For that part of his body is healthier, and it itself is very hidden by many people.
Quod si non inuenis eam, et non apparet sensui omnino: tunc phlebotoma aliquem ramum eius, et est ille qui apparet in dorso pedis, et uersus auricularem: et caue a neruis, et fac currere ex sanguine quantitatem quam uis.	That if you do not make it known by sense at all: then phlebotomize some of his ramus, and that is what appears on the back of the foot, and towards the earlobe: and caution the nerves, and let a quantity of blood run out as much as you want.
Deinde solue stricturam, et pone super locum phlebotomiae corium, et stringe locum.	Then tie it tightly, and put it on the part where you made the phlebotomy, and tighten the place.
Uelociter enim sanatur.	He heals quickly.
¶ De Ventosatione, et qualitate usus eius.	On ventilation, and on the quality of use thereof.
Caput XCVIII.	Chapter LXVIII.
Uentosae fiunt ex cornibus, et ex aere, et ex uitro.	Vents are made from horns, and from brass, and from iron.
Et Ventosatio quidem fit secundum duos modos.	And ventilation is made in two ways.
Cum scarificatione, et extractione sanguinis: et alter est uentosatio sine scarificatione.	When there is scarification and extraction of blood, and another kind of ventilation is without scarification.
Et haec Ventosatio quae est sine scarificatione, est secundum duos modos.	And this type of ventilation without scarification has two ways.
Aut enim est cum igne.	For it is with fire.
Aut est absque igne.	Or is without fire.
Et uentosis quae administrantur cum scarificatione et extractione sanguinis sunt quatuordecim loca corporis.	And the ventilations that are given with scarification and extraction of blood are four-and-twenty parts of the body.
Quorum unus est, Ventosatio Alnocrati, et est postremum capitis: et Alkehel, et est medium colli: et uentosae Alhagdahim, et sunt duae laminae colli a duabus partibus simul: et uentosae menti, et est sub mandibula in inferiori oris: et uentosae duarum spatularum: et uentosae Alachosos super finem caudae: et uentosae duorum focilium, et sunt medium duorum brachiorum: et uentosae duorum crurium: et uentosae duarum cauillarum.	Of these four-and-twenty parts of the body, one is the Ventosatio Alnocrati, and it is last of the head: and Alkehel, and that is middle of the neck: and the vents of Alhagdahim, and they are two laminae of the neck from both sides together: and the vent of the mind, and it is under the mandible at the bottom of the mouth: and the vents of the two spatulas: and the vents of the two claws: and the vents of the two cheeks.
Et Ventosatio quidem non extrahit sanguinem tibi ex uenis minutis sparsis in carne, et propter illud non cadit uirtus ex eis, sicut est casus eius ex phlebotomia.	And this type of ventilation does not draw blood from small veins scattered in the flesh, and because of that its strength does not drop out of them, as is the case with phlebotomy.
Neque oportet, ut administretur uentosatio siue cum igne, aut absque igne in aliqua aegritudinum quae fiunt ex repletione, donec euacuetur totum corpus.	And it should not be administered that ventilation whether with fire or without fire in any disease that is caused by accumulation until the whole body has been drained.
Quod si necessitas prouocat ad Ventosationem ex aegritudine, aut propter consuetudinem, administramus eam in omni hora in principio mensis, in fine eius, et in medio ipsius, et in quocumque tempore fuerit.	If necessity requires ventilation because of a disease, or for the habit, we shall administer it at any hour at the beginning of the month, at the end of it, and at its mid-point, and at any other time.
Quod est, quia ex hominibus est qui quando multiplicatur in eo sanguis, donec indiget extractione eius per uentosationem, inuenit in capite suo grauedinem, et sodahan.	That is to say, because there is a man who, when blood accumulates within him, finds relief only through ventilation, and he has a gray hair, and he sweats.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit repletionem et rubedinem in facie sua, capite suo, et collo suo.	And from them comes the swelling and redness on his face, head, and neck.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit pruritum in facie sua, et fronte sua, et tenebrositatem, et hebetudinem in oculis suis.	And from them comes the itching in his face, forehead, darkness, and dullness in his eyes.
Et ex eis est qui scalpit locum uentosationis suae.	And from them comes the place of his wound.
Et ex eis est cuius risus multiplicatur.	And from them comes who has many laughs.
Et ex eis est qui inuenit gustum sanguinis in ore suo: aut apostematur lingua, et expuit sanguinem.	And from them comes who has a taste of blood in his mouth: or he spits it out with his tongue, and spits up the blood.
Et ex eis est cuius somnus multiplicatur.	And from them comes who has many dreams.
Et ex eis est qui uidet in somno suo sanguinem et rubedinem, et interfectos, et plagas, et quae sunt similia illis.	And from them comes who sees in his sleep blood and redness, and those slain, and plagues, and things similar to them.
Quando ergo uidemus aliquid ex illis, et proprie si est in tertia media mensis: praecipimus tunc uentosationem fieri, postquam praeterierunt de die duae horae, aut tres.	When then do we see anything from them, and especially if it is in the third month of the year: then do we make the wound heal, after having let pass two hours of the day, or three.
Iuuamentum autem Ventosationis nuchae, est: quoniam ipsa confert ad grauitatem in capite, et quod effunditur ad oculos.	The treatment for the wound on the neck is this: for it brings with it a burden in the head, and because it drips down to the eyes.
At uero oportet, ut sit illud post euacuationem totius corporis.	But it should be after the whole body has been emptied.
Et haec quidem Ventosa est loco phlebotomiae Cephalicae.	And this is called a local phlebotomy on the head.
Et non licet, ut utatur ea qui est frigidae complexionis, aut in quo est catarrus.	And it should not be used by one who has a cold complexions, or in whom there is catarrh.
Nam infert ei nocumentum magnum.	For it brings about a great injury.
Et propter illud non oportet, ut utantur ea senes, et in cuius capite sunt aegritudines frigidae.	And for this reason, those who are elderly should not use it, and in whose head there are cold diseases.
Qui autem super eam fit assiduus, generatur super eum obliuio.	But whoever uses it with diligence, forgetfulness comes over him.
Et propter illud oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut deponat manum suam cum uentosa parumper ad inferiora, timendo ex generatione obliuionis.	And for this reason you should order the wind-sucker to lay his hand with the wind blowing slightly towards the lower part, fearing the generation of forgetfulness.
Ventosatio aut Alkehel, est loco phlebotomiae Fuscae, et phlebotomiae Basilicae, et propter illud confert asmati, et constrictioni anhelitus, et fissurae instrumenti anhelitus, et tussi, et repletioni.	Ventosation, or alcohol, is a local phlebotomy on the purple color, and also on the blue color, and because of it brings about sneezing, constriction of the windpipe, and the裂开（裂开） instrument of constriction, and coughing, and swelling.
Et oportet, ut impellatur Ventosa Alkehel parumper, quoniam si ponitur inferius, generat debilitatem in corde, et stomacho.	It is necessary that Ventosa Alchehel be driven forth a little further, because if it is put below, it generates weakness in the heart and the stomach.
Ventosatio uero alhagdahim, confert doloribus accidentibus in capite, et obtalmiae, et hemigraneae, et perforationi, et dolori in radicibus dentium: et est loco phlebotomiae Basilicae.	Ventosation however has a cure for the accidents of headaches and eyes and hemicrania and perforations and pain in the roots of the teeth; and is a place for phlebotomy.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne premat manum suam cum scarificatione: ut non incidat arteriam, et accidat fluxus sanguinis.	And you should order the Ventosator not to put his hand on the scarification: so that he does not cut an artery and a flow of blood occurs.
Ventosatio autem sub mento, confert alcolae in ore, et corruptioni gingiuae, et similibus eis ex aegritudinibus quae sunt in ore: et stat loco phlebotomiae alieherich, quae sunt in duobus labiis.	But if it is under the chin, it brings about alcohol in the mouth and corruption of the gums and similar diseases that are in the mouth; and stands in place of phlebotomy for Alieherich, which are in the two lips.
Ventosatio autem spatularum, confert ad alchafacham, quae fit ex replexione, et caliditate.	But if it is a spatulum, it has a cure for alchafacham, which is caused by a rebound and heat.
Ventosatio uero interiorum partium duorum focilium, confert iuuamentum phlebotomiae uenarum trium, Basilicae, et Fuscae, et Cephalicae: quoniam ipsa attrahit sanguinem ex omnibus illis uenis minutis, quae sunt in carne: et attrahunt illae uenae minutae ex uenis aliis grossioribus eis, donec peruenit attractio ad uenas tres.	But if it is an internal part of the body, it has a cure for phlebotomy of three veins, Basilica, Fusca and Cephalica: because it itself draws blood from all the small veins in the flesh; and these small veins draw the blood from other larger veins until the attraction reaches the three veins.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ne multum procedat in scarificatione: quoniam locus est denudatus carne, et sub eo sunt nerui et arteriae.	And you should order the Ventosator not to make a lot of scratches: because it is a bare place of flesh, and under it are nerves and arteries.
Ventosa autem quae uentosatur super alchausos, confert hemorroidibus Ani, et ulceribus inferioribus.	But if the Ventosation is done on top of alchausos, it brings about hemorrhoids in the Anus and ulcers from below.
Et oportet, ut praecipias Ventosatori, ut sit uentosa magna, et ut sit ex aere: quoniam locus indiget suctione forti, et fortasse franguntur Ventosae subtiles: et scarificetur scarificatione magna.	And you should order the Ventosator so that there is a great Wind and that it is made of iron: because the place does not admit to strong suction, and perhaps the fine ones are broken by the Wind; and the large scarification is made.
Ventosae autem crurium minuunt diminutione manifesta: quoniam attrahunt sanguinem ex toto corpore, et conferunt doloribus antiquis in renibus, et matricibus, et uesica: prouocant menstrua, et conferunt bothor, et ademenul: et stant loco phlebotomiae duarum saphenarum, et alhorcobeni.	But the fine Wind diminishes with a clear appearance: because it draws blood from all the body and brings about old pains in the kidneys and bladders and urinary bladder; causing menses and colic and heat; and stands in place of phlebotomy of two veins, and alhorcobeni.
Verumtamen debilitant corpus multum, et faciunt accidere syncopim in pluribus hominibus.	Indeed, the body becomes very weak, and causes fainting in many people.
Et Ventosarum alhorcobeni iuuamentum est propinquum iuuamento Ventosarum duorum crurium.	And the treatment of the two cracks of the wind is close to the treatment of the wind.
Qualitas positionis Ventosarum est, ut ponas uentosam in primis uacuam, et sugas suctione temperata: et non prolonges positionem uentosarum, sed pone eas uelociter, et remoue eas uelociter, ut ueniant humores ad locum aduentu aequali: et non cesses iterare illud et continuare, donec uideas locum iam rubere et inflari, et appareat rubedo sanguinis: tunc ergo scarifica, et itera suctione paulatim.	The quality of the position of the winds is that you should place the wind in the first place empty, and moisten with moderate suction: and do not continue the position of the wind, but put them quickly, and shake them quickly so that the humors come to a place of arrival equal: and do not cease to repeat that and continue, until you see the place already red and swollen, and appears the redness of blood: then therefore scrape, and repeat suction slowly.
Deinde considera in dispositione corporum.	Then consider in the disposition of the bodies.
Nam qui ex hominibus est tenerae carnis, rarorum pororum, oportet ut scarifices ipsum semel, non plus: ut non ulceretur locus.	For he who is among men with tender flesh, rare pores, should cut himself once, not more: so that the place does not ulcerate.
Et praecipe Ventosatori, ut amplificet scarificationem, et profundet parum: et temperet suctionem in facilitate, et uelocitate, et motu suaui.	And instruct the wind-starter so that he amplify the scraping and dig a little: and moderate suction in convenience, and quickly, and movement of his own.
Quod si in sanguine est grossitudo, tunc oportet, ut scarifices ipsum bis.	That if there is grossness in the blood, then you should cut yourself twice.
In uice quidem prima aperitur uia subtiliationi sanguinis, et aquositati eius: et in secunda quidem perscrutationi exquisitae extractionis sanguinis grossi.	In fact the first opening of the subtlety of blood, and its moistening: and in the second perscrutation of the exquisite extraction of thick blood.
Si uero sanguis est faeculentus ualde, tunc fiat scarificatio uice tertia: ut consequatur ultimum.	If, however, the blood is fecund very much, then let the scraping be done for the third time: so that the last result is obtained.
Et ad ultimum, quando uolumus extrahere sanguinem paulatim, uel parumper, sufficit nobis scarificatio una.	And to the last, when we want to extract blood slowly, slightly, one scraping is sufficient for us.
Quod si uolumus extractionem sanguinis multi, scarificamus scarificatione plurima.	That if we want multiple extractions of blood, then we scrape with multiple scratchings.
Et si nos mensuramus, quod sanguis est grossus: tunc oportet, ut scarificetur scarificatione profunda: et terminus aequalis in scarificatione, est profunditas cutis.	And if we measure that the blood is thick: then it is necessary that scraping be done with a deep scratching: and an equal end in the scratching, is the depth of the skin.
¶ Quid sit illud quod oportet administrari ex oleis apud positionem Ventosarum, et quid caueat uentosandus.	What is that which should be administered from oils at the position of the wind, and what does the wind-starter caution?
IN illo quidem cuius cutis est grossa, dura, fusca, et pori eius sunt stricti, oportet ut ungantur loca Ventosare cum oleis apertiuis, lenitiuis, resolutiuis: si est in tempore aestatis, sicut est oleum alkeiri, aut oleum uiolatum, aut oleum de amigdalis dulcibus, aut oleum de semine cucurbitae.	In that, indeed, whose skin is thick, tough, dark, and whose pores are tight, it is necessary that the places be anointed with open, soothing, and resolving oils: if it is in the time of summer, such as is the oil of several, or olive oil, or almond oil, or oil from sweet almonds, or oil from pumpkin seed.
Et si est in tempore hyemis, tunc oleum narcissinum, aut oleum de lilio, aut oleum camomellinum, aut sarbatinum: et eis similia.	And if it is in the time of winter, then oil of narcissus, or of lily, or of chamomile, or gin: and similar ones.
Si uero superfluitas est grossa, frigida: tunc oleum sit amaracinum, aut oleum de balsamita aut oleum alben, aut oleum anetinum: et eis similia.	If, however, there is a lot of superfluity, cold: then oil of wormwood, or of balm, or of almond, or of annatto, or of saffron: and similar ones.
Si uero uentosandus est amplorum pororum, tenerae carnis: tunc oportet, ut prohibeatur ab oleo, et oportet ut isti abluant loca Ventosarum earum post uentosationem cum aqua rosata, aut cum aqua frigida, aut cum aqua solatri, aut cum aqua cucurbitae, aut cum aqua portulacae: et similibus eis.	If, however, it is ventous, with open pores, and tender flesh: then it is necessary that oil be forbidden to it, and these places should be washed after fanning with rose water, or cold water, or water of amaranth, or water of pumpkin, or water of portulaca: and similar ones.
Ille autem cuius sanguis est multae humiditatis, abluat uentosas cum aceto, aut cum aqua myrti, et sumach: et similibus eis.	But he whose blood is very humid should wash the ventose places with vinegar, or with myrtle water, and sumach: and similar ones.Et si superfluitas est in pedibus, in calcis, aut in uiris: tunc oportet ut superius locos mictis urini et moco, et similes suis; et quod superius mictur
Cuius autem superfluitates sunt grossae, abluat uentosas suas cum uino antiquo, aut cum aqua samsuci, aut decoctione aneti, aut camomillae: et eis similibus.	And if there is a lot of superfluity in the feet, in the shoes, or in the feet: then the ventose places should be washed with old wine, or with water of samsou, or with decoction of anet, or of chamomile: and similar ones.Et si superfluitates sunt in capite uiri, aut in labibus: tunc oportet ut superius mictur urina et moco, et quod superius sint alii similes; et quod
Et oportet, ut caueatur uentosatio in balneo, aut in uestigio balnei, imo oportet, ut administretur post exitum ex balneo per horam, aut per horas duas.	And it is necessary that the fanning be done in a bath, or in a bathhouse; and it should be administered after leaving the bath for an hour, or two hours.Et si superfluitates sunt in uiris: tunc oportet, ut mictur urina et moco, et quod mictur non sit prope uiris sed per horam, aut per horas duas; et quod
Et non oportet, ut dormiat aliquis post uentosationem.	And it is not fit that any should sleep after dressing.
¶ Quid est quo oportet ut regatur Ventosandus, aut Phlebotomatus ante uentosationem.	What is the need for one to be bandaged or bled before dressing?
ET post eam oportet, ut consideres in primis: tunc si Ventosatus, aut Phlebotomatus sit cholericus, et uincunt super sanguinem eius acuitas et inflammatio: tunc oportet, ut accipiat infrigidantia, sicut granatum muzum: et etiam endiuiam cum aceto et lactuca, et secaniabin, et iuleb: et eis similia.	And after that, you should consider first of all: if the person is jaundiced and their blood is thick, then their sharpness and inflammation will be due to a lack of cooling, like granatum muzum: also dill with vinegar and lettuce, and secaniabin, and juleb: and similar things.
Et pone cibaria eius pullos, et carnes ouium sekebiget, et cibos conditos cum agresta: et eis similia.	And put on his food porridge, and meat that is sour, and cooked foods with apples: and similar things.
Et cuius complexio est frigida, oportet ut sumat in potu syrupum de melle, aut de almiua, aut alsecaniabin de seminibus factum: et sumat uinum odoriferum medium, quod est inter uetus et nouum: et praecipiatur, ut utatur paucitate cibi.	And if his complexio is cold, he should take syrup of honey, or of almond, or alsecaniabin made from seeds: and he should drink medium-strong wine, which is between new and old: and let him be instructed to eat a little food.
Et pone cibum eius pullos, et canebir: et passeres, id est, paruas aues: et pullos columborum issiadebet.	And put on his food porridge, and hempseed, and paschal eggs, that is to say, many birds: and let him eat pigeon loaves.
Et oportet, ut potus die uentosationis et phlebotomiae plus sit quam cibus: et oportet, ut detur in potu in quibusdam hominibus in horis tyriaca alfaroch, aut medicamen de musco, id est, muscata, aut alesselithe ante uentosationem: et ante phlebotomiam, aut post: ut confortentur membra principalia, et subtilietur sanguis.	And it is necessary that the drink of dressing and phlebotomy be more than the food, and that it be given in wine to some men in Horica tyeroca or a remedy made from musk, that is to say, muscata, or alesselithe before dressing: and before phlebotomy, or after: so as to strengthen the main muscles, and refine the blood.
Et non oportet, ut sumant eam in potu calefacto.	And it is not fit that they drink it warm in hot wine.
¶ De Ventosis sine scarificatione.	Of dressing without scraping.
Uentosae autem quae sunt sine scarificatione, sunt Ventosae quae ponuntur super epar, et splenem, et podagram, et super uentrem, umbilicum, et loca renum, et pixidem anchae: quoniam ista membra non sufferunt scarificationem super se.	Dressings that are without scraping are dressings that are put on top of the liver, and the spleen, and the podagram, and over the navel, and places of the testicles, and the pixie anchae: because these limbs do not suffer from scraping on themselves.
Et non quaeritur per eas, nisi aut attactio ex membro sanguinis ad membrum: sicut ponimus Ventosam super mammillas in aegritudine fluxus sanguinis narium.	And it is not asked for them, unless there is an outbreak from a member of blood to the limb: as we put dressing on the breasts in the sickness of blood flow from the nose.
Et utimur eis, ut soluamus a membro uentositatem frigidam inuiscatam in membro: sicut ponimus uentosam super uentrem, et umbilicum.	And we use them so that we can heal a cold, sore member in the limb: as we put air on top of the bowels, and the navel.
Ipsa enim rarificat membrum, et calefacit ipsum, et remouet dolorem propterea, quia resoluit illam uentositatem.	For it itself tightens up the member, and warms it, and removes the pain because it has healed that cold sore.
Etiam ponitur super renes, quando accidit in eis opilatio, aut lapis.	Also, we put air on the kidneys when there is an accumulation of dung or stone.
Uirtute enim attractionis suae fortasse aperit opilationem, aut eradicat lapidem ex loco suo.	For with his own power it may well open up a discharge, or remove a stone from its place.
Et similiter facit quando ponitur super epar, et splenem apud uentositatem terendam in eis utrisque.	And also when it is put on the liver, and the spleen when there is a cold sore in either of them.
Et istae Ventosae administrantur uacuae cum sectione tantum.	And these Wind-sores are dealt with by means of a cut only.
Et quandoque administrantur cum igne.	And sometimes they are dealt with by fire.
Et quandoque administrantur plenae aqua tepida in aegritudinibus pleuresis: et illud est, ut impleatur Ventosa, et sit magna, aqua calida sola, aut aqua in qua decoctae sint herbae quae conueniunt.	And sometimes they are given with warm water when there is a pleural illness; and that is, so as to fill the Wind- sore with warm water, or water in which have been boiled herbs suitable for the purpose.
¶ Forma Ventosae administratae cum igne.	The form of the Wind-sores dealt with by fire.
Sit amplitudo orificii eius duorum digitorum apertorum, secundum quod formauimus: et quantitas eius in profundo sit medietas palmi: et sit in latere eius in loco qui est circiter medium eius, foramen paruum, secundum quantitatem quod ingrediatur ipsum acus: fiat ex aere simul, aut citrino, grossorum marginum, lenium, aequalium, tersorum: ut non laedat membrum apud positionem suam super ipsum: et sit in medio eius uirga transuersa ex aere, aut ferro, ubi ponitur candela cum igne.	Let the width of its opening be two fingers wide, according to the shape we have made; and let the quantity of it in the depth be half the palm: and let it be in the back of its place which is about the middle of it, a little hole, according to the quantity that is put into it: let there be also made, of copper, brass, or iron, an equal rod across it, so as not to hurt the limb at its position over it; and let there be in the midst of it a wire of copper, or iron, through which a candle with fire is held.
Et iam fit haec uentosa magna, maior ea quam narrauimus, et parum minor illa, secundum aegritudines et aetatem eius qui utitur.	And this great Wind-sore may also be made, larger than we have described, and a smaller one, according to the illness and age of him who uses it.
Ventosae enim puerorum, et extenuatorum sunt aliae, quam uentosae uirorum, et grossorum corporum.	For the Wind-sores are different in boys, and in those who are weak, from those in men, and in those who have large bodies.
Qualitas autem ponendi hanc uentosam cum igne super membrum, est, ut accendas licinium cum igne ex lino decenter, aut candelam paruam ex caera: et pone eam super medium uirgae transuersae quae est in medio uentosae: ut sit accensus ignis circiter inferiorem partem uentosae, ut non comburatur corpus infirmi.	The quality of this wind-sucking application with fire on the arm, that is, to light a flax candle or a small candle with a wick; and put it in the middle of the wound above the skin, so that the fire surrounds the lower part of the wound, so that the body does not burn.
Deinde ponatur super membrum: et digitus sit super foramen quod dixi, donec quando tenemus uentosam: dum indigemus, auferamus digitum, et egredietur uapor super illud foramen, et soluetur uentosa statim.	Then place it on the arm, and let the finger be placed over the hole that I have said, until we hold it in place: while we hold it, remove the finger, and the vapor will come out of that hole immediately and the wound will open.
Deinde igni licinium secundum modum suum, et itera eam, si indiges illa.	Then light the flax again in the same way, and repeat it if you want to.
In Ventosa autem quae administratur in aegritudine pleuresis cum aqua, non est uirga transuersa, neque foramen: et non administratur, nisi quia impletur aqua, et ponitur super membrum tantum.	But in the wound that is applied to pneumonia with water, there is no cross-section and no hole; it is only filled with water and placed on the arm.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Et haec Ventosa quanto plus est magna, ut capiat aquam multam, est melior.	And this wound, the more it is big, so that it takes a lot of water, is better.
¶ De suspensione Sanguisugarum.	In suspension of blood sugar.
Caput XCIX.	Chapter LXIX.
Sanguisugae non administrantur in pluribus, nisi in quibus membris non est possibilis positio uentosarum, propter paruitatem eorum, sicut labium, et gingiua, et eis similia.	Sanguine sugar are not applied to many members, unless the position of the wound allows it, due to its smallness, such as the lip and the gums, and similar ones.
Aut in membro denudato a carne, sicut digitus, et nasus, et eis similia.	Or on a naked member, stripped of flesh, such as a finger, or a nose, and like them.
Et qualitas utendi eis est: ut ueneris ex Sanguisugis quae sunt in aquis dulcibus, mundis a putredinibus.	And the quality to be used is this: to come from blood sugar that are in sweet water, cleaned from putrefactions.
Deinde dimittantur die et nocte in aqua dulci, donec famelicae sint, et non remaneat in uentre earum aliquid.	Then they are left to rest in sweet water during the day and night, until they become thirsty, and nothing remains in their stomachs.
Deinde euacuetur corpus in primis cum phlebotomia, et cum uentosis.	Then the body is emptied in the first place with phlebotomy, and with wind-sucking.
Deinde absterge membrum infirmi, donec rubeat.	Then wash the wound with water, until it turns red.
Postea ponantur super ipsum.	Then put on them.
Cum ergo implentur, et cadunt, et est possibilis suctio loci cum uentosa, tunc est magis ultimum in iuuamento: et si non, tunc ablue locum cum aceto.	When they are filled, and fall down, and it is possible to suck the place with wind-sucking, then it is more effective in healing: and if not, then wash the place with vinegar.
Deinde cum aqua multa, et fricetur, et exprimatur.	Then, with much water, and knead, and squeeze.
Quod si prolongatur cursus sanguinis post casum Sanguisugarum, et est illud resudando: tunc infunde pannum lini in aqua frigida, et pone ipsum desuper, donec abscindatur resudatio.	If the course of blood is prolonged after the loss of blood and it remains bloody: then pour a cloth made of linen into cold water, and place it on top until the blood clot is removed.
Quod si multiplicatur sanguis, tunc pulueriza super ipsum zegi tritum, aut gallas, et similia eis ex stipticis: donec abscindatur sanguis.	If the blood increases, then sprinkle powder on top of it made of dried blood, or eggshells, and things like that from astringent: until the blood is cut off.
Aut ponantur super locum medietates fabarum excorticatarum: et dimittantur, donec adhaereant fabae in loco, nam sanguis abscinditur.	Or they place on top of the place half of the ground up bark of oak tree: and they leave it, until the acorn sticks to the place, for the blood is cut off.
Et oportet si necessaria est iteratio Sanguisugarum, quando est possibile, mutare eas.	And it should be that if the need requires a repeat of the bloodletting, when possible, change them.
Si autem prohibentur Sanguisugae a suspensione, tunc abstergatur locus cum sanguine recenti.	If, however, they prohibit bloodletting by suspension, then clean the place with fresh blood.
Aut fige acum in locis, donec egrediatur aliquid ex sanguine.	Or tie them up now in places, until someone leaves.
Deinde ponantur, nam ipsae quando sentiunt aliquid ex sanguine, adhaerent statim.	Then they are placed on, for when they feel some of the blood, they stick immediately.
Quando ergo uis ut cadant, pulueriza super eas aliquid ex aloe trito, aut salem, aut cinerem: et cadent statim.	When, however, you want them to fall down, sprinkle on top of them some dried aloe, or salt, or ash: and they fall down immediately.

¶ Sermo uniuersalis de restauratione, et dislocatione, et curatione torsionis, et similibus.	Section on general principles of restoration, dislocation, treatment of twists, and similar conditions.
Caput I.	Head I:
Hoc Capitulum etiam multotiens est necessarium in arte Medicinae, et est restauratio fracturae, et dislocationis accidentium in ossibus.	This chapter is also often needed in the art of medicine, and it is restoration of a fracture, and dislocation of accidents in bones.
Scitote o Filii, quia iactant se de hoc Capitulo stolidi medicorum et uulgi, et qui non inspexerunt unquam antiquorum librum, neque legerunt ex eo literam.	Know ye, O sons, that this chapter is for the most part lost to the medical men who are dull-witted and of the herd, and who have never examined the old book, nor read a letter from it.
Et propter hanc caussam fit, quod iste modus ex scientiis in terra nostra est priuatus.	And for this reason it has come to pass, that this mode is secret among us.
Et ego non obuiaui in eo unquam bono omnino, et non adeptus sum ex eo illud, quod sum adeptus nisi propter longitudinem lectionis librorum antiquorum, et studium super intellectum eorum, donec extraxi scientiam illius ex eis.	And I was not occupied with it at all, and I was not qualified in it unless because of the length of reading of the old books, and study over their understanding, until I drew out the science from them.
Deinde adhaesi experimento et studio longitudine uitae meae.	Then, by experimentation and study, I measured the length of my scar.
Et iam descripsi uobis ex illo in hoc Capitulo totum quod continet scientia mea: et super quod praeteriit experimentum meum, postquam abbreuiaui illud uobis, et liberaui illud ex occupatione elongationis, et abbreuiaui illud fine abbreuiationis, et ostendi illud fine declinationis: et formaui in eo formas multas ex formis instrumentorum quae administrantur in eo, cum sit ex additione declinationis, sicut feci in duobus Capitulis praecedentibus.	Then, I will describe to you from that in this chapter all of my knowledge: and, regarding what was the experiment of mine, after I had abridged it for you, and released it from the occupation of elongation, and abridged it by its end of abbreviation, and showed it by its end of decline: and I formed in it many forms from forms of instruments that are administered in it, because it is from the addition of decline, as I did in two previous chapters.
¶ Summae, et collectiones ex esse fracturae ossium, ex eis quarum praemissio necessaria est, antequam incipiamus rememorationem membrorum fractorum, et diuersorum, si uniuscuiusque.	Now, and from the fracture of bones, from which it is necessary to begin the re-membering of broken limbs, and diverse, if of each one.
Caput II.	Chapter II.
Oportet, ut dicamus in prologo huius Capituli, summas sermonis, et capitula, ad quarum intellectum cogitur in primis artifex ad stationem super earum ueritatem: scilicet ut uos, et qui sunt prompti, sciant, uel addiscant hanc artem nobilem, et alii a uobis.	It is necessary, that we say in the prolog of this chapter, that summa of discourse and chapters, to which an understanding is considered at first by the artist on the veracity: that is, so that you, and who are ready, know or learn this noble art, and others from you.
Dico, ergo, quod quando accidit alicui fractura, aut dislocatio, aut torsio, aut casus: tunc oportet, ut properes in primis ad phlebotomandum eum, et soluendum ipsum, aut utraque simul: si non prohibeat aliquid, sicut debilitas uirtutis: aut est ille cui accidit aliquid ex illis puer, aut senex decrepitus: aut est tempus uehementis caloris, aut uehementis frigoris ualde.	I say, then, that when it happens to someone that there is a fracture, or dislocation, or twist, or a fall: then you should properly, first of all, prepare to phlebotomize him, and solve the wound, or both at the same time: if not forbidden by anything, such as the weakness of virtue: or he is that boy who has something from those things: or he is an old man of senility: or it is a time of great heat, or great cold.
Deinde sit contentus in cibo suo, oleribus frigidis, et carnibus auium, et haedorum: et prohibe uinum, et carnes grossas, et repleri ex cibis et omni cibo qui replet uenas sanguine.	Then, be satisfied with your food, cold drinks, and feathers, and hair: and forbid wine, and fatty meats, and what fills the belly with blood.
Donec quando securus sis ex apostemate calido, et non times effusionem materiei ad membrum: tunc redeat infirmus ad regimen suum primum cum quo cucurrit consuetudo eius.	Until you are secure from heat of apoplexy, and do not wait for the flow of matter to a limb: then return the sick to their usual customs with which he runs.
Cum ergo incipit os fractum restaurari, tunc oportet, ut cibetur infirmus cibis nutrientibus nutrimento multo, grosso, graui, in quibus sit uiscositas: sicut cibaria facta ex tritico cocto cum aqua, et rizum, et capita, et pedes, et uentres uaccarum, et oua, et pisces recentes: et uinum grossum, et similia illis.	When the mouth is broken, then it is necessary that the sick person be fed with food rich in nutrients, thick, brown, and full of flavor: just as food made from wheat cooked with water, and rice, and heads and feet and entrails of fowl, and eggs and fish that are fresh: and strong wine, and similar things.
Cum hoc enim regimine fit coagulatio fracturae uelocius, et melius.	For with this regimen the healing of a fracture takes place more quickly and better.
Et scias, quod ossa fracta, quando sunt in uiris qui sunt in prima senectute, et decrepitis, non est possibile, ut continuentur et consolidentur secundum naturam suam semper, propter exiccationem membrorum eorum: et consolidantur et continuantur quae ex eis sunt in fine lenitatis, sicut ossa puerornm paruorum.	And know that bones which are broken, when they are in the hands of a man who is in the first age of old age and decay, cannot continue nor consolidate themselves according to their nature always, by reason of the drying up of the limbs of them: but they consolidate themselves and continue such as they are at the end of lightness, like the bones of young boys' small arms.
Verumtamen natura annectit super os fractum ex omni parte aliquid simile glutino, in quo est grossitudo, quo adhaeret et stringit ipsum, donec conglutinantur adinuicem, et ligantur adinuicem, donec uenit in fine fortitudinis et firmitudinis, sicut fuit in primis, donec non prohibet ipsum aliquid ab operationibus suis: et propter hanc caussam est necesse, ut ponas nutrimentum infirmi cibaria, in quibus sunt grauitas, et uiscositas, et grossitudo, sicut diximus.	However, nature adds something to the broken bone from every part a little glue, in which there is thickness, by which it clings and binds itself, until it is joined together, and bound together, until it comes to the end of strength and firmness, as it was at first, until it does not prevent its operations: and for this reason it is necessary that you put nutriment on the sick food, in which there are thickness, and flavor, and thickness, as we have said.
Et scias, quod fracturae species sunt diuersae, secundum diuersitatem membrorum: quoniam fractura cruris, est diuersa a fractura ossis capitis: et fractura ossis pectoris, est diuersa a fractura ossis dorsi: et similiter reliqua membra omnia diuersa existunt adinuicem: et ego ueni cum rememoratione omnis speciei fracturae expositae in Capitulo suo distinctae ab alia.	And know that the species of fractures are various, according to the diversity of the limbs: for a fracture of the leg is different from a fracture of the skull, and a fracture of the breastbone is different from a fracture of the spine, and likewise each limb has all its parts very different: and I come with a reminder of every kind of fracture exposed in its own chapter, distinct from the other.
Et diuersificantur species fracturae ossis etiam in seipsa.	And the species of fractures of bones also differ in themselves.
Quoniam fit fractura eius arcuata, praeter quod accidant in ea astellae.	For a fracture is made by an arc, except that they happen in a star.
Et quandoque fit fractura eius secundum longitudinem ossis: et sunt fracturae eius satagiae, id est, astellae, et additiones procedentes, sicut sunt in calamo, cum aptatur cultello ad scribendum.	And when a fracture is made according to the length of the bone: and there are fractures of his stagium, that is, stars, and additions coming from, as there are in the stem, when it is caught by a knife for writing.
Et non procedentes: et est fractura cum uulnere et disruptione in capite: et est fractura fissura parua.	And do not proceed: and is fracture with ulna and disruption in the head: and is fracture small crack.
Et omni speciei est ingenium, uel instrumentum proprium in restauratione eius, secundum quod ueniet rememoratio eius, distincta in locis suis.	And all kinds of people are skilled, or their own instrument in restoring him, according to what will come to his memory, distinguished in their places.
Et ex eo quo cognoscitur fractura ossis, est tortuositas eius, et ipsius eminentia: et apparitio eius sensui, et sonitus eius quando comprimis ipsum manu tua.	And from this it is known that the break in the bone, its curvature and eminence: and its appearance to the sense, and its sound when you press it with your hand.
Quando ergo non est in loco tortuositas apparens, neque sonitus apud tactum tuum cum tangis os cum agitatione, neque inuenit infirmus magnum dolorem: tunc non est illic fractura, imo possibile est, ut sit tortuositas, aut fissura parua: non ergo oportet, ut moueas ipsum cum manu et compressione omnino, imo pone super ipsum ex medicinis, quarum uenit rememoratio, post momentum illud quod conuenit loco: deinde stringatur strictura subtili.	So when there is no apparent curvature in the place, and no sound at your touch when you press the bone with agitation, and it does not cause great pain: then it is not a fracture, but possible that there is a curvature or a small crack: so it is not necessary to move it with your hand and squeeze it all, but rather put something from the doctors, for their memory comes about, after the time that suits the place: then tighten the tightness slightly.
Et scias, quod locus quando arcuatur, et scinditur in duo, praeter quod accidant in eo satagiae, uerumtamen remouetur omnis pars a compari sua: tunc oportet tibi, ut incipias ab hora tua ad rectificationem eius, aequando ipsum antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you know that the place when it arches and is split into two, apart from what happens in it of satchels, but all its parts are removed from each other: then you should start to correct it from your time, straightening it before it happens to it a swelling of heat.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum, tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec quiescat apoestema.	But if it happens to him a swelling of heat, then let go of the bone for a few days, until it rests the swelling.
Deinde aequa ipsum secundum quemcunque modum potest ex lenitate et ingenio.	Then make the bone equal by any way you can of softness and skill.
Et scias, quod restauratio eius, et ipsius aequatio, est facilior quam ossis, in quo accidunt satagiae.	And you know that the restoration of it, and its equality, is easier than of bone, in which satchels happen.
Deinde stringe ipsum, secundum quod ueniet tibi rememoratio eius.	Then tighten it, according to what comes to your memory about it.
Si uero in osse sunt satagiae, tunc necessaria est extensio huius membri fracti ex duabus partibus, si manus sit, aut pes: aut cum manu tua, si membrum est paruum: aut cum duobus funibus, aut cum fune et manu.	But if in the bone are satchels, then necessary is the extension of this broken member from two parts, if it sits with a hand, or with a foot: or with your hand when the member is small: or with two ropes, or with a rope and a hand.
Et sit positio tua qua ponis membrum super locum aequalem, secundum figuram suam naturalem, donec quando extenduntur partes membri fracti: tunc conare, ut redire facias illas additiones omni ingenio, et secundum quemcunque modum potes in locis suis: et caue secundum fortitudinem tuam, ne accidat super infirmum per operationem tuam dolor, neque laesio: et conare secundum fortitudinem tuam, ut applices unum duorum ossium cum socio suo, secundum meliores formas.	And set your position so that you place the limb on an equal place, according to its natural figure, until when the parts of the broken member are extended: then take care, that you return them with all your inventiveness, and in whatever way you can in their places: and be careful, according to your strength, that no pain should happen over the weak by your operation, or any fault: and take care, according to your strength, that you apply one two bones with his friend, according to better forms.
Et oportet in illa hora, ut tentes et tangas ipsum manu tua.	And it is necessary at that hour, that you try and touch him with your own hand.
Si ergo uides illic aliquid diuersum, rectifica ipsum, et aequa illud per quantitatem tuae uirtutis.	If then you see there anything different, straight it out, and make it equal by the quantity of your strength.
Et caue extensionem uehementem, et compressionem fortem, sicut faciunt multi stolidorum.	And be careful about the sudden extension, and the strong compression, as many do with the stiff.
Multotiens enim faciunt accidere per operationem illam suam apostema calidum, aut contractionem in membro: sicut iam uidimus illud ex operationibus eorum multotiens.	For often it happens through their own operation that they make the limb hot with a fever, or contract it in the member: for we have seen this thing often from their operations.
Deinde annecte post aequationem, et decentem operationem, et stricturam illius membri, et quietem, et tranquillitatem: et mone infirmum super ipsum.	Then join on after the healing, and on the relaxing of the operation, and on the tightening of the limb, and peace, and calmness: and warn the weak person over it.
Et fac ipsum cauere, ne moueat ipsum in hora suarum uigiliarum, et somni sui apud reuolutionem suam, et agitationem suam, et apud egestionem suam, et omnes motus suos ultima uirtute sua.	And make the limb rest, so that it does not move in the hour of its strength, and its sleep when it is in a state of resolution, and agitation, and its movement at its last power.
Et ut caueat, ne sit positio membri positio cum qua sequatur dolor.	And be careful, so that the limb does not take a position with which it follows pain.
Quod est, quia quando sentit in dispositione positionis membri dolorem, aut laesionem: tunc oportet, ut permutes ipsum ad dispositionem aliam ab illa cum qua non sentiat dolorem.	That is, because when it feels the pain of the limb's position, or injury: then it is necessary that you change it to a position other than that from which it does not feel pain.
Et caue cum illo, ut sit positio eius illa aequalis, recta: ut non accidat in membro tortuositas, quando restauratur.	And be careful with him, so that his position is equal and straight: so that no tortuosity happens in the limb when it is restored.
Et qualitas stricturae membri fracti est, secundum quod narro.	And the quality of a broken member's tightness is according to what has been said.
Scias, quod membra fracta diuersificantur in paruitate sua, et eorum magnitudine, et ipsorum forma.	Be aware that broken limbs differ in their length and size and shape.
Quae ergo ex eis sunt parua, sicut brachium, et digitus, et focile, et similia eis, tunc oportet, ut sit inuolutio panni mollis, subtilis.	Of which the shorter members, such as the arm, and the finger, and the thumb, and the like, then it should be, that there is a spread of soft cloth, thin.
Quae autem ex eis sunt grossa, sicut coxa, et crus, oportet ut sit in eis inuolutio lata, dura.	But of which the thicker members, such as the hip, and the leg, then it should be, that there is a spread of broad, hard cloth in them.
Quoniam ligamentum latum, connectit membrum magnum, et stringit ipsum ab omni parte strictura aequali, ita quod non ingreditur ipsum macula.	Since the wide ligament connects the large member, and tightens it with equal tightness from all sides, so that it does not enter it a stain.
Deinde incipe post euacuationem tuam ab aequatione ponere linimentum conueniens ad illud, in stuppa leni super locum fracturae ipsius.	Then begin after you have drained to place the ointment suitable for that, in a soft cloth over the site of the fracture.
Deinde incipe inuoluere ligamentum super locum fracturae ipsius tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor, secundum quod meretur membrum: et stringe manum tuam parumper cum ligamento.	Then begin to spread three or four times over the site of the fracture, depending on how much the member is stretched, and lightly tighten your hand with the ligament.
Deinde uade cum eo ad partem superiorem a loco fracturae, et stringe minus quam fuit strictura tua, qua strinxisti locum fractum.	Then move it along with you to the upper side from the site of the fracture, and tighten less than how tight your tightening was, which you tightened the broken place.
Deinde elonga te cum inuolutione a loco fracturae parumper, et mollifica stricturam paulatim, donec capias ex loco sano rem magnam.	Then stretch yourself out with the spread from the site of the fracture a little, and soften the tightness gradually, until you have recovered from the place a large piece.
Deinde accipe uittam aliam, et inuolue eam iterum super locum fractum inuolutionibus.	Then take another clean one, and spread it again over the broken site with spreads.
Postea uade cum inuolutione ad partem inferiorem a fractura.	Then move it along with you to the lower side from the fracture.
Et sit operatio tua in strictura inuolutionis, et mollificatione eius, secundum quod diximus in inuolutione prima superiore.	And let your operation be in the tightness of the spread, and in the softening of it, according to what we have said in the first spread above.
Deinde pone inter inuolutiones ex stuppa leni, aut panno, cum quo aequetur tortuositas fracturae, si est in ea tortuositas: et si non, non ponas in ea aliquid.	Then place between the spreads a soft cloth, or a cloth, with which it is even the curvature of the fracture, if there is any curvature: and if not, do not place anything in it.
Deinde inuolue super ipsam uittam aliam.	Then spread again over that other clean one.
Postea aequa super has inuolutiones astellas decenter factas statim, si non est in loco inflatio, neque apostema calidum.	Then make the stars of the spreads even immediately, if there is no swelling or fever at the site.
Si autem in ea est inflatio, aut apostema: tunc pone super eam quod sedet illud apostema, et auferat inflationem: et dimitte eam aliquot diebus.	If, however, there is swelling or bruising: then place something on top of it to support that bruising, and remove the swelling: and let it go for a few days.
Deinde stringe super ipsam tunc astellas.	Then bind firmly to it then stars.
Et sint Astellae ex medietatibus cannae latae, rasae, formatae sapienter: aut sint ex ligno unde fiunt cribra, quae fiunt ex pino, aut geraid, id est, ramis palmae, aut calingi: et sit amplitudo omnis Astellae, secundum hanc formam, et hanc eandem figuram.	And the stars are from the middle of canes broad, rasped, formed wisely: or they are from wood where cribs are made, which are made from pine, or rags, that is to say, branches of palm, or calix: and let the width of each star be according to this form, and let it have this figure.
Verumtamen oportet, ut Astella quae ponitur super ipsam tracturam, sit grossior et latior parumper, quam reliquae Astellae: et longitudo Astellae sit secundum quod licet membro ex magnitudine et paruitate.	However, the star that is placed on top of it should be wider and longer by a little bit than the other stars: and the length of the star should be according to what is suitable for the member in size and beauty.
Deinde stringe super Astellas cum uitta alia, secundum stricturam primam eandem.	Then bind the stars together with another string, starting from the first one to form a group.
Deinde liga desuper cum filis decenter, secundum quod diximus de strictura: et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae plus: et quanto plus elongatur a fractura sit, strictura minor.	Then tie from above with a string that is slightly less stiff: and it should be, so that your stiffness covers the fracture spot more: and the less it extends from the fracture, the stiffer it is.
Et oportet, ut sint fila media in grossitudine et subtilitate, et sint ex lino molli.	And it should be, that the middle strings in thickness and softness are made of soft linen.
Quoniam si fila sunt grossa, sicut uidi ex operatione stolidorum ponentium fila sua ex chordis lini tortis, est error magnus: quoniam cadit strictura cum eis extra qualitatem.	For if the strings are thick, such as is the case with strings used for stiffening of wooden frames in surgery from twisted linen chords, it is a great mistake: because the stiffness comes out of shape with them.
Et fila subtilia iterum non conueniunt: quoniam tu non consequeris per stricturam cum eis illud quod uis.	And thin strings do not suit either: for you will not get the desired stiffness with them.
Et non oportet, ut sit inter astellam et astellam minus quam digitus.	And it is not suitable that there be less than a space of a finger between each star.
Quod si laeditur infirmus per extremitates astellarum post stricturam in locis sanis: tunc pone sub eis ex stuppa leni, aut lana carminata, donec nihil laedatur ex illo.	That if a sick person is laid between the stars after the stiffness has been applied to the healthy places: then place something soft under them, such as fluffy cloth or red wool, until there is no pain from it.
Quando autem est fractura cum uulnere, et accidit disruptio in cute, ego ueniam cum rememoratione eius in capitulo secundum singularitatem.	When there is a fracture with an injury, and there is a break in the skin, I return to this chapter to remember it in detail.
Et scias, quod non omne membrum fractum oportet ut stringatur cum astellis a primo die.	You should know that not every broken limb needs to be fixed with splints from the first day.
Quod est, quia membrum quando est magnum, non oportet ut ponas superipsum astellas, nisi post quinque dies, aut septem, aut plus, secundum securitatem tuam ab euentu apostematis calidi.	That is, because the limb when it is big, it should not be placed on top of the splints, unless after five days, or seven, or more, according to your security from blood clots.
Et iste est modus emplastrorum, quibus restaurabant antiqui, quae ponuntur super fracturam et dislocationem.	And this is the way that the ancient ones used to fix it, which are placed on top of the fracture and dislocation.
¶ Modus Emplastri communis abbreuiati, restaurans fracturam, conueniens pluribus complexionibus, praecipue mulieribus, et pueris: quoniam est ex eo super quod non uincit calor, neque frigus.	The common short way of doing the plaster, for restoring the fracture, suitable for many cases, especially for women and children; because it is not hurt by heat or cold.
Et est, ut accipias ex puluere molendini, et est medulla farinae quae pendet in parietibus molendini apud motum molae: et conficias ipsum sicut est, praeter quod cribelles ipsum cum albugine oui: et pone confectionem eius non spissam, neque subtilem.	And it is so that you take from the flour that is ground, and there is a dough that hangs on the walls of the gristmill next to the rolling mill: and make it as it is, except that you add chalk to it: and put its coating not thick, nor thin.
Deinde utere eo.	Then use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, restaurantis fracturam, et dislocationem, et torsionem.	The other way of doing the plaster, for restoring the fracture and dislocation and torsion.
Recipe almess, et laudani, et acaciae, et enulae, et mugath: et suc, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V et alethil ʒ XX terantur omnia, et cribellentur, et misceantur cum aqua alethil: aut cum albugine oui, si complexio infirmi est calefacta.	Take almsgiving, and lauds, and acacia, and cow's milk, and mug; and honey, of all kinds of myrrh, and aloe of both sexes, of the XX parts of alethah, as much as there is, and add it to the chalk, and mix it with water of alethah: or add it to the chalk if the case is warm.
Deinde utere hoc emplastro.	Then use this plaster.
Nam ipsum est bonae compositionis, restaurat ossa fracta uelociter, et confert pluribus hominibus.	For this is a good composition, it restores the broken bones quickly, and suits many people.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius, quod etiam confert fracturae et torsioni.	The other way of doing the plaster, which also suits the fracture and torsion.
Recipe mugath, et mess, et alteae albae, omnium ana ʒ X myrrhae, et aloes amborum ana ʒ V acaciae ʒ VI boli armeni ʒ XX terantur omnia contritione multa, et cribellentur, et conficiantur cum aqua, aut albugine oui: et administrentur.	Take mug, and almsgiving, and white aloe, of all kinds of myrrh X parts, and of acacia VI parts, and of bolus Armenian XX parts; twist them together with much grinding, and add them to the chalk, and make it with water, or add it to the chalk: and administer.
¶ Modus Emplastri ad iuncturas, et ossa separata ex locis suis: et sedat dolorem accidentem eis, et scissuram ossis, et fracturam.	The mode of applying plasters for joints, and bones separated from their places: and to assuage the pain, the injury, the cutting of the bone, and the fracture.
Sumatur lana succida, et submergatur in aceto, et oleo decocto: et ponatur super locum.	Take wool wetted with sour milk, and let it be submerged in vinegar and oil cooked, and let it be placed on the place.
Et in hoc quidem Emplastro non est uirtus restaurationis, sed est bonum in sedatione apostematis calidi: et expellit dolores proprie.	And in this plaster, there is no virtue of restoration, but it is good in the sedation of hot swelling: and it drives away pains by itself.
¶ Modus Emplastri, quod restaurat os fractum.	The mode of applying plaster, which restores a broken bone.
Sume folia fici surdi, et folia papaueris syluestris: et tere omnia, et fac emplastrum ex utrisque.	Take leaves of fig and leaves of wild papaw: and dry them all, and make a plaster of both.
¶ Modus Emplastri abbreuiati, administrati apud restaurationem fracturae ossis: et quando tu uis resolutionem residui apostematis.	The mode of applying a short plaster, applied to the restoration of a fracture of a bone: and when you wish to resolve a residual swelling.
Recipe radicis alteae, et camomillae, et florum uiolarum, et farinae herbi, omnium ana partem unam: terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum uino, si non est membrum calefactum.	Take the root of marigold, and of chamomile, and of flowers of violet, and of herb-weed, all one half: dry them all, and make them with wine, if it is not a heated member.
Si uero est calefactum, tunc confice illud cum aqua coriandri humidi, aut cum aqua, et utere eo.	If it is indeed heated, then make that with coriander seed juice, or with water, and use it.
¶ Modus Emplastri alius fortioris in resolutione, quam istud primum, quando accidit apostema durum apud restaurationem membri.	The mode of a stronger plaster in the resolution, which is greater than this, when it happens that a swelling is harsh on the restoration of a member.
Recipe radicis alteae, et seminis lini, et balaustiae, et melliloti, et samsuci, et floris uiolarum, et camomillae, omnium ana, partem unam, terantur omnia, et conficiantur cum aqua salicis, aut cum aqua dulci, aut cum uino.	Take the root of marigold, and of flax seed, and of poplar bark, and of mealy-seed, and of sweet grass, and of violet flowers, and of chamomile, all one half: dry them all, and make them with water of willows, or with sweet water, or with wine.
Totum illud secundum caliditatem membri, et quietem caloris eius.	All this depending on the calor of the member, and on the quieting of heat.
Hippocrates uero non dixit in libro suo, quod ponatur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius, nisi caerotum factum ex caera, et oleo: non aliud: et narrauit, ut sit medium inter grossitudinem et subtilitatem.	Hippocrates indeed did not say in his book, that a plaster placed on a broken member should be made from the ash of the oak and oil: nothing else: and he related, that it should be between harshness and softness.
Galeno autem uisum est, ut ponantur super membrum fractum apud restaurationem eius res, in quibus est exiccatio caliditatis, sicut myrrha, et aloes et olibanum, et similia eis ex eis quae narrauimus.	But Galen did use, that plasters be placed on a broken member at the restoration of it, in which is an drying up of heat, such as myrrh, and aloe, and olive-oil, and things similar to these from which we have spoken.
¶ Modus Emplastri quod confert ad laesionem et dolorem.	The mode of poultice which is beneficial for injury and pain.
Recipe mugath, et ciceris, et capillorum hominis incisorum, aut pennae auis, et alteae, et salis partes aequales: terantur, et cribellentur, et conficiantur: et fiat ex eo emplastrum.	Take mutton, and chickpeas, and hair of man's teeth, or feathers of birds, and herbs, and equal parts of salt: they are to be ground, and rubbed together, and made into a poultice.
Quantitas autem secundum quam oportet, ut remaneat ligatura, deinde soluatur, est, ut consideres tunc, si non accidit infirmo dolor, neque pruritus, neque mouetur os fractum a loco suo: tunc non resoluas ipsum diebus multis.	But as to the quantity, according to what is necessary, so that it remains a dressing, and then dissolves away, consider this then, if pain does not occur, nor itchiness, nor does a broken jaw move from its place: then do not take it away after many days.
Quod si accidat ei in loco pruritus uehemens, aut dolor inquietans, aut inflatio: tunc propera, et solue in hora ipsum, et aufer emplastrum ab eo: et accipe pannum lenem, aut spongiam marinam lenem, humidam: et submerge eam in aqua tepida, et ablue cum ea locum, donec quiescat pruritus, et sedetur dolor.	If it happens to him that there is a stinging itchiness, or a troubling pain, or inflammation: then do this, and dissolve it away in the hour itself, and take off the poultice from him: and receive a cloth of wool, or a sea sponge of wool, wet with water: and dip it into the lukewarm water, and wash with it the place, until the itchiness is calmed down, and the pain is soothed.
Deinde dimitte membrum quiescere una hora.	Then let go of the member to rest for one hour.
Deinde pone super ipsum lanam succidam, submersam in aceto et oleo, aut oleo rosato: et liga super ipsum nocte una, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido, et quiescat inflatio membri, et remoueatur dolor eius.	Then put over it a woolen cloth, soaked in vinegar and oil, or oil rubbed with rosewater: and bind it on for the night, so that he is safe from the heat of the sun, and the swelling of the member has ceased, and the pain of his has gone away.
Deinde itera ipsum ad stricturam subtilem, et emplastrum paruum: et non stringas ipsum constrictione tua prima, et subtilia cum eo, donec sanetur.	Then repeatedly examine him to see if he is healing well, and the poultice is small: but do not bind him with your own constriction first, and soft things, until he has healed.
Quod si uides, quod apostema, et rubedo, et dolor, et inflatio, et omnia accidentia iam remota sunt penitus, et indiges emplastro et strictura, tunc itera illud sicut fecisti in primis aequaliter.	If you see that the swelling, and redness, and pain, and inflammation, and all the other accidents have entirely disappeared, and there is no need for the poultice or constriction anymore: then do this again as you did before, equally.
Quod si non accidit membro aliquid ex eis quae diximus, tune non soluas ipsum, nisi post tres dies, aut quatuor, aut quinque, aut septem.	If not one of those things which I have said happens to the member: then do not take it away, unless after three days, or four, or five, or seven.
Et quando que dimittitur uiginti diebus totum illud, secundum quod apparet tibi ex solutione membri, sicut diximus, donec quando adhaeret fractura, et approximat coagulatio carnis super eam: adde etiam tunc in strictura plus quam strictura tua prima tota: et adde etiam in ingrossatione cibi infirmi, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius.	And when the member has been left for twenty days all over, according to what appears to you from the healing of the member, as we have said, until such time as the fracture is healed, and the coagulation of the blood on it is approximate: also add to that then more constriction than your first constriction: and add also in the swelling of food, according to what preceded its remembrance.
Si autem uides locum fracturae iam exiccari, et extenuari plus quam oportet: tunc scias, quod nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad ipsum.	If, however, you see the place of fracture already drying out and becoming more extensive than necessary: then you should know that nourishment is forbidden to reach it.
Embroca ergo ipsum cum aqua tepida apud omnem uicem qua soluis ipsum, et sit illud in omnibus tribus diebus, et alleuia stricturam parumper.	So wrap the wound with warm water at all times and leave it open for three days and then apply a little ointment.
Per hanc ergo operationem currit ad membrum nutrimentum, et sanatur uelociter.	Therefore, in this operation, nourishment runs to the limb and is quickly healed.
Illud autem quod faciunt stolidi restauratores ex fractura membri uice alia, quando non restauratur in primis, secundum quod oportet, et restauratur secundum tortuositatem, est error ex operatione eorum, et timor magnus: et si esset rectum, dixissent illud antiqui in libris suis, et operati fuissent cum eo.	But that which the careless healers do from a broken limb, when they do not restore it at first, and then restore it according to its need and restoration according to its bend, is a mistake in their operation and a great fear: and if it had been right, the ancients would have said in their books, and they would have operated with it.
Et ego non uidi alicubi eorum uestigium in illo omnino, et rectius est, ut non fiat illud.	And I did not see any of their legacy in this at all, and it is better that it should not be done.
¶ De factura accidente in capite.	[On the Making of an Injury in the Head.]
Caput III.	Chaps. 3 - On the Making of an Injury
Species fracturae sunt diuersae, et figurae eius multae: et caussae eius sunt distinctae.	(There are various kinds of fractures and many forms of it; and its causes are separate.)
Nam ex fractura est quae fit a percussione cum ense: et percussio aufert os totum usquequo peruenit ad siphac, quod est sub osse, sicut facit axia in ligno: et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Axialis.	For the fracture is from a punch which passes all the way through to the other side, which is beneath the bone, as it does in the axe in the wood: and for that reason this kind of fracture is called the axial fracture.
Aut ensis incidit quiddam ossis, et incidit faciem eius, et non penetrat incisio usque ad ultimum eius: et nominatur haec species fracturae Kalaan, id est, Leuatio absolute.	Or a blade cuts some bone, and it hits its face, but the cut does not go through to the other side: and this kind of fracture is called the Kalaan fracture, that is, an absolute Let-down.
Et est uulnus duarum fracturarum, aut magnum, aut paruum.	And there is a joint of two fractures, or a large one, or a small one.
Et ex fractura est, quae est contritio, aut attritio: et caussa eius est percussio cum lapide, aut casus super lapidem, aut eis similia.	(And from a fracture is a crushing, or a grinding): and its cause is a punch with a stone, or a fall on a stone, or similar things.
Et haec fractura est etiam aut penetrans, quae iam appropinquat panniculo, quod est sub osse: aut est in facie ossis: et est uulnus harum duarum fracturarum etiam aut paruum, aut magnum.	(And this fracture is also penetrating, which is about to break through a skin, which is beneath the bone): or it is on the surface of the bone: and these two fractures are also small or large.
Et ex fractura est, quae est occulta in osse in subtilitate capilli: et est fissura parua, et propter illud nominatur haec species fracturae Capillaris.	It is from a fracture that is hidden in bone and subtle in hair: and it is a small crack, and for this reason this type of fracture is called Capillaris.
Et ex eis est fractura, quae fit a casu, aut percussione lapidis, et eis similium, quae faciunt ingredi laminam ossis ad interiora, et fit loco concauitas: sicut accidit caldariis aeris, quando occurrit eis percussio, et ingreditur pars eorum ad interiora.	And from these is a fracture that happens by accident or by the hitting of a stone, and similar to these, which make a layer of bone go inside, and makes a concavity: as happened with the caldaria of air when it was hit and some of them went inside.
Et plurimum quidem fit illud in capitibus humidorum ossium, sicut sunt capita puerorum.	And most certainly this happens in the heads of moist bones, such as are the heads of boys.
Et fiunt omnibus istis speciebus fracturae satagiae separatae, et ego ueniam cum rememoratione illius totius in loco suo.	And all these types of fractures are separated from each other, and I will add something about this whole thing in its place.
Et cognoscimus omnes has species fracturae per detectionem super eam, et inquisitionem earum cum tentis, et ablationem carnium corruptarum, quae sunt super eas.	And we know all these types of fractures by detecting them and inquiring about them with the help of a probe, and by removing the corrupted flesh that is on them.
Species uero Capillaris cognoscitur per hoc, quod detegitur super os, et abstergitur, et linitur super ipsum cum encaustro: fractura enim apparet nigra.	The Capillaris species is recognized in this way, that it is detected on the bone and scrubbed and applied with caustice to it: for a fracture appears black.
In curatione autem fracturae, considera in primis accidentia infirmi: tunc si uides ex accidentibus quod significet significatione manifesta super timorem, sicut uomitus cholerae, et extensio, et amissio intellectus, et abscisio uocis, et syncopis, et febris acuta, et egressus oculorum, et rubedo eorum, et similia eis ex accidentibus in pluribus dispositionibus, proculdubio non sanatur: et si uides accidentia non terrentia te, et speras salutem: tunc incipe curationem eius.	In the cure of a fracture, consider first the enferms: then if you see from the enferms that it means a clear indication on fear, such as a fever of cholera, and extension, and loss of intellect, and loss of speech, and syncope, and acute fever, and exit of eyes, and their rubor, and similar things to these in many conditions, without a doubt he will not be healed: and if you see that the enferms are not frightening you, and you hope for his recovery: then begin to cure him.
Quod est, si uenit ad te uulneratus in primis cum uulneratur: et est illud in diebus hyemis, tunc oportet, ut studeas in ablatione ossis ante diem quartumdecimum secundum omnem dispositionem.	That is, if a person comes to you wounded for the first time: and it is on a cold day, then one should study to remove the bone before the 24th day according to all conditions.
Et si est in diebus aestatis, tunc oportet, ut properes remouere os ante diem septimum, antequam corrumpatur quod est sub osse ex panniculo, et accidant illa accidentia quae narrauimus.	And if it is on a summer day, then one should remove the bone before the seventh day, before it corrupts what is under the bone from a pannicle, and those accidents that we have described.
Quod si fractura ossis iam peruenit ad panniculum tangentem cerebrum, et est cum minutiis, et attractione: tunc oportet, ut incidas partem comminutam, et attritam, secundum quod narro tibi.	If the fracture of the bone has reached the meninges and is small, then draw it out with attraction; then you must break the broken part and grind it according to what I have told you.
Et est, ut radas caput uulnerati: et detege super os secundum quemcunque modum possibile est tibi: et secundum figuram uulneris, et quod leue est super infirmum.	And then you must shave the head of the injured person: and find out on the bone in any way possible for you: and according to the shape of the wound, and what is more suitable for the sick.
Quod si accidat tibi apud detectionem ossis fluxus sanguinis, aut apostema calidum: tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet.	If you encounter a flow of blood or a hot sweat when you are examining the bone, then oppose it with what is necessary.
Et est, ut impleas locum cum pannis infusis in uino, et oleo rosato: et facias quiescere uulnus, donec sedetur apostema, et sis securus a fluxu sanguinis.	And fill the place with cloth soaked in wine and oil; and let the joint rest until the sweat subsides, and be safe from the flow of blood.
Deinde incipe in curatione ossis, et ablatione eius.	Then begin the treatment of the bone and removal of it.
Et illud fit secundum unum duorum modorum.	And make it as one or two ways.
Modus quidem unus est, ut incidas os cum Incisorio strictae aciei: et haec est forma eius.	The one way is to break the bone with a sharp chisel: and this is its form.
Dende administra Incisorium aliud post Incisorum latius eo parumper: et haec est forma eius.	Then give another Incisory wider by the same width: and this is its form.
Deinde administra etiam Incisorium aliud latius etiam quam secundum.	Then also give a wider Incisory, as wide as the second one.
Et modus secundus est, ut sit apud te numerus Incisoriorum diuersorum: quorum quaedam sint latiora quibusdam, et quaedam eorum breuiora quibusdam: et sint in ultimo acuitatis extremitatum suarum, et sint ex ferro indo, aut fuled: et utere facilitate in percussione super Incisorium, ut non concutiat caput, et laedat ipsum.	The second way is to have a number of Incisory tools with different widths, some wider and some narrower: and let the latter be at the extremities of their sharpness, and made of iron or metal; and use ease in striking on the Incisory, so that it does not hurt itself and hurts itself.
Si autem os est forte, durum: tunc oportet, ut perfores in circumitu eius, antequam tu administres Incisoria, cum Terebris quae nominantur Terebra non profundantia: et non nominantur ita, nisi quoniam ipsa non pertranseunt terminum ossis carnei ad illud, quod est post ipsum: propterea, quod Terebro est extremitas rotunda super illud, quod est sub capite eius acuto, similis margini, et circulus paruus prohibet submergi, et pertransire spissitudinem ossis.	If the bone is strong and hard, then you must drill around it before administering the Incisory with Terraz (an instrument), which do not go deep: for they are not called so unless they do not pass the edge of the bone to that which is behind it: because Terrizo is a round extremity on it, below its sharp head, like an edge, and a small circle prevents sinking into it, and going through the thickness of the bone.
Et conuenit tibi, ut accipias ex istis Terebris numerum multum, quorum unumquodque conueniat quantitati spissitudinis ossis, donec praesens sit tibi omni craneo Terebrum: cuius extremitatis acutae quantitas in longitudine et breuitate sit, secundum quantitatem spissitudinis illius cranei.	It is fitting that you should receive from these Terribles a great number, each of which corresponds to the quantity of thickness of bone, until the present one is entirely in your skull: whose extremities are acute in length and brevity, according to the quantity of thickness of its skull.
Et haec est forma trium specierum Terebrorum, uel Trepanorum.	And this is the form of the three Terribles, or trepanations.
Qualitas autem perforandi in circumitu ossis fracti, est: ut ponas Terebrum super os, et reuoluas ipsum digitis tuis, donec scias, os iam penetratum esse.	But the quality of drilling around the fractured bone is: as you place the Terribles on the bone and rotate your fingers, until you know that the bone has been penetrated.
Deinde permuta Terebrum ad locum alium, et pone quod est inter omne foramen quantitatem grossitudinis radii, aut circiter illud.	Then exchange the Terribles for a different place, and put whatever quantity of thickness is around any hole or circle it.
Deinde incide cum Incisoriis quod est inter omne foramen ex osse: et fac illud subtilius quam potes super illud ex fine leuitatis, sicut diximus, donec eradices os, aut manu tua, aut cum aliquo alio ex quibusdam instrumentis, quae parasti ad illud: sicut tenaliae, et forpices subtiles.	Then cut with the Incisors whatever is between any hole from the bone: and make it thinner than you can on it from the edge of lightness, as we have said, until you eradicate the bone, or your hand, or with some other instrument that you have prepared for it: such as tenacles, and fine pincers.
Et oportet, ut caueas omni cautela, ne tangat Terebrum, aut Incisorium aliquid ex siphac.	And it is necessary that you should take every precaution, so that the Terribles or any of the Incisors do not touch a sipha, or anything else.
Cum ergo circumieris os perforando, et separatum fuerit a siphac, si fuerit continuum cum eo, et extraxeris ipsum, oportet ut radas, et aeques extremitatem eius quod remanet in osse cum instrumento alio simili Incisorio.	When you have thus drilled around the bone and separated it from a sipha, if it should be continuous with it, and you extract it, then you must file it, and make the same end of it as remains in the bone with some other similar instrument of the Incisors.
Verumtamen oportet, ut sit tenuis et subtilis magis aliis Incisoriis.	However, it is necessary that it should be thin and thinner with the other Incisors.
Quod si remanet aliquid ex ossibus paruis, et satagiae: tunc accipe ea cum facilitate, cum eo quod est apud te ex instrumentis.	That if there remains a little of the bones left, and it is difficult: then take them with ease, with whatever is near you from instruments.
Deinde cura uulnus post illud cum liciniis, et unguentis quae diximus.	Then care for the knots after that with oil, and the ointment which we have said.
Et modus alius operationis est facilis, prorsus longinquus a timore: quem dixit Galenus, et laudauit ipsum laude magna: et iste est sermo eius.	And another way of operation is simple, quite far from fear: which Galen said, and praised it much: and this is the words of his.
Necese est tibi in primis, ut incipias detegere partem ossis ex loco, in quo fractura est uehementior, et manifestior: donec quando detexeris illam partem, et posueris sub eo extremitatem huius Incisorii lenticularis, cuius haec est forma.	It is necessary that you first, when you begin to handle the bone part from the place where the fracture is greater and more evident: until such time as you have handled it and placed under it this lens-shaped incisor, whose form this is.
Et pars lenticularis, lenis non incidit aliquid: et pars acuta eius in duabus lateribus eius uadens in longitudinem, sicut uides: ut sit pars lenticularis innixa ad siphac, facie eius incidente acuta in osse.	And the lens-shaped part, does not affect anything at all: and the sharp part of it moving on both sides of it from lengthwise, as you see: so that the lens-shaped part is placed on a chisel, the face of it striking sharply into the bone.
Deinde percute super Incisorium a parte una cum malleo paruo, donec incidas totum os cum facilitate, sicut reuoluitur: et tu sis securus ex panniculo, quod non accidat in eo accidens, quod timeas prorsus.	Then strike on the incisor from one side with a small mallet until you hit the whole bone with ease, as it turns over: and you will be safe from panic, for there is no danger of anything happening to it, which you truly fear.
Et si medicans non esset stultior hominum, et magis ignarus eius, nec esset dormiens, tunc si remaneret aliquid annexum ossi ex panniculo in quibusdam locis, incideret ipsum ab eo cum extremitate incisorii lenticularis ipsius, et liberaret ipsum ab eo cum facilitate.	And if the healer was not a fool among men, and rather ignorant of it, and not asleep, then if there remained anything attached to the bone from the pannicle in some places, he would hit it himself with the extreme end of the lens-shaped incisor, and set it free from it with ease.
Liberatur enim ab eo sine nocumento, et absque timore.	For it is freed from it without harm, and without fear.
Et si fractura ossis non penetret usque ad panniculum, et illud quod abscinditur ab osse est facies eius, et remanent in ipso asperitas et satagiae subtiles: tunc oportet, ut radas illam asperitatem, et eradices illas satagias cum rasoriis subtilibus ex quibus praeparasti numerum diuersarum quantitatum, ut sit tibi possibile administrare ex eis in omni loco conuenientiora eorum, et rectiora ipsorum, secundum illud ad quod perducit te operatio, et ipsum os fractum, et figura eius.	And if the bone fracture does not penetrate as far as the pannicle, and that which is cut off from the bone is the face of it, and there remain in it roughness and subtle knots: then you should remove this roughness and pluck out these knots with fine rasps, so that it is possible for you to administer them at all times more convenient for them, and straighter for them, according to which the surgery leads you, and that broken bone, and its form.
Et oportet, ut administres in rasione tua, qua in primis radis os, latius illorum rasoriorum.	And you should administer in your ration, at first the root of the bone, with a wider rasp of these rasps.
Deinde utere post ipsum subtiliore eo.	Then use after it a finer edge of the blade.
Et non cesses facere illud secundum continuitatem, donec peruenias ad administrandum tenuius, et subtilius eorum omnium.	And you should not stop doing that according to continuity, until you reach the point of administering them thinner, and finer of all.
In unaquaque autem fissurarum reliquarum paruarum capillarium, et fractura subtili, oportet ut administres curam, secundum illud quod perducit ad rectificationem eius.	In every other case of remaining lung cracks and thin fractures, you should give treatment according to that which leads to its correction.
Et est res quae non occultatur super omnem, cui in hac arte est quodlibet studium, et stetit super illud quod scripsimus, et ostendimus in fracturis magnis.	And this is a thing that is not hidden above all, to which in this art any study is useful, and stands on that which we have written and shown in the case of large fractures.
Si autem panniculus detectus retinetur, quando tu eradicas os: tunc oportet, ut accipias pannum lini, secundum quantitatem uulneris, et submerge ipsum in oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super orificium uulneris.	But if a patch has been placed and retains the wound: then you should take a piece of linen cloth, according to the quantity of the wound, and immerse it in rose oil, and place it over the wound's opening.
Deinde accipe pannum alium duplicatum, aut triplicatum, et submerge ipsum in uino et oleo rosa, et pone ipsum super pannum primum: et fac illud quam facilius potes super illud, ut non grauetur siphac.	Then take another piece of cloth, doubled or tripled, immerse it in wine and rose oil, and place it over the first cloth: and make it so that you can do this more easily than the other, so that it does not chafe.
Deinde administra supra ipsum ligamentum latum: et non stringas ipsum, nisi per quantitatem quae teneat uulnus tantum: et dimitte ipsum cum hac cura die uno, aut diebus duobus, donec sis securus ab apostemate calido.	Then apply a broad bandage over it: and do not tighten it, unless by the amount that holds the wound only: and leave it with this treatment for one day or two, until you are secure from fever.
Deinde solue ipsum, et administra post illud medicinas cum quibus est superflua siccitas: sicut radices lilii, et farina herbi, et puluis thuris, et aristolochia, et similia eis: et est, ut facias ex istis medicinis puluerem, qui puluerizetur super uulnus sicut sunt siccae.	Then dissolve it, and administer after it the medicines with which there is no need of dryness: such as lilies' roots, herb flour, thorn powder, and similar things: and it is, that you make a powder of these medicines, which you sprinkle over the wound like those which are dry.
Et uniuersaliter administra in illo omnem medicinam de proprietate cuius est ut abstergat, et non mordicet.	And administer universally in it all medicine of its property, which is to cleanse and not to bite.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, ut uulnus in curatione tua sit limpidum: neque sit in ea sordes unguenti, neque sordicies.	And take care, according to your skill, that the wound in your cure is clear: and is not in it an ointment, nor any sort of dirtiness.
Neque dimittas uirus aggregari in eo omnino: quoniam quando uirus aggregatur super panniculum cerebri, corrumpit eum, et putrefacit ipsum, et accidit super infirmum post illud malicia magna: et iam accidit in siphac capitis, cum mundificatur ab eo os, praecipue quando negligitur cura eius, nigredo in superficie eius.	And do not leave any wart aggregating therein at all: because when a wart aggregates over the haircloth of the skull, it corrupts it, and makes it putrefied, and brings about great evil after that: and this has already happened to the scalp's skin, when it is washed away from it, especially if its care is neglected, and there is blackness on its surface.
Considera ergo tunc, si accidunt infirmo accidentia quae diximus, scias, quia est pernitiosum proculdubio.	Therefore, consider then, if happen accidents to the sick which we have said, know that is certainly dangerous.
Et si nigredo non accidit, nisi a medicina quae ponitur super ipsum, et est in uirtute illius medicinae, ut faciat illam nigredinem: tunc oportet, ut accipias ex melle partem unam, ex oleo rosato partes tres, et linias cum eis pannum.	And if the blackness does not happen, unless by medicine which is put on himself, and it is in the virtue of its medicine, to make him black: then you should take from honey a part, from oil rose three parts, and with them linen cloth.
Deinde pone ipsum super siphac: postea cura ipsum cum speciebus curationis quae conueniunt, donec sanetur.	Then put the patient on a bed: then care for the patient with the species of cure which are appropriate, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione Nasi quando frangitur.	Of restoration of the nose when it is broken.
Caput IIII.	Chapter IV.
Scias, quod non franguntur ex Naso nisi duae partes eius superiores simul, aut una earum: propterea, quod ipse sunt duo ossa: quoniam inferius eius est cartilaginosum, non frangitur, et non accidit ei nisi attritio, et tortuositas, et simitas.	Know that they do not break from the nose unless both parts of it are at the same time, or one of them: since it has two bones: for the lower part is cartilaginous, does not break, and does not happen to him except by wearisome, and twist, and roughness.
Si frangitur una duarum partium eius, tunc oportet, ut intromittas digitum paruum in foramen Nasi, et aeques illam fracturam digito tuo indice, et pollice deforis, donec redeat Nasus super figuram suam naturalem: et fiat illud arte, cum facilitate.	If it breaks one of the two parts of it, then you should introduce your little finger in the nasal opening, and align the fracture with your little finger and thumb, until the nose returns to its natural shape: and do this with ease.
Et caue, ne accidat per operationem tuam illam super infirmum dolor.	And be careful, so that does not happen by your operation on him a pain on the sick.
Quod si fractura est in superiore parte Nasi, et non perueniat ad illam digitus: tunc oportet, ut aequetur extremitate radii, in quo sit grossitudo parua.	That if the fracture is in the upper part of the nose, and does not reach to that finger: then you should adjust the end of the rib, where is a small thickness.
Si uero fractura est in duabus partibus, tunc fac simile illius: et propera cum restauratione eius in die primo fracturae, si est possibile.	If, however, the fracture is in both parts, then you should make it similar to him: and attend to his restoration on the first day of the fracture, if it is possible.
Et si non, tunc post diem septimum, aut decimum apud quietem apostematis calidi.	And if not, then after seven or ten days at rest from the heat.
Deinde intromitte in extremitate Nasi licinium ex panno lini, si fractura est in parte una: aut intromite duo licinia si fractura est in duabus partibus: et sit in licinio grossitudo tantae quantitatis, quae impleat foramen Nasi.	Then introduce into the end of the nose a piece of linen cloth if the fracture is in one part: or introduce two pieces of linen cloth if the fracture is in both parts: and let it be in the piece of linen thickness such a quantity, which fills the nasal opening.
Et dixerunt quidam antiquorum restauratorum, ut infundantur licinia in butyro, et permutentur omni die.	And certain restorers of antiquity said, let licinia be infused with butter, and be exchanged every day.
Illud uero non uidetur mihi, imo oportet, ut infundatur licinium in albugine oui, confecto cum puluere molendini.	That is not true to me, but it seems necessary that licinia be infused with alum, however, when combined with the powder to be ground.
Deinde dimitte licinium, donec firmetur os, et induretur cartilago.	Then remove the licinia, until the bone is hardened and the cartilage is strengthened.
Et quandoque intromittitur in Nasum loco licinii penna anseris, postquam inuoluitur super ipsam pannus lenis: et fit, quod ipsa tenet fracturam Nasi uehementius, et ut non prohibeatur infirmus ab inspiratione.	And when a feather of a goose is introduced into the nose instead of licinia, after it has been wrapped with a soft cloth: and so it is, that it holds the fracture of the nose more firmly together, and prevents the sick from breathing in.
Et non est haec res necessaria.	And this is not necessary.
Si uis, fac illud: et si uis, fac licinia.	If you want, do that: and if you want, do licinia.
Quod si accidat Naso iterum dum operaris apostema calidum, emplastra nasum cum caeroto, aut cum coto infuso in oleo rosato, aut modico ex dyaquilon.	That if the nose should be again injured while you are working, apply an cold poultice to the nose, or one made with a herb called hyssop, or with a little oil of rosemary, or with a little dandelion.
Si autem non accidit apostema calidum, tunc oportet, ut emplastres ipsum cum farina sisami, et puluere thuris confecti cum albugine oui.	But if the cold poultice does not work, then it is necessary that the nose itself be wrapped with a sisam flour paste, and with thuris powder mixed with alum.
Deinde pone super ipsum stuppam lenem, et non liges Nasum cum aliquo omnino.	Then put a soft cloth over the nose, and do not bind it with anything at all.
Si uero franguntur ossa Nasi fractura parua, aut comminuuntur, tunc oportet, ut scindas super ea, et extrahas ipsa cum instrumentis quae conueniunt eis.	But if the nose bones are broken or crushed, then it is necessary that you split them open, and remove the bone with the appropriate instruments.
Deinde sue scissuram, et cura ipsum cum eo quod incarnat, et consolidat ex emplastris conuenientibus ad illud, uel unguentis.	Then cut away the flesh, and take care of the nose when it is infected, and hardened with the plasters suitable for it, or with a ointment.
Quod si accidat inter Nasum uulnus, tunc oportet, ut cures ipsum cum liciniis: et administres cannulam de plumbo, donec sanetur.	That if a nail is stuck between the nose, then it is necessary that you care for the nose with licinia: and administer a brass tube until it heals.
¶ De restauratione Mandibulae inferioris, quando disrumpitur.	Of the restoration of the lower jaw, when it is broken.
Caput V.	Chapter V.
Quando disrumpitur Mandibula inferior, et fractura eius non est cum uulnere: conspice tunc si est fractura eius deforis tantum, et non frangitur in duo, et curuatur ad interiora: tunc cognitio eius est facilis.	When the lower jaw is broken, and not with a nail: examine then if it is only a fracture of the side, and not a break in two, and take care of the internal parts: then it is easy to know it.
Oportet ergo, si est fractura eius in parte dextra, ut intromittas digitum indicem sinistrae in os infirmi: similiter si fractura est in mandibula sinistra, tunc intromitte indicem manus dextrae: et impelle cum eo gibbositatem fracturae deintus cum facilitate ad exteriora cum manu tua altera ab interiori parte ossis decenter, et cum eo aequa ipsam.	If there is a fracture on the right side of his nose, then you should insert your left index finger into the hole: likewise, if there is a fracture in the left jaw, then insert your right index finger: and push it in with ease to the outside with your other hand from the inside of the bone, and align it in place.
Quod si fractura mandibulae iam separata est in duo, tunc oportet, ut administres extersionem a duabus partibus, secundum rectitudinem: donec possibilis sit aequatio eius.	If the fracture of the jaw has already separated into two parts, then you should manage to pull apart the two sides, according to the straightness: until it is possible to align it.
Si autem iam accidit in dentibus commotio, aut disruptio: tunc stringe illos de quibus speras quod remaneant cum filo auri, aut argenti, aut seta.	If an injury has already occurred to the teeth, or a dislocation or fracture: then you should tighten them together with a gold wire, or silver, or silk thread.
Deinde pone super mandibulam fractam caerotum.	Then place the poultice over the fractured jaw.
Deinde pone super ipsum pannum duplicatum, et pone super pannum astellam magnam decenter factam: aut frustum cutis soleae aequale, in longitudinem mandibulae.	Then place a doubled cloth over it, and an uneven-sized wooden splint: or a fragment of skin, the same length as the jaw.
Deinde liga ipsum desuper, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ligatura eius, et conuenit ipsius applicatio, donec non destruitur: et praecipe infirmo, uti tranquillitate et quiete: et pone cibum eius sorbitiones lenes.	Then bind it from above, according to how you have prepared the ligature for yourself, and allow the application to remain in place until it is destroyed: and instruct the patient to use tranquillity and calmness: and provide him with soft food to eat.
Si autem estimas, quod iam alteratur aliquid figurae aliquo modorum: tunc propera, et solue ipsum in die tertio.	If you think that something has already changed in the shape by some amount: then approach it, and dissolve it on the third day.
Deinde rectifica quod alteratum est ex eo, et emplastra ipsum ex puluere molendini, cum albugine oui, aut cum farina sisami, postquam tu abstuleris caerotum: et pone super emplastrum lanam lenem.	Then straighten out what has been moved from it, and cover the jaw with a powder that is ground, mixed with chalk or flour, after you have removed the poultice: and place a thin woollen cloth over it.
Dum ergo permanet annexum illud emplastrum super ipsum, et non alteratur ossis dispositio, dimitte ipsum, ne soluas, donec sanetur: aut stringe fracturam.	While that adhesive poultice remains attached to the jaw and its position of the bone does not change, let it be: and do not remove it, until healing is complete: or tighten the fracture.
Multotiens enim stringitur haec fractura in tribus septimanis.	This fracture is often tightened with three seven-day periods.
Quod si interim accidat apostema calidum, tunc administra illud quod diximus multotiens in sedatione eius, donec remoueatur illud apostema.	If a cold sore occurs while the adhesive is still in place, then administer to it what we have said many times in its treatment, until it disappears.
Et si fractura est cum uulnere, considera.	If there is a fracture with the ulna, consider.
Namsi iam separatur ex osse frustum, aut a satagie: tunc subtilia te in hoc, ut auferas illa frusta satagiae cum eo quod conuenit tibi in ablatione eorum ex instrumentis.	I have already separated the fragment from the bone, or with a saw: then I made it very small, so that you can remove the fragments of sawing together with him when you want to remove them from the instruments.
Si uero orificium uulneris est strictum, tunc amplifica ipsum cum phlebotomo secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae.	If in fact the opening of the wound is tight, then I increase it with the phlebotomist according to the quantity that you need.
Deinde quando abstuleris illa satagie, et non remanserit ex eis aliquid, sue tunc orificium uulneris, si est amplum: et si non, pone super ipsum ex emplastris quae conueniunt ad illud, et incarnant illud, donec sanetur.	Then when you remove these saws and there is nothing left of them, then close the opening of the wound if it is wide: and if not, put over it from the placards that fit on it, and let it heal up until it is well.
¶ De restauratione Furculae, quando frangitur.	The restoration of the fork when it breaks.
Caput VI.	Chapter VI.
Plurimum quidem frangitur Furcula ab anteriore parte ex parte humeri, et fractura eius fit secundum unum trium modorum.	Many things are broken from the front part of the shoulder, and the break in the fork is made according to one of three ways.
Aut enim frangitur et separatur in duo, praeter quod accidant in ea satagiae: et est facilius ad restaurationem eius.	Or if it breaks and separates into two, except that they happen in the sawing: and it is easier to restore it.
Aut ita, quod accidunt in osse satagiae: et est difficilius ad restaurationem.	Or thus, so that they happen in the bone sawing: and it is more difficult to restore.
Aut ita, quod est fractura cum uulnere.	Or thus, so that there is a fracture with the ulna.
Et operatio in ea quando fractura est absque uulnere, est, ut facias praesentes esse duos ministros, ut teneat unus eorum adiutorium quod sequitur Furculam fractam, et alter extendat collum uersus partem.	And the operation in it when the fracture is without the ulna, is, so that you make the two ministers present, so that one of them holds a support to follow the broken fork, and the other extends the neck towards the side.
Deinde aequa fracturam digitis tuis, donec fiat forma eius, secundum quod oportet: et non sit in ea eminentia, neque concauitas.	Then you make the fracture of your fingers equal, until it takes on shape according to what is needed: and it does not stand out in it, nor is it convex.
Quod si indiges extensione plus, tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico infirmi spheram ex panno, aut lana: et sit magnitudo eius secundum quantitatem necessitatis tuae: et extende, et eleua Furculam, et coarta spheram manu tua, donec aeques fracturam, secundum quod oportet.	That if you can bear to extend more, then it should be so that you put under a ball from a cloth or wool: and let the size of it be according to the quantity that you need: and extend it, and smooth out the fork, and crimp the ball with your hand, until the fracture is equal, according to what is needed.
Quod si non potes trahere extremitatem Furculae ad exteriora: propterea, quia peruenit ad profundum: tunc oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et ponas sub humero eius puluinar medium in magnitudine, et premat minister humerum eius ad inferiora, donec eleuetur os Furculae quod est in profundo ad sursum: atque tunc rectifica fracturam, et aequa eam digitis tuis.	If you cannot bring the end of the Furcula to the outside because it goes deep inside: then let the sick person lie down on their chest and place the middle part of a feather under their shoulder blade; and press the shoulder of the sick person towards the lower part, until the bone of the Furcula that is in the depth comes up to the top: and then set the broken bone straight with your fingers and make it equal.
Si autem sentis sathaiatum ex Furcula, et mouetur: tunc oportet, ut findas super illud, et extrahas ipsum alsathaiatum cum facilitate.	If you feel a creak in the Furcula and it moves: then you should find something to put on top of it and take out the creak with ease.
Si autem est retentum in osse, tunc ingenia in incisione eius cum uno Incisoriorum quae praeparasti ad illud, postquam tu posueris sub Furcula instrumentum quod seruat sifach: et est instrumentum ex ligno, aut ex ferro.	If it is stuck in the bone, then take one of the incisorium instruments that you prepared for it and place it under the Furcula after you have placed a lever on top of it to lift it up; and this instrument should be made of wood or iron.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its shape.
Assimilatur cochleari cui non est concauitas.	It is joined to the ear which is not hollowed out.
Et sit latitudo eius secundum illud quo indiges eo ex magnitudine ossis, et paruitate eius.	And its width should be according to the position of your shoulder and its size.
Longitudo uero eius etiam secundum quod possibile est tibi ad operationem.	The length, however, should also be according to what is possible for you to operate.
Et habeat duas extremitates, sicut uides: et extremitas una sit ampla, et altera stricta.	And it has two ends, as you see: and one end should be wide, and the other tight.
Si autem disruptio uulneris quod scidisti quando extraxisti sathaiatum ossis, est ampla, et securaris ab apostemate calido: tunc aggrega duo labia uulneris cum sutura.	If the wound you made while extracting the bone's creak is wide and dries quickly with warm air: then join the two edges of the wound together with a stitch.
Et si disruptio est parua, aut times apostema calidum: tunc imple uulnus cum pannis, et puluillis secundum quantitatem scissurae uulneris.	And if the break is small or you do not have warm air to dry it: then fill the wound with rags and powder according to the amount of the wound's length.
Quod si accidat apostema calidum, tunc infunde pannum in oleo rosato, et aceto, et uino, et pone super ipsum.	If warm air comes, then pour a mixture of rose oil and vinegar and wine on it and place it on top.
Strictura uero ossis quando est absque uulnere, et absque sectione, est, ut ponas super os emplastrum factum ex farina molendini cum albugine oui.	The rigor of the bone is what it is like when there is no wound and no break, that is, when you place a paste made from pounded flour with ash on top of the bone.
Et pone stuppam lenem super ipsum.	And set a stump of wood upon it.
Deinde pone spheram sub titillico eius, si indiges illa.	Then place a ball under its toe, if you can tolerate it.
Deinde accipe himematem, id est, rotam quam tenent Saraceni, quae sit longa ualde: et sit latitudo eius palmi unius, aut circiter illud.	Then take the blood, that is, the bag which the Saracens hold, which is long and very thin: and let its breadth be that of a palm or about it.
Deinde pone puluillum duplicatum super stuppam et emplastrum.	Then place a double layer of cloth on top of the stump and a pad.
Deinde accipe astellam ex tabula subtili, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, et in longitudine similiter.	Then take an Astrolabium from a thin board, whose breadth is that of three fingers, and whose length is similar.
Deinde inuolue eam in panno.	Then wrap it in a cloth.
Deinde inuolue pannum illum cum astella in loco alhimemati qui cadit super fracturam et locum.	Then wrap the cloth with the Astrolabium in the place of alchemy which lies over the fracture and the spot.
Deinde pone alhimemati super fracturam sicut reuoluiur, et inuolue eam super collum eius, et sub titillico eius sano, et sub titillico eius infirmo: et reduc eam super omnem partem, et quomodo uides quod strictura tenet fracturam strictura decenti: et est illud, quod non occultatur super te, et totum, ut non remoueatur astella desuper os fractum.	Then place the alchemy over the fracture like a turban, and wrap it over his neck, and under his healthy toe, and under his unhealthy toe: and reduce it on all sides, and see how the constriction holds the fracture fast: and this is that it does not cover you above, and in whole, so that it does not move the Astrolabium from above the broken nose.
Et propter hoc oportet, ut aspicias infirmum in omni die.	And for this it is necessary, that you should see the sick one every day.
Quotiens ergo mollificatur ligamentum, et uides astellam iam remoueri: tunc rectifica illud, et stringe ligamentum.	Whenever therefore the ligature softens, and you see the Astrolabium start to move: then straighten it, and tighten the ligature.
Deinde pone somnum infirmi super dorsum eius, et pone sub titillico eius apud somnum eius puluinar paruum in nocte, ut cum eo eleuetur adiutorium eius a latere ipsius.	Then place a pillow of medicine behind his back, and under his healthy toe next to his pillow in the night, so that it aids him from its side when he turns.
Eleuatur ergo fractura furculae per eleuationem humeri.	Thus is broken the fracture of the forearm by elevation of the shoulder.
Aut liga brachium eius ad collum ipsius: et non soluas ligamentum, si non accidat in loco accidens ex pruritu, aut ab apostemate, usque ad duodecim dies.	Or bind his arm to his neck: and do not loosen the ligature, if it does not happen to dislodge by itching, or from a change of position, until twelve days have passed.
Deinde renoua emplastrum, si uideris faciem eius ad illud.	Then mend the pad, if you see his face towards that.
Et adde in strictura, et dimitte ipsum, donec restauretur et coaguletur.	And add to the constriction, and let him go, until it is restored and has clotted.
Et fractura quidem furculae stringitur et confortatur secundum plurimum in uigintiocto diebus: et quandoque fit in quibusdam hominibus in minore illo.	The fracture of the femur is also pulled and strengthened after a few days: and sometimes it happens in some people with less strength.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spatulae.	On the restoration of the fracture of the spit.
Caput VII.	Chapter VII.
Raro frangitur Spatula, et in loco lato eius: et non franguntur ex ea nisi margines eius.	Rarely does the spatula break, and in its width place; and do not break from it except its edge.
Quando ergo frangitur ex eo locus, et frangitur in medio eius, et non cognoscitur illud nisi per tactum: tunc secundum quod est figura fracturae conare praeparationem eius.	But when it breaks from it place, and breaks in the middle of it, and is not known that except by touch: then according to what is the shape of the fracture prepare the preparation.
Et reduc eam super figuram naturalem omni modo ingenii, quod est tibi possibile.	And reduce it to the natural form at all your skill, which is possible for you.
Deinde pone super locum puluerem molendini cum albugine oui, et stuppam lenem, et pone desuper puluillum ex panno duplato.	Then put on place powder of grinding with alum, and a stopple of wood, and put above pulse from a doubled cloth.
Deinde pone super ipsum astellam latam ex tabula subtili secundum quantitatem Spatulae totius, aut ampliorem ea parum.	Then put on top of it a thin plate of metal from a thin board according to the quantity of the spatula of all, or larger than that a little.
Si uero sub astella est concauitas in aliquo locorum Spatulae, tunc aequa illam concauitatem cum stuppa leni, donec descendat astella secundum aequalitatem.	But if the bottom is crushed under the plate in some place of the spatula, then make it equal with the stopple of wood, until the plate falls down according to the equality.
Deinde ftringe desuper cum alhimemati longa, constrictione decenti, et firmitudine astellae, donec non remoueatur a loco suo.	Then wipe above with long-haired alkimium, with a pressure of it, and a firmness of the plate, until it does not move away from its place.
Et considera ligamentum in omni die.	And consider the ligature every day.
Quotienscunque ergo mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum, et aequa astellam si remoueatur a loco suo: et iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	Whenever that is softened the ligature, tighten it, and make the plate equal if it moves away from its place: and lie on the injured side on his healthy.
Et Spatula quidem restauratur in uiginti diebus, aut in uigintiquinque diebus.	And the spatula is restored in twenty days, or in twenty-five days.
Quando ergo completur iste numerus, tunc solue ligamentum: et tu sis in securitate.	But when this number is completed, then dissolve the ligature: and you are in safety.
Nam ipsa est ex ossibus quorum communitio non timetur, neque eorum solutio.	For that itself is from bones whose community is not feared, and their solution.
Si autem procedat ex osse frustum, et pungit sub cute: tune scinde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum.	But if it proceeds from an ossicle, and stings under the skin: then cut above on it, and take it off.
Et fac quod diximus in fractura furculae ex sedatione apostematis calidi, si accidat ex eo aliquid.	And do as we have said in the fracture of the fork from the seat of the pus, if anything happens from it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Pectoris.	About restoring the fracture of the breastbone.
Caput VIII.	Chapter VIII.
Pectus quandoque frangitur in medio sui, et raro accidit illud.	The breastbone sometimes breaks in the middle, and this rarely happens.
Extremitates eius quidem plurimum franguntur, et comminuuntur ex accidentibus eius.	The extremities of it are most often broken, and they are destroyed by accidents of it.
Quando frangitur eius medium, quod declinat ad inferiora, et accidit ei dolor uehemens, et difficultas in anhelitu, et tussis: et fortasse euomit sanguinem, et declaratur concauitas in osse fracto, et non occultatur sensui, Restauratio eius est, ut resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et pone inter Spatulas eius puluinar.	When it is broken in the middle, which turns downward toward the lower part, a severe pain takes place, and difficulty in breathing, and perhaps a cough, and he may spit blood, and there seems to be a fracture of the bone, and this is not hidden from feeling, The restoration of it is so that he shall lie down on his back: and let him put under his armpits.
Deinde preme humeros eius, et aggrega costas a duabus partibus uel lateribus cum manibus: et subtiliare in aequatione eius, secundum omnem modum quo possibile est illud et conuenit, donec redeat figura ossis, secundum quod oportet.	Then he shall press his shoulders and bring the ribs together from both sides or from the sides with his hands: and gently adjust him in alignment, according to all possible ways that it may be fitting, until he has restored the shape of the bone, as it should be.
Deinde pone super ipsum emplastrum et stuppam, et pone desuper astellam ex tabula subtili ex salice, aut chalingi, et ex eis similibus in leuitate, postquam tu inuoluis eam in panno.	Then he shall place over him plaster and a board, and put beneath him from the table a light one, made of willow or of holly, and of similar things in a state of lightness, after you have dried it up with cloth.
Deinde subtiliare in ligando eam super os fractum, ut non remoueatur: et uade cum ligatura secundum rotunditatem ad dorsum aliquotiens, et stringe ipsum strictura decenti.	Then gently fasten him with a bandage over the broken bone so that it does not move: and sometimes he shall walk with a limp, going with a tight grip when turning.
Deinde considera ligaturam in omni hora, et quotienscumque mollificatur, stringe eam: et si necessitas eius prouocat ad solutionem eius apud pruritum, uel corrosionem quae accidit in loco, aut dolorem, aut apostema: tunc propera, et solue eam, et eradica emplastrum, et rectifica quod accidit cum modo curationis eius.	Then consider the bandage at every hour, and whenever it becomes soft, tighten it: and if need should prompt its loosening in order to cure an itch, or a rash which has occurred at that place, or pain, or pus: then go through with it, and loose it, and remove the plaster, and set right what has happened in the course of its treatment.
Deinde reduc emplastrum, si uides ad illud faciem: et annecte ei stricturam, donec sanetur.	Then reduce the plaster, if you see toward it: and put on a tight grip, until it is healed.
¶ De restauratione Costarum, quando franguntur.	Regarding the restoration of the ribs, when they are broken.
Caput IX.	Chapter IX.
Scias, quod Costarum fractura non accidit, nisi in locis grossis quae sequuntur dorsum, et ex extremitatibus earum ab anteriori parte.	Know that the fracture of ribs does not occur unless in the places near the back and from the extremities thereof from the anterior part.
Et non accidit eis attritio, nisi propterea, quia sunt cartilaginosae.	And it does not happen to them any attrition, except therefore, because they are cartilage-like.
Et cognitio ipsius non occultatur sensui apud inquisitionem cum digitis.	And the knowledge of this is not hidden from the sense in inquiry when the fingers are probed.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, ut aeques fracturam cum digitis secundum modum possibilem, donec aequetur figura, secundum quod oportet.	And the restoration of it is made so that the equal fracture with the fingers in a possible second way, until it is equal in figure, according to which is necessary.
Deinde emplastra, et stringe os fractum cum astella, si indiget illo.	Then apply an overlay, and tightly fix the broken bone with the splint, if it needs it.
Et si fractura Costarum est decliuis ad interiora: tunc accidit infirmo dolor uehemens, et punctura, sicut punctura illa quae accidit illi qui habet pleuresim: propterea, quod os pungit uelamen, et etiam ei accidit difficultas anhelitus, et tussis, et uomitus sanguinis multi: et haec est difficilis curationis.	And if the fracture of the ribs is hidden to the interior: then it happens to the sick a sharp pain, and a puncturing, like that which happens to him who has pleurisy: for the bone pricks the wound, and also it happens to him that a difficulty in breathing, and coughing, and blood-letting: and this is difficult to cure.
Et iam ingeniati sunt antiqui in ea cum ingeniis multis: et ex eis sunt qui dicunt, ut ponas cibos infirmi qui generent inflammationem et uentositatem, ut inflammetur uenter, et extendatur, et impellatur fractura ad exteriora.	And already the ancients have devised in it with many contrivances: and among them are those who say, Let you place food that generate an inflammation and a ventosity, so that it inflames the belly, and extends, and pushes the fracture towards the exterior.
Nos uero abhorremus, ut non fiat caussa uelox ad faciendum apostema calidum, si non accidit.	But we really despise, so that there is no cause of haste in making an emetic that is hot, if it does not happen.
Si autem iam accidit, tunc addit in eo.	But if it has already happened, then add this to it.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: ponatur super locum uentosa, deinde sugatur cum fortitudine, et est similius ratiocinationi.	And said some of them: Let it be placed on a ventous place, and then suck with strength, and it is similar to reasoning.
Verumtamen timetur, quod attrahat uentosa superfluitates ad locum, propter dispositionem debilitatis.	However, it is feared that the ventosity attracts suppurations to the place, because of the weakness of disposition.
Et dixerunt quidam eorum: oportet ut cooperiatur locus cum lana quae iam submersa est in oleo calido: et ponantur puluilli inter Costas, donec impleatur: ut sit ligatura aequalis quando inuoluis eam secundum rotunditatem.	And said some of them: It is necessary so that the place is covered with wool which has already been immersed in hot oil: and let there be placed down feathers between the ribs, until it is filled up: so that the ligature is equal when it is probed, according to its roundness.
Deinde curetur infirmus curatione pleuresis ex cibo et medicina.	The sick person shall be nursed with food and medicine until he has recovered from the pleurisy.
Quod si coartat infirmum res uehemens, quam non tolerat, et os pungit uelamen punctura laedente, et timemus super infirmum: tunc oportet, ut scindamus super locum, et detegamus a Costa fracta.	If the sick person is being pressed by pain, and if his nose itches or pricks, and we are afraid for the sick man: then we should split him on the spot and detect any broken rib.
Deinde ponamus super ea instrumentum quod conseruat sifac, cuius rememoratio praecessit: et incidamus os cum facilitate, et incidamus ipsum.	Then let us place over it an instrument that keeps it open, of which the memory precedes: and we will easily cut the bone, and we will cut it itself.
Deinde aggregemus duo labia uulneris, si est magnum cum sutura: et curemus ipsum cum emplastris, donec sanetur.	Then let us gather two skin flaps of the wound, if it is large with a stitch: and let us heal him with plasters until he heals.
Quod si accidat interim apostema calidum, tunc propera, et infunde puluillos in oleo rosato, et pone super locum: et curetur infirmus cum eo quod conuenit apostemati.	If it happens during the time of a feverish swelling, then let it approach, and pour flour into rose oil and place it on the spot: and let the sick person be nursed with it as is appropriate for the swelling.
Interim etiam resupinetur super latus super quod dormit, donec sanetur.	In the meantime he shall also lie down on his side where he sleeps until he heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Spondilium dorsi et colli.	For the restoration of a broken spine of the back and neck.
Caput X.	Chapter X
Ossibus quidem colli quandoque aduenit fractura, et raro accidit eis attritio: et similiter Spondilibus dorsi etiam.	Of the bones of the neck when a fracture occurs, and it rarely happens that they are worn out: and likewise to the spines of the back.
Cum ergo accidit illud alicui, et uis scire, an sanetur, an non sanetur: tunc confidera.	But when this happens to someone and you want to know whether it will heal or not: then trust in the Lord.
Nam si uides manus eius iam mollificatas, et stupefactas, et mortuas: et non potest mouere eas, neque extendere eas, neque constringere eas: et quando constringis eas cum digitis tuis, et pungis eas cum acu, non sentit illud, et non sentit in eis dolorem: tunc scias, quia non sanatur, et in pluribus dispositionibus est mortale.	For if you see his hands already softened, and stuporified, and dead: and he cannot be moved or extended or tightened, and when you tighten them with your fingers and prick them with a pin, he does not feel it, and does not feel pain in them: then know that he is not healing, and there are many dispositions that are fatal.
Quod si mouet eas, et sentit in eis constrictionem cum digitis et puncturam: tunc scias, quia nucha ossis salua est, et quod infirmus sanabitur cum curatione.	But if he feels it when you tighten them and prick them: then know that the neck bones are healed, and that the sick person will heal with treatment.
Quod si eueniat Spondilibus dorsi simile illius, et uis scire, an sanetur etiam, an non: tunc considera ad pedes eius: tunc si uides quod mollificati sunt, et accidit in eis illud quod accidit in manibus: deinde quando iacet super dorsum suum, egreditur uentositas et egestio absque uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super uentrem suum, egreditur egestio sine uoluntate: et quando resupinatur super dorsum suum, et uult mingere, et non potest: tunc scias, quia est mortale.	If something similar happens to his back spine, and you want to know whether it will heal or not: then look at his feet: if you see that they are softened, and the same thing happens to them as happened to his hands: then when he lies on his back, he moves and has a desire to go to the toilet, and when he leans on his stomach, he wants to urinate, but cannot: then know that it is fatal.
Non ergo labores in curatione eius.	Therefore, do not interrupt his work.
Si uero non accidit ei aliquid ex illo, res est leuior.	If, however, nothing of this happens to him, the matter is lighter.
Et curatio eius quod accidit ex illo est, ut coneris sedationem apostematis calidi: ita, ut ponas super Spondilem attritam oleum rosatum solum: aut cum uitellis oui assati.	And the cure of him that happens from this is, as you seek to calm inflammation of the hot sweat: so that you put on oil of rose alone: or when you wash with water alone.
Pone super ipsam illud aliquotiens in die, donec quando sedatur apostema calidum: tum pone super locum unum ex emplastris confortantibus, exiccantibus, et stringe super ipsum cum ligamento: et praecipe infirmo, ut utatur quiete et tranquillitate.	Place over it now and then in the day, until he is calmed down with a hot sweat: then place on one spot from healing plasters, drying up, and tightly binding to him with the bandage: and order the sick person to use rest and tranquility.
Nec dormiat super partem cum qua inuenit dolorem, donec sanetur.	And let him not sleep over the part that hurts when he feels pain, until he is healed.
Quod si accidit apud attritionem ossis sathaiatum, aut aliquid quod iam separatum fit ex eo: tunc oportet, ut seces super cutem, et auferas illud.	That if it happens at the separation of a bone's splint, or something that has already been separated from it: then you must, as it separates on the skin, and remove it.
Deinde aggrega duo labia uulneris, si est magnum, cum sutura.	Then gather together the two lips of the wound, if it is large, with a stitch.
Deinde cura ipsum cum aliquo incarnatiuo, ex unguentis, donec sanetur.	Then take care of the person with some meat that has grown on him, from ointment, until he is healed.
Si uero frangitur postremum ossis alhausos, et est finis caudae: tunc oportet, ut intromittas pollicem manus sinistrae in anum, et aeques os fractum manu altera, secundum quod possibile est, et secunda aequatione.	But if, at the end, the hip bone is broken and has come off, and the tail is cut off: then you must, with your left hand, put your thumb into the hole in the hip, and, with your right hand, push it back together as well as possible, and second, by equating it.
Deinde pone super ipsum, et aufer ipsum: et cura uulnus cum curatione quae praecessit, donec sanetur.	Then place over him, and take him away: and take care of the wound with the cure that preceded it, until he is healed.
¶ De restauratione Anchae.	The Restoration of Ankles.
Caput XI.	Chapter XI.
Raro franguntur ossa Ancharum.	Bones of the ankles are rarely broken.
Quod si franguntur, tunc fractura eorum non est, nisi comminutio in extremitatibus ipsorum: et scinduntur in longitudine, et declinantur ad interiora: et accidit infirmo dolor in loco, et punctura: et stupescit crus quod frangitur.	If they are broken, then their fracture is not, unless it is split at the ends of the bones: and they break lengthwise, and bend inward towards the inside: and happens to the person pain in the place, and a bruise: and the leg breaks that is broken.
Et restauratio quidem eius est, ut extendas manum tuam super ipsum, donec stes super fracturam qualiter est figura eius.	And the restoration of it is, as you stretch your hand over it, until you stand over the fracture like this figure:
Quod si fractura est in extremitatibus eius tantum, tunc aequa illam fracturam, secundum quod praeparatur tibi ex aequatione, donec assimiletur figurae suae naturali.	If the fracture is in the extremities of it only, then make that fracture equal, according to how you are prepared from equality, until its figure becomes similar to its natural one.
Si autem fractura est in longitudine, aut iam declinat ad interiora: tunc fac iacere infirmum super uentrem suum, donec praeparetur tibi restauratio illius fracturae.	If, however, the fracture is in its length or already declines towards its insides: then make the sick person lie on his/her stomach, until his/her fracture is prepared for restoration.
Quando ergo aequaueris ipsam, pone super ipsam emplastrum: deinde pone super ipsam astellam ex ligno, aut ex cute: et stringe strictura super quam non timeas permutationem fracturae, neque remotionem astellae.	When, therefore, you have made that equal, put over it a plaster: then put over it an wooden or skin splint: and tightly tighten the straitening over which you do not fear the displacement of the fracture, nor the removal of the splint.
Et aequa concauitatem illorum cum eo quod impleat eam, donec capiat eam strictura secundum aequalitatem: et praecipe infirmo, ut dormiat super dorsum suum, aut super latus suum sanum.	And when those equalities have come together with it so that it fills it, until it receives that stricture according to the equality: and order the sick person to sleep on his/her back or on his/her healthy side.
Si autem accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc cessa ab extensione eius, et ipsius restauratione, donec sedetur apostema calidum: et pone super ipsum quod sedet ipsum, secundum quod praecessit, deinde redi ad restaurationem eius: et stringe ipsum sicut oportet.	If, however, there occurs to him a hot swelling: then cease from extending it, and from its restoration, until the hot swelling subsides: and put over him what sits, according to what has preceded, then return to its restoration: and tightly bind him as is necessary.
Si uero accidit in osse satagie, aut comminuitur, extrahe.	If, however, it has happened that the bone is stuck or broken, extract it.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Adiutorii.	The assistant for the restoration of a fracture
Caput XII.	Chapter XII:
Adiutorium est illud, quod est inter cubitum usque ad caput Spatulae.	The aid is that which is between the bed and the head of the spoon.
Si ergo frangitur, tunc restauratio eius est secundum unum duorum modorum.	If it is then broken, its restoration is according to two ways.
Quorum unus est: ut accipias lignum planum mediae grossitudinis, secundum hanc formam, quae sequitur.	The one is that you take a flat piece of wood of medium thickness, according to this form, which follows.
Et ligentur in duabus extremitatibus duo ligamenta.	And bind together with two straps the two extremities.
Deinde suspendatur ex loco eleuato: et sedeat infirmus super sedem.	Then hang it from a raised place: and let the sick person sit on a seat.
Deinde proiiciat brachium suum fractum super lignum, donec perueniat ad titillicum eius, in cuius medio sit annexa curuitas ligni.	Then let him throw his broken arm over the wood, until it reaches to its touch-point, in which middle sits an annexed piece of wood.
Deinde suspende desuper ipsum aliquid graue, ut extendat ipsum minister ad inferiora.	Then hang from above the person some heavy thing, so that he extends his arm towards the lower one.
Deinde aequet medicus fracturam manibus suis simul, donec redeat fractura, secundum quod oportet.	Then let the physician break the bones in his hands at once, until the fracture has healed, as it is necessary.
Et modus alter est, ut resupinetur infirmus super ceruicem suam: et suspende manum eius a collo ipsius cum ligamento.	And another mode is that he should lie on his back upon his breast, and hang his hand from his neck with a bandage.
Deinde praecipe duobus ministris, ut teneat unus eorum illud quod est supra fracturam cum manibus suis: et ut alter teneat inferius eius, et extendat unusquisque eorum ad partem suam.	Then order two servants, that one of them should hold this which is above the fracture with his hands: and that the other should hold below him, and should stretch both of them on either side.
Et si uis, ut sit extensio fortior, tunc stringe sub fractura cum ligamento, et supra ipsam cum ligamento alio: et extendat ea unusquisque duorum ministrorum ad duas partes suas.	And if you will that the extension be stronger, then bind beneath the fracture with a bandage, and above it with another bandage: and should stretch both of them on either side.
Si ergo fractura est propinqua extremitati humeri, tunc oportet, ut ponatur unum ligamentum sub titillico, et alterum sub fractura uersus cubitum.	If then the fracture is near the end of the arm, then it is necessary that there be placed one bandage under the joint, and another under the fracture toward the hip.
Et similiter si fractura est propinqua cubito: tunc oportet, ut ponatur ligamentum super illum locum, et super cubitum ipsum.	And likewise if the fracture is near the hip: then it is necessary that there be placed a bandage on that place, and on the hip itself.
Deinde aequa fracturam cum facilitate absque labore, donec quando aequatur fractura secundum quod oportet, et applicatur applicatione bona: tunc stringe eam, si non accidit apostema calidum.	Then break the fracture with ease without labor, until it is made equal when it has healed: and then apply the bandage well: then bind it if there does not occur a swelling warm.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam usque ad diem septimum.	If then a swelling warm occurs: then let go of the binding until the seventh day.
Et pone super ipsum lanam succidam imbibitam in aceto et oleo rosato, donec quando quiescit apostema: tunc stringe eam: et modus stringendi eam est, ut ponas emplastrum super fracturam.	And place on him wool which is soaked in vinegar and oil of roses, until it has stopped the swelling: then bind it: and the mode of binding it is that you should place a plaster upon the fracture.
Deinde pone inuolutionem ex panno nouo super emplastrum.	Then place an innovation from new cloth upon the plaster.
Deinde aggreget brachium super adiutorium ipsum, et ponat manum suam apertam super humerum suum.	Then let the assistant take the arm and put it on the shoulder: and he shall put his hand open upon the shoulder.
Et pone pannum, et stringe super adiutorium brachium, ut brachium stet loco astellarum: si non prohibet te ab illo aliquid, neque alteretur super te aliquid ex osse fracto.	And place a cloth, and bind above the assistant's arm so that the arm stand in the place of the stars: if he does not forbid you to do anything, and does not change about you anything out of a broken bone.
Quod si times, quod alteretur super te ex osse fracto aliquid, tunc utere astellis: et est, ut ponas super fracturam ipsam astellam quae sit latior et fortior reliquis astellis.	That if you should find that there changes about you anything out of a broken bone: then use stars: and it is that you should place upon the fracture a star which is wider and stronger than the other stars.
Et ponas inter omnem astellam latitudinem digiti: et sit longitudo astellarum secundum fracturam cum additione trium digitorum ab omni parte.	Place the splint between all the fingers with a width that corresponds to the length of the fingers, and make it so that there are three fingers' lengths from one side to the other end of the fracture plus three more finger-lengths.
Deinde stringe super astellas strictura quam dixi in principio capituli.	Then tie tightly with a string over the splints as I described at the beginning of this chapter.
Et est, ut sit strictura tua super locum fracturae strictior.	And it is so that your tension on the splints should be stricter than the place of fracture.
Et quanto plus elongatur fractura, sit strictura minor.	And to the extent that the fracture lengthens, the tension should be lessened.
Si ergo uides situm astellarum et stricturam, sicut diximus, in hora qua restauras membrum statim, tunc fac: et si times apostema calidum, tunc dimitte stricturam et astellas usque ad diem septimum, sicut diximus.	If then you see that the splints are long and the tension is strong, as we have said, in the hour when you restore the limb to life, then do so: but if you wait for the swelling to go down, then remove the splints and the bandages until the seventh day, as we have said.
Deinde considera ligamentum in omnibus tribus diebus, ut non accidat in loco pruritus, aut inflatio, aut prohibeatur cibus peruenire ad membrum, propter dispositionem superfluitatis stricturae.	Then examine the ligaments in all three days so that there will not be a prickly feeling, or swelling, or prevention of food from reaching the limb, due to the tension on the swelling.
Rectifica ergo illud totum, secundum quod diximus.	So make it right again as we have said above.
Si uero es super fiduciam, ut non accidat ex illo aliquid: tunc non soluas ligamentum, nisi post tres dies, aut plus.	But if you are in doubt, so that there is no risk of anything from it: then do not remove the ligaments until after three days or longer.
Et sit dormitio infirmi super dorsum suum, et manus eius super stomachum suum: et pone sub adiutorio culcitram plenam lana aequaliter.	And lie on his back with his hands on his belly and put under his pillow a stuffed cushion made of wool.
Et considera in omni hora noctis, aut diei, ut non soluatur figura membri fracta, aut mollificetur ligamentum.	Consider this at all times, whether night or day, so that the broken limb does not move around and the ligaments do not become loose.
Rectifica ergo illud totum uirtute tua.	So make it right again with your own power.
Et pone cibum infirmi secundum ordinem quem praemisimus, ita ut sit cibus subtilis in primis, donec incipiat os stringi: tunc oportet, ut ingrosses cibum eius.	And set before him food according to the order that we have described, so that there is light food at first, until the jaw begins to close: then it should become heavier.
De consuetudine enim adiutorii et cruris est, ut stringatur in quadraginta diebus: tunc ergo oportet, ut soluatur, et administretur balneum, et medicetur cum unguentis quae rectificant illud.	For the habit of helping and of the limbs is that it should be strict for forty days; then it should be loosened, and given a bath, and treated with ointment that makes it right.
Quod si fractura fuerit foeda, attrita: tunc non soluas ab ea ligamentum et astellas usque ad quinquaginta dies, et usque ad duos menses.	If the fracture has been broken, ground down: then do not remove the ligaments and splints until after fifty days and up to two months.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Brachii.	On the restoration of fractures of the brachial bone.
Caput XIII.	Chapter XIII On the restoration of fractures of the brachial bone
Brachium est compositum ex duobus ossibus, quae nominantur duo focilia.	The arm is made up of two bones called the humerus and ulna.
Quorum unum est paruum: et est illud quod sequitur pollicem.	One of these is small, and it is that which follows the thumb.
Et alterum est magnum, et est illud quod est positum sub paruo ab inferiori parte.	The other is large, and it is that which is placed below the little finger on the lower part.
Fortasse ergo frangitur focile maius solum, aut paruum: et fortasse franguntur simul.	Perhaps then, only one of the bones breaks, or both break at the same time.
Quando ergo frangitur focile paruum superius, tunc restauratio eius est facilis, et sanatio eius est facilior.	When therefore one of the bones breaks above, then is its restoration easy and its healing easier.
Et quando frangitur focile inferius, est fractura eius mala, et sanatio eius difficilis.	And when one of the bones breaks below, it is a bad fracture, and its healing is difficult.
Et deterior ea est, quando franguntur duo ossa simul.	And it is worse when both bones break at the same time.
Si ergo os quod frangitur est focile parum superius, tunc conuenit medico apud restaurationem eius, ut ponat extensionem paruam cum facilitate, donec aequet ipsum.	If therefore the broken bone is the little humerus above, then it is fitting for the doctor to restore it with ease, that he extend the small one properly, until it is even with it.
Si uero focile magnum est illud quod fractum est: tunc oportet, ut ponat stricturam fortiorem ualde.	But if the broken bone is the big one: then let it be, that he restore it with a stronger bandage, tightly bound.
Et oportet, ut ponat figuram manus apud restaurationem eius, et ipsius extensionem extensam super puluinar.	And let him set the hand in its place, and its extension above the little finger.
Et sit pollex manus ad superiora altior omnibus digitis: et sit articularis inferior omnibus digitis, uel reliquis: et infirmus sedens quadratus super seipsum, et sit puluinar coram eo, uel in directo eius, in altitudine, ut non incurrat infirmus laborem.	And let the thumb of the hand be set at a higher level than all the fingers; and let the articular inferior be set for all the fingers, or for some of them; and let it rest sitting on its haunches, and let the little finger face it, or directly in front of it, in height, so that it does not suffer from any trouble.
Deinde extendat minister Brachium ab inferiori parte, aut manu sua, aut cum ligamento.	Then let him extend the arm from its lower part, or with his hand, or with a bandage.
Et minister alius extendat desuper similiter.	And another one of them should extend it from above.
Deinde aequet medicus os, donec reducat ipsum secundum meliorem figuram quam potest.	Then let the doctor adjust the bone until he has set it in a better position than he can achieve.
Quod si in fractura ossis sunt satagiae, tunc conare reducere omne frustum in loco suo uirtute tua.	If there are any fractures that are out of place, then strive to restore all the bones to their places with your skill.
Si uero apparet in eo sathaiatum separatum, et pungit cutem, et non est tibi spes in restauratione eius: tunc finde super ipsum, et aufer ipsum secundum modum quem diximus in eis quae praemissa sunt.	But if it seems to you that there is a fracture of the bone and it stings the skin, and there is no hope of restoring it: then remove it according to the manner which we have spoken of in those which precede.
Si autem fractura est cum uulnere, ego iam feci ad illud capitulum singulare, ergo accipe curationem illius inde.	If, however, there is a fracture with the radius, I have already done so to that singular chapter, therefore take care of it from that side.
Quod si accidat in principio tuae restaurationis apostema calidum, tunc line pannum cum caeroto facto ex oleo rosato, et caera alba, et sit medium inter spissitudinem et subtilitatem: et stringe pannum super ipsum strictura subtili, donec quando sedatur apostema: tunc remoue caerotum, et pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum albumine oui.	If, however, in the beginning of your restoration there is a warm swelling, then take a thin cloth made of linen, blue in color, and place it between the thickness and thinness: and tightly bind the cloth to the stricture with care, until the swelling sits down: then stir up the liniments, and put on an emulsion prepared from fine flour ground with albumin.
Deinde pone astellas, et sit astella quae ponitur super fracturam ipsam latior parumper, et fortior.	Then put on the splints, and let the splint that is placed on the fracture be a little wider and stronger.
Et scias, quod numerus astellarum Brachii est sex in pluribus dispositionibus: siue sit fractura in focili uno, aut in duobus focilibus simul.	And know that the number of splints for the arm is six in various dispositions: whether the fracture is in one shaft or in two shafts at once.
Deinde pone stricturam tuam super locum fracturae fortiorem et uehementiorem, et aliquanto plus cum strictura ad superiora fracturae, aut ad inferiora eius: aut pone stricturam molliorem strictura eius parumper, secundum quod praecessit rememoratio eius in principio capituli.	Then place your splint on the location of the fracture, stronger and more robust, and somewhat more with the splint towards the upper fracture, or towards the lower part: or place a softer splint on the splint, according to what preceded the memory of it at the beginning of the chapter.
Et sint panni qui inuoluuntur super fracturam, panni lenes, humidi: et non sint duri, asperi.	And let there be cloths wrapping around the fracture, soft cloths, moist: and let them not be hard, rough.
Et sit filum quo stringitur ex lino proprie, medium inter subtile et grossum, sicut narrauimus.	And let there be a thread that is tied with linen itself, between thinness and thickness, as we have said.
Et considera membrum et ligamentum post dies.	And consider the member and the ligaments after some days.
Quod si accidat aliquid cuius rectificatio sit necessaria, sicut pruritus qui accidit membro: tunc oportet, ut embroces membrum cum aqua calefacta, donec quiescat ille pruritus, et dimittas membrum non constrictum, donec quiescat, deinde itera stricturam.	If anything that requires correction happens, such as a rash that occurs in the member: then one should soak the member with hot water, until that itch subsides, and remove the member not constricted, until it subsides, and then repeat the splint.
Quod si strictura iam mollificata est, et os iam remotum, et similia illis: tunc rectifica illud totum uirtute tua, et considera iterum.	If the stricture has already been softened, and the bone has already receded, and similar things: then repair it completely with your skill, and consider again.
Nam si nutrimentum prohibetur peruenire ad membrum, propter superfluitatem stricturae, tunc oportet, ut mollifices ipsum parumper, et dimittas ipsum aliquot diebus, donec currat ad ipsum nutrimentum, deinde stringe ipsum.	For if nourishment is prevented from reaching the member, because of too much stricture: then one should make it a little softer, and remove it for a few days, until it heals up, and then bind it tightly.
Si autem non accidit infirmo aliquid eorum quae diximus, tunc non oportet, ut soluatur, nisi post uiginti dies, aut circiter hos.	But if some of those things we said do not happen to the sick person in question, then it is not necessary that he be cured unless after twenty days or so.
Deinde suspendatur manus infirmi ad collum eius.	Then his hand that was injured should be suspended from his neck.
Et sit collum eius aequale, et custodiatur uirtute sua a motibus agitatiuis.	And his neck should be made level and guarded with strength against movements.
Et fac eum dormire super dorsum suum.	And let him sleep on his back.
Et scias, quod haec fractura in triginta diebus, aut in triginta duobus diebus restauratur: et fortasse restauratur in uigintiocto diebus.	And know that this fracture is restored in twenty days, or in thirty-two; and perhaps it will be restored in thirty days.
Totum illud est secundum dispositiones complexionum, et dispositiones uirtutis.	All of this depends on the condition of the skin and the strength of the body.
¶ De restauratione fracturarum Manus.	Of the restoration of broken hands.
Caput XIIII.	Chapter XXII.
Scias, quod pectini Manus, et nodis digitorum raro accidit fractura.	You should know that it is rare for a fracture to occur in the knuckles and joints of the fingers.
Et non accidit ei, nisi attritio multotiens.	And it does not happen to him unless there is repeated rubbing.
Quando ergo accidit plantae fractura, aut attritio: tunc oportet, ut sedeat infirmus quadratus: et coram eo sit sedes secundum aequalitatem.	When, therefore, the fracture has occurred or the bruising, then the sick person should sit on a level seat; and before him should be placed a second seat at equal distance.
Deinde pone Manum eius super eam extensam.	Then place his hand on that, extended.
Deinde extendat minister ossa fracta, et aequet ea medicus, donec quando coniunguntur coniunctione bona.	Then the surgeon should make the bones that are broken join together with good union.
Tunc oportet, ut ponat emplastrum et stuppam, si non accidat apostema calidum.	Then he should put on a poultice and a bandage, if there does not occur a hot swelling.
Deinde pone astellam desuper secundum quantitatem loci: et tu iam inuoluisti eam in panno lini.	Then place the splint from above, according to the quantity of space on the skin; and you have already bound it with linen thread.
Si autem fractura est ad inferiora circiter uentrem plantae, tunc fac simile spherae ex panno: et praecipe infirmo, ut coartet super eam cum planta sua fracta: deinde stringatur cum panno longo.	If the fracture is below the knee, then make a sort of ball out of linen cloth; and direct the sick person to put it on with his injured leg: then tie it tightly with long linen thread.
Et sit astella ex corio, in quo sit lenitas, ut applicetur corium cum corpore plantae: et stringe eam, secundum quod oportet.	And let him sit on a splint made of linseed, so that it is soft, in order to apply the linseed to the body with the injury: and tie it tightly, according as it is needed.
Si autem fractura est ad exteriora, tunc oportet: ut ponas astellam desuper, et astellam aliam ab inferiori in planta: et sit manus aperta recta.	If the fracture is on the outside, then you should place a splint from above and another one from below the injury; and let the hand be held open and straight.
Deinde pone stricturam, sicut reuoluitur manus: et extende inter digitos cum ligamento.	Then put on the splint, as the hand turns, and extend between the fingers with the ligament.
Quod si accidat fractura alicui nodorum digitorum, tunc si est pollex, aequetur secundum quod oportet.	If a bone of any finger is fractured, then if it is the thumb, it should be made equal according to what is necessary.
Deinde stringatur cum planta: et si amas, pone ei astellam rectam, paruam: ut eleuetur fractura, et non moueatur.	Then tie it with the sole of the foot: and if you wish, put a straight stick under it so that it may not move, in order that the fracture may heal without moving.
Si autem fractura est reliquis digitis, sicut medio, et indici, aut auriculari, et anulari, tunc aequetur, et ligetur cum digito sano qui sequitur eum: aut ligentur omnes secundum continuationem: et est melius.	If the fracture is in any of the remaining fingers, such as the middle, index, or ring finger, then it should be made equal and tied to the healthy finger that follows it: or all of them should be tied together according to their length, and this is better.
Aut pone super ipsum astellam paruam, sicut diximus in pollice.	Or put a stick on top of it, as we have said for the thumb.
Et considera in restauratione tua, et post ipsam dispositionem apostematis calidi: et oppone cum eo quod oportet, quando accidit aliquid ex illo, secundum quod iteratur eius narratio.	And consider this in your restoration, and after that arrangement of the splints, warm them with hot water: and oppose to it whatever is necessary, when anything happens from it, according to what he tells us.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Coxae.	On the Restoration of a Fracture of the Hip
Caput XV.	CHAPTER XV.
OS Coxae multotiens frangitur, et declaratur sensui: quoniam conuertitur ad interiorem et posteriorem partem.	The hip bone often breaks and is felt: because it turns toward the inner and back parts.
Et restauratio eius fit ita, quod stringitur ligamentum supra fracturam, et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	And its restoration is such that one ligature is tied above the fracture, and another ligature is tied below the fracture.
Et infirmus prostretur super faciem suam.	And the sick person extends his hand on his face.
Deinde extendat omne ligamentum minister ad partem suam secundum aequalitatem: et hoc, quando est fractura in medio ossis.	Then he should extend all the ligaments for their sides according to equality: and this is done when the fracture is in the middle of the bone.
Si autem est fractura propinqua radici Coxae, tunc sit ligamentum ad partem pectinis, ut cadat extensio ad sursum: et ligamentum aliud sub fractura.	If the fracture is near the root of the hip bone, then one ligature should be on the side of the pelvis so that it hangs down to the top: and another ligature should be below the fracture.
Et sic similiter si est fractura propinqua genu, tunc sit ligamentum propinquum genu, ut sit extensio ad inferiora.	And in the same way, if the fracture is near the knee joint, then one ligature should be near the knee joint so that it hangs down to the bottom: and another ligature should be below the fracture.
Deinde aequet medicus os utriusque manibus suis, donec reducat ipsum secundum similitudinem figurae naturalis: et coniugatur os coniunctione bona.	Then the doctor should make the two hands equal to each other until he has reduced them according to their natural form: and the bones should be joined by a good joint.
Tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum et stricturam, si non accidit membro apostema.	Then it is necessary that you put on plaster and tighten it, if a member does not happen to have an aposteme.
Quod si accidat in eo apostema: tunc dimitte ipsum diebus aliquot, donec sedetur apostema calidum, deinde redi ad curationem tuam.	That if it should happen to have an aposteme: then let him dismiss himself for a few days, until the heat has seized it, and then return to your cure.
Strictura autem eius ita sit.	But tighten it so that it is like this.
Oportet ut inuoluas super fracturam imema duram, id est, bindam: et dupla eam bis, aut ter: et remaneat ex ea superfluitas.	It is necessary that you wrap him up tightly on the fracture, that is to say, tie him: and leave twice as much of it, or three times: and let remain from it what is superfluous.
Deinde inuolue crus, donec perueniat calcaneus apud radicem natis.	Then wrap the leg, until the foot has grown back at the root.
Et intromitte filum longum inter Coxam et crus prope genu ad inferiora, et ueniant extremitates fili a superiori parte duarum partium.	And introduce a long thread between the pelvis and the leg near the knee towards the bottom, and make the ends of the thread come from the upper part of the two members.
Deinde reuolue super Crus et Coxam quod superfluit ex alimema.	Then tighten the leg and the pelvis so that what is superfluous comes out of the loop.
Deinde pone super Coxam in loco fracturae ipsius astellas, et pone ex eis astellam unam super os cruris.	Then put on top of the pelvis in the place of the fracture the stars, and put from them one star on the bone of the leg.
Deinde imple uacuitates inter crus et coxam cum pannis lenibus, ut aequetur strictura.	Then fill with dry leaves between the leg and the pelvis with soft leaves so that the tension is even.
Deinde incipe cum strictura forti a medio super locum fracturae tribus inuolutionibus, aut quatuor.	Then begin with the strong tension from the middle on three twists, or four.
Et quanto plus elongaris cum ligamento a loco fracturae, sit strictura tua minor et mollior, et lenior.	And the more you lengthen it with a rope from the place of the fracture, your tension will be smaller and softer, and gentler.
Deinde intende ad duas extremitates fili, quod tu intromisisti inter coxam et crus.	Then turn to both ends of the thread that you introduced between the pelvis and the leg.
Liga ergo cum utrisque tres astellas quae sunt desuper.	Tie it with the three stars that are above.
Deinde uade cum duabus extremitatibus fili ad inferiora, donec peruenias ad cauillam pedis.	Then turn the two ends of the thread towards the bottom, until you reach the toe of the foot.
Et cum utrisque stringe etiam extremitates astellarum a parte altera: ut non remoueatur ligamentum ex loco suo.	And tie both ends of the thread as well as the ends of the stars from the other side: so that the ligament does not move from its place.
Deinde dimitte stricturam super illud, dum permanet, ita quod non accidat membro corrosio, neque apostema, neque inflatio, et similia eis.	Then dismiss the tension on it while it remains like that so that there does not happen to a member corrosion, or an apostema, or an inflation, and similar things to it.
Quod si accidat aliquid ex illo.	That if anything should happen from it.
Propera ergo cum solutione eius, et rectifica illud quod accidit inde totum, secundum quod diximus multotiens.	Therefore, with respect to his solution, and adjust that which happened from there completely, as we have said many times.
Si uero in osse est frustum ex osse quod pungat: tunc oportet, ut aeques illud, si est tibi possibile.	But if a fragment of bone pricks the bone: then it is necessary, like that, if you can, to smooth out.
Et si non, finde super illud, et remoue illud: et cura cum eo cuius praecessit rememoratio, donec sanetur.	And if not, find on top of it, and move it: and take care with that which preceded it, until it heals.
Et quandoque stringitur haec fractura Coxae, praeter quod addantur ei astellae, sicut diximus in adiutorio et brachio.	And when this fracture is contracted in the hips, besides adding stars to it, as we have said in the leg and arm.
Verumtamen in restauratione eius taliter fracta, non accidit infirmo claudicatio.	However, in restoring it so that the broken one does not cause a limp.
Et si restauratur sola, praeter quod applicetur ei crus alterum, tunc necesse est, ut claudicet ille cuius est, semper.	And if restored alone, besides being applied to the other leg, then it is necessary that he who has it limps always.
Et scias, quod Coxa stringitur in quinquaginta diebus, uel additur parum, aut minuitur parum: totum illud est secundum diuersitatem complexionum, et reliquarum dispositionum.	And you should know that the hip is contracted in fifty days, or added a little, or shortened a little: all this is according to the diversity of complexions, and the remains of dispositions.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Rotulae genu.	Regarding the restoration of the fracture of the knuckle of the knee joint.
Caput XVI.	Chapter XVI.
Scias, quod Rotulae genu raro accidit fractura, sed accidit ei attritio multotiens.	You should know that the knuckle of the knee is rarely fractured, but it often occurs through wear and tear.
Si uero accidit ei fractura, tunc non nisi aut fissura, aut foramen in partibus suis.	But if it has occurred to him a fracture, then there is no doubt that it is either a crack or a hole in its parts.
Et est illud cum uulnere, et absque uulnere.	And it is like the wound and without the wound.
Et statur super illud totum cum sensu.	And he stands above all that with respect to sense.
Et restauratio eius est ita, ut aequetur quod disruptum est ex partibus eius cum digitis, donec aggregetur, et coniungatur secundum quod possibile est ex aequatione et facilitate, et fabricatione.	And the restoration of it is so that it equalizes what has been broken from its parts with the fingers, until it coheres, and joins together according to what is possible from adjustment and convenience, and manufacture.
Deinde pone emplastrum ex farina sisami, uel molendini, cum albumine oui: et pone super ipsum astellam rotundam, si indiges illa: et stringe desuper strictura conueniente ad illud.	Then put a plaster of rice flour, or flour that has been crushed and mixed with albumen: and put over it a round star, if you can bear it: and tightly tighten the upper part to it with respect to that.
Deinde considera omnes dispositiones quas narrauimus in reliquis fracturis: sicut apostema calidum, et similia illi: ita, ut opponas omni accidenti cum eo quod conuenit ei, donec sanetur.	Then consider all the dispositions that we have described in the remaining fractures: such as blisters, heat, and their like: so that you oppose any accident to it when it coheres with it, until it heals.
¶ De restauratione fracturae Cruris.	Of restoring broken bones of the leg.
Caput XVII.	Chapter XVII.
Scias, quod Cruri sunt duo ossa, quorum unum est grossum, et nominatur nomine Cruris: et alterum subtile, et nominatur Focile.	Know that there are two bones of the leg, one is thick and called the leg bone; and the other is fine and called the fibula.
Et accidit utrisque ex speciebus fracturae quod accidit duobus ossibus brachii: et propter illud fit restauratio eius, sicut restauratio brachii aequaliter, et operatio est una.	And it happens to both species of fracture that occurs in the two bones of the arm: and for this one is made the restoration thereof as is the restoration of the arm equally, and the operation is one.
Quod si franguntur duo ossa simul, conuertitur Crus ad omnes partes.	That if both bones break at the same time, the leg becomes bent in all parts.
Et si frangitur os subtilius, conuertitur Crus ad anteriorem partem.	And if only the fine bone breaks, then the leg bends forward.
Et si frangitur os grossius, inuenis illud inferius: et est ex eis quae non occultantur tibi.	And if only the thick bone is broken, it twists downward: and that is of those which do not hide from you.
Deinde administra extensionem, et aequationem, et ligationem astellarum secundum illud aequaliter.	Then administer the extension, and the equalization, and the binding of the joints by means of bandages equally.
Verumtamen oportet, si fractura Cruris est fractura foeda, habens sethagie multa: ut sit extensio minor, et lenior alleuiatione tua.	However, if the fracture of the leg is a bad fracture, it has many complications: so that there be less extension, and milder alleviation to thee.
Et in Crure quidem est ex operatione quiddam super brachium: et est, ut quando tu aequas astellas, et comples omnem operationem tuam, tunc accipe duas fascias ex ligno pini, quod administratur in fabricatione solariorum quod ponitur sub tabulis: et fiunt ex spatulis palmae: et elige ex eis quibus est grossitudo parua, et neque sint ex minutis: et sit longitudo earum secundum longitudinem Cruris a genu usque inferius.	And in the leg itself is some operation on the arm; and it is, as when you make the joints equal, and do all your work, then take two strips of pine wood, which are employed in the making of splints which are laid under tables: and they are made from the palm leaves: and choose out of them those that have a little thickness, and there be none of the small ones: and make the length thereof according to the length of the leg from the knee down below.
Deinde inuolue super unamquamque pannum duabus inuolutionibus secundum longitudinem eius.	Then wrap up on a single cloth of two folds, making an overlap on each side according to its length.
Et pone unam partem Cruris a parte una, et alteram a parte altera: et sint ex genu usque inferius pedis.	And place one end of the leg from one side, and the other end from the other side: and let them be from the knee down to the foot.
Deinde liga duas fascias in tribus locis ex duabus extremitatibus et medio.	Then bind the two strips on three sides from the two ends and the middle.
Cum enim strictura prohibetur, Crus declinat ad dextram et sinistram, et stat statione bona.	Since when tightness is forbidden, the leg leans to the right and to the left, and remains in good position.
Et iam quidem administretur cunabulum ex ligno secundum longitudinem Cruris, et ponatur in eo Crus, ut conseruet ipsum a motu.	And also let a wooden splint be made according to the length of the leg, and let it be placed therein so that it may preserve itself from motion.
Et plurimum quidem oportet, ut facias illud in fractura quando cum ea est uulnus proprie.	Indeed, it is very important that you make that when the fracture is a proper fracture.
Deinde considera Crus in omni die, et stude cum eo studio ultimo ab apostemate, aut inflatione, aut reliquis aliis.	Then consider the leg every day, and with great care try to prevent it from becoming infected, or inflated, or otherwise.
Si ergo accidit aliquid ex illis, tunc oppone ei cum eo quod oportet, usquequo sanetur, si Deus uoluerit.	If then any of these things happen, then oppose it with him as much as is necessary, until he recovers his health, if God wills.
De fractura ossium Pedis, et Digitorum.	Regarding the fracture of the bones of the foot and toes:
Caput XVIII.	Chapter XVIII:
Calcaneo quidem non accidit fractura penitus.	The heel bone does not have a deep fracture.
Ossibus uero Pedis accidit quandoque fractura, et Digitis parum etiam accidit fractura: et non accidit eis nisi attritio in pluribus dispositionibus.	However, when the fracture of the bones of the foot does occur, and when the toes also have a small fracture, it only occurs in many cases of abrasion.
Quod si accidit ossibus Pedis fractura, et uides illa ossa sublimari super se adinuicem, tunc ponat infirmus Pedem suum super terram praeparatam, sicut ambulans.	If a fracture occurs in the bones of the foot and you see those bones slip over one another from side to side, then place the injured foot on the ground as if walking.
Deinde sta tu, et pone Pedem tuum super illud quod eleuatur ex illis ossibus: postea preme, uel calca eam: et aequa ipsam, donec redeat in locis suis.	Then stand still, and place your foot on that which will elevate the bones: then press or trample it, and make it equal by applying pressure until they are all back in their places.
Deinde pone emplastrum, et stuppam desuper: et pone sub uentre Pedis tabulam paruam, cui sint duo capita plana.	Then place a plaster on top of it, and put a board underneath: and place under the foot a thin panel with two flat ends.
Deinde stringe eam cum Pede strictura decenti, postquam tu inuoluis eam cum pannis, et reliquis quibus indiget.	Then tighten it with a tight bandage when you have wrapped it and left it alone.
Cum ergo praetereunt ei tres dies, aut quatuor, tunc solue ligamentum.	When then after three or four days, then loosen the bandages.
Nam tu inuenies ossa aequata, siue sint fracta, aut sint dislocata.	For you will find that the bones are even, or if any of them are fractured or displaced.
Operatio ergo in eis est, sicut uides.	The operation then is as follows: as you see it.
Si autem franguntur aliqui digiti, tunc restaura eos, et aequa ipsos secundum quod narraui tibi in restauratione digitorum manus.	If any of the toes are fractured, then restore them, and make them equal according to what you have told me about the restoration of toe bones.
Deinde pone digito tuo astellam secundum longitudinem digiti, et sit latior eo parumper: deinde pone sub Pede hanc tabulam quam narraui tibi, et stringe eam strictura decenti.	Then place your finger with a wooden splint according to the length of your finger, and make it about as wide: then place under the foot the same panel that you have told me about, and tighten it tightly when you walk.
Si uero quod frangitur ex ossibus est duo, aut tria, aut plus, tunc pone super omnem digitum astellam suae quantitatis, inuolutam in panno lini: et stringe tabulam in inferiori Pedis: et sit stans super unum capitum tabulae extra uentrem Pedis, ut teneat retentione bona.	If it is broken from the bones, then two, or three, or more, then put a star on top of all the fingers of its size, rolled up in a cloth: and tighten the table in the lower foot; and stand over one head of the table outside the vent of the foot, so that he holds by good retention.
Et conuenit tibi, ut non obliuiscaris, quin consideres omnia quae dixi tibi in reliquis fracturis ex accidentibus quae diximus: et oppone omni accidenti cum eo quod oportet.	And it is fitting that you do not forget, but you consider all that I have said to you in the remaining fractures from the accidents which we have spoken of: and oppose all accident with him that it is necessary.
¶ De fractura Vuluae mulieris, et ossis pectinis, et uirgae uiri.	On the fracture of the woman's femur, and of the spine, and of the man's pelvis.
Caput XIX.	Chapter XIX: On the fracture of the femur in women
Quando frangitur Vulua mulieris, tunc fac eam sedere quadratam.	When the femur is broken in a woman, then make her sit square.
Deinde inclina eam ad partem dorsi ipsius parumper, et teneatur retro.	Then lean her back slightly, and hold her by the rear.
Deinde impleat obstetrix Vuluam eius coto, donec impleat eam: et fiat in Vulua ex eo sicut sphera.	Then fill the woman' with the hand of the obstorger, until she is filled: and let her be in the female part like a sphere.
Deinde concutiatur mulier, et eleua dorsum eius paulatim.	Then shake the woman, and raise her back slowly.
Illud enim cotum egreditur, donec fiat ante portam Vuluae sicut sphera, et os fractum redit.	For that hand moves, until it is before the door of the woman like a sphere, and the broken jaw returns.
Deinde pone puluillum super dorsum eius.	Then put a little ball on her back.
Quando ergo uult mingere, remoueat cotum cum facilitate, deinde mingat: et reduc ipsum secundum modum, quo intromisisti ipsum in primis: deinde redeat ad puluillum suum primum.	When, therefore, she wants to urinate, the hand moves with ease, and then urinates: and reduces it according to the way that you put it in at first: and then turns back to her little ball.
Faciat illud septem diebus, aut circiter, os ipsum enim restauratur.	Let it do this for seven days, or about, for the jaw is restored: for it is not recovered by that time, let it be mended with a needle.
Et si uis, accipe uesicam ouis, et stringe super foramen eius cannulam arundinis, et intromitte uesicam totam in Vuluam eius.	And if you want to, take an awl, and tighten it on the hole of a twig, and insert the whole awl into the woman'
Deinde suffla in cannulam cum uirtute, donec infletur uesica intra Vuluam, fractura enim redit.	Then blow into the twig with force, until it bends the awl inside the woman: for the fracture returns.
Deinde impleatur cum coto, et stet aliquot diebus, secundum quod narrauimus, donec sanetur.	Then fill it with the hand of the obstorger, and let it stand for a few days, according to what we have said, until it is healed.
Et quando frangitur os Pectinis uiri, aut mulieris, tunc administra in restauratione eius, et ipsius aequatione illud quod narrauimus in osse Anchae.	And when the os Pectini [i.e., the pelvis] of a man or woman is broken, then administer to it restoration and that which we have said concerning the os Anchae [i.e., the hip bone].
Et non occultatur rectum in his fracturis propinquis, quae parum contingunt, praecipue cui est quiddam studii, uel usus.	And let not the rectum be hidden in those who are broken close to it, for these are few, especially if there is some study or use.
Et intellige librum meum istum multum, quoniam fractura ipsa significat tibi in pluribus dispositionibus uiam rectam in restauratione sui, et strictura sui: intellige ergo.	And understand my book well, for the fracture itself signifies to you many things concerning the straightening of its own restoration and the narrowing of its own [bone's] self: therefore understand.
In Virga autem uiri quando frangitur, accipe guttur anseris: et intromitte uirgam in ipso.	But when the os Pectinis [i.e., the pelvis] of a man is broken, take the throat of an goose; and insert the penis into it.
Deinde pone super ipsum inuolutionem ex panno, et inuoluatur, et dimittatur tribus diebus, aut circiter eos, et sanabitur, si Deus uoluerit.	Then put a bandage over it, and wrap it up, and leave it for three days or so, and let it heal, if God wills.
¶ De restauratione fracturae ossium, quando est cum uulnere.	As for the restoration of broken bones, when they are with a wound.
Caput XX.	Chapter XX.
Conuenit ei cui accidit fractura cum uulnere, praecipue si est magnum, sicut os coxae, aut adiutorii, aut simile illi, ut properes, et phlebotomes ipsum statim: si attestantur tibi conditiones phlebotomiae, sicut praemisimus.	It belongs to him who has suffered a fracture with a wound, especially if it is large, such as the os coxae or supporting bones, or similar to it, as you see fit, and stop bleeding immediately: if you have evidence of bleeding, as we have said above.
Quod si uulnus effluit sanguinem, tunc oportet, ut properes ad abscisionem eius, ita ut puluerizes super ipsum zegi tritum: si non est tibi praesens aliud.	If the wound spurts blood, then you should cut it off, as you would grind up powder on top of it: if there is not present to you anything else.
Deinde incipe restaurare fracturam in illo eodem die: et non postponas illud, si non accidit apostema.	Then begin to restore the fracture on that very day: and do not put off doing so, unless there is a swelling.
Si uero accidit apostema calidum, tunc dimitte restaurationem eius usque ad diem nonum, donec sedetur apostema.	But if a swelling becomes hot, then dismiss the restoration of it until the ninth day, until the swelling subsides.
Et non appropinques ei in die tertio, et quarto omnino, nam tu faceres ei accidere accidentia mala.	And do not approach it on the third or fourth day at all, for you would bring upon it bad accidents.
Si autem os fractum est eminens super cutem detectum: tunc oportet, ut coneris reducere ipsum, et aequare ipsum manibus tuis cum facilitate et extensione parua.	But if the broken bone is prominent above the skin detected: then you should seek to reduce it and make it level with your own hands with ease and a small extension.
Si autem non praeparatur extensio eius, et ipsius aequatio manibus tuis: tunc reduc ipsum cum isto instrumento.	If, however, the extension is not prepared and his own skin is equal to your hands: then reduce him with this instrument.
Et est instrumentum quod fit ex ferro, cuius longitudo est quantitas septem digitorum, aut octo: et eius latitudo est secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And this instrument is made of iron, whose length is the quantity of seven fingers, or eight; and its width is according to the amount of the wound.
Et propter illud necesse est medico, ut accipiat ex eis tria, aut quatuor secundum quantitatem qua indiget ad illud ex curatione in omni specie fracturae.	And for this it is necessary for the doctor to take three, or four according to the amount that he needs for healing any kind of fracture.
Et sit rotundum: et sit in eo grossitudo parua, ut non duplicetur apud compressionem super ipsum in hora operationis: et sit acutae extremitatis, cui sit margo in extremitatibus suis.	And it should be round: and it should have a small thickness so that it does not double up on itself when pressed against the body during surgery: and its sharp ends should have a margin on their edges.
Et sit superius eius ad grossitudinem ex medietate eius usque ad inferiora.	And let it be above his thickness from one half of it to the bottom.
Et haec est forma eius.	And this is its form.
Oportet in Hac Operatione, ut ponatur extremitas eius acuta curuata super extremitatem ossis eminentis: et impelle ipsum cum eo uice una, donec quando redit os et aequatur quadam aequatione.	It is necessary in this operation, that the sharp end of it be placed on the edge of the prominent bone: and push it with a single force until the bone is reduced and reaches a certain equilibrium.
Conare ergo aequare extremitates fracturae adinuicem.	So consider to equalize the ends of the fracture in opposite directions.
Quod si extremitates eius fracta est subtilis, et non accipit eam instrumentum accaeptione bona, tunc opotet, ut incidas extremitatem illius ossis, donec instrumentum potestatem habeat eius.	If its ends are thin and do not accept the instrument well, then you should strike against one of its ends until the instrument has strength.
Si uero non potes reducere eos cum eo quod narrauimus omnino, tunc incide ipsum cum eo quod conuenit ei ex Incisoriis quae diximus: aut serra ipsum cum una serrarum quocunque modo possibile est tibi.	But if you cannot reduce them with the above mentioned instrument at all, then strike against it with a chisel that we have mentioned: or saw it with one of any kind of saw that is possible for you to get hold of.
Deinde rade illud quod remanet in osse ex asperitate et corticibus minutis.	Then smooth out what remains in the bone from roughness and small bark.
Cum ergo reducitur os, et inuenit infirmus post reductionem eius dolorem uehementem laedentem, tunc scias, quod os non rediit ad locum suum naturalem.	When therefore the bone is reduced and finds a painful, annoying pain after its reduction, then you should know that the bone has not returned to its own place.
Fac ergo illud.	So do this.
Nam tu confers infirmo iuuamentum magnum, cum completur restauratio tua quam facis ossi.	For you will have a great impediment of infirmity, when your restoration is complete that bone which you have healed.
Tunc submerge pannum in uino stiptico, nigro.	Then dip the cloth in black vinegar.
Et proprie si est in aestate.	If it is summer.
Et non ponas super uulnus caerotum, neque aliquid in quo sit oleum: ut non faciat accidere in ipso putredinem et corruptionem.	And do not place the wound on a bone, nor put anything to sit with the oil: so that it does not cause rot and decay in itself.
Deinde administra astellas in hora complementi tui a restauratione ossis.	Then apply the poultice at the time of your meal from the healing of the bone.
Et dimitte uulnus detectum: ita, ut incidas cum forficibus foramen in inuolutionibus secundum quantitatem uulneris.	And remove the wound bandage: so that you will not fall with the forceps into the second hole of the wound according to the quantity of the wound.
Et caue omni cautela, ne stringas uulnus cum fractura.	And take all caution, do not tie the wound when it is broken.
Multotiens enim fecerunt istud stolidi medici: et fecerunt accidere super infirmos suos aut mortem, aut corrosionem, aut zuchem, id est, saniem.	For many times have done this ignorant doctors: and they caused to happen on their sick or death, or corruption, or decay, that is, harm.
Et sit strictura tua mollis, lenis, diuersa stricturae fracturarum reliquarum.	And your bandage be soft, gentle, varied of the bandages of broken bones.
Quod si uulnus est malum, aut est uulnus magnum, et times super ipsum quaedam accidentia mala quae narrauimus, et inuenis dolorem in loco suspensum: tunc non oportet, ut ponas super ipsum astellas.	That if the wound is bad, or is a large wound, and you are waiting for some bad accident that we have described, and hanging pain in the place: then it is not appropriate that you put the poultice on.
Et fac eis inuolutiones ex pannis duris in loco astellarum, et stringe ipsum cum eis.	And make them incisions of dry cloth in the place of the poultice, and tie it up with them.
Cum autem est post diem unum, aut dies duos, et uides uulnus iam incipere, ut in eo generetur pus: tunc aufer desuper ipsum pannum quem posuisti super ipsum cum uino.	When, however, it is after one day, or two days, and you see the wound begin to come into pus, that it generates in it: then take off from above the wound the cloth that you put on with wine.
Deinde administra licinia, et unguenta cum quibus de consuetudine nostra est, ut medicemur uulnera: sicut unguentum tetrapharmacon, et similia illi.	Then apply vinegar, and oils with which we usually treat wounds: such as the four-part oil, and similar to it.
Et conuenit tibi, ut soluas ligamentum.	And it will be good for you, so that you loosen the ligature.
Et considera uulnus in omni die mane et uespere, donec consolidetur, et sanetur.	And consider the wound every day morning and evening, until it has hardened, and healed.
Et oportet, ut praeparetur membrum taliter, ut currat ex eo pus ad inferiora cum facilitate.	And it is necessary that the limb be prepared so, that pus that comes out of it goes down with ease.
Quod si praetereunt uulneri dies multi, et non consolidatur, neque abscinditur pus ab eo: tunc scias, quod illic sunt satagie ossis parua.	That if the days that are passing over wounds, and it does not harden, nor does the pus come out of it: then you know that there are small bones in it.
Quare oportet, ut inquiras uulnus cum tenta.	Why it is necessary to inquire about the fracture with the trial.
Quot uero ex illis alsatagie sunt separata, remoue ea, et extrahe ipsa.	How many of those false joints are separated, remove them, and pull out themselves.
Et quae ex eis sunt non separata, et pungunt membrum, et faciunt accidere dolorem, conare incidere ea, et auferre ea omni modo quo possibile est tibi illud.	And which of those false joints are not separated, and prick the limb, and cause pain to it, seek to injure it, and remove it in any way possible for you that thing.
Quod si accidat uulneri zuchen, aut ekileten, id est, estiomenus, aut species alia corruptionis et putrefactionis: tunc oportet, ut opponas unicuique ex eis cum eo quod conuenit ei ex curatione, cuius praecessit narratio in capitulo suo.	That if it happens to a wound to burst, or to open, that is, to suppurate, or some other species of corruption and putrefaction: then it is necessary that you oppose each of them with what is appropriate to him from the cure, whose preceded description in his own chapter.
Et ex eo in quo oportet ut stet sermo meus, et cui facias praesentem mentem tuam quando frangitur os, et eminet super membrum, sicut os coxae, et adiutorii, et similia eis ex membris magnis, est, ut non praesumas attractionem eius, multotiens enim accidit ex illo mors, imo dimitte ipsum, donec putrefiat.	And from that in which it is necessary that my speech should stand, and to which you make present mind when a bone is broken, and protrudes over the limb, such as the hip bone, and auxiliary, and similar to those of the large limbs, it is, that you do not suspect attraction of it, for many times from that happens death, indeed, leave it until it putrefies.
Fortasse enim cadet per se post uiginti dies, aut triginta.	Perhaps, however, it falls by itself after twenty days, or thirty.
Tunc ergo cura uulnus, si uidetur tibi: et sinon, dimitte ipsum.	Then, therefore, cure the fracture, if it is with you: and otherwise, leave it.
¶ De curatione Nodationis in uestigio fracturae.	On the Cure of Fractures in the Neck.
Caput XXI.	Chapter 21.
Multoties accidit haec Nodatio in uestigio sanationis fracturae.	This Nerve Treatment has often happened in the neck for the cure of a fracture.
Praecipue, quae est prope iuncturas: et foedatur ex ea figura membri.	Especially, that which is near to joints: and it is nourished from that figure of the limb.
Et fortasse prohibet membrum ab operatione sua naturali.	And perhaps it prevents the limb from its natural function.
Considera ergo tunc, si nodatio est recens: administra in ea medicinas quae stipticitatem habent, sicut aloe, et olibanum, et myrrha, et sarcocolla, et acacia, et similia eis.	Consider, therefore, if that nerve is young: administer to it medicines which have a constricting action, such as aloe, and olive oil, and myrrh, and oak bark, and acacia, and similar ones.
Ita, ut accipias ex istis quasdam, aut omnes eas: et confice eas cum uino stiptico, aut cum albumine oui, aut cum aceto: et pone eas super nodationem in stuppa, et stringe eas super ipsam strictura bona.	So, taking some of these certain things, or all of them: and bind them with a bitter wine, or with an egg white, or with vinegar: and place them on the nerve in a poultice, and tightly bind them with a good constriction.
Et dimitte stricturam, nec soluas eam diebus multis.	And free him from prison, and do not separate him from his wife on many days.
Deinde solue eam, et itera aliam, donec remoueatur nodatio.	Then free her, and take another, until the nausea is gone.
Aut stringe super ipsam laminam plumbi decenter.	Or put a lead weight on her chest uneasily.
Plumbo enim est proprietas remouendi omne quod timetur ex membris.	Lead is a property that removes whatever is feared from the body.
Si autem nodatio iam in lapidem conuersa est, et stricta est, et festine prouocat necessitas ad auferendum eam: tunc finde super eam ex superiori parte eius, et incide superfluitatem eminentem: aut rade eam cum quibusdam rasoriis, donec remoueatur: et cura ipsam, donec sanetur.	But if the nausea is already well-established and firm, and urgently needs to be removed: then find on its upper part, and strike with a sharp instrument: or cut it off with something like a razor, until it stops: and take care of her, until she recovers.
¶ De curatione quando restauratur, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, non secundum naturam suam.	The cure, when it is restored, and there remains a member after that in a subtle way, not in accordance with its nature.
Caput XXII.	Chapter XXII.
Quando restauratur fractura ossis, et remanet membrum post illud subtile, debile: tunc non fit illud nisi propter caussas multas.	When the bone fracture is restored, and there remains a member after that in a subtle and weak way: then it is not done except for many reasons.
Quarum una est, multitudo solutionis ligamenti et ligationis eius non secundum quod oportet: aut propter superfluitatem stricturae ligamentorum, donec prohibeatur nutrimentum currere ad membrum: aut propter multitudinem embrocationis superfluae in non sua hora: aut propter paucitatem sanguinis in corpore infirmi, et debilitatem eius.	Of which one is that many solutions of the ligament and its ligation are not done according to what should be: or because of the excess of the tightness of the ligaments, until it is prevented from running into the member: or because of the multitude of emollients in the non-time of their hour: or because of the scarcity of blood in the body, and its weakness.
Et curatio illius est, cibare infirmum, et tenerum facere corpus eius, donec multiplicetur sanguis in eo.	And the cure for it is to feed the sick and make the body relaxed, until the blood increases in it.
Et administra balneum.	And apply the bath.
Et intromitte gaudium et laeticiam super eum.	And introduce joy and happiness to him.
Deinde pone picem super membrum: ut attrahat pix ad ipsum nutrimentum multum.	Then put a piece on the member: to draw the piece towards it so that it receives a lot of food.
Et assiduet embrocationem eius cum aqua tepida, donec currat nutrimentum, et redeat ad figuram suam naturalem.	And apply his emollients to him with warm water, until he runs the food, and returns to his natural shape.
¶ De curatione ossium fractorum quando restaurantur tortuose.	The cure for broken bones when they are restored when they are twisted.
Caput XXIII.	Chapter XXIII.De curando fractis supero, et
Quando accidit membro iam restaurato post sanationem eius tortuositas, et eminentia ossi fracto, aut nodatio: et foedatur per illud forma membri, uerumtamen membrum non prohibetur ab operatione sua naturali: tunc non oportet ut recipias sermonem eius, qui existimat, ut frangatur membrum denuo.	When the cure for a fracture that has been restored after its healing, and the prominence of the broken bone or nausea: and feed it in the form of the member, however, the member is not prevented from its natural function: then you should not listen to what he imagines, that the member should be broken again.
Et iam fuerunt multi stolidorum medicorum et restauratorum, qui fecerunt illud in terra nostra.	There were also many stupid doctors and healers who did this on our land.
Et haec quidem operatio est uituperabilis ualde, perducens ad mortem, uel timorem magnum, ut scilicet sit mortalis.	And indeed this operation is very terrible, leading to death or a great fear, as if it were mortal.
Verum si claudicatio et nodatio sunt recentes: tunc oportet, ut embrocetur cum aqua tepida, in qua decoctae sint herbae mollificantes, sicut folia alteae, et radix eius, et mellilotum, et illis similia.	But if the lameness and numbness are recent: then it should be dressed with warm water in which have been boiled softening herbs, such as the leaves of althaea, and its root, and mallow, and similar things.
Et fiat ei emplastrum cum emplastro mollificatiuo, sicut dyachilon decenter factum.	And let there be made to him a plaster with a softening plaster, like that of dandelion roots ground up in water.
Aut sumatur mucilago radicis alteae, et concutiatur cum adipe gallinae, aut oleo sisamino: et emplastretur cum eo.	Or let the root of althaea be cooked in mucus and stirred with chicken fat or oil of sesame: and let it be applied with it.
Aut sumantur ficus pingues, et terantur cum fimo columbino, et similibus eis quae nominantur ex medicinis diminuentes consolidationem.	Or let fig leaves be taken, and dried with colubrain clay, and similar things that are called by the name of medicines which diminish congestion.
Et quandoque soluitur nodatio cum fricatione assidua, antiqua, et leni, quae fit cum manibus humidis.	And when the numbness has resolved with persistent friction, old, and soft, which is made with wet hands.
Et administretur motus membri ad omnem partem in horis omnibus.	And let movement of the member be administered to all parts at all times.
Si autem tortuositas iam antecessit, et fortis facta est, et conuersa est in lapidem, et prouocata est necessitas ad curatonem eius cum ferro: tunc oportet, ut secetur superius eius, et soluatur continuatio ossis, et incidatur quod superfluit ex nodatione aut osse cum Incisoriis subtilibus: et administretur facilitas in illo cum sollicitudine et studio.	But if the crookedness has already come before, and it is strong, and has gone into a stone, and there is a need to treat it with an iron: then let it be cut off above the bone, and the continuity of the bone be made to heal, and what is superfluous from the numbness or the bone with fine incisions: and let ease be given to it with care and diligence.
¶ De sermone in Dislocatione.	On the subject of dislocation
Caput XXIIII.	Chapter 24.
Dislocatio est exitus alicuius iuncturarum a loco suo.	Dislocation is the departure of someone who is joined from their place.
Quare prohibetur a motu suo, et foedatur figura membri.	Why it is prevented from its own movement, and is supported in its figure.
Et facit accidere super infirmum dolores, et laesiones uehementes.	And does cause to happen on the painful pains, and severe injuries.
Quando ergo accidit alicui dislocatio, tunc oportet festinare ad restaurationem eius: neque tardet eam omnino.	But when it happens that a dislocation has happened to someone, then let him hurry to have it restored: and do not delay it at all.
Nam si tardatur, apostematur locus, et fortasse cum eo reductio dislocationis.	If it should delay, the place should be opened and the dislocation reduced with force.
Propter illud ergo non oportet, ut moueatur, neque extendatur in hora apostemationis eius.	Therefore, so that it may not make a noise, nor should it be extended at the time of opening it.
Quoniam multotiens facit accidere spasmum, et dolores laedentes.	Since it often causes a spasm, and hurts with its pain.
Verum quando accidit illud, tunc oportet, ut properes ad phlebotomiam infirmi.	True, when that happens, then you should, in case of the wound, care to drain off the blood.
Deinde dimittatur, donec quiescat apostema.	Then let it be discharged, until it has rested the opening.
Deinde embrocetur membrum cum aqua calida et oleo.	Then the member should be massaged with warm water and oil.
Deinde reducatur cum facilitate.	Then reduce it with ease.
Et curetur omne membrum cum eo cuius rememoratio ueniet in loco suo.	And care for all members, so that the member may recover to its own place.
Ego quidem iam ordinaui capitula dislocationis, etiam secundum quod praecessit in fractura, a superiori parte corporis usque ad inferiorem eius.	I have already arranged the chapters of dislocation, also according to that which preceded in fracture, from the upper part of the body to the lower part of it.
¶ De cura dislocationis Mandibulae inferioris.	§ Of the care of dislocation of the Mandible inferior.
Caput XXV.	Head
Parum dislocantur duae Mandibulae nisi raro.	The two Mandibles are slightly dislocated unless it is rare.
Et dislocatio ambarum fit secundum unum duoru modorum.	And the dislocation of the jaw is made according to one of two ways.
Aut enim remouentur a locis suis remotione parua, et mollificantur parumper.	Or else they move away from their places with a small removal, and become slightly softer.
Aut dislocantur dislocatione integra, completa, donec mollificentur ad partem pectoris, donec currat saliua infirmi, et non possit tenere eam, neque possit claudere os suum, et inuoluatur lingua eius cum sermone.	Or they are dislocated with a whole, complete dislocation, until they become softer towards the breast, so that a salve drains out, and it cannot hold fast, nor can it shut its mouth, and its tongue is drawn out with a word.
Quando autem dislocatio eius est parua, tunc redit in pluribus dispositionibus per se cum paucitate.	When, however, the dislocation of it is small, then it returns to itself in many positions with a little removal.
Si uero est dislocatio completa, integra: tunc oportet, ut administretur reductio eius uelociter, et non tardetur penitus: et est, ut teneat minister caput infirmi: et intromittat medicus pollicem manus suae unius in radicem Mandibulae dislocationis inter os eius, si dislocatio est a parte una.	If, however, the dislocation is complete and whole: then it should be reduced quickly, and there should not be any delay: and it is, so that it holds fast by means of the cap, at the end of the jaw of dislocation, from the inside, if the dislocation is on one side.
Aut intromittat duos pollices suos simul, si dislocatio est a duabus partibus.	Or insert two fingers together, if the dislocation is from both sides.
Et reliqui digiti manuum eius sint extra, quibus aequet.	And the remaining fingers of his hand are outside, with which he is even.
Et praecipe infirmo, ut mundificet Mandibulas suas, et absoluat eas ad manducandum ad omnem partem.	And say to the sick person that he should clean his jaws and make them healthy so that he can chew on all sides.
Et medicus aequet Mandibulam, et impellat Mandibulam, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And the doctor should even out the jaw, and push it back into place until it returns to its own place.
Quod si difficilis sit reductio eius, praecipue si sunt ambae Mandibulae simul: tunc administra uaporationem cum aqua calida, et oleo, donec fiat facilis reductio ambarum: neque tardes reductionem ambarum omnino, sicut diximus.	If it is difficult to reduce it, especially if both jaws are affected: then administer a vapor with warm water and oil until the reduction becomes easy: and do not delay the reduction of the jaws at all, as we have said.
Cum ergo redeunt et aequantur, et clauditur os infirmi, et non mollificantur: tunc pone super eas puluillos pannorum, cum ceroto quod sit factum ex cera: et oleo rosato.	When they are reduced and evened out, and the mouth is closed, and do not relax: then place over them a few cloth pads, with a piece of wax that has been made from wax: and oil it with rose oil.
Deinde ligetur cum facilitate cum ligamentis mollibus.	Then bind it easily with soft ligaments.
Et sit somnus infirmi super dorsum suum: et caput eius sit stans inter duo puluinaria, ut non moueat ipsum ad dextram et sinistram: neque conetur, uel cogatur masticare aliquid: imo ponatur cibus eius sorbitio lenis, donec quando remouentur dolores, et nodatur Mandibula: tunc comedat quod uult, et administretur illud cum facilitate.	And let the patient lie on his back: and let his head stand between two cloth pads so that he does not move to one side or the other: and do not force him to chew anything: but let him eat what he wants, and administer it to him easily. Let him drink a little warm water, and let him swallow it easily: then let him go to the toilet, and wash his mouth with water.
Non laboret super operationem oris sui apud comestionem et potum, et oscitationem, donec nodetur Mandibula, et sanetur.	He should not be troubled during the operation of his mouth while he eats and drinks, and when he swallows, until his jaw has set and healed.
Quod si difficilis fiat reductio duarum Mandibuiarum, quando dislocantur in hora aliqua, et non conuertuntur ad loca sua: tunc multotiens accidunt inde febres, et soda assidua: et fortasse soluitur uenter infirmi, et fortasse uomit choleram puram.	If it is difficult to reduce the two jaws when they come out of place in an hour, and do not return to their own place: then many times fever and constant bloating will occur: and perhaps the stomach will be loose, and perhaps pure cholera will occur.
Cum ergo uides illud: tunc scias, quia est perditio, et multotiens moritur ille cui accidit illud in decem diebus.	When you see this then you should know that it is a sign of death, and many times that person will die within ten days.
¶ De reducione dislocationis Furculae, et extremitatis humeri.	The reduction of dislocation of the fork (furca) and the extreme of the humerus.
Caput XXVI.	Chapter XXI.
Furcula quidem non dislocatur ex latere intrinseco, propter continuationem suam cum pectore.	The furcula does not dislocate from the side due to the intrinsic continuity with the chest.
Et dislocatur quandoque ad exteriora: et declaratur illud sensui.	And it dislocates sometimes towards the outside: and that is what is sensed.
Et restauratio eius est, ut iaceat infirmus super dorsum suum, et extendat brachia sua.	And its restoration is, so that it lies on its back on the ground, and extends its arms.
Deinde coarta locum cum palma tua coartatione forti, nam ipsa redibit.	Then the cover takes the place with your palm through strong cover, for she will return.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stringe eam.	Then put on her a plaster, and wool, and squeeze it.
Extremitates uero eius quae sequuntur cubitum, et continuantur cum eo, non dislocantur, nisi raro.	The extremities of the one who follows the bed, and continue with it, do not dislocate, except rarely.
Quod si dislocatur die aliquo: tunc oportet, ut reducatur et aequetur secundum quod diximus, et quod praeparatur tibi.	That if it dislocates on a certain day: then it should be reduced and made even as we have said, and that you should be prepared.
Deinde pone super ipsam emplastrum, et puluillos, et stricturam.	Then put on her a plaster, and wool, and tighten it up.
Et praecipe infirmo, adhaerere tranquillitati et quieti, donec sanetur.	And instruct the sick person to remain in a peaceful and calm state until she heals.
Et cum hac eadem curatione reducitur extremitas Humeri, quando separatur etiam a loco suo.	And with this same cure the extremity of the humerus is reduced when it separates from its place as well.
¶ De reductione dislocationis Humeri.	On the reduction of the dislocation of the humerus.
Caput XXVII.	Chapter XXVII.
Scias, quod Humerus non dislocatur, nisi secundum tres modos.	You should know that the humerus does not dislocate, unless through three modes.
Quorum unus est, ut dislocetur ad partem titillici ad inferiora.	One is that it dislocates towards the side tickling towards the lower part.
Secundus est, ut dislocetur ad partem pectoris.	Second is that it dislocates towards the side of the chest.
Et fortasse dislocatur ad superiorem partem Humeri: et illud fit raro.	And perhaps it dislocates towards the upper part of the humerus: and that happens rarely.
Et non dislocatur ad posteriora, propter spatulam.	And does not dislocate towards the back due to the spatula.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora, propter neruos.	And it does not dislocate towards the front due to the nerves.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur et egreditur ad inferiora uersus titillicum: praecipue in illis, quorum carnes sunt paucae.	It certainly often dislocates and exits towards the lower part tickling: especially in those who have little flesh there.
Quoniam egrediur in eis uelociter, et ingreditur uelociter.	Since it exits quickly in them, and enters quickly as well.
In illis autem quorum carnes sunt multae, est econtrario illius, scilicet quia egreditur cum difficultate, et ingreditur cum difficultate.	But in those who have much flesh, the opposite is true: that is to say, since it exits with difficulty, and enters with difficulty as well.
Et fortasse accidit quibusdam hominibus percussio, aut casus, et apostematur Humerus apostemate calido, et putatur propter illud, quia iam dislocatus est.	And perhaps it happened to some men that they were struck, or fell down; and the humerus was dislocated warm, and it is thought because of this, since he has already been dislocated.
Oportet ergo, ut experiaris illud, donec stes super certitudinem eius, et tunc procedas in curatione eius.	It is necessary therefore that you experience that, until you are certain about it, and then proceed to its treatment.
Et cognoscitur dislocatio, quando est ad inferiora uersus titillicum: et distinguas inter Humerum dislocatum, et humerum sanum.	And the dislocation is known when it is directed towards the lower side in relation to the shoulder blade: and distinguish between a dislocated shoulder and a healthy shoulder.
Nam tu inuenis inter eos diuersitatem manifestam, et inuenis in capite Humeri concauitatem, et sub titillico apud tactum caput humeri quasi ipsum sit ouum: et non potest infirmus reducere manum ad aurem suam, neque mouere eam omnibus motibus.	For you will find a great difference between them, and an injury in the head of the humerus, and under the little finger at the touch of the head of the humerus as if it were itself: and it cannot be reduced by the sick hand to its socket, nor can it move in all its movements.
Et similiter, si dislocatur uersus pectus, aut ad sursum: tunc inuenis manifestum tactum, neque occultatur.	And likewise, if it is dislocated towards the chest, or upwards: then there is a clear touch, and it does not hide.
Et huius quidem dislocationis fit facilis reductio, quando est recens, aut infirmus est puer.	And of this kind of dislocation the reduction is easy when he is young, or a sick boy.
Et reductio eius est, ut eleuet minister manum suam ad superiora.	And its reduction is, as he raises his own hand towards the top.
Deinde pone tu pollices tuos sub titillico eius, et eleua iuncturam cum fortitudine ad sursum ad locum suum: et minister eleuet manum suam, et extendat eam ad sursum.	Then put your fingers under its little finger, and raise the joint with force towards the top to its place: and the minister will raise his hand, and extend it upwards.
Deinde ponat eam inferius, ipse enim redit uelociter.	Then let him put it down, for himself he will soon recover.
Si autem non redit per illud quod diximus, et sunt a principio quo accidit dislocatio dies multi: tunc oportet, ut balneetur infirmus in aqua calida, et administretur embrocatio quae mollificat et lenit, sicut si decoquantur radices alteae, et foenugraecum, et mellilotum in aqua, et administretur.	If he does not recover with the above-mentioned thing, and there are many days from when the dislocation happened: then it is necessary that the sick man bath in warm water, and an emollient application is administered which softens and eases, such as if cooked leaves of the plant known as sweet marjoram, and foenugraecum, and melilotum in water, and is applied.
Deinde resupinetur infirmus super dorsum suum: et ponatur sub titillico eius sphera et lana, quae sit aequalis inter lenitatem et stricturam.	Then the sick man will lie on his back: and let a sphere and wool be placed under its little finger, which is equal between softening and tightening.
Deinde ponat medicus calcaneum suum super spheram, et eleuet caput humeri cum uirtute, et attrahat manum infirmi ad inferiora.	Then the doctor will place his heel on the sphere, and raise the head of the humerus with force, and draw the sick man's hand towards him by the lower side.
Et minister alius teneat caput infirmi, ut non moueatur ad inferiora: ipse namque redit statim.	And let another nurse hold the head so that it does not move downward: for himself he will soon return to consciousness.
Et si uis, reduc eum secundum modum hunc: et est, ut facias esse praesentem uirum qui sit longior infirmo, et stet a parte lateris, et intromittat humerum suum sub titillico infirmi: et eleuet titillicum eius ad superiora, donec sit infirmus suspensus in aere.	And if you want to bring him back, do it this way: and he will come to himself as he is longer ill, and stand at the side, and let his shoulder under a towel of the nurse; and lift up the towel on him to the top, until he is sick lying in air.
Et minister alius trahat manum infirmi ad inferiora uentris eius.	And another nurse should take the hand of the patient at the bottom of his leg.
Si autem infirmus est leuis: tunc oportet, ut suspendatur cum eo aliquid aliud, ut grauet ipsum: nam redit dislocatio statim.	But if the sick person is light: then he should be suspended with something else, so that he does not move: for he will return immediately with dislocation.
Et reducitur etiam secundum modum alium: et est, ut figatur in terra lignum longum, cuius caput sit rotundum figura: sicut manica mortarii: quod non sit grossum, neque subtile.	And he is also reduced by another way: and it is that he is fixed on the ground a long wood, whose head is round figure: like a glove of the mortar: which is neither thick nor thin.
Deinde ponatur sub infirmo postquam ponuntur super caput ligni panni lenes: et infirmus sit stans secundum longitudinem ligni.	Then let him be placed under the patient after he is laid on the head of the wood with soft cloth: and let the sick person stand by the length of the wood.
Deinde extendatur manus eius ad inferiora a parte altera, et extendatur corpus eius ab altera parte cum fortitudine: nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then let his hand be extended at the bottom on one side, and let his body be extended from the other side with strength: for the junction returns to its place with speed.
Quod si difficilis sit eius reductio per omnia quae diximus, tunc utere hac cura: et est, ut accipias lignum cuius longitudo sit quantitas duorum brachiorum, et eius latitudo quantitas quatuor digitorum, et grossitudo eius quantitas duorum digitorum: cui sit caput rotundum, ut alleuietur introitus eius in profundum titillici, secundum hanc formam.	That if his reduction is difficult by all that we have said, then use this cure: and it is that you take a piece of wood whose length is the quantity of two arms, and its width is the quantity of four fingers, and its thickness is the quantity of two fingers; and let the head be round, so that it eases his entrance into the deep title, in this form.
Deinde ligentur super caput rotundum panni lenes, ut non laedat lignum infirmum.	Then let them bind on the round head with soft cloth so as not to hurt the wood for the sick person.
Deinde ponatur sub titillico infirmi, ut extendatur manus, aut brachium super lignum usque ad inferiora: et ligetur lignum super adiutorium et brachium et extremitatem manus.	Then let it be placed under the title of the nurse, so that his hand or arm extends on the wood to the bottom: and let the wood be tied over a support and the arm and the end of the hand.
Deinde ponatur brachium super gradum scalae per latitudinem, et extendatur manus ad inferiora, et dimittatur reliquum corpus suspensum a parte altera.	Then let the arm be placed on a step by the width, and let his hand be extended at the bottom, and let the rest of the body be suspended from one side.
Iunctura enim ingreditur statim.	The wound should be closed immediately.
Cum ergo completur introitus eius secundum quemcunque modum possibile est: tunc oportet, ut ponas sub titillico spheram aequalis quantitatis ex lana.	For once the entrance is complete in whatever way possible, then you should place under it a sphere of the same quantity made of wool.
Deinde pone emplastrum praeparatum ex puluere molendini cum olibano, et albumine oui super humerum totum, sicut reuoluitur desuper.	Then place the prepared plaster made of powdery resin with olibanum and albumen all over the shoulder as it turns upside down.
Deinde stringe sub titillico strictura decenti: et reuoluatur ligamentum super emplastrum desuper: et annectatur manus eius ad collum ipsius, et dimittatur, neque moueatur manus eius septem diebus.	Then tie the tourniquet under it as it is lowered: and let the ligaments be attached over the plaster upside down: and let his hands be joined to his neck, and let them remain so for seven days without moving them.
Et oportet, ut ponatur cibus infirmipaucus, donec confortetur membrum: quoniam est uelocius ad sanationem eius.	And it should be placed an impoverished diet for the member to heal: because it heals faster.
Deinde ponatur amplior post septem dies, aut quinque, et ex ercitetur cum motu.	Then after seven or five days let him exercise with movement.
Si ergo firmatur et non mollificatur, tunc iam sanatus est.	If then it remains firm and does not become soft, then it is healed indeed.
Si uero iunctura dislocatur multotiens, propter humiditatem quae accidit ei, aut propter caussam aliam: tunc oportet, ut administretur in ea cauterium cum tribus foraminibus, secundum quod praemissum est in capitulo de cauterio.	If then the wound comes out a lot due to moisture that occurs with it or due to some other cause: then you should administer cauterization to it with three holes, as has been mentioned in the chapter on cauterization.
Quod si fiat hoc totum, et soluatur ligamentum post septem dies, et non confirmetur iunctura, et reducatur emplastrum et strictura super ipsum aliquotiens, et non firmetur, et cadat, et non possit eleuare ipsum ad superiora: tunc scias, quod nerui eius qui sunt ad caput humeri, iam incisi sunt, aut extensi, aut mollificati: et scias, quod iunctura nunquam figetur in loco suo.	If all this is done, and the ligament is not firm after seven days, and the plaster and tourniquet are not secure on it, and it does not stand up by itself, and cannot raise its arm above its head: then you should know that the nerves serving the shoulder are either cut, or stretched, or softened: and you should know that the wound never heals in its place.
Dislocationis autem quae fit uersus pectus et mammillam, aut ad posteriora reductio, fit cum impulsione et extensione cum manibus: donec redeat, et administretur in ea reliqua strictura et cura, donec sanetur.	But the dislocation that occurs toward the chest and the nipple, or toward the back, occurs with a push and an extension with the arms: until it stops, and cauterization is administered to it with remaining ligaments and care, until it heals.
Quod si accidat post sanationem grauitas in membro, et tarditas in motu eius, tunc utatur infirmus balneo multotiens, donec leniatur illa grauitas, et redeat ad naturam eius primam.	If something like this happens after healing, and a lag in movement occurs in the member, then let the invalid take frequent baths until that weight is softened, and return to its natural state first.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.	On the treatment of dislocations of the cubitus.
Caput XXVIII.	De curatione dislocationis Cubiti.
Scias, quod iunctura Cubiti dislocatur cum difficultate, et similiter redit cum difficultate etiam: et ipsa quidem dislocatur ad omnes partes, et praecipue ad anteriorem, aut ad posteriorem.	You should know that the dislocated cubitus joint moves with difficulty and returns to its position with difficulty as well; it dislocates particularly in the forward and backward directions.
Et eius dislocatio non occultatur tibi: quoniam est cadens sub uisu, et sub tactu, secundum quamcunque figuram dislocetur.	And its dislocation is not hidden from you; for it falls by sight, and by touch, and dislocates in whatever form.
Et quando coniungis cubitum dislocatum cum sano, declaratur tibi illud manifeste.	And when you join a dislocated cubitus with a healthy one, that will be apparent to you.
Concauatur enim iunctura, et non potest duplicare brachium, neque tangere cum eo humerum suum.	For the joint is stiffened, and it cannot bend the arm, nor can it touch its shoulder.
Et oportet, ut properes, et reducas dislocationem statim, antequam accidat ei apostema calidum.	And you should know that you should immediately reduce a dislocation before it becomes cold.
Nam si accidit ei apostema calidum, difficilis fit eius reductio: et fortasse non sanatur omnino, praecipue quando est ad posteriora.	For if the dislocation has become cold, its reduction is difficult; and it may not recover at all, especially when it is towards the back.
Est enim deterior omnibus speciebus dislocationis, et uehementioris doloris eis: et multotiens descendit cum ea mors.	It is worse in every form of dislocation, and more painful; and often dies with it.
Et restauratio eius quando est ex eis quae possibile est reducere, est, ut extendatur manus eius cum duabus manibus: et brachium eius sit expansum, et manus medici sint supra cubitum et sub eo, et ipse impellat iuncturam cum pollicibus manuum suarum simul, aut cum radice palmae suae, donec redeat ad locum suum.	And its restoration is such that it extends its hand with two hands; and the arm is spread out, and the thumb of each hand pushes against the cubitus joint from below, or from the base of the palm, until it returns to its place.
Aut uero dislocatio est ad anteriora: tunc redit ita, ut duplicet manum cum manu sua, donec percutiat cum radice palmae suae cubitum qui est dislocatus.	Or the dislocation is towards the front; then it returns in such a way that it doubles its hand with its own hand, until it hits against the base of its palm the dislocated cubitus joint.
Quod si non obedit dislocatio ad reductionem, tunc administra extensionem uehementem, fortem ualde: et est, ut extendant brachium duo ministri: et teneant ipsum duo ministri etiam, ut non remoueatur apud extensionem.	If the dislocation does not submit to reduction, then you should administer a severe and vigorous extension; and it is as if two ministers extend an arm: and they hold him back from moving during extension.
Deinde reuoluatur brachium ad omnem partem postquam inuoluitur super manum eius pannus duplicatus longus, aut ligamentum latum.	Then the arm turns in all directions after it has been wrapped with a long double cloth, or a broad ligament.
Et quando tangit medicus manu sua iuncturam, inungat ipsam cum oleo: ut sit illud ex eis quae adiuuant in lubricitate iuncturae cum facilitate.	And when the doctor touches the joint with his hand, he should rub it with oil so that it moves with ease in the lubrication of the joint.
Deinde impellat iuncturam impulsione uehementi, donec redeat.	Then, with a sharp push, pull the wound open until it is re-opened.
Et post reductionem eius oportet, ut ponatur super ipsam emplastrum, in quo sit stipticitas, et exiccatio cum albugine oui: et stringatur strictura decenti.	And after reducing [the wound], let it be placed on top of it a plaster, in which is sitting the stitch, and drying with alba [white substance]; and let it be tied with stricture going down.
Et suspendatur brachium a collo infirmi: et dimitte diebus aliquot.	And let the arm be suspended from the neck by the nurse: and let it be left for a few days.
Deinde soluatur.	Then, let it be unbound.
Si ergo firmatur iunctura in loco suo, tunc solue ligamentum ab ea, et dimitte ipsam.	If then the wound is firmly held in place, then dissolve the ligaments from her, and let her go.
Et si uides iuncturam non bene stringi, tunc itera emplastrum, et ligamentum, et dimitte ipsam diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	And if you see that the wound is not well tied up, then repeat the plaster, and the ligament, and let her go for a few days, until it is tied up.
Deinde solue ipsam.	Then, unbind her.
Si autem accidit ei grauitas post reductionem iuncturae, et dispositio sit in motu: tunc administra humectationem in balneatione, et fricationem subtilem, et compressionem, donec liniatur, aut pone super iuncturam iliati, id est, natem arietis pinguem.	If then there happens to her any weight after reducing the wound, and she is in motion: then administer humidification in a bath, and a subtle friction, and a compression, until it is healed up, or put on top of the wound an ointment, that is, natem arietis pinguem.
Deinde ligetur, et dimitte ipsam super eam die et nocte.	Then let it be tied up, and let her go on top of it for a day and night.
Deinde aufer eam, et intromitte ipsum in balneum.	Then take away from her, and introduce into the bath.
Cum ergo sudat, tunc frica iuncturam fricatione temperata.	When then she sweats, then bind up the wound with a moderate friction.
Deinde itera super ipsam aleliati uice una, et secunda, et tertia cum introitu balnei, donec leniatur.	Then repeat on top of her one time, and twice, and third time with the entrance into the bath, until she becomes relaxed.
Et si uis, pone super ipsam stercus uaccinum, humidum, calefactum cum butyro, et stringe super ipsum.	And if there is a wound, put on top of her manure that is wet, heated with butter, and tie over the wound.
Fac illud aliquotiens.	Perform this several times.
Ipsa namque lenitur, et redit ad dispositionem suam.	She is then healed, and returns to her own disposition.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Almahassem.	The cure for the dislocation of Al-Mahasım.
Caput XXIX.	Chapter XXVII.
Mahassem manus multotiens dislocatur, id est, iunctura quae est inter brachium et manum.	The dislocation of Mahasım causes great pain, that is, the wound between the arm and the hand.
Et reductio dislocationis eius est facilis.	And reducing the dislocation of him is easy.
Econtrario reliquarum iuncturarum.	Opposite to the joints are ligatured.
Verumtamen oportet, ut uelocitas sit in reductione dislocationis eius in hora in qua dislocatur, antequam apostemetur locus: aut accidat in eo apostema calidum.	However, it is necessary that the speed be in the reduction of dislocation at the time when it dislocates, before the apotome is measured: or happen in him an apothem hot.
Et reductio dislocationis in eo est, ut ponas Mahassem manus infirmae super tabulam, et extendat minister manum eius: et ponat medicus palmam suam super eminentiam iuncturae, et impellat eam, donec redeat.	And the reduction of dislocation is that you put the Mahassem hand of the weak on a table and extends it minister his hand: and puts the doctor his palm on the eminence of the joint, and pushes it, until it returns.
Verumtamen oportet, ut consyderetur, si palma iam recessit ad uentrem manus: tunc ponat infirmus dorsum manus suae super tabulam apud extensionem et reductionem: et si dislocatio est procedens ad dorsum manus, tunc sit positio manus eius intrinsece super tabulam, id est, interior pars manus eius super tabulam ponatur, ut cadat manus medici super ipsam eminentiam iuncturae.	However, it is necessary that you consider if the palm has already gone to the belly of the hand: then put the injured back of his hand on a table during extension and reduction: and if dislocation is going to the back of the hand, then the position of the hand should be intrusively on the table, that is, the inner part of the hand should be placed on the table, so that the doctor's palm rests on it on the eminence of the joint.
Si ergo redit statim, bonum est: et si non, tunc stringe eam cum emplastro sedante apostema: et dimitte ipsum, neque iteres illud.	If he returns immediately, then it is good: and if not, then bind it with an plaster while the apothem stands: and let go of him, and do not return to it.
Nam si non tolerat, neque potes super reductionem eius, postquam praetereunt ei dies, uerumtamen iunctura remanet secundum tortuositatem suam: et non nocet infirmo aliquid, nisi quod mollificatur manus, et non potest stringere aliquid: tunc scias, quod nerui sunt abscissi, aut attriti.	For if he does not bear it, and you cannot reduce it after the days have passed, then the joint remains according to its tortuosity: and does not hurt the weak one anything, unless the hand is softened, and cannot grip anything: then you should know that nerves are cut off, or rubbed.
Non est ergo ingenium in ea, nisi ut stringatur cum cauterio prope casum eius.	There is no skill in it, except to bind it with a plaster close to the risk of it.
Et fortasse non confert illud aliquid.	And perhaps does not bring anything.
Cum ergo non redit Almahassem, tunc pone super ipsum emplastrum, quod narrauimus.	So if Mahassem does not return, then put on him the plaster which we described.
Deinde stringatur, et dimittatur quinque diebus: postea soluatur et dimittatur, et exercitetur manus.	Then it is bound, and let go after five days: then it is unbound and let go, and exercises the hand.
Si autem priuatur motus eius, et accidat in ea aliquid grauitatis: tunc leni eam cum aqua calefacta, et fricatione aliquotiens, donec leniatur.	But if his movement is prevented, and happens to him something of gravity: then make it soft with warm water, and sometimes with friction, until it softens.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Digitorum.	On the treatment of dislocations of the fingers.
Caput XXX.	Chapter 30.
Quando dislocatur ex eis Digitus ad omnem partem, uel ex eis Digitus ad dorsum palmae, aut uentrem eius: tunc extende Digitum, et impelle dislocationem pollicibus tuis, donec redeat.	When one of the fingers is dislocated all the way, or one of them to the back of the palm, or it is inside: then extend that finger and push the dislocation with your thumb until it comes back.
Deinde sustenta caput Digiti, et suspende ipsum uersus partem ad quam dislocatur, et dimitte ipsum duobus diebus.	Then support the end of the finger, and suspend it toward the side where it is dislocated, and let it be for two days.
Deinde suspende eum, et extende ipsum, donec aequetur rectus in illo die suo.	Then suspend it, and extend it, until it gets straight again on its own day.
Cum ergo fuerit nox, liga ipsum secundum narrationem ipsam: et non cesses soluere ipsum in die: et exerce eum cum motu: et liga ipsum in nocte.	When it is night, bind it according to that story: and do not cease to make it well on the day: and exercise it with movement: and bind it at night.
Fac illud diebus aliquot, donec stringatur.	Make it for a few days, until it gets well.
Et similiter fac cum eo, si dislocatur ad uentrem manus: et liga eum ad partem ipsam, et fac cum eo operationem tuam primam, donec sanetur.	And do the same with it if it is dislocated toward the bottom of the hand: and bind it to the side, and do your work with it, until it heals.
Et similiter fac cum eo quando dislocatur ad reliquas partes.	And do the same with it when it is dislocated to the other parts.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Spondilium dorsi.	On the treatment of dislocations of the spine of the dorsal side.
Caput XXXI.	Chapter 31.
Quando accidit alicui Spondilium dorsi, aut colli dislocatio completa, aut remouentur Spondiles multae a locis suis: tunc non est in ea curatio, quoniam mors properat infirmo.	When this happens to anyone of the spine, or many of the vertebrae are removed from their places: then there is no cure for it, because death approaches quickly.
Et signum illius est, quod egestio infirmi egreditur absque uoluntate, neque potest tenere eam: et multotiens mollificantur ex eo quaedam membra eius, aut duo crura eius, aut duo brachia ipsius, aut unum eorum: aut remouetur Spondilis una de loco suo.	And a sign of that is, that he leaves the toilet with a will, and cannot hold himself: and often they become weak from him, or two limbs, or two arms, or one of them: or one of his spine is removed from its place.
Multotiens enim remouetur, quod multotiens fit remotio earum ad quatuor partes.	For many times it is dislocated, since the removal of them to the four sides happens often times.
Illa ergo quae remouetur ad posteriora, nominatur Gibbositas.	That which is dislocated to the back is called a hunchback.
Curatio uero eius est, ut consyderes tunc, si Gibbositas accidit a puericia: tunc non est in ea curatio, neque ex ea est sanatio omnino.	But the cure for it is this, that you should consider then, if a hunchback happens to be from childhood: then there is no cure for it, and there is no healing from it at all.
In illa autem quae accidit a casu, aut percussione, aut similibus illis, iam dixerunt antiqui modos curationis sermone prolixo.	In those cases that occur by accident, or by percussion, or similar things, the ancient authorities have already set forth in a lengthy discourse the ways of treating them.
Cuius plurimum non redit cum proficuo.	This does not return with profit.
Ego uero iam abbreuiaui ex illo, cuius parum excusat a multo eius ex propinquitate mea ad intentionem: et expositione mea qua exposui illud, et formaui instrumentum eius diuerso modo ab eo quo ostenderunt illud, et exposuerunt ipsum.	I have indeed already abbreviated it from that, which little excuses its length by reason of its nearness to my purpose: and in my exposition of it as I did exhibit it, and fashioned the instrument after their manner, showing it, and exhibiting it itself.
Dico ergo, quod in gibbositate quae accidit ab anteriori parte, non est ingenium, neque sanatio ex ea.	I say, therefore, that in the case of a deformity occurring in the anterior part, there is neither art nor cure from it.
Et similiter in illa quae fit ad duo latera etiam.	And likewise in that which is made on both sides.
Et non curatur ex eis, nisi illa quae accidit in dorso proprie, cum eo quod ego narro: et est, ut extendatur infirmus super faciem suam super podium aequale prope parietem: et expandatur sub eo stramentum humidum, ut non laedatur pectus eius.	And do not cure them unless that which happens in the back proper, with what I tell you: and is, so that it extends itself on the face of a sick person on an equal platform close to the wall: and spreads itself under it a damp cloth, that it may not harm his chest.
Deinde ponatur lignum rectum fixum in fouea in terra, in extremitate podii, circiter caput eius: et lignum aliud circiter pedes eius in extremitate altera podii: et minister teneat lignum, et sit non firmatum in fouea.	Then place a straight piece of wood firmly fixed in the earth at the end of the foot, about the head thereof: and another piece of wood about the feet on the other side of the foot: and let the servant hold the piece of wood, and set it not firm in the earth.
Et minister alter teneat alterum.	Then let another servant hold the other.
Deinde inuolue super caput infirmi, et sub titillicis eius ligamentum lene, firmum: et extende extremitatem ligamenti ad lignum quod est apud caput eius: et liga ipsum in eo.	Then let the nurse bend over his head, and with a soft bandage hold fast to the part below his chin, making it firm: and let her extend the end of the bandage towards the piece of wood which is by his head: and bind it there.
Deinde stringe ligamentum aliud supra anchas eius, et supra genua ipsius, et apud cauillas eius.	Then let another bandage be stretched above his shoulders, and above his knees, and at the small of his back.
Deinde aggrega ligamenta omnia, et liga ea in ligno altero quod est apud pedes eius.	Then gather all the bandages together, and bind them to the other piece of wood which is by his feet.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem ligni ligamentum, et non remoueantur duo ligna ex locis suis in quibus sunt fixa: uerumtamen non sint firmata, sicut diximus.	Then let all the servants extend to the piece of wood the bandages, and let them not move two pieces of wood from their places in which they are fixed: however, let them not be firm, as we have said.
Et medicus ponat palmas suas super Spondilem cum fortitudine, donec redeat: aut ponat super eam tabulam.	And the physician should set his hand upon the spine with strength, until he has taken it off; or upon a board.
Deinde annectat super tabulam pedes suos, donec redeat.	Then he should attach his feet to the board with strength, until he has taken them off.
Si autem non redit per hanc curationem, tunc accipe tabulam cuius longitudo sit circiter tria brachia.	But if he does not recover by this treatment, then take a board whose length is about three arms.
Et caua in pariete de quo diximus quod est prope infirmum, locum in quem ingrediatur extremitas tabulae.	And make a cut in the wall which we have mentioned, that is near to the sick man, a place in which to insert the end of the board.
Deinde pone medium tabulae super Spondilem.	Then place the middle of the board upon the spine.
Et ponat pedes suos medicus super extremitatem alteram.	And let the physician set his feet on the other end of the board.
Et stringat bene, donec coartetur Spondilis, et redeat ad locum suum.	And fasten it securely, until the spine is straining, and return to its place.
Deinde si uis, operare cum torno quod inuoluitur cum manu tua: et est, ut figas in terram apud caput infirmi in postremo podii duo ligna, quorum longitudo sit brachii unius: et apud caput eius in postremo podii duo ligna.	Then if you wish, operate with a saw which is turned with your hand: and it is like this, that you should fix two pieces of wood on the ground at the head of the back which are the length of an arm: and at the head of the two pieces of wood.
Et sit longitudo quae est inter omne lignum palmus unus: et iam factum est in omni loco foramen, in quo currit tornum: et firmetur lignum omne in terra multum, ne moueatur omnino.	And make the length which is between all the wood a palm: and there has already been made in every place an opening, in which the saw runs: and it is made fast all the wood to the ground very firmly, so that it does not move at all.
Et intromittatur lignum rotundum: et est tornum in quo reuoluitur ligamentum in duobus foraminibus duorum lignorum.	And introduce the round wood: and there is a saw which turns about in two openings of the two pieces of wood.
Et in extremitate eius est foramen, in quo firmatur lignum, cuius longitudo est palmus cum eo quod reuoluitur: et in duobus lignis aliis est similiter illius.	And at its end there is an opening, in which the wood is fixed, the length of which is a palm with that by which it turns: and there is also similar opening in the other two pieces of wood.
Deinde stringe ligamenta quae strinxisti in pectore infirmi torno quod est apud caput eius: et ligamenta quae strinxisti in cruribus eius in torno quod est apud pedes eius.	Then tighten the ligaments which you have tightened in the spine of the saw which is at its head: and the ligaments which you have tightened in his legs in the saw which is at his feet.
Deinde stet apud omne tornum minister, qui torqueat manum suam cum licinio, cum quo reuoluitur tornum: et medicus aequet Spondilem, secundum quod diximus.	Then stand by every saw which makes it turn with his hand by means of a lever, with which it turns: and the physician should adjust the spine, according to what we have said.
Haec est forma torni, quae sequitur.	This is the form of a tourniquet, which follows.
Deinde postquam redit Spondilis, et aequatur locus, tunc oportet, ut ponas emplastrum exiccatiuum cum albumine oui.	Then, after the spondylius has returned and the place has been made even, then you should put on an dried plaster with albumen.
Deinde stuppam.	Then the stump.
Postea pone supra emplastrum astellam ex tabula, cuius latitudo sit trium digitorum, aut circiter eos.	Then place above the plaster a plate of wood, whose width is three fingers wide, or about that.
Et longitudo eius quantitas quae capiat locum Gibbositatis, et super partem Spondilis sanae.	And its length so much as it takes up space for the gibbosity, and on the healthy side of the spondylius.
Deinde ligetur cum ligamento quod diximus.	Then tie with a bandage which we have said.
Et utatur infirmus nutrimento subtili, donec sanetur.	And use the sick one with delicate nutrition until it heals.
Quod si remaneat quiddam eminentiae in loco in fine sanationis: tunc oportet, ut administrentur medicinae quae mollificant, et leniunt, cum administratione tabulae quam narrauimus tempore longo.	That if anything remains of a prominence in the place at the end of the healing: then it is necessary that the medicines which soften and loosen be given, with the giving of the plate which we described at a long time.
Et iam administratur in illo lamina plumbi.	And now is given in that plate of lead.
Et quandoque accidit eminentia in postremo Spondilium dorsi: et putatur per eam dislocatio, et est illud os quod iam eminet.	And when it happens that a prominence occurs at the rear of the spondylius of the back: and it is believed by means of that dislocation, and it is the opening which has already been made.
Quare non oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei cum hac medicina: fortasse enim accidere faciet mortem.	Why it should not be assumed that it will do so with this medicine: perhaps however that will happen death.
¶ De curatione Anchae dislocatae.	On the treatment of dislocated anchae.
Caput XXXII.	Chapter 32.
Scias, quod iuncturae Anchae, et iuncturae humeri, non accidit, nisi dislocatio tantum: neque accidit eis quod accidit reliquis iuncturis ex remotione parua, et concauitate.	You should know that the dislocation of an anchae, and of a shoulder, does not occur unless there is only a little dislocation: and does not occur to them what occurs to the other joints from slight distance and pressure.
Et iunctura quidem Anchae dislocatur secundum quatuor partes.	And the joint of an anchae dislocates according to four parts.
Quod est, quia dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	Because it dislocates towards the front, and towards the back.
Et plurimum quidem dislocatur ad interiora: et parum dislocatur ad anteriora, et ad posteriora.	And most often it dislocates towards the inside: and a little towards the front, and towards the back.
Et curatio dislocationis eius ad interiora, est: quia quando tu coniungis crus infirmi sanum cum infirmo, est longius: et est genu eius eminens plus quam sani, et non potest infirmus duplicare pedem suum apud inguen: et est locus qui sequitur inguen apostematus apostemate calido, propterea, quod caput coxae iam peruenit illic.	And the treatment of its dislocation to the inside is: because when you join the thigh of a healthy nurse with an unhealthy one, it is longer: and is the knee of the sick more prominent than that of a healthy one, so that the sick man cannot double his foot behind him: and there is a place which follows the buttocks, so that the head of the hip has already reached that place.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad exteriora est, quod sunt accidentia eius contraria istis accidentibus.	And his sign where dislocation has occurred is external, which are his opposite conditions to these conditions.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad anteriora, est, quia expandit crus sanum secundum complementum: uerumtamen non duplicat ipsum absque dolore qui est in genu: et si conatur ad ambulandum, non potest super illud ad anteriora: et retinetur urina eius, et apostematur inguen eius, et apud ambulationem est calcatio eius super calcaneum.	And the sign of him where dislocation has occurred to the front, because it widens the healthy leg according to the complement: however, it does not duplicate the same without pain that is in the knee: and if he tries to walk, he cannot overcome it to the front: and he holds back his urine, and he wipes himself with his heel, and during walking he steps on his heel.
Et signum eius cui accidit dislocatio ad posteriora est, ut non expandat genu, neque possit duplicare ipsum antequam duplicet inguen: et est crus eius etiam breuius altero: et inguen est mollificatum, et est caput coxae apud locum ilii.	And the sign of him where dislocation has occurred to the back, that he does not widen his leg, and cannot duplicate the same until he doubles his knee: and it is shorter the other leg; and the knee is softened, and the head of the femur is at the place of it.
Reductio uero huius dislocationis specierum est, ut consyderes tunc, si dislocatio est uetusta, quae iam antiquatur cum habente ipsam.	The reduction of this dislocation of the eyes is that you consider then, if the dislocation has been fresh, which has now healed with the one who has it.
Deinde si tu administres reductionem eius, et remanet secundum dispositionem suam: tunc non est in ea curatio omnino.	Then if you administer the reduction of it, and remains according to its disposition: then is not in it at all cure.
Non ergo oportet, ut praesumptio fiat ei penitus.	Therefore it should not be assumed that he is perfect.
In illo autem cuius dislocatio est recens, et est ex una specierum quatuor dislocationis: tunc propera ad hoc, ut uoluas iuncturam, et extendas ipsam ad interiora et ad exteriora, et moueas eam dextra et sinistra: fortasse enim redit, et non indiget alia cura.	But in that one whose dislocation is recent, and is out of the four species of dislocation: then approach to this, so that you move the joint, and extend it inwardly and outwardly, and move it with the right and left hand: for perhaps it will recover, and does not need any other cure.
Si autem non redit hoc modo, tunc oportet, ut praepares ministrum fortem, et extendat crus eius ab inferiori parte: aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento, quod ligetur super crus eius supra genu: et minister alius extendat manum eius desuper, ita ut intromittat manus suas sub titillicis eius.	But if this way does not recover, then you should prepare a strong instrument, and extend the leg of him from the lower part: or with his hands, or with a ligature that is tied over the leg above the knee: and another instrument extends his hand from above: so that he inserts his hands under the skin.
Deinde stringat cum ligamento leni super radicem coxae, et teneat extremitatem ligamenti alterius.	Then bind with a soft ligament over the root of the pelvis, and hold the end of the other ligament.
Et sit extensio eius aut ab anteriori parte inguinis ad partem furculae, aut a posteriori ad partem dorsi.	And let his extension be from the front part of the groin to the thigh, or from the back to the spine.
Et sit extensio eorum omnium uice una, donec eleuetur infirmus cum corpore suo a terra, et remaneat pendens.	And let their whole extension be one way, until he who is ill with his body is lifted up from the earth and remains suspended.
Et haec enim species extensionis est species communis specierum quatuor.	For this is the type of extension, which is a common species of the four species.
Si ergo redit dislocatio cum eo quod diximus, est bonum: et si non, tunc necesse est omni speciei illud quod dicam de curatione propria.	If therefore the dislocation returns with him which I have spoken of, it is good; and if not, then it is necessary that every species of what I say about the cure of itself.
In reductione quidem eius propria quando dislocatio est ad interiora, oportet, ut resupinetur infirmus super latus suum sanum.	In reduction however, when his own dislocation is towards the inside, it is necessary that the sick man should lie down on his healthy side.
Deinde ponat ligamentum super radicem coxae, in eo quod est inter caput coxae, et locum qui est sub inguine.	Then let him put a bandage over the root of the hip, in that which is between the head of the hip and the place which is under the groin.
Deinde extende ligamentum ad sursum a parte inguinis ad altiorem partem corporis, ad partem furculae.	Then extend the ligature from the side of the groin to the higher part of the body, to the side of the fork.
Deinde accipiat minister alius fortis brachia eius, et minuat locum grossum coxae infirmae, et extendat ad exteriora extensione uehementi.	Then another strong servant should take his arm, and he should reduce the large place of the ill hip, and extend it towards the outside with a swift extension.
Iam enim redit ad locum suum.	For it has already returned to its place.
Et haec species est facilioris reliquis speciebus curationis, qua reducitur hoc membrum.	And this species is easier than the other species of cure, so that this limb is reduced.
Si autem excusatur super te, et non obedit tibi ad introitum cum hac specie curationis omnino: tunc oportet, ut ligentur duo pedes infirmi simul cum ligamento forti, leni, super duos calcaneos, et super duo genua: et sit longitudo cuiusque a compare suo quantitatis quatuor digitorum: et sit crus infirmum extensum plus altero quantitate duorum digitorum.	If however he excuses himself from you, and does not obey you at all with this species of cure: then it is necessary that two nurses should bind the feet together with a strong ligature, soft, over the two heels, and over the two knees: and let the length of each from its comparison be four fingers' quantity: and let the length of the sick man's leg be increased by two quantities of two fingers.
Deinde suspendatur infirmus super caput ligni, quod sit in domo: et sit longitudo eius a terra quantitas duorum brachiorum.	Then let the sick man be suspended over the head of the ligature, so that he is in the house: and let his length from the earth be a quantity of two arms' length.
Deinde praecipe iuueni forti, ut muniat caput coxae: et suspendatur cum infirmo inuenis alius: et impellat iuuenis alius, muniens coxam cum fortitudine, nam iunctura redit ad locum suum cum uelocitate.	Then command a strong man to strike the head of the hip: and let another be suspended with the sick man: and let another push the hip with strength, for the extension returns to its place with velocity.
In reditione autem eius propria, quando est dislocatio ad exteriora, oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super podium, secundum quod narrauimus in habente gibbositatem.	In reduction therefore of his own, when there is a dislocation to the outside, it should be so that the sick person lies on his back, according as we said in having gibbosity.
Et stringatur ligamentum super crus eius, infirmum proprie, et super pectus eius.	And let the ligaments be tied over the cross of his own body, the sick one, and over his chest.
Deinde ponantur duo ligna, unum apud pedes eius, et alterum apud caput ipsius.	Then two beams are to be placed, one at the feet of him, and another at the head of him.
Deinde ponatur lignum additum in medio podii, fixum bene: super quod inuoluti sint panni humidi, ut non laedat infirmum: et sit lignum inter coxas eius, ut non attrahatur ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then a beam is to be placed in the middle of the foot, well fixed: over which wet cloths are to be spread so as not to hurt the sick one; and let the beam be placed between his thighs, so that it does not draw towards the lower parts by the extension.
Deinde extendat omnis minister ad partem suam, et medicus aequet reductionem manu sua.	Then all the ministers are to extend on their side, and the doctor is to make the reduction with his own hand.
Si ergo obedit ad reuersionem, erit bonum.	If therefore he obeys to the reduction, it will be good.
Et si non, pone super ipsam tabulam, et preme ipsam, sicut diximus in gibbositate, aequaliter.	And if not, let him be placed on that board, and pressed as we said in the case of gibbosity, equally.
Verumtamen oportet, ut iaceat infirmus super latus suum sanum.	However, it is necessary that the sick one should lie on his sound side.
Et quando dislocatio est ad anteriora, tunc oportet, ut extendatur crus infirmi uelociter: et est secundum hanc eandem narrationem super podium: et ponat medicus palmam manus suae dextrae super inguen infirmum.	And when the dislocation is to the front, then it should be so that the thigh of the sick one is quickly extended; and this is according to our above description on lying on the back; and the doctor places his right hand palm on the knee of the sick one.
Deinde coartet ipsum cum manu altera, et cum illa coartatione pone ipsum extensum ad inferiora ad partem genu.	Then he is to be pulled by the hand with the other, and with that pulling place him extended towards the lower parts on the side of the leg.
Et si dislocatio est ad posteriora: tunc non oportet, ut extendatur infirmus ad inferiora, et sit eleuatus super terram: imo oportet, ut sit positus super rem duram, sicut oportet, ut fit etiam si dislocatur ancha eius ad exteriora, secundum illud quod diximus de accubitu eius super duas anchas: et est super faciem eius, et ligamenta extensa: secundum quod diximus nuper.	And if the dislocation is to the rear: then it should not be so that the sick one is extended towards the lower parts, and is raised up on the ground; but rather let him be placed on a hard thing, as we said also in case of his lying on two broad things; and let him be on his face, and the ligaments extended: according to what we have just said.
Et oportet, ut administretur compressio cum tabula etiam super locum ad quem egreditur iunctura, cum completur reductio secundum quod oportet.	And let there be applied pressure with the board also on the place to which the joint is dislocated, when the reduction is completed according as it should be.
Et signum reditionis eius non occultatur tibi: et est, ut extendas duo crura infirmi: et quando uides ea aequalia, et infirmus stringit crus suum, et expandit ipsum absque excusatione: tunc scias, quia iam redit membrum, secundum quod oportet: tunc coniunge duas coxas, et pone emplastrum, et stringe cum imemati, id est, rota: ita, ut non moueatur ancha ad aliquam partium: et adhaereat infirmus quieti tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	And the sign of his recovery shall not be hidden from you: and it is so, that you spread out two legs of the sick: and when you see them equal, and the sick one straightens his leg, and stretches himself without excuse: then you know that now the limb has returned, according to what is due: then you join the two hips together, and put on a splint, and fasten it with ties, that is, with a belt: so that he does not move widely in any part: and let the sick one rest for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ligamentum, et emplastrum, et compara crus cum altero: tunc si uides ea aequalia in statu, tunc scias, quod dislocatio iam firmata est: absolue ergo infirmum ad ambulandum.	Then you shall loosen the ligaments, and the splint, and bring the leg together with the other: then if you see them equal in position, then know that the dislocation is now fixed: so let go of the sick one to walk.
Et si uides aliquid mollificationis: tunc redi, et emplastra illud, et stringe illud secundum stricturam tuam primam: et dimitte illud etiam tribus diebus.	And if you see any softening: then go back, and put on the splint, and tighten it according to your first direction: and let go of him also for three days.
Deinde solue illud et fac ipsum tardare in ambulatione super utrumque aliquot diebus, donec confortetur bene.	Then you shall loosen it and let him walk a little on each side for a few days, until he is comforted well.
¶ De dislocationis Genu.	The Dislocation of the Knee.
Caput XXXIII.	CHAPTER XIII.
Genu dislocatur secundum tres modos.	THE KNEE IS DISLOCATED IN THREE WAYS.
Dislocatur ad exteriora, ad interiora, et ad inferiora, scilicet ad posteriora.	IS DISLOCATES TO THE OUTSIDE, TO THE INSIDE, AND TO THE BOTTOM, THAT IS TO SAY TO THE BACK.
Et non dislocatur ad anteriora.	AND IT DOES NOT DISLOCATE TO THE FRONT.
Et signum dislocationis eius, est, ut praecipias infirmo, ut applicet crus suum ad coxam suam.	And the sign of his dislocation is, that you command the sick one to apply his leg to his hip.
Si autem non adhaeret cum coxa: tunc scias, quod Genu est dislocatum.	But if he does not attach himself to the hip: then know that the knee is dislocated.
Et restauratio omnium modorum dislocationis eius est, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum, ita ut iam extendat crus suum si potest super illud, et adhaeret dorsum tuum ad faciem eius: et pone pedem eius inter pedes tuos.	AND THE RESTORATION OF ALL KINDS OF DISLOCATION IS THIS, THAT YOU LET THE SICK ONE SIT UPRIGHT, SO THAT HE EXTENDS HIS LEG IF HE CAN OVER IT, AND ADHERE TO YOUR BACK FACING FORWARD: and put his foot between your feet.
Deinde adhaerere fac Genu eius cum palmis tuis, et recta eas inter digitos tuos super Genu eius.	Then you shall attach the knee of him with your palms, and make them straight between your fingers over his knee.
Deinde applica cum palma tua duo latera Genu eius cum fortitudine.	Then apply with your palm two sides of his genitals with strength.
Et minister alius extendat pedem eius, donec redeat Genu ad locum suum.	And another minister extends his foot, until he returns to his place.
Et signum reditionis est, ut adhaereat crus cum coxa in lenitate, non laboriose.	And the sign of the return is that which adheres the thigh to the hip in gentleness, not laboriously.
Deinde emplastra ipsum, et adhaerere fac crus cum coxa.	Then apply plaster upon him, and let the thigh adhere to the hip.
Deinde liga ea simul cum uitta tribus diebus, aut quatuor.	Then bind them together with bandages for three days, or four.
Deinde solue ea.	Then dissolve them.
Et non utatur infirmus ambulatione aliquot diebus, donec sanetur.	And the sick person should not walk, but he will be healed in a few days.
Si autem recusatur tibi reductio eius, tunc administra extensionem fortem cum ligamentis, quorum praecessit narratio in curatione anchae, donec redeat.	But if his return is not satisfactory to you, then apply an extension with strong ligatures, of which the account of the cure of ankylosis was given, until he returns.
¶ De curatione dislocationis Calcanei.	The Cure of Dislocation of the Calcaneus.
Caput XXXIIII.	Chapter XXXIV.
Calcaneus quandoque remouetur remotione parua, et quandoque dislocatur secundum complementum.	The Calcaneus is sometimes moved with a small movement, and sometimes dislocated according to the complement.
Et dislocatio eius fit, aut ad interiora, aut ad exteriora.	And the dislocation of it is made either towards the inside or towards the outside.
Et signum dislocationis eius est, quod uides Calcaneum inflatum, procedentem ad partem ad quam dislocatur.	And the sign of the dislocation of it is that you see the Calcaneus swollen, proceeding to the part to which it is dislocated.
Curatio autem remotionis eius, est facilis reditionis: et est, ut extendatur cum facilitate cum manibus, et aequetur, donec redeat.	But the cure of the dislocation is easy; and it is that, when extended with ease with the hands, and made to return, until it returns.
In curatione autem eius quando dislocatur secundum complementum, oportet, ut facias sedere infirmum rectum: et teneat ipsum minister fortis ualde a posteriori parte dorsi eius, in medio ipsius.	In the cure of it when it is dislocated according to the complement, you should make the sick person sit upright; and hold him firmly from behind by a strong minister at the middle part of his back,
Deinde tene tu cum manu tua dextra pedem eius a superiori parte eius, et cum manu tua sinistra ab inferiori parte pedis eius loco cauillae.	Then hold with your right hand with your palm his foot from the upper part of it, and with your left hand from the lower part of the foot near the heel.
Deinde trahe pedem ad tecum manu tua dextra.	Then draw the foot towards you with your right hand.
Deinde cum sinistra duabus uicibus.	Then with the two fingers of your left hand.
Deinde extende cum sinistra, et impelle pectus pedis cum dextra uersus crus absque labore.	Then extend with the left, and push the chest of the foot towards the hip with the right without labor.
Fac illud bis, sicut narrauimus.	Make it twice as strong, as we have described.
Deinde impelle pectus pedis ad crus in uice tertia, et tu trahis cauillam.	Then push the chest of the foot to the ankle in a third degree, and you should tear the tendon.
Si ergo redit in uice una, aut in duabus secundum hunc modum, et uides pedem aequatum, est bonum: et si non, tunc itera operationem super ipsum: quoniam ipse redit.	But if he returns in a first degree or in a second according to this mode and you see the foot even, it is good; and if not, then repeat the operation on himself because he will return again.
Si autem prohibetur tibi reductio eius cum eo quod narrauimus: tunc fac iacere infirmum super dorsum suum super terram, et fige paxillum in terra firmatum ualde, ut cadat inter coxas eius: et tu iam inuoluisti super ipsum pannum, ut non laedat infirmum.	But if you are forbidden to reduce him with it that we have spoken of then: then let him lie on his back on the ground and fix a board firmly on the ground so that he falls between his thighs: but you have already wrapped up the wound with a cloth in order not to hurt the patient.
Deinde accipiat minister coxam eius: postea extendat minister alter pedem, aut cum manibus suis, aut cum ligamento quod liget super collum pedis.	Then let the servant take the leg of the patient: then let the other serve extend the foot or with his hands or with a cord that binds above the ankle of the foot.
Deinde extendat omnis minister contra extensionem comparis sui: et paxillus sit stans inter duas coxas infirmi retinens eum, ut non attrahatur corpus eius ad inferiora apud extensionem.	Then let all the servants stand opposed to the extension of their patient and let one nurse stand between the two thighs holding it back so that the body does not attract towards the lower parts at the extension.
Deinde aequet medicus dislocationem manibus suis, et minister alter teneat crus sanum ad inferiora.	Then let the doctor adjust the dislocation with his hands and let the other servant hold the sound leg from below.
Nam dislocatio redit cum uelocitate.	For the dislocation returns with velocity.
Quando ergo redit dislocatio, et declaratur tibi sanitas reditionis eius: tunc pone emplastrum et stuppam, et stringe ipsam cum ligamentis firmiter, et liga pedem cum ligamento ad crus.	But when the dislocation returns and you declare to him that the return of it is healthy then put a plaster and a support, and tighten it with strings firmly, and tie the foot with a cord to the leg.
Et oportet, ut caueas uel timeas de neruis, qui sunt supra calcaneum posterius, ut non sit ligamentum super eos uehemens, et laedat eos.	And it is necessary so that you should not be afraid or worry about the nerves that are above the heel in the back because they do not have a binding cord over them and hurt them.
Deinde dimitte ipsum duobus diebus, aut tribus.	Then let him go for two days or three.
Quod si mollificatur ligamentum, stringe ipsum: deinde solue ipsum in die tertio, aut quarto: et prohibe infirmum ab ambulatione quadraginta diebus.	But if the ligament becomes softer then tighten it on him: but let him go free after three days or four and forbid the patient from walking for forty days.
Si uero conatur ambulare ante illud spacium, non fit securitas quin dissoluatur super ipsum dislocatio, et corrumpatur, et non recipiat post illud curationem.	But if he tries to walk before that space, there is no security except that the dislocation should be dissolved on him and the corruption should take place and not receive after that cure.
Quod si accidat ei apostema calidum: tunc oportet, ut administres in sedatione eius illud, in quo praecessit narratio nostra in alio loco ex curatione, et embrocationem, donec remoueatur.	If it should happen that he has a hot apoplexy: then you should give him sedatives, as we have narrated in another place from the cure, and an emetic, until it is removed.
¶ De dislocatione Digitorum pedis, et cura.	Regarding dislocation of the toes of the foot and treatment.
Caput XXXV.	Chapter XXXV.
Oportet, ut aequetur quod dislocatur ex eis cum extensione pauca absque labore: et illud quidem non est difficile, imo est facile.	It is necessary that it should be adjusted which is out of place with a little extension without work: and this is not difficult, indeed, it is easy.
Si autem dislocatio est in quibusdam nodis dorsi pedis: tunc oportet, ut faciat sedere infirmus pedem suum super locum aequalem terrae, aut super tabulam: et est stans sicut ambulans.	If however the dislocation is in some of the knuckles of the back of the foot: then you should make the invalid put his foot on an equal place of the ground, or on a board: and it stands as if it were walking.
Deinde tu sta, et pone pedem tuum super illud quod eminet ex illis iuncturis.	Then you stand, and put your foot on that which protrudes from the joints.
Deinde calca illud cum pede tuo cum uirtute, donec redeat, et uideas ipsum iam aequatum, et non appareat in loco eminentia.	Then trample on it with your foot with force, until it returns, and does not appear to be in a raised position in place.
Deinde pone sub uentre pedis eius tabulam quae capiat pedem totum, cui sint duo capita.	Then put under the instep of his foot a board which takes the entire foot, which has two heads.
Deinde stringe ipsum strictura decenti tribus diebus.	Then tighten him with a strap for three days.
Deinde solue ipsum, et fac quiescere eum ab ambulatione diebus multis, donec stringatur et securetur a reductione.	Then solve him, and let him rest from walking for many days, until it is tightened and secured by reduction.
¶ De speciebus dislocationis cum uulnere uel fractura.	Regarding the types of dislocation with a sprain or fracture.
Caput XXXVI.	Chapter XXXVI.
Quando accidit aliquid ex illo, et conaris curationem eius, et ipsius restaurationem, multotiens succedit mors: et propter illud non oportet, ut praesumat super curationem eius, quod est huiusmodi, nisi qui est prudens in arte longi usus, misericors, pius, tardus, non audax, neque praesumptuosus: et ut utatur in incaeptionce medicinis quae sedant apostemata calida tantum: et dimittat infirmum diuino iudicio.	When this happens to him, and he is inclined to cure himself and restore himself, often death succeeds: and therefore it is not necessary that you should be hasty in the cure of him, which is of this kind, unless he is prudent in the art of the long use, merciful, compassionate, slow, not daring, and not presumptuous: and that he uses medicine which sedates the hot apostemata only: and leaves the invalid to divine judgment.
Nisi uideas, aut speras salutem a perditione cum lenitate aegritudinis, et in quo apparet quiddam spei.	Unless you have hope or expect salvation from destruction with kindness of disease, and in which there seems to be some hope.
Conare ergo reductionem eius statim in principio rei, antequam accidat apostema calidum.	Let us then immediately reduce him at the start of the thing, before the apoplexy of heat occurs.
Si ergo redit membrum, secundum quod uolumus, tunc administra regimen quod sedat apostema: et cura uulnus cum eo quod conuenit ei ex unguentis desiccatiuis.	But if the limb returns, as we have said, then administer the remedy that quiets the apoplexy: and take care of the bruise with it as it suits him from the dried ointment.
Quod si dislocatio est cum fractura, et accidunt in osse satagiae separatae, tunc conare ablationem earum, et fac in illo quod diximus in aegritudinibus simplicibus ex eo quod praecessit in locis earum.	If the dislocation is with a fracture and they occur in separated bones of the jaw, then let us immediately remove them, and make a hole in that place as we have said for simple illnesses because it preceded in those places.
Et caue secundum tuam uirtutem, et custodi teipsum ab introitu in uiam timoris: secundum quod praecessit praedicatio mea tibi.	And let your care be according to your virtue, and keep yourself from the entrance into a state of fear: because my prophecy has preceded you.
Nam illud est melius tibi apud Creatorem tuum, et magis permanens ad gloriam tuam, et magis saluum tuo corpori apud illos in tuo tempore.	For that is better for you with your Creator, and more lasting to your glory, and healthier to your body with them at that time.
