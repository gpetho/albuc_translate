Chapter sixty-nine on castration.
Castration is forbidden in our religion, and therefore I should not have mentioned it in this book, but I have mentioned it for two reasons: one is that it should be in the physician's knowledge if he is asked about it, and that he should know the treatment of whoever is afflicted by it.
And the other reason is that we often need to castrate some animals for our benefit, such as lambs, goats, cats, and the like.
So I say that castration is of two types, either by crushing or by incision and cutting.
The one that is done by crushing, the way to do it is that we sit the animal in hot water until its testicles relax, soften and hang down, then you crush them with your hand until they dissolve and are not discernible to the touch.
As for castration by incision and cutting, it is necessary that you hold the animal and squeeze the skin of its testicles with the left hand, then tie the spermatic cords and make one incision on each testicle so that when the two testicles emerge, you cut them after skinning them and leave nothing of the membranes on them except the thin membrane that is on the vessels.
And this type of castration is better than the one that is by crushing because crushing may leave something of the testicles, so the animal desires intercourse.
Then treat the wound until it heals.
