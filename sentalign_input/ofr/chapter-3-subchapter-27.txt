of the dislocation of the elbow
Know that the joint of the elbow is dislocated with difficulty, and with difficulty returns;
and it is dislocated in all directions, and especially forward and backward, and the dislocation is not hidden, for it is clearly seen and felt;
and dislocates according to each position.
And when you compare the injured elbow with the healthy one, you can see it clearly.
For the joint is separated, and he cannot bend his arm or touch his shoulder at all.
And you must reduce it before a hot abscess develops there, because if a hot abscess were to develop, it would be difficult to reduce;
and perhaps it cannot be completely reduced, especially when it is at the back;
it is worse than other dislocations, and more painful, and sometimes death results.
And the restoration, if it is such that it can be reduced, is that you extend his hand with your two hands;
and his arm should be spread, and the physician's hands placed along the side, above and below, and push the joint with his thumbs together, or at the base of his palm, until it returns to its place.
And if the dislocation is at the front, it is reduced when he bends his hand with his hand, and strikes with the base of the palm the side that is dislocated.
And if it does not want to return to its place, then apply strong extension;
and two assistants should extend the arm, and two assistants should hold him, so that he does not move during the extension;
then turn the arm in each direction, after you have wrapped it with a double-layered cloth, long and wide;
and when the physician has joined the joint with his hand, he should anoint it with some oil to soften the joint, then push the joint firmly, until it returns;
and when it is in place, apply a dry plaster with some egg white, and bind it firmly, and suspend the arm from the patient's neck, and leave it for some days, then untie it. 
And if the joint is firm in its place, untie the bandage and leave it;
and if you see that the joint is not tight, reapply the plaster and the bandage, and leave it thus for some days, until it is firmly set;
then untie it.
And if he feels severe pain after the reduction of the joint, and it moves, bathe and rub it gently, and apply pressure until it is relieved; 
or you put on the joint a greasy sheep's bladder, then leave it for a day and a night, then remove it, and have him enter the bath;
and when he sweats, rub the joint temperately, then put the bladder back on, and then enter the bath;
and do this two or three times, until he is healed;
and if you wish, put on warm, moist cow dung with butter, and bind it on;
it will return to its proper position.
