 CHAPTER FOURTEEN.
On the treatment of entropion of the lower lid.
 This inversion in the lower lid is that which is truly called entropion; and it is either congenital or acquired.
It is acquired by injury or incision or cautery or something like that.
This is the method of operating for it: you take a needle through which has been passed a double thread and you run it into the flesh, making it penetrate from the left angle of the eye to the right angle so that the thread is fixed in flesh both ends.
Then with the needle stretch the flesh upwards and make an incision with a broad scalpel; and if the eyelid returns to its proper shape, well and good.
But if not, take a probe and put it on the site of the incision and with it turn back the lid.
Then make two incisions on the inner side of the lid; the two incisions should begin from the angles of the incision already made and run together making an angle so that when they join they are like this.
It is the Greek letter lambda.
You remove that flesh in proportion as the angled side is lower than that adjoining the lid; then bring the divided parts together with two sutures made with a woollen thread.
Then treat with the relaxing medicaments and dressings we have mentioned, till healed.
But if the inversion is acquired, from incision, suture, or cautery, you should make a simple incision below the eyelashes, as has been described, then bring apart the two edges with a packing, as we have said.
The sum of what there is to say about the treatment of inversion, whether it is in the upper or the lower lid, is that you should make your procedure follow the actual lines of the inversion itself ; for this is of varying shape.
The experienced practitioner will make use of his skill in any way he can to re-establish the natural form or approximate to it.
The disease itself will generally indicate to you the appropriate operation and instruments.
