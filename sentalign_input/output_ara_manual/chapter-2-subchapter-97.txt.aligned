On Applying Leeches	On the application of leeches.	0.7850629
Leeches are only used in most cases on organs where cupping glasses cannot be placed, either because of their small size, such as the lip and gums and the like, or because the organ is devoid of flesh, such as the finger, nose and the like.	Leeches are mostly used on those parts of the body to which application of cupping-vessels is impossible, either because of their smallness, such as the lips, the gums, and so on; or because the part is bare of flesh, like the finger, the nose, and so on.	0.89721805
The way to use them is to select leeches that are in fresh, pure water free from impurities, then leave them for a day and a night in fresh water until they are hungry and there is nothing left in their bellies. Then the body is first evacuated by phlebotomy or cupping, then the diseased organ is wiped.	This is the way to use them: you seek some leeches that are in fresh water free of dirt. Then you leave them in fresh water for a day and a night until they are hungry and nothing is left in their bellies; then you purge the patient's body, either by venesection or by the application of cupping vessels; then you scrub the afflicted part until it is flushed; and then place the leeches on it.	0.7847759
Until it reddens, then it is placed on it, and when it is full it falls off.  If it is possible to suck the area with a cupping glass, it is more effective in benefit, otherwise, wash the area with vinegar, then with plenty of water, and massage it and squeeze it.  If the flow of blood continues after the leech falls off and it is oozing, then soak a linen cloth in cold water.	When they are full they will fall off. If it is possible to make suction with a cupping vessel, the effect will be greater. But if not, wash the part with vinegar followed by much water; then rub and put pressure on it. If the blood continues to run after the leeches have fallen off, and becomes an ooze, let linen dressings be wetted with cold water and apply them over the place until the oozing stops.	0.88634926
And place it on top until the oozing stops. If the bleeding is profuse, sprinkle on it powdered vitriol or gallnut or similar astringents until the bleeding stops, or place peeled halves of fava beans on the area.	But if the bleeding be serious then sprinkle upon the place powdered vitriol or gall or similar styptics, until the haemorrhage is stopped.	0.73274934
And leave it until the fava beans stick to the area, then the bleeding will stop. And if there is a need to reapply leeches, do not reapply those leeches if others are available. If the leeches refuse to attach, then wipe the area with fresh blood.	Or let split shelled beans be applied to the place and left until they stick there, and then the bleeding will stop. If it is necessary to repeat the application, the same leech should not be applied but another one if you possibly can.	0.7663395
Or prick the area with a needle until some blood comes out, then place them; for when they sense some blood they will stick to the spot. When you want them to fall off, sprinkle on them some aloe, salt, or ash, and they will immediately fall off.	If the leeches fail to stick on, the place should be wiped over with fresh blood or pricked with a needle to bring out a little blood; then apply them, for if they smell any blood they will immediately adhere. When you wish to remove them, sprinkle over them a little powdered aloes or salt or ashes, then they will at once fall away.	0.8104831
